    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=204.308s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=205.248s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=207.309s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=208.65s">And</a>  I join Councilor Scarpelli in offering my condolences to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=212.935s">Mr.</a>  Garrity was a great person, Lawrence State's resident, known by friends and family alike as Bayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=220.238s">And</a>  I think Councilor Scott Nelly hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=223.439s">Although</a>  he's left us here, he's going to leave a legacy behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=227.701s">If</a>  it weren't for the Garrity family, I don't think the city would have been in a good position to create the Office of Outreach and Prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=235.384s">But</a>  they came up with this council and they advocated for this story out there, and they helped fight the addiction stigma. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=241.821s">and</a>  it was because of their work that Wisconsin has been able to move forward this season, fighting the epidemic and I just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's indulgences and also my gratitude for their services.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=665.692s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=666.272s">Thanks,</a>  Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=668.994s">Yeah,</a>  so basically, we received back comments from the Community Development Board on change A. They did suggest a substantive change, which is to, we had recommended that the, or we had initiated a proposal where the council would be the special permit granting authority for a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=688.516s">motor</a>  vehicle related uses and miscellaneous commercial uses, specifically in C1, C2 and I districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=694.759s">This</a>  is designed to prevent the further proliferation of motor vehicle repair shops and car yards in Mystic Ave area and other commercial areas of the city where we're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=709.356s">other</a>  more significant uses than storage or repair of vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=714.678s">So</a>  I'll come back to that one, because the CD board recommendation is a significant change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=721.6s">The</a>  second change is B, that's on page three. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=725.781s">The</a>  recodification, that language that we passed had an unintended consequence of making a lot of properties nonconforming, where you have a single parcel with multiple principal structures on the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=737.485s">The</a>  CD board, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=739.619s">did</a>  suggest a language change just to specify the districts where that issue is occurring, SF1, SF2, and GR zoning, but otherwise they accepted the proposed change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=752.093s">The</a>  third change is adding a second associate member to the Board of Appeals and clarifying term length. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=759.459s">We</a>  passed a zoning change in early 2022 that did this, but then we actually overruled it with the recodification. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=766.464s">So</a>  this is correcting us back to the language that we had passed for members appointments to the Board of Appeals and having a second associate member. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=776.872s">There</a>  were a number of unintended referrals for papers to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=781.385s">This</a>  is now the fourth one, number D. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=785.857s">of</a>  lack of clear language. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=787.178s">Basically</a>  a lot of these are we've had this new zoning recodification in place for now a little bit over a year, and the bodies that are going through it, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board are saying, here are some of the technical things that we think need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=799.986s">But</a>  essentially, we're referring papers to the Community Development Board that never needed to go to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=804.328s">So</a>  there's a small technical change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=806.089s">The</a>  CDB did not change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=807.49s">Community</a>  Development Board recommendations don't change what we had proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=812.833s">The</a>  fifth one is number E, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=816.36s">There</a>  was conflict between who is the special permit granting authority, and the Community Development Board recommended specific language to accomplish that objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=829.548s">Number</a>  six, F, the language that we passed in 2022 created an extra requirement for a special permit for inclusionary housing that's not necessary, and the Community Development Board accepted the language changes that we proposed for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=846.59s">G,</a>  the state agency that oversees housing changed its name this year from the Department of Housing and Community Development to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=858.295s">Our</a>  proposed change just updates all of those references in the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=862.216s">I</a>  think the CD board may have found one or two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=868.42s">They</a>  slightly changed the language, just to make it more clear, but basically the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=873.542s">And</a>  then a number of definitions were deleted from the zoning when we recodified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=879.144s">Several</a>  pages, I think it's pages 10 through, yeah, the whole rest of it, I think, 10 through 21, and the CD board, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=891.095s">agreed</a>  with all the ones that we included, and also found a couple other definitions that had been omitted from the recodification to include. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=897.299s">So</a>  essentially, that's the summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=901.002s">If</a>  we were to sever, I would recommend severing change A from changes B through G, or sorry, B through H.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1048.02s">I</a>  would like to ask that Director Hunt and Planner Evans just <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1053.883s">question</a>  about the first change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1055.685s">Change</a>  A to the use table around motor vehicle related uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1062.372s">It</a>  seems to me that that's the major substance of change in here from the Community Development Board recommendations, which is we had proposed that the council be <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1074.6s">the</a>  Special Permit Granting Authority for a number of these uses, and the Community Development Board has recommended that they be the Special Permit Granting Authority instead, and I was just wondering if you guys could speak to the Community Development Board's reasoning or rationale behind that recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1098.587s">Madam</a>  President, so in a big picture way, it is actually fairly unusual in communities to have the city council and elected body be deciding on individual businesses because it really leaves it open to a lot of politics and taking politics more into account rather than looking at the general <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1123.833s">and</a>  what's the good fit here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1126.974s">It</a>  is our understanding that the rationale behind the original proposed changes is because we as a city envision a different situation going on in Mr. Gap, and we don't want to allow a number of uses as of right where we are getting ready to do a more <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1150.154s">Our</a>  recommendation of having the planning board do it is putting it in the hands of people who are planners, either by education or by interest, their work, and to have them sort of make a decision around whether or not a particular business should get a special permit rather than making it a political thing that could be the subject of political <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1173.095s">it's</a>  not a use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1174.196s">It's</a>  a special permit, but basically <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1202.622s">but</a>  you can do it if you come in and ask for a special permit and they're completely discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1207.845s">You</a>  don't have to say yes to any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1211.287s">So</a>  it's not like when you're doing a variance, you have like certain tests that you have to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1215.669s">The</a>  special permit test is like, does it fit with the character of the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1219.411s">Does</a>  it fit with what the city wants to see there? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1221.993s">Does</a>  the city want this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1223.394s">I</a>  don't know if you wanna clarify any of that at all.</p>

    <p>[Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1229.357s">Yeah,</a>  in addition, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1231.658s">As</a>  a staff to the city board, we went through all of the uses and kind of compared it to the comprehensive plan and the zoning districts that would be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1243.203s">And</a>  the city board agreed with the recommendations to add some additional uses to require special permits, particularly like self storage warehouses, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1262.455s">some</a>  other like lower, not the highest and best uses for properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1268.278s">We</a>  get a lot of calls and emails from permit expeditors who are looking to relocate some of these uses that are now getting pushed out of Cambridge, getting pushed out of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1278.104s">And</a>  so they wanna come here and it's not the best uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1282.507s">So</a>  some locations it might be fine, but switching it to a special permit so we could <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1289.943s">you</a>  know, drill down and actually look at a site specifically, will it work at this site? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1296.211s">That's</a>  why we added some additional ones in addition to the motor vehicle.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1302.539s">Is</a>  that a further question on that?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1304.722s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1306.744s">Thanks</a>  for that, because I didn't quite notice that, but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1309.662s">I'm</a>  guessing that's in the J, wholesale transportation, industrial uses, and then it looks like open storage under accessory uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1316.765s">What</a>  was the rationale between, for going to the zoning board for some of them and the city board for others?</p>

    <p>[Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1325.61s">So</a>  looking at, so the use category J, the board of appeals was already the designated special permit granting authority for many of those uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1335.675s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1336.155s">So</a>  to be consistent, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1338.951s">switch</a>  some of the Ys to BA so that they would be in charge of at least that use category so it would make a little bit more sense.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.113s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1353.754s">Yeah,</a>  I think in general, the intent here was not to allow these kind of uses by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1359.054s">I</a>  like that you at the CD board came back and kind of noted some other specific uses that I think fall into a similar category as what we were looking at with the motor vehicle issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1371.332s">in</a>  general, I'd actually, I mean, Councilor Caraviello proposed this, so I'd like to hear from him what he thinks about it being us versus the Community Development Board.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1378.536s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1383.098s">And</a>  it was done for purposely what you just said about people being pushed out of these other communities, and they're getting better value out of their land, and they're coming over here and taking our good property, and we're getting the short end of the stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1397.927s">It</a>  was the intent of this, so I'll take whatever recommendations the board made, but that was my intent when I brought it forward to stop that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1410.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1410.934s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Knight on Zoom and then Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1415.717s">I'll</a>  defer comment at this time, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1419.779s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1420.62s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1422.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1423.891s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for walking us through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1428.156s">As</a>  was just stated, I think that the primary goal of putting these changes forward was to remove some of these uses by right because we want to mitigate how much they're encroaching on our <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1438.228s">valuable</a>  land in this area that we could put to many other uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1442.211s">And</a>  it seems like with these recommendations on the slight amendments that the city board sent back, there's kind of a secondary goal of making it more consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1449.317s">Who</a>  is reviewing the special permit applications when they do come in aligning that with the right board to be reviewing it and making sure that the same board is reviewing for the same types of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1459.805s">So</a>  I think that that is really aligned with what we're trying to do with the zoning ordinance in general, making things both blend with our use goals and also just keeping things more consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1468.59s">user-friendly</a>  inside and outside of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1471.051s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1481.074s">I</a>  just wanted to thank the City Board for getting back to us and for being proactive in suggesting changes and in reviewing the language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1491.977s">I</a>  think that, you know, these, the technical aspects, the technical changes are, I think it's hard to argue against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1501.442s">The</a>  substantive changes are, I think, are really helpful for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1504.344s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello really has explained well over the last few weeks and months why we need something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1512.429s">I</a>  think this brings us in alignment, in closer alignment with our comprehensive plan, and so, and in preparation of round two of rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1521.066s">I</a>  just wanted to express my thanks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1524.988s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1525.628s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1528.729s">And</a>  likewise, I think I appreciate the work of the CD board, our PDS, of the Councilors who did a lot of the best majority of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1536.432s">I</a>  think just understanding, as Councilor Scarpelli will always point out, as Councilor Caraviello, we are absolutely looking at the bigger picture at that next round of zoning, and we're hopefully we'll get out the RFP once more so that we can begin that work being started by <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1548.272s">some</a>  land use experts and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1550.213s">So,</a>  but I appreciate the work being done in the interim to make sure we're addressing some unintended consequences and some things we want to make better for our community as these are living documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1559.117s">So,</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1560.238s">Do</a>  I have a motion?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2176.939s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.2s">I</a>  put this paper on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2178.94s">There's</a>  also a paper on under public participation, which is the next item we're taking up, but maybe we could jointly have the conversation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2186.862s">I</a>  don't know if Elliot wants to come up in a minute, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2190.543s">Just</a>  one of the reasons I put this on is that this was something that's been a priority for me since even before I was elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2197.915s">Short</a>  term rentals, you know, certainly have a <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2201.864s">limited</a>  place, I think, in the housing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2204.967s">But</a>  what we're seeing is a proliferation of a lot of our housing stock being taken up by short-term rentals and being turned into profit centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2214.094s">And</a>  we passed a zoning ordinance last year that put significant restrictions on short-term rentals, required registration, required them to pay a registration fee, and also limited their use, where if there is not an owner-occupant in the unit, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2231.52s">And,</a>  you know, if there's an owner occupant renting out rooms, that's one thing, but if there's just a housing unit that's being taken off the long-term rental market and being used for short-term rentals, particularly where you basically have small hotels operating in our neighborhoods, unregulated, we ban that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2249.05s">However,</a>  Airbnb and Vrbo have not stopped listing properties that are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2255.287s">We</a>  have had residents like Mr. Jockelson and others who have been reporting, you've probably seen them on various social media sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2261.29s">I</a>  think there was someone who had a hot tub in a tent in their backyard that they were putting down as a short term rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2268.434s">And</a>  that got immediately, you know, code enforcement went out they said that's, you can't do that and it wasn't allowed but <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2275.698s">the</a>  limited code enforcement resources we have in the city really mean that it's on the residents to report these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2283.869s">And</a>  even when they do report them, it takes some time to get some enforcement out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2287.674s">I</a>  really think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2289.622s">be</a>  more proactive, I think we'd find a lot of rental units coming back onto the market that are currently being used as profit centers in this way, and that would help with our housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2298.45s">So,</a>  the two things I'm asking for are that there be more resources and requirements provided to code enforcement so that they can do their job more effectively, but also I do know that thanks to to to Mr. Jopelson and others that <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2313.163s">have</a>  informed me that other cities have had created direct liaison relationships with the major short term rental sites, which have allowed the city to report issues directly to them and have listings removed so that they can't be rented. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2325.132s">So</a>  I think both of those solutions need to be explored quickly and implemented so that our zoning ordinance is being followed by these folks who are breaking the law right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2339.844s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2342.598s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2343.919s">This</a>  is a good ordinance that's been put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2347.12s">I</a>  think they're being proliferated in all the neighborhoods, not just up in the Tufts University, where that's probably the greatest extent of them, but I have one on my own street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2356.524s">I</a>  see people just coming down, walking down the street with suitcases. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2359.945s">They're</a>  all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2360.566s">They're</a>  up in the Heights there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2361.886s">They're</a>  proliferated everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2362.967s">All</a>  you gotta do is just go on their page and you'd be surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2366.653s">how</a>  many people are doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2368.113s">I</a>  think Boston, I think today, this week, just passed something where they have to be owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2374.335s">Am</a>  I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2375.295s">I</a>  think I saw that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2376.715s">I</a>  saw they passed something.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2377.775s">Yeah,</a>  Boston did pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2379.536s">So</a>  I would hope we could pass something similar and maybe tighten up our rules to stop this.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2385.057s">Yeah,</a>  we do have, it does say that if you're renting out, our current ordinance says if you're renting out individual rooms, the owner has to be present.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2392.178s">And</a>  if you're not, you can only do it a maximum of 90 days a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.438s">It's</a>  pretty strict. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2396.998s">We</a>  went pretty strict on the first pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2398.659s">I</a>  don't mind going and taking another look, but the most important thing is that the strict ordinance we have now be enforced.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2403.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2405.56s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2406.801s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Bears for putting this on the City Council agenda, to thank Mr. Jockelson for submitting that public participation form with a bunch of research and details about why this is a pressing and urgent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2425.132s">I</a>  think that this is the ordinance that we passed on short-term rentals is one of the most meaningful things that this council has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2432.515s">It's</a>  something that I think many people here had a personal involvement in, particularly Councilor Bears in crafting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2439.098s">And</a>  it is something that I think we really should be enforcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2441.839s">And</a>  I think there's things that have been coming across our desks as a city council in the last few weeks that have really emphasized the need for our city to invest in enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2454.924s">Because</a>  we have good laws in place, we need to make sure that they're carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2461.23s">I</a>  think it's really important to note the distortionary effect that short-term rentals has on housing affordability and rents, both in terms of property values and in terms of rental prices in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2474.303s">The</a>  National Bureau of Economic Research has been pretty unequivocal in <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2479.649s">in</a>  what it's saying in the economic analyses with how this hurts regular working folks like residents of Medford, like people who are renting in our community, and people who want to buy property in our community, who want to stay in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2496.089s">And</a>  so I think it's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2497.45s">I</a>  think the proposed solutions from Councilor Bears, I think, would be a very important first step in making sure that we're patching up those holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2511.12s">Particularly,</a>  I think it's important to establish more direct relationships with outside entities to make sure that Medford's actually, to reassert our authority and to make sure that we are partnering up <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2525.717s">working</a>  in the spirit of cooperation to make our city better.</p>
