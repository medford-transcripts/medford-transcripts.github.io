00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:23,985
[SPEAKER_14]: A gentleman that, um

18
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:34,271
[SPEAKER_14]: gave to the youth of Medford as a hockey coach and always happened to go to his services the other days.

19
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,172
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Mr. John Garrity.

20
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:40,616

21
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:42,838
[SPEAKER_14]: His son Jay was my captain.

22
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,099
[SPEAKER_14]: His son Chris played for me.

23
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:53,456
[SPEAKER_14]: He was always willing to help, never a negative word, whether he thought I played his kid too much or too little.

24
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:59,342
[SPEAKER_14]: He was just a good sounding boy, a Method legend in his own right.

25
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:11,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Listened to some stories the other day and hearing the stories on the playground and on the ice and playing pond hockey really

26
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:15,305
[SPEAKER_14]: summed it up what kind of person Mr. Garrity was.

27
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:22,710
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a tenacious individual who loved life, loved Medford, and loved his family.

28
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,155
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that with the passing of his son, Jay, I know it was very difficult.

29
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:37,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Jay was a very big piece in a lot of people's lives, but I'm sure when a dad loses his first son, I think it must have played,

30
00:02:39,913 --> 00:03:01,462
[SPEAKER_14]: very big part in who he was after that and I know that he was a rock for his wife and I know that Mrs. Garrity is one of the leaders in our community in making sure that we don't forget the issues of drug addiction and

31
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:10,802
[SPEAKER_14]: the Garrity family really keeps that on the front page and making sure that they're solid advocates for that.

32
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:22,907
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did unexpectedly lose Mr. Garrity a few weeks ago and just wanted to send our condolences to the Garrity family and he will be missed.

33
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

34
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,208

35
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

36
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:28,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

37
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I join Councilor Scarpelli in offering my condolences to the family.

38
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:39,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Garrity was a great person, Lawrence State's resident, known by friends and family alike as Bayer.

39
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Councilor Scott Nelly hit the nail on the head.

40
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Although he's left us here, he's going to leave a legacy behind.

41
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:55,364
[SPEAKER_11]: If it weren't for the Garrity family, I don't think the city would have been in a good position to create the Office of Outreach and Prevention.

42
00:03:55,384 --> 00:04:01,126
[SPEAKER_11]: But they came up with this council and they advocated for this story out there, and they helped fight the addiction stigma.

43
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:15,592
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was because of their work that Wisconsin has been able to move forward this season, fighting the epidemic and I just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's indulgences and also my gratitude for their services.

44
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:18,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

59
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:04,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Scott and Gary Farber on celebrating 134 years in business.

00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:06,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

61
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:06,853
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

62
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:14,075
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think most people even know that Hunt's Drug is owned by Medford residents.

63
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:20,016
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you ever have the opportunity to go to Hunt Drug or Hunt Photo, you'd be surprised at the amount of

64
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:24,743
[SPEAKER_23]: camera things that just remarkable.

65
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:45,308
[SPEAKER_23]: I was in there maybe about eight months ago, I cleaned up my closet and I found like a bunch of cameras and I donated them because they donate the veterans and I had a chance to talk to one of them over there and just amazed at how that store has grown over the years and just want to thank them for all the years of business.

66
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

67
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

68
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:59,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing to think that what started out as a small convenience store in Malden three generations of family ago has now transformed into one of the largest camera stores around.

69
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:05,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the great pleasure and opportunity to go to school with both Scott and Gary, and I call them both friends actually.

70
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Gary quite a bit.

71
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:08,675
[SPEAKER_05]: He's moved back to Metro recently.

72
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just great to see that they've been able to continue the family tradition and continue so much success with the business.

73
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:19,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors and congratulate them on such a momentous occasion.

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

75
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello and Knight for bringing this forward.

76
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:44,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that another great family metric, not just a camera store, but Hunt Drug now, if you wanted lessons, if you wanted to do different trade shows, the farmers are always willing to even come into the community to run programs for the community.

77
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:45,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that

78
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:53,281
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, with, you know, Gary and I coach, I was fortunate enough to coach a great athlete in Gary Fava.

79
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,883
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think he's missed a three point shot to this day.

80
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Larry Bird's the only person that rivals him.

81
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:03,549
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that, you know, it is an amazing story of a local family.

82
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:16,236
[SPEAKER_14]: that have done amazing things, but what I really am impressed about is how they always give back, whether it be the veterans or school programming, and it's something that they never forgot their roots.

83
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:17,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to congratulate them as well.

84
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:18,097

00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:43,775
[SPEAKER_09]: A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than August 31st, 2023.

151
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:56,666
[SPEAKER_09]: The petition proposes corrections and clarifications for technical discrepancies in addition to one, amending the use of the table of use and parking regulations for each motor vehicle related uses and I miscellaneous commercial uses.

152
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:00,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, amending language regulating multiple principal structures a lot.

153
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:05,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Three, amending language allowing a second associate member of the Board of Appeals.

154
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:08,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, eliminating the special permit requirement for inclusionary housing.

155
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:13,967
[SPEAKER_09]: call 781-393-2425 for accommodations, AIDS, TDD 781-393-2516.

156
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:28,710
[SPEAKER_09]: The full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of the city clerk, city hall room 103, or on the city's website at medfordma.org slash department slash planning dash development dash sustainability by clicking on current city board filings.

157
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,170
[SPEAKER_09]: As stated, we did open this up at our last regular meeting.

158
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,171
[SPEAKER_09]: This was presented by counselors on the

159
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,452
[SPEAKER_09]: the zoning subcommittee, correct?

160
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:44,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So if council would like to give a brief summary, we also have recommendations back from the CD board, which were in our packet.

161
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:45,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I can review those as well.

162
00:10:46,958 --> 00:11:03,008
[SPEAKER_09]: If councilors want to provide a brief summary, we could also, as there are several, multiple sections, I would be open to whether we want to take this as a whole, if we want to sever this and take this as separate sections, as there are different recommendations from the CD board on different sections.

163
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I will turn it over to Vice President Bears.

164
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:05,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

165
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:07,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Madam President.

166
00:11:08,994 --> 00:11:27,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so basically, we received back comments from the Community Development Board on change A. They did suggest a substantive change, which is to, we had recommended that the, or we had initiated a proposal where the council would be the special permit granting authority for a number of

167
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:34,739
[SPEAKER_17]: motor vehicle related uses and miscellaneous commercial uses, specifically in C1, C2 and I districts.

168
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:47,564
[SPEAKER_17]: This is designed to prevent the further proliferation of motor vehicle repair shops and car yards in Mystic Ave area and other commercial areas of the city where we're looking at

169
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:54,578
[SPEAKER_17]: other more significant uses than storage or repair of vehicles.

170
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:58,939
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll come back to that one, because the CD board recommendation is a significant change.

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,800
[SPEAKER_17]: The second change is B, that's on page three.

172
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:16,724
[SPEAKER_17]: The recodification, that language that we passed had an unintended consequence of making a lot of properties nonconforming, where you have a single parcel with multiple principal structures on the lot.

173
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:18,225
[SPEAKER_17]: The CD board,

174
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:30,030
[SPEAKER_17]: did suggest a language change just to specify the districts where that issue is occurring, SF1, SF2, and GR zoning, but otherwise they accepted the proposed change.

175
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:38,778
[SPEAKER_17]: The third change is adding a second associate member to the Board of Appeals and clarifying term length.

176
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:46,444
[SPEAKER_17]: We passed a zoning change in early 2022 that did this, but then we actually overruled it with the recodification.

177
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:54,751
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is correcting us back to the language that we had passed for members appointments to the Board of Appeals and having a second associate member.

178
00:12:56,872 --> 00:13:01,365
[SPEAKER_17]: There were a number of unintended referrals for papers to the Community Development Board.

179
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:02,569
[SPEAKER_17]: This is now the fourth one, number D.

180
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:07,078
[SPEAKER_17]: of lack of clear language.

181
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:19,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically a lot of these are we've had this new zoning recodification in place for now a little bit over a year, and the bodies that are going through it, the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board are saying, here are some of the technical things that we think need to be updated.

182
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:24,088
[SPEAKER_17]: But essentially, we're referring papers to the Community Development Board that never needed to go to them.

183
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,049
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a small technical change.

184
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,170
[SPEAKER_17]: The CDB did not change.

185
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Community Development Board recommendations don't change what we had proposed.

186
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,354
[SPEAKER_17]: The fifth one is number E,

187
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:45,405
[SPEAKER_17]: There was conflict between who is the special permit granting authority, and the Community Development Board recommended specific language to accomplish that objective.

188
00:13:49,548 --> 00:14:03,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Number six, F, the language that we passed in 2022 created an extra requirement for a special permit for inclusionary housing that's not necessary, and the Community Development Board accepted the language changes that we proposed for that.

189
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:17,594
[SPEAKER_17]: G, the state agency that oversees housing changed its name this year from the Department of Housing and Community Development to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.

190
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:21,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Our proposed change just updates all of those references in the zoning.

191
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:26,238
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the CD board may have found one or two more.

192
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,962
[SPEAKER_17]: They slightly changed the language, just to make it more clear, but basically the same thing.

193
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:38,424
[SPEAKER_17]: And then a number of definitions were deleted from the zoning when we recodified it.

194
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:47,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Several pages, I think it's pages 10 through, yeah, the whole rest of it, I think, 10 through 21, and the CD board,

195
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:56,979
[SPEAKER_17]: agreed with all the ones that we included, and also found a couple other definitions that had been omitted from the recodification to include.

196
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,740
[SPEAKER_17]: So essentially, that's the summary.

197
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:10,769
[SPEAKER_17]: If we were to sever, I would recommend severing change A from changes B through G, or sorry, B through H.

198
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:20,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

199
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:26,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other commentary from the members that have presented the zoning change?

200
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:27,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts?

201
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:29,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

202
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:43,788
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing substantive to add, but just in summary, on top of what Vice President Bears just said, I think the substantive change in A is to bring that use table into alignment with the community's goals for that area.

203
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:50,655
[SPEAKER_20]: through regulating mechanical car park uses to bring an alignment with community wishes and our comprehensive plan.

204
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,076
[SPEAKER_20]: The rest I think are technical corrections.

205
00:15:53,136 --> 00:16:03,941
[SPEAKER_20]: And in some cases, Scribner's errors, typos that we've, we and other bodies have noticed are in the zoning ordinance in the, a little over a year that we've been using it since the first pre-convocation.

206
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

207
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello, do you have anything to add?

208
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:13,613
[SPEAKER_09]: As this is a public hearing, I will reopen the portion of the public hearing for anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper.

209
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:17,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the changes presented to us?

210
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:18,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Hunt.

211
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:29,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

212
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,960
[SPEAKER_16]: On behalf of our office, the planners on staff and the

213
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Community Development Board, we're in favor of these changes.

214
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:48,629
[SPEAKER_16]: If you would like me to speak to or clarify any of the details in here, Danielle Evans, our senior planner, and I am present and we're happy to do so, but otherwise, I'll just leave it at that unless you would like further detail.

215
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:49,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

216
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us, either on Zoom or in person?

217
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:57,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Zoom.

218
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:05,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

219
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:11,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the proposed changes before us, either in person or on Zoom?

220
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

221
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have any further discussion from the council or a motion?

222
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:27,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Paris.

223
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to ask that Director Hunt and Planner Evans just

224
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,605
[SPEAKER_17]: question about the first change.

225
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:41,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Change A to the use table around motor vehicle related uses.

226
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:53,645
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems to me that that's the major substance of change in here from the Community Development Board recommendations, which is we had proposed that the council be

227
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:14,934
[SPEAKER_17]: the Special Permit Granting Authority for a number of these uses, and the Community Development Board has recommended that they be the Special Permit Granting Authority instead, and I was just wondering if you guys could speak to the Community Development Board's reasoning or rationale behind that recommendation.

228
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:40,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, so in a big picture way, it is actually fairly unusual in communities to have the city council and elected body be deciding on individual businesses because it really leaves it open to a lot of politics and taking politics more into account rather than looking at the general

229
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,494
[SPEAKER_16]: and what's the good fit here?

230
00:18:46,974 --> 00:19:04,299
[SPEAKER_16]: It is our understanding that the rationale behind the original proposed changes is because we as a city envision a different situation going on in Mr. Gap, and we don't want to allow a number of uses as of right where we are getting ready to do a more

231
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:31,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Our recommendation of having the planning board do it is putting it in the hands of people who are planners, either by education or by interest, their work, and to have them sort of make a decision around whether or not a particular business should get a special permit rather than making it a political thing that could be the subject of political

232
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,176
[SPEAKER_16]: it's not a use variance.

233
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:36,156
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a special permit, but basically

234
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:06,864
[SPEAKER_16]: but you can do it if you come in and ask for a special permit and they're completely discretionary.

235
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:10,346
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have to say yes to any of them.

236
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:15,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not like when you're doing a variance, you have like certain tests that you have to meet.

237
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,351
[SPEAKER_16]: The special permit test is like, does it fit with the character of the neighborhood?

238
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it fit with what the city wants to see there?

239
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:23,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the city want this project?

240
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:26,676
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you wanna clarify any of that at all.

241
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, in addition,

242
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:42,943
[SPEAKER_06]: As a staff to the city board, we went through all of the uses and kind of compared it to the comprehensive plan and the zoning districts that would be affected.

243
00:20:43,203 --> 00:21:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And the city board agreed with the recommendations to add some additional uses to require special permits, particularly like self storage warehouses,

244
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:06,998
[SPEAKER_06]: some other like lower, not the highest and best uses for properties.

245
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:17,764
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a lot of calls and emails from permit expeditors who are looking to relocate some of these uses that are now getting pushed out of Cambridge, getting pushed out of Somerville.

246
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:22,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they wanna come here and it's not the best uses.

247
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:29,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So some locations it might be fine, but switching it to a special permit so we could

248
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:34,829
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, drill down and actually look at a site specifically, will it work at this site?

249
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:40,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we added some additional ones in addition to the motor vehicle.

250
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a further question on that?

251
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:45,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

252
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:48,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for that, because I didn't quite notice that, but

253
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:55,985
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm guessing that's in the J, wholesale transportation, industrial uses, and then it looks like open storage under accessory uses.

254
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:01,788
[SPEAKER_17]: What was the rationale between, for going to the zoning board for some of them and the city board for others?

255
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:15,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So looking at, so the use category J, the board of appeals was already the designated special permit granting authority for many of those uses.

256
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:15,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

257
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So to be consistent,

258
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:32,633
[SPEAKER_06]: switch some of the Ys to BA so that they would be in charge of at least that use category so it would make a little bit more sense.

259
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:33,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it.

260
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:38,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think in general, the intent here was not to allow these kind of uses by right.

261
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:48,256
[SPEAKER_17]: I like that you at the CD board came back and kind of noted some other specific uses that I think fall into a similar category as what we were looking at with the motor vehicle issue.

262
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:58,516
[SPEAKER_17]: in general, I'd actually, I mean, Councilor Caraviello proposed this, so I'd like to hear from him what he thinks about it being us versus the Community Development Board.

263
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:02,217
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

264
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:16,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was done for purposely what you just said about people being pushed out of these other communities, and they're getting better value out of their land, and they're coming over here and taking our good property, and we're getting the short end of the stick.

265
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:28,433
[SPEAKER_23]: It was the intent of this, so I'll take whatever recommendations the board made, but that was my intent when I brought it forward to stop that.

266
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:30,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

267
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Knight on Zoom and then Councilor Collins.

268
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll defer comment at this time, Madam President.

269
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

270
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

271
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Merlin.

272
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:46,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for walking us through this.

273
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:57,286
[SPEAKER_20]: As was just stated, I think that the primary goal of putting these changes forward was to remove some of these uses by right because we want to mitigate how much they're encroaching on our

274
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,930
[SPEAKER_20]: valuable land in this area that we could put to many other uses.

275
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:08,777
[SPEAKER_20]: And it seems like with these recommendations on the slight amendments that the city board sent back, there's kind of a secondary goal of making it more consistent.

276
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:19,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Who is reviewing the special permit applications when they do come in aligning that with the right board to be reviewing it and making sure that the same board is reviewing for the same types of uses.

277
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:27,752
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that that is really aligned with what we're trying to do with the zoning ordinance in general, making things both blend with our use goals and also just keeping things more consistent

278
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,491

00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:41,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tsai.

284
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:50,538
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to thank the City Board for getting back to us and for being proactive in suggesting changes and in reviewing the language here.

285
00:24:51,977 --> 00:25:01,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that, you know, these, the technical aspects, the technical changes are, I think it's hard to argue against them.

286
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:04,304
[SPEAKER_22]: The substantive changes are, I think, are really helpful for our community.

287
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:12,389
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Councilor Caraviello really has explained well over the last few weeks and months why we need something like this.

288
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:19,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this brings us in alignment, in closer alignment with our comprehensive plan, and so, and in preparation of round two of rezoning.

[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to express my thanks.

00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:36,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And likewise, I think I appreciate the work of the CD board, our PDS, of the Councilors who did a lot of the best majority of this work.

293
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:47,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just understanding, as Councilor Scarpelli will always point out, as Councilor Caraviello, we are absolutely looking at the bigger picture at that next round of zoning, and we're hopefully we'll get out the RFP once more so that we can begin that work being started by

294
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:50,073
[SPEAKER_09]: some land use experts and things like that.

295
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:58,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but I appreciate the work being done in the interim to make sure we're addressing some unintended consequences and some things we want to make better for our community as these are living documents.

296
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So, appreciate it.

404
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:00,509
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to

405
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,514
[SPEAKER_08]: see if there was any questions that we could address.

406
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:04,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we have a motion to approve as is, but.

407
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:05,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Teresa.

408
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Great to see you in this capacity.

409
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:11,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll present if I can.

410
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:23,666
[SPEAKER_14]: These are projects that are already in place, and these are just the additions to finishing projects, something that's why we voted for the CPA, the great project, so move forward to approval.

411
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:24,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

412
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:26,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberto, is there anything else you wanted to add?

413
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:30,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for recognizing me.

414
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:42,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to provide a little bit of context that two of the projects were projects that were previously funded, as you said, and you previously discussed them in the committee of the whole.

415
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:53,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And two of the projects are expansions of, small expansions of projects that have been done in the past and will make improvements over the,

416
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,120
[SPEAKER_03]: the what we have done already to date.

417
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:12,632
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are coming forward as off cycle applications through our small grant application process where very small projects can apply on an as needed basis rather than going through our application cycle.

418
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:16,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate your consideration and the motion that you've already made for approval.

419
00:34:17,616 --> 00:34:17,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:33,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Paris.

444
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:33,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

445
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

446
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:42,583

[SPEAKER_09]: Seven.

[SPEAKER_09]: The affirmative zero in the negative.

451
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:51,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The emotion passes.

452
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:53,713
[SPEAKER_09]: 23-395 offered by Vice President bears.

453
00:35:53,793 --> 00:36:01,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the mayor require the building department and code enforcement to proactively address the rampant violation

454
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:04,556
[SPEAKER_09]: of the short-term rental provisions in the city's zoning ordinance.

455
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:16,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the city create a direct relationship with major short-term rental companies like Airbnb and VRBO to automatically remove any illegal listings that violate the city's zoning ordinance.

456
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

457
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:17,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

458
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,920
[SPEAKER_17]: I put this paper on.

459
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,842
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also a paper on under public participation, which is the next item we're taking up, but maybe we could jointly have the conversation now.

460
00:36:26,862 --> 00:36:29,243
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if Elliot wants to come up in a minute,

461
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:36,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Just one of the reasons I put this on is that this was something that's been a priority for me since even before I was elected.

462
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:39,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Short term rentals, you know, certainly have a

463
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:44,927
[SPEAKER_17]: limited place, I think, in the housing world.

464
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:53,634
[SPEAKER_17]: But what we're seeing is a proliferation of a lot of our housing stock being taken up by short-term rentals and being turned into profit centers.

465
00:36:54,094 --> 00:37:10,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And we passed a zoning ordinance last year that put significant restrictions on short-term rentals, required registration, required them to pay a registration fee, and also limited their use, where if there is not an owner-occupant in the unit,

466
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:28,590
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, if there's an owner occupant renting out rooms, that's one thing, but if there's just a housing unit that's being taken off the long-term rental market and being used for short-term rentals, particularly where you basically have small hotels operating in our neighborhoods, unregulated, we ban that.

467
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,953
[SPEAKER_17]: However, Airbnb and Vrbo have not stopped listing properties that are doing that.

468
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:41,110
[SPEAKER_17]: We have had residents like Mr. Jockelson and others who have been reporting, you've probably seen them on various social media sites.

469
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there was someone who had a hot tub in a tent in their backyard that they were putting down as a short term rental.

470
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:55,078
[SPEAKER_17]: And that got immediately, you know, code enforcement went out they said that's, you can't do that and it wasn't allowed but

471
00:37:55,698 --> 00:38:03,509
[SPEAKER_17]: the limited code enforcement resources we have in the city really mean that it's on the residents to report these situations.

472
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,073
[SPEAKER_17]: And even when they do report them, it takes some time to get some enforcement out there.

473
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:08,876
[SPEAKER_17]: I really think that we should

474
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:18,270
[SPEAKER_17]: be more proactive, I think we'd find a lot of rental units coming back onto the market that are currently being used as profit centers in this way, and that would help with our housing crisis.

475
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:32,583
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the two things I'm asking for are that there be more resources and requirements provided to code enforcement so that they can do their job more effectively, but also I do know that thanks to to to Mr. Jopelson and others that

476
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:45,012
[SPEAKER_17]: have informed me that other cities have had created direct liaison relationships with the major short term rental sites, which have allowed the city to report issues directly to them and have listings removed so that they can't be rented.

477
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:59,204
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think both of those solutions need to be explored quickly and implemented so that our zoning ordinance is being followed by these folks who are breaking the law right now.

478
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:00,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

479
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:03,599
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

480
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:06,020
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a good ordinance that's been put forward.

481
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:15,944
[SPEAKER_23]: I think they're being proliferated in all the neighborhoods, not just up in the Tufts University, where that's probably the greatest extent of them, but I have one on my own street.

482
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,245
[SPEAKER_23]: I see people just coming down, walking down the street with suitcases.

483
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:20,546
[SPEAKER_23]: They're all over the place.

484
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,406
[SPEAKER_23]: They're up in the Heights there.

485
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:22,807
[SPEAKER_23]: They're proliferated everywhere.

486
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:26,148
[SPEAKER_23]: All you gotta do is just go on their page and you'd be surprised.

487
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:27,793
[SPEAKER_23]: how many people are doing so.

488
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:33,314
[SPEAKER_23]: I think Boston, I think today, this week, just passed something where they have to be owner-occupied.

489
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:34,935
[SPEAKER_23]: Am I correct?

490
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:36,095
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I saw that.

491
00:39:36,715 --> 00:39:37,755
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw they passed something.

492
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,496
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Boston did pass something.

493
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:44,357
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would hope we could pass something similar and maybe tighten up our rules to stop this.

494
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:51,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we do have, it does say that if you're renting out, our current ordinance says if you're renting out individual rooms, the owner has to be present.

495
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:54,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're not, you can only do it a maximum of 90 days a year.

496
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:56,978
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty strict.

497
00:39:56,998 --> 00:39:58,599
[SPEAKER_17]: We went pretty strict on the first pass.

498
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:03,280
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't mind going and taking another look, but the most important thing is that the strict ordinance we have now be enforced.

499
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

500
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

501
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:22,665
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted to thank Councilor Bears for putting this on the City Council agenda, to thank Mr. Jockelson for submitting that public participation form with a bunch of research and details about why this is a pressing and urgent issue.

502
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:31,295
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that this is the ordinance that we passed on short-term rentals is one of the most meaningful things that this council has done.

503
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:38,718
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something that I think many people here had a personal involvement in, particularly Councilor Bears in crafting.

504
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:41,819
[SPEAKER_22]: And it is something that I think we really should be enforcing.

505
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:53,423
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think there's things that have been coming across our desks as a city council in the last few weeks that have really emphasized the need for our city to invest in enforcement.

506
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:59,609
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we have good laws in place, we need to make sure that they're carried out.

507
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:14,203
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's really important to note the distortionary effect that short-term rentals has on housing affordability and rents, both in terms of property values and in terms of rental prices in neighborhoods.

508
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:17,847
[SPEAKER_22]: The National Bureau of Economic Research has been pretty unequivocal in

509
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:35,349
[SPEAKER_22]: in what it's saying in the economic analyses with how this hurts regular working folks like residents of Medford, like people who are renting in our community, and people who want to buy property in our community, who want to stay in Medford.

510
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:37,410
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I think it's really important.

511
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:49,819
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the proposed solutions from Councilor Bears, I think, would be a very important first step in making sure that we're patching up those holes.

512
00:41:51,120 --> 00:42:04,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Particularly, I think it's important to establish more direct relationships with outside entities to make sure that Medford's actually, to reassert our authority and to make sure that we are partnering up

513
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:08,358
[SPEAKER_22]: working in the spirit of cooperation to make our city better.

514
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:09,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

515
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:10,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins and Councilor Knight.

516
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,239
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Merlin.

517
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,461
[SPEAKER_20]: I also appreciate this being put forward into the constituents that have been advocating about this, some of them for a pretty long time.

518
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:28,164
[SPEAKER_20]: As Councilor Tseng mentioned, this has been, I mean, this is always coming up, but it's been coming up over the past couple weeks over a couple of different topics.

519
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:30,565
[SPEAKER_20]: And this council has

520
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:35,989
[SPEAKER_20]: spent a lot of time talking about the lack of code enforcement resources in the city.

521
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:37,390
[SPEAKER_20]: This comes up every budget season.

522
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:53,004
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something that we, and by we, I mean as a city, not as a council, can't seem to fund and expand resources for that department nearly fast enough at the rate that we know there's a clear need for and that residents are on a daily basis observing.

523
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:54,184
[SPEAKER_20]: the need for.

524
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:56,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, rules are not self-enforcing.

525
00:42:56,605 --> 00:43:04,628
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that these suggestions are really good to try to nip in the bud the problem of Airbnbs and things like them proliferating in Medford.

526
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:20,334
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we need an expanded code enforcement office to be following up on problems like these and all of the many other problems from potholes to obstructed sidewalks to overgrowth that residents are reporting every day.

527
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:33,621
[SPEAKER_20]: in our community, and I really do regret and resent that when we exist at these substandard staffing and resource levels for basic city functions, it means that residents have to be code enforcement officers, and I really don't think that's fair.

528
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,642
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think community members should have to be that.

529
00:43:36,122 --> 00:43:36,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

530
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:37,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

531
00:43:37,903 --> 00:43:38,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

532
00:43:40,144 --> 00:43:41,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

533
00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:45,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also very important to point out that this is 100% an enforcement issue.

534
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:53,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have the controls in place and it's a matter of the administration taking steps that are necessary to ensure that neighborhoods are protected.

535
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's number one.

536
00:43:56,101 --> 00:44:04,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And number two, we also have to think about what's prompting residents in this community to move towards not being landlords and instead being Airbnb operators.

537
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:11,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of it has to do with the discussion, I think, about policies that might go into effect in this community in the future.

538
00:44:12,465 --> 00:44:15,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it has to do with the fact that there's a lot of strong tenant rights laws

539
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:22,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And landlords feel like sometimes they're at a disadvantage when they go in to pursue non payment or rent issues and the like.

540
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:29,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So policy that we create also impacts these trends in housing.

541
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:32,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important for us to look at the big picture as we move forward.

542
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:36,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can certainly agree with all my council colleagues and saying that this is 100% enforcement issue.

543
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that needs to be handled the forthright.

544
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:42,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, you know, it's about protecting the neighborhoods.

545
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:44,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now we're not doing it.

546
00:44:44,094 --> 00:44:45,015
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something we need to do.

547
00:44:45,095 --> 00:44:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank the council for bringing the issue forward.

548
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:49,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

549
00:44:51,018 --> 00:44:52,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council at this time?

550
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Any members of the public wish to speak?

551
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of, I mean, we'll take public participation.

552
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:08,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of vice president affairs, seconded by councilor Collins, Mr. Calderon.

553
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:12,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

554
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:12,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

555
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:21,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

556
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:23,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

557
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:24,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

558
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:25,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven.

559
00:45:25,094 --> 00:45:26,935
[SPEAKER_09]: The infernus during the negative emotion passes.

560
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to public participation.

561
00:45:28,995 --> 00:45:36,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Elliot Jockelson of 60 Marshall Street, Medford, with a complaint regarding violations of short term rental regulations on 66 Lyman Ave, Medford.

562
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:43,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Subject is urgent addressing violations of short term rental regulations at 66 Lyman Ave.

563
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:47,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Medford City Council members, I hope this message finds you well.

564
00:45:47,046 --> 00:45:53,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to draw your attention to a matter of considerable concern regarding the property situated at 66 Lyman Ave in Medford Hillside.

565
00:45:53,589 --> 00:46:00,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Recent developments have highlighted serious violations of the city's short-term rental code at this location, prompting the need for a thorough examination.

566
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:04,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Key points of concern, I want to emphasize that I have taken proactive measures to address this situation.

567
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:09,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally reached out to Medford Code Enforcement Department to report these violations.

568
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:12,552
[SPEAKER_09]: See click issue ID 15172926.

569
00:46:13,132 --> 00:46:20,758
[SPEAKER_09]: In response, they promptly conducted an onsite inspection and acknowledged that the apparent violations by issuing an official violation letter to the property owners.

570
00:46:21,419 --> 00:46:26,503
[SPEAKER_09]: However, despite these actions, the property continues to function as an apparent illegal lodging establishment.

571
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:31,487
[SPEAKER_09]: At present, the property remains occupied by a substantial number of guests and is fully booked for the upcoming year.

572
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,827
[SPEAKER_09]: operational practices and consequences.

573
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:41,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on my investigation, it appears that 66 Lyman Ave is operating in a manner resembling an unauthorized boarding house.

574
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,552
[SPEAKER_09]: The proprietors, who reside in Winchester, have been renting individual bedrooms through Airbnb since 2020.

575
00:46:46,952 --> 00:46:52,955
[SPEAKER_09]: The operational model has resulted in a continuous influx of approximately six new guests each week for over two years.

576
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:56,877
[SPEAKER_09]: The practice raises serious concerns about security and potential health hazards for our community.

577
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:58,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Security risks in our neighborhood.

578
00:46:58,744 --> 00:47:05,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond potential code violations, the security risks associated with operating in a legal hotel in a quiet suburban neighborhood are significant.

579
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:10,375
[SPEAKER_09]: The constant turnover of unfamiliar individuals entering and exiting the premises disrupts the tranquility of our community.

580
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:23,715
[SPEAKER_09]: The dynamic presents security concerns that extend beyond the property itself, affecting neighboring houses and streets, the heightened traffic flow, possible disturbances, and the unfamiliarity of temporary occupancy with local safety protocols amplifies these concerns.

581
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:33,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Identifying regulatory barriers, digital evidence listed in CCLX fix report shows that there are several violations of the short-term rental zoning regulations at 66 Lyman Ave.

582
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,341
[SPEAKER_09]: It is crucial to investigate potential factors impeding compliance.

583
00:47:37,381 --> 00:47:39,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Three key areas of concern include

584
00:47:40,074 --> 00:47:53,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Operator's primary residence requirement is a requirement that a short-term rental property serves as the operator's primary residence appears to be compromised as evidenced by the absence of the owner slash operator and the transportation of supplies from an external location.

585
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:06,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Sole renter party mandate, the practice of renting multiple separate bedrooms of distinct groups as indicated by multiple listings for different bedrooms concurrently raises concerns about compliance with the single party rental mandate and guest count limitation.

586
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,006
[SPEAKER_09]: The observed operational activity prompts questions

587
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:12,318
[SPEAKER_09]: about adherence to the stipulated guest limits for short-term rentals.

588
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:14,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Impact on local rental dynamics.

589
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:19,640
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to potential regulatory infractions, there are implications for our local rental dynamics.

590
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:32,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Short-term rental practices have led to substantial disparities in rental rates, while traditional year-long lease for comparable property rents for approximately 3,500 per month, the same property on Airbnb commands around 6,000 per month.

591
00:48:32,904 --> 00:48:37,866
[SPEAKER_09]: This trend distorts the local rental market, rendering long-term leases less accessible for residents.

592
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:40,133
[SPEAKER_09]: preservation of our community's well-being.

593
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:43,855
[SPEAKER_09]: As these complexities unfold, it is vital to address the situation promptly.

594
00:48:43,975 --> 00:48:48,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Upholding established regulations and safeguarding our community's well-being are paramount.

595
00:48:48,498 --> 00:48:56,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I urge you to enforce the new short-term rental codes for 66 Lyman Ave and all other illegal short-term rentals in Medford.

596
00:48:56,483 --> 00:49:05,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Your thoughtful consideration is highly valued, and I am confident that your appropriate measures will be taken to address this matter in alignment with existing regulations and the best interests of our community.

597
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:07,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely, Elliot Jockelson, 60 Marshall Street, Medford.

598
00:49:08,803 --> 00:49:09,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to come up?

599
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:17,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Just name and address for the record, even though, or just, you can just say name and address.

600
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Elliot Jockelson, 60 Marshall Street.

601
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:18,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

602
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:20,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having me here, Zach.

603
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:21,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for engaging with me on this.

604
00:49:22,274 --> 00:49:25,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Zach spent a lot of time talking to me about this issue.

605
00:49:25,156 --> 00:49:28,159
[SPEAKER_10]: The police were at my house this morning.

606
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:32,542
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an Airbnb guest that was walking behind my garage, behind my fence.

607
00:49:33,343 --> 00:49:37,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, hey, I was out there with my dog at eight in the morning, can I help you?

608
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:38,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was just curious.

609
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:39,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm new.

610
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:42,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm over here now, pointing towards the Airbnb house.

611
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,341
[SPEAKER_10]: We have cars on our block from every state.

612
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:49,122
[SPEAKER_10]: The cars change every week.

613
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:56,145
[SPEAKER_10]: The one thing I'll say, I put everything in the report, because I'm sorry that was so long.

614
00:49:56,265 --> 00:49:58,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to make sure everything was there and you guys heard it.

615
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:04,708
[SPEAKER_10]: What I will say is that this problem is unique.

616
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:09,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's really spreading across the neighborhood quickly.

617
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:11,072
[SPEAKER_10]: It's causing a lot of damage.

618
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,374
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also unique in that the solution can be quick.

619
00:50:15,814 --> 00:50:18,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, all this could be taken care of in a day.

620
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:35,159
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone did the research like I did, you just compare the listings to Zillow, you know, anything you have to do online to confirm that this house is not renting properly, make a list and create an official liaison from the city to Airbnb, and everything will be shut off in a day.

621
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:37,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you call Boston, someone did it there.

622
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:41,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Find out who did it, and they'll put you in touch with the person at Airbnb.

623
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:42,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't do it.

624
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:46,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been emailing Airbnb for two weeks.

625
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:48,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been sending them code from Zach.

626
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:56,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent them an email from our code enforcement stating that their violation has been found, and I'm getting canned responses.

627
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So they obviously are not interested in shutting down an Airbnb unless the city gets involved.

628
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:03,413
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my takeaway.

629
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:14,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for putting, for creating, trying to create more teeth in these restrictions and thank you for listening to me and reading my letter.

630
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

631
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:16,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

632
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:17,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

633
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:18,903
[SPEAKER_09]: That's embarrassing.

634
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:26,932
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I could just, I just do want to reiterate Councilor Knight's point, which I tried to make clear in my resolution just prior to this.

635
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:29,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Two things are clear.

636
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:48,076
[SPEAKER_17]: I've talked I've been working with Elliot talking to code enforcement about this I've been hearing from other folks about You know different issues code enforcement goes out when they hear about it, but they Basically the way we're doing code enforcement city generally in the way that it's structured is not what it needs to be you know essentially

637
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:53,468
[SPEAKER_17]: The building departments code enforcement, and they're more focused on things like this and building inspection.

638
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:55,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Dennis came straight and they came straight out.

639
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:56,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they looked at it.

640
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,631
[SPEAKER_10]: They were professional.

641
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:58,131
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't them.

642
00:51:58,151 --> 00:52:00,693
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just they don't have the teeth.

643
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:01,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly the staff.

644
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:03,634
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, and that's what I'm that's what I'm getting at.

645
00:52:03,674 --> 00:52:03,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Right?

646
00:52:03,935 --> 00:52:04,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Like they're doing great.

647
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:05,936
[SPEAKER_17]: They're doing an awesome job.

648
00:52:05,996 --> 00:52:07,697
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking to them directly about what they need.

649
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:09,038
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know,

650
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:15,840
[SPEAKER_17]: essentially, you know, they've been doing, there should be a code enforcement officer at DPW looking at stuff in the public way.

651
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,681
[SPEAKER_17]: The building department's been covering for that for a long time.

652
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:23,062
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to have a serious discussion about inspectional services and code enforcement in the city.

653
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,822
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the resource level?

654
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:25,962
[SPEAKER_17]: How are they collaborating?

655
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Which departments are doing each job?

656
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:34,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Because clearly, on this issue, I think we're about to hear another major issue about overgrowth and trash and issues in

657
00:52:36,013 --> 00:52:37,454
[SPEAKER_17]: on Emory Street tonight, right?

658
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Clearly they don't have the resources and the support they need.

659
00:52:41,396 --> 00:52:50,362
[SPEAKER_17]: The flip side of that is we can advocate, we pass the zoning ordinance, we communicate when we can, when we hear from a resident or we hear from code enforcement, we try to make those links.

660
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:58,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually funding or making a structural change to how we do inspectional services, only the mayor has the power to do that.

661
00:52:58,647 --> 00:53:00,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually saying, hey, code enforcement,

662
00:53:01,168 --> 00:53:04,930
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we need to prioritize creating an Airbnb liaison, right?

663
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Only the mayor can do that.

664
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:07,631
[SPEAKER_17]: So does the mayor watch this?

665
00:53:08,072 --> 00:53:18,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the mayor is watching please shut all these Airbnbs down immediately because I'm just curious like about 66 Lyman Well, I mean, thank you for having me here.

666
00:53:18,297 --> 00:53:19,097
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the next step?

667
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I had the police out here today.

668
00:53:20,718 --> 00:53:22,899
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three more cars coming tomorrow.

669
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:23,199
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a

670
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:26,506
[SPEAKER_10]: 18 more cars coming next week.

671
00:53:27,387 --> 00:53:34,533
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of the reason why I came here because I've spoken to code enforcement, I've spoken to the city council now.

672
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:38,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still unclear what the process is for getting this shut down.

673
00:53:38,537 --> 00:53:43,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in the dark and every day I'm looking outside my kitchen window and I'm seeing three new cars blow up.

674
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:51,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, and that's kind of why I'm making the statement I'm making is we've now put a resolution on, our resolutions generally get a response from the mayor.

675
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:59,630
[SPEAKER_17]: The point of this resolution is to say, hey, we need to make this a priority, it's our request, please respond and tell us when and how you're going to do it.

676
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:10,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, all I can do is we can have another email or phone conversation with Dennis or Mike and we can- I'm gonna email the mayor next, but I'm gonna keep watching and annoying people until this house is shut down.

677
00:54:10,572 --> 00:54:11,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going away, I'm the-

678
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:15,553
[SPEAKER_10]: the like miser of Marshall Street or whatever.

679
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:16,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you want to call it.

680
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The campsite was shut down, so there is precedence.

681
00:54:19,597 --> 00:54:20,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, exactly.

682
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:22,419
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, that's what I'm saying.

683
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,981
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to be clear that we have our eyes on it.

684
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,623
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been working on this legislatively.

685
00:54:27,162 --> 00:54:28,383
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to be pushing for it.

686
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:38,750
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a partnership in a two-way street in terms of we can make the request, but the action has to come from the office of the mayor, because that's who runs enforcement and who supervises the staff of the city.

687
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:43,192
[SPEAKER_17]: So- Well, now that I've spoken to you, I will now go and try and pursue it there.

688
00:54:43,232 --> 00:54:45,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and I'm happy to help on that direction too.

689
00:54:46,194 --> 00:54:52,779
[SPEAKER_17]: I would love to have a conversation with the council and the mayor and code enforcement about what should inspectional services look like.

690
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:54,653
[SPEAKER_17]: in the city as well.

691
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:55,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so easy to shut it down.

692
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:58,094
[SPEAKER_10]: You could change the entire city in a day.

693
00:54:58,494 --> 00:54:59,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you had the right.

694
00:54:59,694 --> 00:55:00,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, thank you so much.

695
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:01,174
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

696
00:55:01,654 --> 00:55:03,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

697
00:55:03,555 --> 00:55:06,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President, and I feel for the gentleman.

698
00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:10,276
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, code enforcement is something that I've been.

699
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:12,316
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been pushing since for 12 years.

700
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:13,896
[SPEAKER_23]: It's my first day in the council.

701
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:20,718
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I mean, Dennis and Mike, uh, anytime I've called him, they've been very responsive.

702
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,958
[SPEAKER_23]: But again, you know, they're only two of them.

703
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:23,378
[SPEAKER_23]: And

704
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:38,720
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of my objectives was always wanted to have that we should have people on the street at least two to three days a week going around and picking up the obvious violations.

705
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:48,125
[SPEAKER_23]: Not going out looking for them, looking for problems, but there's hundreds of obvious violations right in front of everyone's face that these gentlemen just can't possibly do.

706
00:55:48,505 --> 00:55:48,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And I say,

707
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:53,793
[SPEAKER_23]: The inspection department, right, and Council Member is right.

708
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:55,594
[SPEAKER_23]: We should have one in for the Board of Health.

709
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:57,514
[SPEAKER_23]: We should have one in for the building.

710
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:04,637
[SPEAKER_23]: We should have multiple ones, but unfortunately, two people just can't possibly do the work that's needed.

711
00:56:04,937 --> 00:56:06,718
[SPEAKER_23]: Please, if you need any help, call me.

712
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:07,898
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm around during the day.

713
00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:09,699
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll come to your house and help you.

714
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:11,180
[SPEAKER_23]: If the police don't come, you call me.

715
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,140
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll be there.

716
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:19,274
[SPEAKER_10]: any precedent for like a, like a, like citizen task force that helps them?

717
00:56:19,394 --> 00:56:21,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sure, there's a lot of people that will be interested.

718
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,197
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they don't have a citizen task, but doesn't have legal authority.

719
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:32,201
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, I mean, other than other than providing information to them in a certain way, where they can look at it and say, Okay, this is an Airbnb house, and they don't have to spend any time on it.

720
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:33,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, you know, something like that.

721
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:33,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

722
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:39,085
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, yes, I say, you know, as fast as you bring it to our attention, you call me or you call councilors.

723
00:56:39,445 --> 00:56:40,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I'll

724
00:56:41,246 --> 00:56:42,887
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll call in as fast as you give them to me.

725
00:56:43,387 --> 00:56:45,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Madam Mayor, Madam President.

726
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:50,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what you're doing is unbelievable.

727
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:54,012
[SPEAKER_14]: What you're doing right now is a good example for the rest of the community.

728
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:56,854
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have to have a task force, just people caring about the community.

729
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,415
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to hear that about, you know, Emory Street.

730
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:05,257
[SPEAKER_14]: It's people that are reaching out to us that unfortunately we don't have the court enforcement department we need.

731
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:05,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

732
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:07,919
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

733
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:10,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I said, you know, I'm around during the day.

734
00:57:10,341 --> 00:57:11,842
[SPEAKER_23]: You call me, I'll come and help you.

735
00:57:11,902 --> 00:57:12,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

736
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:14,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the things I'm only here 10 years.

737
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:18,027
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that really frustrates me about the city is I don't want to have to call one person.

738
00:57:18,107 --> 00:57:18,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank you.

739
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:22,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to like, where do I go online to make the report?

740
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do I speak to in three weeks when it doesn't get done?

741
00:57:24,392 --> 00:57:26,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what are the consequences?

742
00:57:26,553 --> 00:57:29,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to have to, I've been on this and thank you so much for offering that.

743
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:31,597
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been on it for like two years now.

744
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any more time.

745
00:57:32,978 --> 00:57:34,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, you get a job, you get a job.

746
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:38,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm saying that to you guys, you guys spent so much time for little rewards.

747
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:39,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate it.

748
00:57:40,462 --> 00:57:40,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

749
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:46,426
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to add, I think on this specific one, you found the answer, which is we should just be saying directly to the company, you have to remove the listing.

750
00:57:46,826 --> 00:57:47,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

751
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:47,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

752
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:49,648
[SPEAKER_17]: And that, that, that strips out the entire process.

753
00:57:50,088 --> 00:57:57,432
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, you know, you have the people with the authority to make that from the city side who have the legal authority to have that enforcement happen.

754
00:57:58,633 --> 00:57:58,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

755
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:02,144
[SPEAKER_23]: And sometimes it takes a little push from us.

756
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:07,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I say, I went up to Emory Street, I took some pictures, I sent them over to the DPW and the expression.

757
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:13,473
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, and we'll talk about that later, but sometimes it takes that little extra push from somebody to get up there.

758
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:19,058
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you got something, please, my number's listed, call, I'm gonna say I'm around all day long.

759
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,800
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate that, thank you very much.

760
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:22,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

761
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:28,924
[SPEAKER_09]: This is public participation, and I see some folks online with hands up, and I know folks want to speak in person.

762
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:31,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to go to Eunice on Zoom.

763
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:32,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I will ask you to unmute.

764
00:58:34,228 --> 00:58:34,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you.

765
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:36,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, good evening.

766
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:38,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for allowing me to speak.

767
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:40,714
[SPEAKER_18]: So my question is this.

768
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:43,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please?

769
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:43,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

770
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:45,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Eunice Browne, Greenleaf Ave.

771
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:55,647
[SPEAKER_18]: I have two houses on my street, two families that are getting ready to close with new owners this month.

772
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:01,671
[SPEAKER_18]: And particularly the one next door to me, but the other one is four houses up.

773
00:59:02,952 --> 00:59:05,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very fearful of what's to come.

774
00:59:06,674 --> 00:59:15,941
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what their intentions are, but if their intentions are to run an Airbnb, and they've bought the property specifically for that purpose,

775
00:59:18,783 --> 00:59:21,325
[SPEAKER_18]: How are we nipping these in the bud?

776
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:31,133
[SPEAKER_18]: If the people next door to me thought, well, I'll buy this two-family, I'll turn it into an Airbnb, hey, I've got a gold mine here.

777
00:59:32,754 --> 00:59:35,676
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, they can't do this, from what I understand.

778
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:40,400
[SPEAKER_18]: They can't just turn this two-family into a hotel, so to speak.

779
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:44,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Do they know that they can't do this?

780
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:46,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Do they know that they have to go and register?

781
00:59:46,137 --> 01:00:08,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Or are you folks on the city side just counting on the fact that a couple of months in, I'm going to see a rotating cast of characters in here in different cars where Greenleaf's parking is already tight enough, as I'm sure you all know, and a rotating cast of characters.

782
01:00:09,123 --> 01:00:10,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any way to proactively

783
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:16,225
[SPEAKER_18]: know, before these people do this, tell them that they can't do it.

784
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:18,767
[SPEAKER_18]: And then maybe they'll go look elsewhere.

785
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:29,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we did just recently passed the housing stability notification ordinance, which is about providing renters with information they need to know about renting in the city.

786
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:40,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure there's something we could explore as far as providing new owners information like this that lets them know about regulations as far as short term rentals, directing them to this

787
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,500
[SPEAKER_09]: zoning code, something like that.

788
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng?

789
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:59,985
[SPEAKER_22]: And it might be helpful to do more for the city to do more outreach to realtors and to folks who are helping sell the properties to let them know that they should inform their clients that that use is off the table.

790
01:01:01,205 --> 01:01:01,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

791
01:01:02,266 --> 01:01:02,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins?

792
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:13,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate this bringing forward because it's, you know, essentially an example of what we've been talking about is what can we do to make it so these problems aren't happening in the first place.

793
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:28,842
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think the housing stability notification ordinance is a good example because that's using our existing city communication channels just to distribute what is information that's already existing rules that already exist, you know, using an existing communication channel.

794
01:01:29,762 --> 01:01:32,223
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that that paired with having a liaison to

795
01:01:32,947 --> 01:01:42,053
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, Airbnb or a similar company, these are ways of saying, hey, before anybody starts doing anything that you may not know in good faith that you shouldn't be doing, here's how things work in Medford.

796
01:01:42,674 --> 01:01:50,059
[SPEAKER_20]: That paired with more robust enforcement, I think that that's what we should be rolling out for every, you know, all of these frequent flyer city problems that we know we see all the time.

797
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

798
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:51,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

799
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:52,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

800
01:01:53,942 --> 01:01:55,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

801
01:01:55,803 --> 01:01:57,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at this in a couple of different ways.

802
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:01,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The first of which is, you know, all of this,

803
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:12,863
[SPEAKER_05]: getting involved between someone trying to sell a house and someone trying to buy a house and the regulations and restrictions that surround it is part of the due diligence process when you're purchasing a home.

804
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:16,003
[SPEAKER_05]: or when you're purchasing a piece of property.

805
01:02:16,643 --> 01:02:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that that's a process that's heavily regulated as it is.

806
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:32,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we better be very careful in how far we're going to be going in performing the due diligence for these private landowners conducting private land transactions.

807
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:44,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So, with that being said, you know, I can certainly see the issue going on with the lack of enforcement of BMPs in the community, the strict code that we've established that would provide you only 90 days a year for rental.

808
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, you know, I think that there has to be a spot where government doesn't get so involved in people's lives.

809
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:52,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we have to draw our line somewhere.

810
01:02:52,823 --> 01:02:56,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that when that line is doing the due diligence for

811
01:02:58,638 --> 01:02:59,718
[SPEAKER_05]: potential homebuyers.

812
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:04,340
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't really fall within the scope of what a government service is.

813
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:12,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that at the end of the day, we'd be providing far too much energy and effort and performing an exercise that's not going to reap great results.

814
01:03:12,903 --> 01:03:18,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'd be much better off putting our energy, efforts, and time into enforcement.

815
01:03:18,624 --> 01:03:20,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where I stand on this matter, but thank you.

816
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:22,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

817
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Sneha on Zoom.

818
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:26,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I will unmute you.

819
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: and name and address for the record, please.

820
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:34,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Deb.

821
01:03:34,222 --> 01:03:35,603
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Sneha.

822
01:03:35,683 --> 01:03:38,425
[SPEAKER_00]: My address is 108 Medford Street.

823
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:59,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this discussion is rightly so about enforcement, but I just wanted to introduce a note of skepticism in that regard because honestly, just hearing about neighbors sort of keeping an eye on the number plates coming in and who's coming in, who's coming out and having this,

824
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:27,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost sounds like a kind of vigilantism, which is very terrifying to me, frankly speaking, because I think as much as we care about going by the book and making sure homeowners don't exploit certain loopholes in the law, we should also be careful about not building up a resistance to any kind of outsider as a sentiment coming into the community.

825
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:29,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to have that on the record.

826
01:04:30,622 --> 01:04:31,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

827
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:32,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

828
01:04:32,844 --> 01:04:38,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation at this time?

829
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Please come up to the mic.

830
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:44,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we have multiple folks for public participation.

831
01:04:44,094 --> 01:04:46,216
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have an agenda that folks are here for as well.

832
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:51,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will be enforcing the council rules, five minutes each for public participation.

833
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:53,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

834
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:58,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, it's on, there you go.

835
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,385
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street.

836
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:09,528
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here tonight because I wanted to call attention to the fact, you all know that Walkland Court is being redeveloped.

837
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:19,211
[SPEAKER_19]: They have had meetings for the community, but the community doesn't feel as though our voices are being heard.

838
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:30,605
[SPEAKER_19]: So in talking to the residents in the neighborhood, I decided that maybe we should do a petition to see what gauged the sentiment of the community, which I did.

839
01:05:31,786 --> 01:05:33,688
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm going to give you a copy tonight.

840
01:05:34,189 --> 01:05:40,496
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to also present this tomorrow night because the Community Development Board is going to have a meeting on the zoning there.

841
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:50,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, basically, the neighborhood around Walkley Court is not opposed to rebuilding, renovating, upgrading, or whatever.

842
01:05:50,602 --> 01:05:54,143
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the size and the scale that they're proposing there.

843
01:05:54,804 --> 01:06:05,109
[SPEAKER_19]: They're cramming, we feel, too many people in too small an area, and they're putting six-story buildings in a residential neighborhood besides single-family homes.

844
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:12,990
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have all the issues that the residents are concerned about in the petition.

845
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:30,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And for your information, there's very strong, and I mean very strong opposition to this, of the design, not the fact that they're going to redevelop the community, but it's to the... I'd like to get the names on that.

846
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:32,976
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is for the clerks, for the permanent.

847
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:43,942
[SPEAKER_19]: I have collected 1,131 signatures opposing the current design.

848
01:06:44,182 --> 01:06:46,844
[SPEAKER_19]: 99% of the people that I've approached signed.

849
01:06:47,605 --> 01:06:54,451
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't know anything about this, most of them, so I showed them a copy of the design that's being proposed.

850
01:06:55,292 --> 01:07:01,938
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to educate everybody on what's going on there because they've only notified people about the change within 400 feet of the complex.

851
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:13,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, everybody's touting the fact that it's gonna be good for the housing authority and they're gonna add this, but what is it doing to the neighborhood?

852
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:16,985
[SPEAKER_19]: There has to be some compromise here.

853
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:22,349
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we'll be supportive of whatever they wanna do there, but within reason.

854
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:27,354
[SPEAKER_19]: They have to consider the neighborhood and how it's gonna affect the neighborhood.

855
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:34,005
[SPEAKER_19]: So all the points that have been raised are in the handout that I gave you tonight.

856
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:40,270
[SPEAKER_19]: And the copy of the permanent sign petition is gonna be filed with the clerk's office.

857
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:47,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Tomorrow night at the 6.30, well actually during the day tomorrow, I'm going to the community development office and give them their copy.

858
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:51,098
[SPEAKER_19]: But since the city council was meeting tonight, I thought you should have your copy tonight.

859
01:07:51,879 --> 01:07:55,622
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd be happy to answer any questions if you people have any.

860
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:10,451
[SPEAKER_19]: but I want you to know that the community needs some help in mediating what the housing authority wants to do and what is good for the residents of the city of Medford.

861
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:12,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mary.

862
01:08:12,113 --> 01:08:23,861
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to be holding as committee of the whole next Tuesday with the executive director of Medford Housing Authority on this project to get an update, to hear from residents and address concerns.

863
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:26,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be hosting that as a committee of the whole next week.

864
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:26,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

865
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:31,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the points that I bring out in the letter should help you start that conversation.

866
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:32,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

867
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:35,349
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

868
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:36,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

869
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

870
01:08:39,151 --> 01:08:41,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Councilor Knight, unless your hand is still up.

871
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:45,815
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an old high five, Madam President, my apologies.

872
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:47,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Haynes.

873
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

874
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,501
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

875
01:08:54,202 --> 01:09:03,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to make a point regarding the Walkley Court concerns, particularly the one that we're cramming so much housing onto a particular lot.

876
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:08,188
[SPEAKER_12]: basically the size of the land there is fixed.

877
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:11,409
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you reduce the density, that means there's going to be less housing for people there.

878
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,430
[SPEAKER_12]: We desperately need housing.

879
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:21,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just very important that we recognize that if you want less density, there's going to be less housing.

880
01:09:21,654 --> 01:09:23,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Fewer people are going to benefit from the project.

881
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:33,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Big part of this project is not just to renovate, but also to expand the ability to have an offering for people who need a place to live.

882
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:39,942
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a very low income, deeply affordable housing project.

883
01:09:40,202 --> 01:09:49,509
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a very big demand for that housing crisis in general, but we're way short of where we need to be at that deeply affordable as well.

884
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:58,635
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just really important we recognize, you know, less density means less housing, less people benefiting from the project.

885
01:09:58,735 --> 01:09:59,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

886
01:09:59,635 --> 01:09:59,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

887
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:02,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have someone else for public participation.

888
01:10:04,278 --> 01:10:05,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're

889
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,951
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good through every, if you wanna come up, we're good for everyone.

890
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:12,954
[SPEAKER_09]: We can also go back to public participation at the end if you wanna get through everything, but okay.

891
01:10:13,555 --> 01:10:14,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have something else?

892
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:15,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Elliot.

893
01:10:18,538 --> 01:10:20,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna support my neighbor over here.

894
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,400
[SPEAKER_10]: She's fantastic.

895
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:24,463
[SPEAKER_10]: She goes around with petitions and she went around for the bus.

896
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:28,506
[SPEAKER_10]: And I live on Marshall Street, which is a block away from

897
01:10:29,795 --> 01:10:35,238
[SPEAKER_10]: where they're proposing a new road that will lead into all these six-story apartment buildings.

898
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:45,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been following the issue closely, and I've been surprised when I checked to see what the requirements were for who they had to speak with.

899
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:49,366
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just houses that touched the property, which is like six houses.

900
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:58,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're proposing to open up a road with several six-story buildings onto a street that they don't repair.

901
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,052
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one six-story building.

902
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:03,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, one six-story building.

903
01:11:04,543 --> 01:11:05,766
[SPEAKER_10]: It's two six-story buildings.

904
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:07,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it not, Zach?

905
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:13,116
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's one large six-story building and then smaller outbuilding.

906
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:14,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually in favor of it.

907
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:15,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think it's a little large.

908
01:11:15,858 --> 01:11:27,786
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're opening the road onto a street, adding all those people, and you don't ever fix a street for 10 years, maybe you want to go down the street and talk to every house on the street and see how they feel about it.

909
01:11:28,446 --> 01:11:30,527
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a lot more traffic there, that's for sure.

910
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:31,668
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I wanted to say.

911
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:32,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

912
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:32,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

913
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:37,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, if there's no one else to participate, you can come to the mic, please.

914
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,792
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, hi, it's Matthew Page-Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

915
01:11:45,493 --> 01:11:47,135
[SPEAKER_21]: First, yeah, I got here a little late.

916
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,798
[SPEAKER_21]: I imagine some of the things that were on the agenda were covered.

917
01:11:49,858 --> 01:11:52,602
[SPEAKER_21]: If so, Justin, so as Councilor is saying,

918
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:56,833
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very thankful that you got work on the Gender Equity Commission started again.

919
01:11:57,373 --> 01:11:59,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I know- We haven't gotten to it yet, but- Oh, you have not.

920
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:00,575
[SPEAKER_09]: See, we voted for it.

921
01:12:00,595 --> 01:12:07,160
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm speaking on behalf of, in the last term, it looked like there was a lot of aversion to moving on it, particularly by the president.

922
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,463
[SPEAKER_21]: It seemed like there were mothballing, and I'm glad to see that there'll be movement on it again.

923
01:12:12,504 --> 01:12:13,264
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry about that.

924
01:12:13,424 --> 01:12:18,648
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a big, quick walk over here, but there's another issue about this whole Airbnb.

925
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:21,250
[SPEAKER_21]: I've watched these meetings long enough,

926
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:38,397
[SPEAKER_21]: To hear counselors different different instances of the council and members here just target lots of groups there was years ago developers were targeted and then some of the same counselors changed their minds and then Targeted the Historical Commission.

927
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:41,040
[SPEAKER_21]: I've heard masseuses get attacked here.

928
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:42,161
[SPEAKER_21]: I've heard

929
01:12:43,308 --> 01:12:50,730
[SPEAKER_21]: I've heard there's this threat about Oasis and the clientele, and now it's people that are in Airbnbs, and you hear it again and again and again.

930
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,891
[SPEAKER_21]: I know part of it is this game, right?

931
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:54,532
[SPEAKER_21]: We got to target somebody this week.

932
01:12:55,332 --> 01:13:05,055
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm just kind of trying to speak that there are many people who don't speak, but there are us out in the community, and we see what's going on when yet another group is targeted.

933
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:07,916
[SPEAKER_21]: But uh-oh, they might be having some fun, and I'm not.

934
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:11,077
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm miserable, I'm pissed off, and I want to stop them from having some fun.

935
01:13:11,903 --> 01:13:16,608
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, last month I had a bilateral Ernie operation.

936
01:13:17,469 --> 01:13:22,534
[SPEAKER_21]: And my mother came, she's a retired nurse, she came from Florida to help me out and help me through the recuperation.

937
01:13:22,554 --> 01:13:23,735
[SPEAKER_21]: The recuperation is still going on.

938
01:13:24,436 --> 01:13:25,777
[SPEAKER_21]: We really want to stay here in Medford.

939
01:13:26,618 --> 01:13:27,399
[SPEAKER_21]: We really did want to.

940
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:33,966
[SPEAKER_21]: And some people don't know how to do searches on Airbnb, and they actually think that there are thousands of Airbnb units in the city, but they're not.

941
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:36,874
[SPEAKER_21]: But we were able to find one in Malden.

942
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,116
[SPEAKER_21]: All we were looking for was two units and a kitchen.

943
01:13:40,436 --> 01:13:41,757
[SPEAKER_21]: And we simply could not find that.

944
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:43,298
[SPEAKER_21]: This was an actual need.

945
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,579
[SPEAKER_21]: This isn't like some party.

946
01:13:45,419 --> 01:13:49,602
[SPEAKER_21]: And it wasn't here in the city where I wanted to stay in my own city during my creation.

947
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:50,643
[SPEAKER_21]: It was in Malden.

948
01:13:51,243 --> 01:13:53,284
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we may want to reflect upon that.

949
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:59,028
[SPEAKER_21]: There are many people that use Airbnb besides what we imagine are troublemakers partying.

950
01:13:59,168 --> 01:13:59,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

951
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:00,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

952
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else for public participation?

953
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:07,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Castagnetti.

954
01:14:07,497 --> 01:14:08,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, can I go first?

955
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:10,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on, Mr. Castagnetti.

956
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:11,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Advice isn't fair.

957
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:11,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

958
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,582
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna acknowledge what Mr. Paige Lieberman just said.

959
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:20,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's not targeting people who use Airbnb.

960
01:14:20,124 --> 01:14:25,348
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's obviously cases and situations where there's need for people to have short-term accommodations.

961
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:35,614
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's the question of, historically, until these app companies came in and said, oh, we're gonna make a premium off of people's homes, renting them out,

962
01:14:36,257 --> 01:14:49,604
[SPEAKER_17]: people stayed at hotels, which have regulations, they have specific security requirements, taxation requirements, there is a suites, I think it's a town place suites or some Marriott suites in Medford that has a kitchen and some bedrooms in it, right?

963
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:55,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, but while there are certainly reasonable and valid use cases, I think when you have a

964
01:14:57,142 --> 01:15:00,284
[SPEAKER_17]: there are people renting single family homes for $1,000 a night.

965
01:15:00,824 --> 01:15:12,252
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can make $360,000 a year, and maybe you won't rent it out every night, but say you rent it out half the nights, you can make $180,000 a year, why would you ever rent it long-term to a long-term tenant?

966
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:14,213
[SPEAKER_17]: You just wouldn't.

967
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:20,437
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I wouldn't do that, but if you're just buying property to speculate on and seek profit motive, if you can make $180,000 a year versus $40,000 a year,

968
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:28,264
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, someone who has that profit motive or chooses to speculate on the land and housing in our community.

969
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,492
[SPEAKER_17]: since we don't regulate it, they're gonna do that.

970
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:50,409
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just think that's, it's not about targeting the people who use Airbnbs, it's targeting the people who are buying housing and land in the city and turning it into micro hotels in neighborhoods that are unregulated because they can make an extra $100,000 a year off of land that should be used for people to live here, to live here.

971
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really more where I'm coming from on it.

972
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:53,772
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not one to,

973
01:15:56,772 --> 01:15:58,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Be mad that people are having fun.

974
01:15:58,332 --> 01:15:59,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I like having fun too.

975
01:16:00,093 --> 01:16:08,515
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just don't think that the landlord making $100,000 a year in profit by taking a housing unit away from a family who wants to live here should be able to do so.

976
01:16:09,115 --> 01:16:09,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

977
01:16:11,296 --> 01:16:13,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

978
01:16:15,797 --> 01:16:16,957
[SPEAKER_09]: The address for the record please.

979
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:21,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, President Andrew Castagnetti, Medford, Massachusetts.

980
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:25,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about this Airbnb business.

981
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:45,242
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I feel for Mr. Elliot Jockelson from Marshall street and all his neighbors who have to deal with all these different vehicles, maybe on a nightly basis, they should not be allowed to rent out a home, especially an absentee landlord.

982
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and they rented it as a hotel.

983
01:16:48,323 --> 01:16:50,844
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense to me.

984
01:16:50,864 --> 01:16:55,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is unjust to the, to the people that live in the neighborhood.

985
01:16:56,135 --> 01:17:24,632
[SPEAKER_04]: so uh I mean for lack of a better word um if one of your councils live next door to one of these hotels on a daily basis in a house it would really for lack of better english it would really suck plain english hopefully you have federal or state or local laws or local ordinances that you can uphold and have teeth because this should not go on it's not just

986
01:17:25,385 --> 01:17:26,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Marshall Street's problem.

987
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:28,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's many locations.

988
01:17:29,308 --> 01:17:30,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening.

989
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:31,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

990
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:33,572
[SPEAKER_05]: On that point, Madam President.

991
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:35,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

992
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:43,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to point out that we probably do have one of the strongest short-term rental ordinances in the region.

993
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's an issue about enforcement.

994
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:50,266
[SPEAKER_05]: To Mr. Castagnetti's question, this has been

995
01:17:51,821 --> 01:17:57,564
[SPEAKER_05]: reviewed at the state level extensively, and it's been determined that local municipalities can't ban them.

996
01:17:58,164 --> 01:18:01,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we can do is regulate them, but we can regulate them only to a certain extent.

997
01:18:02,466 --> 01:18:06,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've utilized our legislative power to do that to the fullest.

998
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:17,713
[SPEAKER_05]: The question now is, can the administration put the teeth that we gave them to good use, and be sure that our ordinance is enforced to the level that the taxpayers deserve?

999
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:21,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1000
01:18:21,966 --> 01:18:25,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else for public participation at this time?

1001
01:18:27,651 --> 01:18:30,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving to 23-393 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1002
01:18:31,615 --> 01:18:40,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the T Medford Disability Commission Parking Commission address the issue with the lack of handicapped parking at the Tufts T Station.

1003
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:41,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1004
01:18:41,685 --> 01:18:42,465
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

1005
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:43,406
[SPEAKER_23]: This is something

1006
01:18:44,957 --> 01:18:55,252
[SPEAKER_23]: I was brought to my attention by a young lady sitting in the audience there who made me aware that we have this brand new T stop and we have no handicapped parking there.

1007
01:18:55,753 --> 01:19:00,841
[SPEAKER_23]: I just assumed that there was parking and after she brought it to my attention, I went up there, I looked.

1008
01:19:01,608 --> 01:19:02,749
[SPEAKER_23]: And I see none.

1009
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:08,155
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we have our mayor who's the vice chairman of the Tea Advisory Board.

1010
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:14,081
[SPEAKER_23]: I would hope that the mayor will be on top of this and have spots put up there immediately.

1011
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:23,310
[SPEAKER_23]: And the other issue is all the tea workers park their cars there with the little tea badge in there, and our parking commission doesn't tag them.

1012
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:25,793
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't work.

1013
01:19:25,813 --> 01:19:29,096
[SPEAKER_23]: Parking's at a minimum at the best up there.

1014
01:19:29,176 --> 01:19:33,860
[SPEAKER_23]: T employees should find their own place to park or take the T to work, like everyone else.

1015
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:45,610
[SPEAKER_23]: And I say, I think the young lady may want to talk, but I say, I would hope that the disability director and the mayor, who's vice chair of the committee, immediately act on this, get some spots there immediately.

1016
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:46,530
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

1017
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1018
01:19:47,251 --> 01:19:47,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to speak?

1019
01:19:49,172 --> 01:19:50,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1020
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:53,888
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Anne Driscoll.

1021
01:19:54,268 --> 01:20:01,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I live at 77 Quincy Street in Medford, and it was worth coming just to hear Mr. Caraviello call me a young woman.

1022
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:13,052
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is a population being underserved by not having parking spaces at the Medford Tufts station, and that's the handicapped and the elderly.

1023
01:20:13,072 --> 01:20:18,093
[SPEAKER_15]: You may be aware that in the United States, 13.67 of the people are disabled,

1024
01:20:23,049 --> 01:20:24,129
[SPEAKER_15]: which is a more proper term.

1025
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:25,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Handicap means hand in your cap.

1026
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,230
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an outdated, but it's still on the signs.

1027
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:41,252
[SPEAKER_15]: That's an underestimation because to have a handicap, a placard for your car, you get a permanent placard or a temporary one.

1028
01:20:41,772 --> 01:20:48,254
[SPEAKER_15]: A permanent placard is for those who cannot walk 200 feet without needing to sit down.

1029
01:20:48,794 --> 01:20:50,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Those with heart conditions, elderly,

1030
01:20:51,249 --> 01:21:00,894
[SPEAKER_15]: A temporary is for those people that are disabled for more than two months, broken ankle, broken leg, perhaps cancer treatment.

1031
01:21:01,434 --> 01:21:04,795
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a segment of the population that's being very underserved.

1032
01:21:05,996 --> 01:21:16,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have been to the mayor and had... On May 12th, 2022, I've been bounced from department to department.

1033
01:21:16,641 --> 01:21:20,503
[SPEAKER_15]: No action has been taken until Mr. Caraviello graciously

1034
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:28,706
[SPEAKER_15]: met with me last Friday, and we discussed that and several other issues in which we are underserving our disability population.

1035
01:21:29,306 --> 01:21:44,358
[SPEAKER_15]: I am 79 years old, so I love being called the young one, a young lady, and we bought our first house in Medford at age 35, then had a rental unit in addition to family, and now we're into a downsized in Medford.

1036
01:21:44,778 --> 01:21:51,063
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're long-term Medford residents, and it's now in our older years, with, of course, my disabilities,

1037
01:21:51,564 --> 01:22:00,288
[SPEAKER_15]: that we need the services that would support us to make this a livable city for everyone.

1038
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:02,569
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've lived in the Tufts Hillside area.

1039
01:22:03,329 --> 01:22:13,893
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know the students and they can be daunting, but Tufts has always worked very well with the community.

1040
01:22:14,293 --> 01:22:17,415
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we call, they break up the 200 people parties.

1041
01:22:17,835 --> 01:22:20,756
[SPEAKER_15]: So Tufts, the fellow from Marshall Street

1042
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,905
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to say I sympathize with him because I recognize that overpopulation can really be a threat.

1043
01:22:27,305 --> 01:22:31,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why we moved five minutes away to Quincy Street.

1044
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:40,616
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think to be fair and to serve the entire population, we need not just to have one little handicapped parking spot.

1045
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:46,882
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to have a number because there are those people that have caretakers and they're bringing people.

1046
01:22:46,922 --> 01:22:49,524
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have been in a wheelchair and I have been

1047
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,302
[SPEAKER_15]: on crutches, and I have been using a walker.

1048
01:22:52,862 --> 01:23:01,149
[SPEAKER_15]: And to have an easy way to get to a doctor is important, it's critical.

1049
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:09,196
[SPEAKER_15]: And for heaven's sakes, our elderly and our disabled might like to just go sit on the Boston Common and enjoy the weather.

1050
01:23:09,496 --> 01:23:10,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for hearing me.

1051
01:23:11,317 --> 01:23:11,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1052
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:14,380
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

1053
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:20,332
[SPEAKER_23]: I think most of us were there at that grand opening of the T with much fanfare.

1054
01:23:20,372 --> 01:23:21,732
[SPEAKER_23]: The governor was there and everybody was there.

1055
01:23:21,773 --> 01:23:26,895
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't know how an issue of handicap parking got overlooked on there.

1056
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:31,017
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would say our mayor is the vice chair of the T Advisory Commission.

1057
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:39,101
[SPEAKER_23]: I would hope that, I don't know why this wasn't acted on sooner was this woman put it in in May, but now September.

1058
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:41,823
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1059
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:42,843
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry.

1060
01:23:42,863 --> 01:23:43,284
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize.

1061
01:23:43,304 --> 01:23:43,864
[SPEAKER_23]: May of last year.

1062
01:23:44,993 --> 01:23:50,239
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been over a year, and it's something that should have been rectified immediately.

1063
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:51,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1064
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:07,132
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, it's, I live a block away from Medford Tufts and, you know, honestly, it's, it's not a hard solution.

1065
01:24:07,472 --> 01:24:13,575
[SPEAKER_22]: There's, there's space on Boston Ave where you can put in handicap parking and there are garages in the neighborhood.

1066
01:24:13,756 --> 01:24:18,258
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a Tufts garage where people can, people who don't need that proximity can park at.

1067
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:28,665
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and so I would really hope that, um, the administration really work to, to make it, I, I just don't know how this got overlooked as well.

1068
01:24:29,025 --> 01:24:29,205
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1069
01:24:30,762 --> 01:24:31,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1070
01:24:32,924 --> 01:24:33,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1071
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:38,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I also just want to say thank you, Mr. Scullin, for working with Councilor Caraviello to raise this issue.

1072
01:24:39,228 --> 01:24:46,753
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry that it's taken you such a long time and been bounced from department to department to try to give voice to this issue.

1073
01:24:46,953 --> 01:25:00,403
[SPEAKER_20]: You speak very movingly about the need to, as a city and as working with our state agencies, to keep doing a better job of, you know, not always just catering to the average user, but centering people who are disabled, either temporarily or permanently,

1074
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:05,865
[SPEAKER_20]: All types of people need to get on the T, and this T station was built for all of us.

1075
01:25:05,905 --> 01:25:12,032
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for bringing this forward, and I'm sure that we're all going to stay on it to make sure that there are disabled parking spaces near this T station.

1076
01:25:12,132 --> 01:25:12,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1077
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:13,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1078
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:14,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

1079
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:15,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

1080
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:19,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Anne, for coming down and bringing this forward and for working with Councilor Caraviello on it.

1081
01:25:20,392 --> 01:25:36,716
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to propose an amendment to just add the traffic commission, because I believe the parking on Boston Ave is city-owned, so it would be the jurisdiction of the traffic commission, and a petition could go before them soon, and they could put the markings and signs out.

1082
01:25:36,776 --> 01:25:38,917
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it would be under their authority to put that out, so.

1083
01:25:39,537 --> 01:25:42,578
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Bears, if you drive by there, you'll see 8 to 10 cars

1084
01:25:44,081 --> 01:25:47,102
[SPEAKER_23]: that are parked there in our parking spots.

1085
01:25:47,663 --> 01:25:49,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I've seen that, and they're not paying.

1086
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:54,627
[SPEAKER_23]: With the T badges, and our parking department just ignores it.

1087
01:25:54,687 --> 01:25:58,229
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason I just want to add the Traffic Commission is because there's the two things here.

1088
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:12,558
[SPEAKER_17]: One is the Traffic Commission could mark those as handicapped spots at their next meeting, changing enforcement and requiring enforcement that, you know, we've had a lot of discussions about that tonight, haven't we?

1089
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:44,247
[SPEAKER_14]: a few different issues when it comes to our handicapped community and the lack of respect, whether they were having a city event and they're blocking handicap ramps or issues like what we're hearing tonight.

1090
01:26:44,307 --> 01:26:55,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, I know that the, I know that Neil Osborne used to have the position.

1091
01:26:57,409 --> 01:26:58,269
[SPEAKER_14]: is so frank.

1092
01:26:58,349 --> 01:27:02,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Has anybody can we actually make a motion to send that to Francis as well?

1093
01:27:02,852 --> 01:27:08,855
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this is an issue to with the Disability Act that it's not just the T issue.

1094
01:27:08,955 --> 01:27:13,357
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not, you know, a situation with with, uh,

1095
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:36,725
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, Todd Blake, but this is also something that legally that the city has to get involved in, and we can send, you know, our enforcement agency to look at that as soon as possible to see if something could be remedied sooner rather than later, because if we wait for the T, they'll be building a blue line going through Metro.

1096
01:27:36,905 --> 01:27:40,286
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could do that, I appreciate that.

1097
01:27:40,326 --> 01:27:40,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1098
01:27:41,787 --> 01:27:50,612
[SPEAKER_15]: The American Disability Act does require 20% parking for services for people that will need it that are disabled.

1099
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:51,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1100
01:27:52,413 --> 01:27:55,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And to echo my fellow counselors, thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this forward.

1101
01:27:55,555 --> 01:27:56,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Anne, for coming out for this.

1102
01:27:56,816 --> 01:28:10,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate just the background facts as well, because I think something that I've heard in one of these meetings that stuck with me is it's something that Americans with Disabilities is the largest minority group in the country, and it's the only minority group that you can join at any time.

1103
01:28:10,563 --> 01:28:12,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's something that it's not a niche issue.

1104
01:28:12,685 --> 01:28:16,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that affects every single one of us and every single one of us should be focused on.

1105
01:28:16,069 --> 01:28:23,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really appreciate you coming here tonight and reminding us once more of all the things that we may not see that are really impacting people's lives.

1106
01:28:23,677 --> 01:28:25,559
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully we can get this fixed.

1107
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Councilor Knight.

1108
01:28:29,265 --> 01:28:30,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1109
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:37,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I think moving forward as we go through our zoning reform, this is something we also might want to take a look at where the ADA requires a minimum of 20%.

1110
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:42,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's anything that could prevent us from requiring more than that, number one.

1111
01:28:43,054 --> 01:28:48,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, as we've established policies in this community as a council through zoning reform that's reduced

1112
01:28:49,077 --> 01:28:55,680
[SPEAKER_05]: the parking minimums in certain developments with that obviously would come a reduction in the number of parking for handicapped blackout holders.

1113
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:59,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, you know, an unintended consequence of policy change.

1114
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:01,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something that needs to be addressed.

1115
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:15,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a good way to approach that might be through our next round of zoning codification and maybe increasing the minimum number of parking spots that would be required or reserved for our disabled residents here in the community and elsewhere that are visiting our community.

1116
01:29:17,145 --> 01:29:17,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1117
01:29:18,526 --> 01:29:27,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Vice-Mayor Bears and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1118
01:29:37,377 --> 01:29:37,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1119
01:29:37,817 --> 01:29:38,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1120
01:29:38,197 --> 01:29:38,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1121
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:47,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1122
01:29:48,432 --> 01:29:48,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1123
01:29:48,672 --> 01:30:02,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if earners here and then I get the motion passes to 3.400 offered by Vice Affairs, whereas thousands of civil code violations are going on address each year due to underfunding and misallocation of city staffing resources for enforcement and inspections.

1124
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:10,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide a plan to increase civil code enforcement and inspection services staffing, either with new funding

1125
01:30:11,485 --> 01:30:21,951
[SPEAKER_09]: or by reallocating funding within or between the city's enforcement departments to match need, be it further resolve the city administration report on efforts to address numerous major code enforcement violations in the hillside neighborhood.

1126
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:23,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

1127
01:30:23,935 --> 01:30:28,898
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this has kind of become the theme of the night, so I'm happy to just kind of quickly move through this resolution.

1128
01:30:28,918 --> 01:30:31,720
[SPEAKER_17]: We can move to the specific resolution that Councilor Caraviello filed.

1129
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:48,053
[SPEAKER_17]: But really, the intent here is just to say that we need to have a discussion about code enforcement and inspectional services in the city, getting them the resources they need, putting that under the correct structure, because there's just tons of civil code violations happening all the time that are, you know, either going unaddressed or

1130
01:30:48,968 --> 01:30:54,234
[SPEAKER_17]: are overwhelming code enforcement or, you know, a lot of them are getting reported by residents.

1131
01:30:54,274 --> 01:31:03,284
[SPEAKER_17]: So if there isn't a resident in a place who knows how to report something, or doesn't have access to the systems or is new to the area, maybe that thing just never even gets to the people who can enforce it.

1132
01:31:04,574 --> 01:31:16,422
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's also the specific issues that I've definitely had communications from and have annual communications from folks in the Hillside neighborhood as it relates to Tufts University students and landlords.

1133
01:31:17,082 --> 01:31:18,944
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the intent of this resolution.

1134
01:31:19,924 --> 01:31:25,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy to move through it and have the discussion that folks are here to have on Councilor Caraviello's resolution.

1135
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:26,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1136
01:31:30,513 --> 01:31:31,875
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor Bailão, for bringing this forward.

1137
01:31:31,935 --> 01:31:37,241
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, for the last 12 years, I've been on code enforcement consistently.

1138
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:39,022
[SPEAKER_23]: It's nothing I have ever waived on.

1139
01:31:41,145 --> 01:31:46,931
[SPEAKER_23]: In the past two mayors, three mayors, I've always wanted more code enforcement.

1140
01:31:48,147 --> 01:31:52,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, I went up to the Board of Health the other day with a rat situation.

1141
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,491
[SPEAKER_23]: I was told that the inspector for rats was on vacation.

1142
01:31:55,571 --> 01:31:57,812
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll have to wait until she comes back.

1143
01:31:58,693 --> 01:31:59,973
[SPEAKER_23]: We only have one person doing rats.

1144
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:03,675
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, it's a systemic thing throughout the whole city.

1145
01:32:04,496 --> 01:32:05,696
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank you for bringing it forward.

1146
01:32:06,116 --> 01:32:09,918
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's something that needs to be really taken care of quickly.

1147
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:14,398
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank Vice President Meares for introducing this.

1148
01:32:14,899 --> 01:32:20,805
[SPEAKER_22]: I think tonight it really exemplifies why we need to invest more in our code enforcement.

1149
01:32:21,165 --> 01:32:23,969
[SPEAKER_22]: We need our laws to have some meaning.

1150
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:32,018
[SPEAKER_22]: This is also something I should note that the first budget I worked on here, the one

1151
01:32:33,459 --> 01:32:42,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess, in 2022, 2022, we, as a council and our Committee of the Whole sat down and advocated for more money put to code enforcement.

1152
01:32:42,567 --> 01:32:44,368
[SPEAKER_22]: That's something that we coordinated our efforts on.

1153
01:32:44,749 --> 01:32:54,077
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's, it would be, that's something that I know Councilor Caraviello and me were particularly passionate about in that meeting, in that Committee of the Whole meeting.

1154
01:32:54,677 --> 01:33:08,743
[SPEAKER_22]: in the upcoming budget season, no matter whatever the format or the makeup of the city council may look like after elections, I would really hope that the city council redoubles on its efforts to push for more code enforcement.

1155
01:33:11,405 --> 01:33:12,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1156
01:33:13,345 --> 01:33:17,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Susan Bair, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1157
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:31,420
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes, 23-405 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1158
01:33:39,045 --> 01:33:46,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it so resolved that city administration provide a written explanation as to why the city attorney defaulted on a court appearance related to 41 Emory Street proceedings.

1159
01:33:46,707 --> 01:33:56,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved the city administration provide the city council with all correspondences, communications, records, reports, and any materials related to the distressed property located at 41 Emory Street.

1160
01:33:57,309 --> 01:34:04,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the disability director have the owner remove the overgrowth as the sidewalk is impassable to wheelchairs, strollers, and pedestrians.

1161
01:34:05,211 --> 01:34:07,331
[SPEAKER_09]: access in the interest of public safety.

1162
01:34:07,691 --> 01:34:08,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1163
01:34:08,232 --> 01:34:08,872
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

1164
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:19,033
[SPEAKER_23]: Madam President, the person who lives next door reached out to us, reached out to the whole council to go by and look at the house and what was going on.

1165
01:34:19,073 --> 01:34:22,874
[SPEAKER_23]: So I had the opportunity to go over there last Thursday and meet with her.

1166
01:34:22,954 --> 01:34:24,934
[SPEAKER_23]: She gave me a little walk through the neighborhood.

1167
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:34,436
[SPEAKER_23]: And I was appalled to hear that our city of Medford took the homeowner of 41 Emery Street to court

1168
01:34:35,296 --> 01:34:37,218
[SPEAKER_23]: and we did not show up in court.

1169
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:50,630
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, we're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a law firm who couldn't even send the first year law student, a law associate to go to court and show up for us.

1170
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:52,812
[SPEAKER_23]: Shame, shame, shame, shame.

1171
01:34:53,532 --> 01:34:56,115
[SPEAKER_23]: Nevermind the overgrowth at this person's house.

1172
01:34:57,036 --> 01:34:59,538
[SPEAKER_23]: This house has been abandoned for a while, they know who the owner is.

1173
01:35:00,423 --> 01:35:04,665
[SPEAKER_23]: I know there was some work done on the property over the last weekend.

1174
01:35:05,025 --> 01:35:06,545
[SPEAKER_23]: It's still not acceptable to the owner.

1175
01:35:07,385 --> 01:35:09,346
[SPEAKER_23]: There's overgrowth all over the place.

1176
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:21,670
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not fair, again, similar to this gentleman's, but not fair to the people who live in that community that's been taken over by students for years, and it's not a new problem that this house is gone.

1177
01:35:24,211 --> 01:35:27,913
[SPEAKER_23]: left like that in this condition where you can't even walk down the sidewalk.

1178
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:33,315
[SPEAKER_23]: Never mind if someone had a stroller or someone had a wheelchair, impossible to get by there.

1179
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:39,558
[SPEAKER_23]: But again, shame on us for defaulting a court because they said they didn't have an attorney available.

1180
01:35:39,878 --> 01:35:43,360
[SPEAKER_23]: KP Law's got to have 50 lawyers in their office there.

1181
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,981
[SPEAKER_23]: Totally unacceptable, Madam President.

1182
01:35:47,181 --> 01:35:47,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1183
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:55,319
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I concur with Councilor Caraviello that that was perhaps the most shocking part of that email.

1184
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:06,153
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, why would we go schedule a court date without talking to Kate, without making sure that someone from KP Law would be there and without making sure that someone from our city would be there.

1185
01:36:07,293 --> 01:36:08,854
[SPEAKER_22]: It just doesn't make sense.

1186
01:36:09,274 --> 01:36:19,580
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this is something that would be inexplicable if you went to a law firm and asked them, you know, how are you scheduling your court hearings?

1187
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,201
[SPEAKER_22]: So I support this resolution.

1188
01:36:22,241 --> 01:36:25,283
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we need answers because this is unacceptable.

1189
01:36:25,403 --> 01:36:27,744
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, are there more cases of this, you know?

1190
01:36:28,605 --> 01:36:39,673
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's why I would want to amend, if you're so amenable, Councilor Caraviello-Velo, to ask also for a written explanation as to how we're going to prevent things like this from happening again.

1191
01:36:39,693 --> 01:36:53,203
[SPEAKER_22]: So a written explanation as to how the city of Medford will prevent defaults on court appearances from happening again.

1192
01:36:53,243 --> 01:36:54,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1193
01:36:54,204 --> 01:36:54,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1194
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:56,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

1195
01:36:59,209 --> 01:37:01,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it, but I told you so.

1196
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:09,355
[SPEAKER_14]: We had an opportunity this budget season to hold the mayor's feet to the fire, and we didn't do that.

1197
01:37:10,615 --> 01:37:13,177
[SPEAKER_14]: The answer to Councilor Tseng's resolution is very simple.

1198
01:37:13,637 --> 01:37:18,040
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor.

1199
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,622
[SPEAKER_14]: It's unheard of in the state of Massachusetts.

1200
01:37:22,438 --> 01:37:33,325
[SPEAKER_14]: the city of this size, not having a team of city solicitors representing the residents, the council, of this community.

1201
01:37:36,207 --> 01:37:39,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're finally getting some redacted bills.

1202
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:46,034
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was last month, maybe you can correct me, I believe it was over $100,000 K.P.

1203
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:46,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Law.

1204
01:37:46,995 --> 01:37:50,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe this month, last month that we just got, a slow month,

1205
01:37:51,877 --> 01:37:52,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was another $60,000.

1206
01:37:52,778 --> 01:37:54,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1207
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:01,582
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is money we're paying to a law firm that doesn't have to answer to us.

1208
01:38:05,084 --> 01:38:06,245
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is what's frustrating.

1209
01:38:06,265 --> 01:38:12,948
[SPEAKER_14]: These are basic necessities we need that every city needs to move forward.

1210
01:38:15,049 --> 01:38:17,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Even tonight, some of the resolutions we're going through, we're talking about

1211
01:38:18,786 --> 01:38:21,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm afraid to open my mouth because we have no legal representation.

1212
01:38:23,028 --> 01:38:28,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Because one one of our residents came up and said, Well, you're starting to pick on people.

1213
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:29,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't disagree with them.

1214
01:38:30,452 --> 01:38:39,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that we don't have legal guidance to say careful how you say this, because you could be sued, because that's happened to us.

1215
01:38:39,737 --> 01:38:40,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Did we not forget that?

1216
01:38:42,218 --> 01:38:44,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're still in court with it with the BJ situation.

1217
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:46,941
[SPEAKER_14]: So again,

1218
01:38:50,998 --> 01:38:51,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for bringing this up.

1219
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:57,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, for the neighbors, what's going on in that neighborhood is ridiculous.

1220
01:38:57,802 --> 01:39:12,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, again, the fact that we don't have code enforcement officers is another big issue, but we wouldn't know that because we couldn't discuss these issues at the budget hearing.

1221
01:39:15,732 --> 01:39:17,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the mayor got what she needed.

1222
01:39:18,193 --> 01:39:19,614
[SPEAKER_14]: She got her four votes.

1223
01:39:21,212 --> 01:39:25,653
[SPEAKER_14]: And now here we are again, bringing up these same things and sounding like a broken record.

1224
01:39:26,453 --> 01:39:36,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I will tell you, I, on the school committee, we realized we had the toughest mayor that negotiates in years, and Mike McGlynn.

1225
01:39:38,597 --> 01:39:46,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we needed things done for our school department, the school committee stood together and would not vote a budget until we got what we needed.

1226
01:39:50,137 --> 01:39:54,158
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know people don't like to hear this, but that's politics.

1227
01:39:54,718 --> 01:39:58,179
[SPEAKER_14]: That's part of the whole gamut of why we're here.

1228
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,940
[SPEAKER_14]: This mayor is doing whatever she wants to do.

1229
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:13,323
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't see any benefit for our community, whether it's neighbors with Airbnbs, or whether it's a simple question that people, no one's picking up the phone.

1230
01:40:17,133 --> 01:40:18,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm frustrated, yes.

1231
01:40:19,373 --> 01:40:23,174
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not as animated, because I think I'm getting tired of being so animated.

1232
01:40:23,654 --> 01:40:28,215
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, this is a very simple issue, very simple solution.

1233
01:40:28,955 --> 01:40:31,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Hire a city solicitor.

1234
01:40:32,716 --> 01:40:35,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Hire an assistant city solicitor.

1235
01:40:38,217 --> 01:40:41,117
[SPEAKER_14]: In most communities, that's like saying, breathe.

1236
01:40:44,318 --> 01:40:44,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1237
01:40:45,718 --> 01:40:46,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Pastor Garbelli.

1238
01:40:47,182 --> 01:40:48,603
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Caraviello.

1239
01:40:48,723 --> 01:40:56,108
[SPEAKER_23]: As Councilor Capelli mentioned, so we're just on two months, we're at $160,000 for two months.

1240
01:40:57,009 --> 01:41:00,311
[SPEAKER_23]: So the comment was made, well, we're not paying enough money.

1241
01:41:00,772 --> 01:41:03,493
[SPEAKER_23]: We're spending probably $800,000 to $900,000 a year on legal fees.

1242
01:41:07,824 --> 01:41:10,547
[SPEAKER_23]: We can hire a Supreme Court justice for half a million dollars.

1243
01:41:10,867 --> 01:41:20,637
[SPEAKER_23]: So don't tell me that there's no money to hire a solicitor or an assistant solicitor because we're spending way over budget on outside legal fees that could be done in-house.

1244
01:41:25,101 --> 01:41:25,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Collins.

1245
01:41:26,983 --> 01:41:27,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1246
01:41:31,356 --> 01:41:37,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate you bringing this up and I think that this, these two, this resolution and vice president beers is for it.

1247
01:41:38,705 --> 01:41:48,636
[SPEAKER_20]: They rhyme together because when you look at the experience of this particular household on Emory Street and I had the opportunity to speak with one of the neighbors there as well as with representatives from our Board of Health Department and

1248
01:41:49,457 --> 01:42:10,421
[SPEAKER_20]: There were a lot of details from this particular episode, which would not shock most people in the city who live with, you know, chronic code violations, you know, as a matter of course, but are still shocking to hear, you know, the way in which this particular, you know, quote unquote resolution was trying to be achieved to a truly unsatisfactory way, how much time it took.

1249
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:16,462
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're talking about the need to reallocate

1250
01:42:17,515 --> 01:42:21,360
[SPEAKER_20]: or find new resources to make sure that we're spending money where it's going to be meaningful for our residents.

1251
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:28,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Because currently, you know, I spoke to the Board of Health and they said, I think it was about a different household with a vermin problem.

1252
01:42:28,769 --> 01:42:30,171
[SPEAKER_20]: They said, you know, same thing that you heard.

1253
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:34,676
[SPEAKER_20]: The one inspector that we have for that in this apartment is out on vacation.

1254
01:42:34,756 --> 01:42:36,819
[SPEAKER_20]: And when she gets back, she will start to work through

1255
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:44,644
[SPEAKER_20]: the queue that has been amassing for her ever since she took her vacation, which I'm sure was extremely deserved because she's the only person doing this type of inspection in the entire city.

1256
01:42:46,385 --> 01:42:47,645
[SPEAKER_20]: No person is a superhero.

1257
01:42:47,766 --> 01:42:52,048
[SPEAKER_20]: This is an extremely severe misallocation of resources problem.

1258
01:42:52,228 --> 01:42:57,832
[SPEAKER_20]: And the downstream effect is that residents feel the lack of responsibility and the lack of communication.

1259
01:42:57,852 --> 01:43:01,574
[SPEAKER_20]: And they see their complaints going under investigated and unresolved.

1260
01:43:01,614 --> 01:43:03,915
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's not because our city staff are doing a bad job.

1261
01:43:04,696 --> 01:43:06,097
[SPEAKER_20]: It's because there just aren't enough of them.

1262
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:13,205
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know that we all feel that frustration day in and day out when we get these emails and calls, and we know that we feel it every meeting.

1263
01:43:14,046 --> 01:43:14,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1264
01:43:15,247 --> 01:43:15,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1265
01:43:15,987 --> 01:43:25,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And to that point, we did get a email earlier today from the Director of the Board of Health, Mary O'Connor, saying that she would be back by the property tomorrow, understanding that it wasn't cleaned up in a satisfactory way.

1266
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:27,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to you, Councilor Knight.

1267
01:43:30,398 --> 01:43:31,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1268
01:43:36,471 --> 01:43:59,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I am at a loss sitting here hearing that after the amount of money that we spent on outside council, that represents the mayor personally and not the city of Medford, an amount of money is some of the totals close to a half a million dollars.

1269
01:44:03,175 --> 01:44:14,365
[SPEAKER_05]: over $450,000 we spent on KP Law's legal fees in what appears to be violation of city ordinance, Madam Mayor, Madam President.

1270
01:44:14,545 --> 01:44:19,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, I'm calling you Madam Mayor, because I'm just wishing it would be somebody else, but the one that's in there.

1271
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:29,018
[SPEAKER_05]: When I think about this, Madam President, it makes me crazy, because for three years, I feel like I was talking in an echo chamber.

1272
01:44:29,767 --> 01:44:31,329
[SPEAKER_05]: saying we need to hire a city solicitor.

1273
01:44:31,429 --> 01:44:32,310
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a city solicitor.

1274
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:33,591
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to hire a city solicitor.

1275
01:44:33,791 --> 01:44:34,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We still don't have a city solicitor.

1276
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:39,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, we have a private law firm that we paid a half a million dollars to.

1277
01:44:40,097 --> 01:44:43,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too busy to go to court and represent the interests of this community.

1278
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:46,984
[SPEAKER_05]: That shows you where their priorities lay.

1279
01:44:49,807 --> 01:44:53,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It also shows you how inept this administration is.

1280
01:44:54,645 --> 01:44:57,588
[SPEAKER_05]: when it comes to the deliverance of basic city services, number one.

1281
01:44:58,108 --> 01:45:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And number two, the protection of the taxpayers' interests when it comes to having in-house legal counsel that represents the taxpayer and not the corner office.

1282
01:45:07,697 --> 01:45:13,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we are again, two months after the budget passed, asking for more money for a code enforcement office.

1283
01:45:13,643 --> 01:45:19,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we had an opportunity, when we had an opportunity to hold up a budget and get what we needed, number one.

1284
01:45:19,788 --> 01:45:20,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two,

1285
01:45:20,891 --> 01:45:27,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're coming off the heels of a budget where the mayor said she was gonna hire a solicitor and an assistant city solicitor for the council and never did.

1286
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:32,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfulfilled promises, Madam President.

1287
01:45:33,739 --> 01:45:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfulfilled promises.

1288
01:45:37,301 --> 01:45:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been the number one issue, the number one underlying theme throughout this past term for this council is where is our legal representation?

1289
01:45:47,727 --> 01:45:49,108
[SPEAKER_05]: We're driving a ship without a compass.

1290
01:45:50,615 --> 01:45:53,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going into uncharted territory, and we need guidance.

1291
01:45:53,938 --> 01:45:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Please help us.

1292
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:56,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Please help us.

1293
01:45:58,141 --> 01:46:01,223
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the council asking, and the council gets ignored.

1294
01:46:03,685 --> 01:46:05,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Madam President, we have residents asking.

1295
01:46:07,047 --> 01:46:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying, please help us.

1296
01:46:08,549 --> 01:46:09,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Please help us.

1297
01:46:09,409 --> 01:46:10,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're now being ignored.

1298
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:18,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And KP law is defaulting on court appearances that they filed, that they filed.

1299
01:46:20,046 --> 01:46:38,880
[SPEAKER_05]: KP law is directing the board of health not to put clean it and lean it notices on homes after the council is directing them to do so because such levels of dissatisfaction in the public administration of the enforcement of code.

1300
01:46:40,422 --> 01:46:42,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, we can put the record on repeat.

1301
01:46:42,904 --> 01:46:49,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam president, here we are again, the same spot we were 12 months ago, the same ones we were the same spot we were 12 months before that.

1302
01:46:50,552 --> 01:46:56,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I sit here and I scratch my head every day and I say, let's name one thing the city does well.

1303
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:00,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's name one thing.

1304
01:47:03,462 --> 01:47:08,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Our school test scores are down about eight, 9% across the board in the last three years.

1305
01:47:10,067 --> 01:47:11,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Our city streets look awful.

1306
01:47:12,209 --> 01:47:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Our sidewalks look terrible.

1307
01:47:14,411 --> 01:47:15,812
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get trees trimmed.

1308
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:17,073
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get stumps removed.

1309
01:47:17,822 --> 01:47:19,343
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get crosswalks repainted.

1310
01:47:19,744 --> 01:47:20,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get 3-3 paved.

1311
01:47:23,326 --> 01:47:26,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The only saving grace we have in this community is we pick up that phone and dial 9-1-1.

1312
01:47:26,969 --> 01:47:35,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that the police and the fire are always going to show up with or without a contract for 700 plus days.

1313
01:47:37,677 --> 01:47:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I sit here and I reflect on what's going on in this community and I ask myself, what are we doing well?

1314
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:44,923
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we doing well?

1315
01:47:45,343 --> 01:47:47,525
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the hottest questions I have to struggle with every day.

1316
01:47:48,598 --> 01:47:52,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I look around, I don't see anything that we're doing well, that we're exceeding at, that we're excelling at.

1317
01:47:52,641 --> 01:47:59,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see anything that's putting Medford on the forefront, that's keeping Medford where it was.

1318
01:48:02,469 --> 01:48:11,175
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years ago when I got elected, Medford was the hottest zip code in Massachusetts because of its large inventory of single family homes and its small class sizes.

1319
01:48:12,516 --> 01:48:13,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, how times have changed.

1320
01:48:14,218 --> 01:48:15,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, how times have changed, Madam President.

1321
01:48:18,766 --> 01:48:20,427
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a community that's losing its identity.

1322
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:26,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And pretty soon we're going to be swallowed up and become just a pocket of Boston.

1323
01:48:28,733 --> 01:48:31,475
[SPEAKER_05]: The zoning reform that's coming up is going to be very important to us.

1324
01:48:32,355 --> 01:48:37,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope the mayor keeps her word this time around and provides us with the tools necessary to succeed.

1325
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:43,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, I feel as though the city is not in a strong position for now or for the future.

1326
01:48:43,063 --> 01:48:44,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1327
01:48:45,925 --> 01:48:46,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1328
01:48:48,951 --> 01:48:49,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1329
01:48:54,754 --> 01:48:56,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

1330
01:48:56,315 --> 01:48:59,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can hit that button if it's, there you go.

1331
01:48:59,597 --> 01:49:01,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, sorry, maybe they, there you go.

1332
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:04,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Narelle Marr, 39 Emory Street.

1333
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,441
[SPEAKER_24]: Michael Marr, 39 Emory.

1334
01:49:08,282 --> 01:49:13,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to address the issue at 39 Emory Street.

1335
01:49:13,164 --> 01:49:16,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, there's, you guys all got my email.

1336
01:49:16,426 --> 01:49:17,587
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on there.

1337
01:49:18,186 --> 01:49:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not a new issue.

1338
01:49:19,627 --> 01:49:20,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been going on.

1339
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:23,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I just looked through my records.

1340
01:49:23,811 --> 01:49:27,214
[SPEAKER_02]: 2011 is the first time I emailed the city council about it.

1341
01:49:28,074 --> 01:49:32,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, there is no enforcement.

1342
01:49:32,878 --> 01:49:40,445
[SPEAKER_02]: There hasn't been any enforcement and people get up in arms and talk about enforcement, but it just doesn't get done.

1343
01:49:41,085 --> 01:49:41,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So I heard

1344
01:49:42,213 --> 01:49:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: the enforcement issue come up many times today.

1345
01:49:46,576 --> 01:49:49,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also heard the rat issue come up.

1346
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two really important issues that need to be funded.

1347
01:49:59,186 --> 01:50:00,907
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I mean, it's 20 years ago.

1348
01:50:00,967 --> 01:50:02,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Just lean towards the mic.

1349
01:50:03,309 --> 01:50:09,914
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, City Solicitor 20 years ago, we had Mayor McGlynn and we're living in the exact same neighborhood today that we had 20 years ago.

1350
01:50:09,974 --> 01:50:10,975
[SPEAKER_24]: We've been fighting this fight

1351
01:50:11,721 --> 01:50:19,548
[SPEAKER_24]: We have landlords, absentee landlords that come in, buy a property, walk away and rent overcrowd, do not take care of anything.

1352
01:50:19,668 --> 01:50:28,195
[SPEAKER_24]: And the more that this happens, the more of the good people like Rich and Tracy, Rhonda Randy, ourselves, we're gonna move out.

1353
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:31,497
[SPEAKER_24]: I could make a fortune on my house renting to students, but we don't.

1354
01:50:32,838 --> 01:50:40,185
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're here again, just asking for the help of the city to step up for the good people, because if you don't, you're gonna get more of the difficult people.

1355
01:50:41,064 --> 01:50:42,465
[SPEAKER_24]: So really could use your help.

1356
01:50:44,527 --> 01:50:52,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the discussion from the council versus affairs.

1357
01:50:52,874 --> 01:50:57,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, I just want to say to the points that you made, you know,

1358
01:50:59,124 --> 01:51:01,425
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been fighting the same fight for a long time.

1359
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:03,587
[SPEAKER_17]: You haven't seen the enforcement.

1360
01:51:03,807 --> 01:51:07,369
[SPEAKER_17]: It's because the enforcement hasn't been funded the whole time.

1361
01:51:07,889 --> 01:51:09,510
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's fundamentally the question.

1362
01:51:10,231 --> 01:51:13,793
[SPEAKER_17]: This council doesn't have the ability to increase funding for anything by a single dollar.

1363
01:51:14,173 --> 01:51:16,414
[SPEAKER_17]: All we can do once a year is cut.

1364
01:51:16,855 --> 01:51:18,276
[SPEAKER_17]: We can take more away.

1365
01:51:18,676 --> 01:51:20,497
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the only power the city charter gives us.

1366
01:51:21,257 --> 01:51:26,000
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know I've communicated with all of you here about that.

1367
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:30,613
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad you're voicing the issue again.

1368
01:51:30,653 --> 01:51:32,197
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad we're setting resolutions up.

1369
01:51:32,598 --> 01:51:34,362
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure we'll get responses eventually.

1370
01:51:34,382 --> 01:51:39,392
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an incredibly difficult position to sit here and say,

1371
01:51:40,646 --> 01:51:46,450
[SPEAKER_17]: here you say can you help us and me basically have to think, and I'm just going to voice it now and say, functionally no.

1372
01:51:47,211 --> 01:52:03,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, you've come up and you've asked the Council for 10 years for help, and it's the same charter and different members of the Council completely right, you could say people love the Council 10 years ago and they hate me and you know whatever completely different Council, same issues, and quite frankly it's going to be the same response because this Council whether it's

1373
01:52:04,295 --> 01:52:10,398
[SPEAKER_17]: the people here now or the people here 12 years ago, neither of those councils could raise any funding for any department by a single dollar.

1374
01:52:11,138 --> 01:52:12,439
[SPEAKER_17]: That power only lies with the mayor.

1375
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:21,663
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sorry that we can't do more for you to help you other than try to be advocates from the position that we're in.

1376
01:52:21,683 --> 01:52:27,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1377
01:52:27,566 --> 01:52:30,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question regarding enforcement.

1378
01:52:30,287 --> 01:52:32,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Does an enforcement create revenue?

1379
01:52:32,748 --> 01:52:38,690
[SPEAKER_24]: If you start going after, as soon as you started enforcing some of the fines on some of these landlords, things changed.

1380
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:42,811
[SPEAKER_24]: So the money would come in if you enforce it like a revolving door there.

1381
01:52:42,991 --> 01:52:48,872
[SPEAKER_24]: You lay out the fines on parking, lay out the fines on absentee landlords and money comes in and helps pay for the enforcement.

1382
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:56,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Work with Tufts, maybe Tufts can help up because they are providing the students or good kids, but for the most part, they're creating havoc in our neighborhoods.

1383
01:52:56,134 --> 01:52:58,935
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe Tufts can help out for our particular part of the neighborhoods.

1384
01:52:59,707 --> 01:53:00,448
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a revolving thing.

1385
01:53:00,508 --> 01:53:01,429
[SPEAKER_24]: I would assume so.

1386
01:53:01,509 --> 01:53:03,250
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe it's not, but that's what I was hoping.

1387
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:08,415
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I don't know if other counselors have haven't answered the question.

1388
01:53:09,036 --> 01:53:11,098
[SPEAKER_17]: My understanding is that other than the parking

1389
01:53:12,349 --> 01:53:13,130
[SPEAKER_17]: parking and permitting.

1390
01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:17,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't seen civil code enforcement violations as a major source of revenue for the city.

1391
01:53:17,654 --> 01:53:22,359
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if that's because it actually costs more to send people out to enforce it than we're allowed to fine.

1392
01:53:22,759 --> 01:53:30,006
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're limited at our maximum to $300 per issuance on the fine by state law, 350 maybe.

1393
01:53:30,026 --> 01:53:33,029
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know the answer to your question is all I'm saying.

1394
01:53:34,414 --> 01:53:35,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1395
01:53:35,315 --> 01:53:38,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor say Councilor bears is understanding is my understanding as well.

1396
01:53:40,258 --> 01:53:50,544
[SPEAKER_22]: Given our limits on how much we can charge violations and fine for violations and given the, I mean, it could be that we're just we haven't done it so we don't know but

1397
01:53:51,424 --> 01:53:57,629
[SPEAKER_22]: realistically, given the number of possible violations out there, probably would not amount to a full-time salary for the position.

1398
01:53:57,649 --> 01:53:59,790
[SPEAKER_22]: But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be investing in that.

1399
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:01,031
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we should be doing that.

1400
01:54:01,572 --> 01:54:17,783
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I would definitely say in the next budget process, no matter who's mayor, who's not sitting on this side of the rail, that we come up to residents, like you come up to the city council and advocate for more funding for code enforcement and more hiring, more staff in that aspect.

1401
01:54:19,554 --> 01:54:36,561
[SPEAKER_22]: To the rodent point, we passed a resolution two weeks ago from Councilor Scarpelli, asking us to sit down with the Mayor, with the Director of Public Health of the Board of Health on the rat issue to talk about solutions.

1402
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:42,323
[SPEAKER_22]: I've mentioned in email to you folks about some of the things that the resolutions that we've passed on our end.

1403
01:54:43,263 --> 01:54:44,724
[SPEAKER_22]: as another enforcement issue.

1404
01:54:45,924 --> 01:54:48,805
[SPEAKER_22]: We have strengthened our ordinances with regards to that as well.

1405
01:54:49,505 --> 01:54:50,825
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to think of what else.

1406
01:54:51,646 --> 01:54:57,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, we need to be working with Tufts, as you guys have said.

1407
01:54:58,288 --> 01:55:04,670
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure the students are well-intentioned, but there's a lot that they don't know with regards to some of the kind of

1408
01:55:05,771 --> 01:55:07,792
[SPEAKER_22]: quality of life issues that they're causing in the neighborhoods.

1409
01:55:08,353 --> 01:55:15,778
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I think we need better communication with cops, better, more pressure on cops to, to have them communicate better, to have them enforce better.

1410
01:55:16,438 --> 01:55:24,243
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, we need to relook at our community benefits, um, with them as well, relook at the pilots because they don't pay property taxes.

1411
01:55:24,303 --> 01:55:24,504
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1412
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:30,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but we, we need to leverage that to, to have better pilot agreements with them as well.

1413
01:55:30,227 --> 01:55:33,570
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think the enforcement aspect could be something that we talked about.

1414
01:55:37,516 --> 01:55:38,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1415
01:55:39,217 --> 01:55:50,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually Tufts through their development has agreed with the city to pay taxes, property taxes, I believe in all the new purchases of land and I've done so for over a decade now.

1416
01:55:50,881 --> 01:55:58,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think Madam President that the most moving thing that was said tonight was take care of the good people because if you don't, you're going to lose them.

1417
01:55:58,704 --> 01:56:00,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just going to get more of the bad.

1418
01:56:03,254 --> 01:56:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that was the most moving thing that was said this evening.

1419
01:56:06,057 --> 01:56:07,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care of the good people.

1420
01:56:07,079 --> 01:56:08,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the good people some help.

1421
01:56:08,749 --> 01:56:09,950
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's all they're asking for.

1422
01:56:10,990 --> 01:56:12,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate the gentleman.

1423
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:13,732
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that really resonated with me.

1424
01:56:14,572 --> 01:56:16,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, you know, we all know what we need to do.

1425
01:56:17,113 --> 01:56:18,374
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get action on this.

1426
01:56:18,534 --> 01:56:24,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to hold the administration accountable for their failures and delivering the basic public services that these people deserve.

1427
01:56:24,457 --> 01:56:33,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't understand why we don't have a program or a maintenance plan or a review plan where we go out to these distressed properties, which we know we've had problems with.

1428
01:56:34,088 --> 01:56:38,653
[SPEAKER_05]: year after year and do a spot check once every 6, 8 or 12 months.

1429
01:56:39,154 --> 01:56:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's basic, basic, basic stuff.

1430
01:56:41,697 --> 01:56:46,523
[SPEAKER_05]: The person that's answering the phone knows the phone's gonna, knows they're gonna get the phone call and when they see who it is that's calling them,

1431
01:56:47,594 --> 01:56:48,575
[SPEAKER_05]: know exactly what it's about.

1432
01:56:48,615 --> 01:56:50,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gotten to that point with people in this community.

1433
01:56:51,817 --> 01:57:11,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't understand why we can't take a couple of steps and be a little bit more proactive and have an outreach program where, you know, when we know we have these distressed properties and these properties that are failing to do right by the neighborhood, that we don't go out there and do a little bit of outreach and preventative maintenance, as they like to say, to prevent this from happening and rising to this level of frustration.

1434
01:57:13,666 --> 01:57:14,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1435
01:57:15,007 --> 01:57:16,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

1436
01:57:17,328 --> 01:57:21,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's time to maybe make a motion that we become a little creative.

1437
01:57:22,071 --> 01:57:42,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that working with the building department, the inspectional service department, maybe working with the unions, maybe we ask the city administration and the mayor to sit down with those unions like they do with the police department and bring in retired police officers and maybe pay them to actively

1438
01:57:43,624 --> 01:57:48,708
[SPEAKER_14]: to go out and do, you know, assist with the code enforcement.

1439
01:57:49,468 --> 01:57:57,594
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, especially with our retired police officers, I think that might be an opportunity that we can think outside the box.

1440
01:57:57,955 --> 01:58:08,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, other communities use grant writers, bringing in grant writers and use grants that they would write to bring in money to our community and pay them through that.

1441
01:58:09,483 --> 01:58:12,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe there's an avenue there that they, you know, having some incentive that

1442
01:58:13,266 --> 01:58:35,961
[SPEAKER_14]: we can, you know, do a few things at once where we're sending more people out, qualified people out, to understand our code enforcement and start, like our neighbor said, is start policing it better and giving them the avenues that we haven't given them at budget time.

1443
01:58:38,356 --> 01:58:53,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to make that form of motion that we ask the mayor administration to look into that process to try to immediately enhance the code enforcement office, both with the health department and the building department.

1444
01:58:54,043 --> 01:58:54,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

1445
01:58:57,224 --> 01:58:59,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1446
01:59:10,422 --> 01:59:11,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Castagnetti.

1447
01:59:15,906 --> 01:59:16,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1448
01:59:17,427 --> 01:59:18,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1449
01:59:19,048 --> 01:59:19,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1450
01:59:21,669 --> 01:59:22,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we on?

1451
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:23,531
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear you.

1452
01:59:23,551 --> 01:59:24,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1453
01:59:25,032 --> 01:59:25,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1454
01:59:26,453 --> 01:59:39,101
[SPEAKER_04]: With all due respect to our city council at night, I disagree because this city does one thing really, really well.

1455
01:59:39,989 --> 01:59:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is collecting our real estate taxes.

1456
01:59:45,352 --> 01:59:51,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, is it time to adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C?

1457
01:59:51,856 --> 02:00:03,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So the owner-occupied exemption will go to the homeowners who live in their home, and our savings will be shifted to those absentee landowners, house owners.

1458
02:00:04,282 --> 02:00:08,905
[SPEAKER_04]: On my street alone is three, Winchester, Andover, and Wellesley.

1459
02:00:10,342 --> 02:00:11,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's time.

1460
02:00:11,223 --> 02:00:14,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening.

1461
02:00:16,567 --> 02:00:17,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1462
02:00:17,988 --> 02:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.

1463
02:00:19,108 --> 02:00:20,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 116 Forestry.

1464
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a couple of questions and then maybe a couple of suggestions.

1465
02:00:26,714 --> 02:00:33,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears stated that the revenue from the parking is the only revenue that

1466
02:00:34,574 --> 02:00:43,165
[SPEAKER_07]: fees that has the most, but I have not been able to see or find in the budget the actual amount of money that we get from parking fees.

1467
02:00:43,266 --> 02:00:51,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen the cost it is to support our parking department, which is four people, and I've seen the revenue generated from our excise taxes.

1468
02:00:52,312 --> 02:00:55,834
[SPEAKER_07]: but I've not seen any breakout of revenue from our parking.

1469
02:00:56,074 --> 02:00:59,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a question, I don't even know if we're making any money off of that.

1470
02:00:59,735 --> 02:01:00,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That was delivered to the council.

1471
02:01:00,976 --> 02:01:02,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the budget, I couldn't find it.

1472
02:01:03,277 --> 02:01:04,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it wasn't in the budget.

1473
02:01:04,458 --> 02:01:04,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1474
02:01:04,918 --> 02:01:08,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it was referenced during a meeting, so we can get that to you.

1475
02:01:08,379 --> 02:01:10,961
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of issues with how the budget is formatted by the mayor.

1476
02:01:10,981 --> 02:01:12,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

1477
02:01:14,562 --> 02:01:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I was going to mention was it's building off of,

1478
02:01:19,703 --> 02:01:31,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli is pilot programs, working with Tufts and our other nonprofits and helping with a lot of the code enforcement and getting some restitution or help in that situation.

1479
02:01:32,252 --> 02:01:32,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also,

1480
02:01:34,164 --> 02:01:44,326
[SPEAKER_07]: my understanding, and I could be wrong with how I read the budget, but isn't there $25 million put aside with the fact that the mayor only wanted 10% of our full budget?

1481
02:01:44,466 --> 02:01:52,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I read that budget correctly, that means she wanted to put about 14 million aside for a rainy fund, but that's still money that's left over, no?

1482
02:01:53,708 --> 02:02:01,850
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't access it right now, because we can't access it again until it's free cash and certified, which is not until next year, end of this year?

1483
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:02,910
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it would work.

1484
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:06,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so yeah, maybe it's yeah, October, November.

1485
02:02:06,052 --> 02:02:09,855
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, but we can't access that money currently, currently.

1486
02:02:09,995 --> 02:02:12,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But you said October, November, November.

1487
02:02:12,517 --> 02:02:14,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not that far away.

1488
02:02:14,038 --> 02:02:15,980
[SPEAKER_17]: We still get access.

1489
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:18,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Only the mayor can ask it to be spent, right?

1490
02:02:18,582 --> 02:02:26,288
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys don't have authority to ask to be sent, but you can recommend to the mayor that she make adjustments in the budget to enforce codes.

1491
02:02:27,168 --> 02:02:28,949
[SPEAKER_07]: in ordinances, is that correct?

1492
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:31,351
[SPEAKER_17]: We nominally have yes.

1493
02:02:32,953 --> 02:02:34,674
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds beautiful.

1494
02:02:34,794 --> 02:02:35,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1495
02:02:36,075 --> 02:02:40,058
[SPEAKER_17]: We've made a lot of recommendations.

1496
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:40,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1497
02:02:40,559 --> 02:02:48,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So then in other words, then the citizens really need to get on her in residence of Medford to ask her to really push for this, but all right.

1498
02:02:48,225 --> 02:02:49,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for answering my questions.

1499
02:02:49,286 --> 02:02:49,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1500
02:02:50,006 --> 02:02:50,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1501
02:02:52,027 --> 02:03:03,514
[SPEAKER_17]: even if we use free cash reserves, which are basically just the reserves of the city for one time enforcement, they're one time funds, so wouldn't be hiring a permanent code enforcement officer if we use those reserves.

1502
02:03:04,795 --> 02:03:12,720
[SPEAKER_17]: So it really is this longer term, bigger question of, are we funding enforcement in the city correctly?

1503
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:18,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello's sixth term and every term, I think his answer has been, no, we're not.

1504
02:03:18,123 --> 02:03:20,625
[SPEAKER_17]: And he constantly is recommending every budget

1505
02:03:21,095 --> 02:03:25,277
[SPEAKER_17]: under three mayors, if I'm correct, to change that.

1506
02:03:26,078 --> 02:03:50,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Fundamentally, and Councilor I talked about earlier, I think we've all talked about it earlier, whether it's reallocating funding, reorganizing divisions, organizing a more proactive enforcement to bring in enough revenue to support the department or using funds, finding new revenue sources to fund it, whatever option we pick on any of those things, that is the administration of the city and that's under the executive

1507
02:03:51,087 --> 02:03:51,447
[SPEAKER_17]: branch.

1508
02:03:51,707 --> 02:03:53,208
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are the legislative branch.

1509
02:03:53,768 --> 02:04:05,291
[SPEAKER_17]: And under our current charter, we don't have the authority to order, you know, maybe maybe we could pass an ordinance to say we reorganizing inspectional services, but I'm not necessarily even sure that the mayor has to follow that, right?

1510
02:04:05,391 --> 02:04:11,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, as we've noted tonight, we have an ordinance saying we will have a city solicitor, we haven't had a city solicitor for what 30 months.

1511
02:04:11,833 --> 02:04:12,113
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's

1512
02:04:16,178 --> 02:04:28,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's just an incredibly frustrating situation to sit here and be trying to voice and engage and and work with residents to come up with to voice have hear residents voice in their concerns and difficulties and wanting to see the city become a better place.

1513
02:04:29,648 --> 02:04:41,016
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition to, I agree that we do collect the property tax I would say the other thing that we as a city to effectively is this city council for the two terms that I've been on it has passed a lot of good ordinances.

1514
02:04:41,696 --> 02:04:53,841
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done a lot of good legislating we passed the road and control ordinance we passed the zoning ordinance on short term rental, we've tried to pass things giving code enforcement clear authority we've passed are working closely to pass a new waste ordinance right.

1515
02:04:54,341 --> 02:05:00,444
[SPEAKER_17]: And we passed all these ordinances, and the staffing isn't there or the, you know, for whatever reason.

1516
02:05:01,264 --> 02:05:27,679
[SPEAKER_17]: the administration doesn't enforce those ordinances to the letter, and that is where the difficulty comes in, is we can pass the strongest and as many ordinances as we want, but if they don't get enforced by the mayor and her team, or the mayor doesn't come to us and say, I need more resources to enforce this ordinance, then we end up where we are, which is passing good ordinances that then don't get the follow-through that they need.

1517
02:05:27,699 --> 02:05:27,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1518
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:43,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to commend my council colleague for suggesting that we move to supplement our code enforcement staff with the use of, whether it be retired police officers, was it, Councilor?

1519
02:05:46,945 --> 02:05:47,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Or code enforcement?

1520
02:05:49,226 --> 02:05:59,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, I think anybody that can be trained for that, Councilor Knight, that works with the union and the code enforcement department right now that can do something that

1521
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:04,601
[SPEAKER_14]: can assist with these concerns and issues so we get ahead of it.

1522
02:06:05,482 --> 02:06:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great idea, especially when you look at how human resources in this community is handled.

1523
02:06:12,547 --> 02:06:14,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how many times have we had per diem department heads?

1524
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:17,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a per diem assessor, right?

1525
02:06:18,292 --> 02:06:19,713
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a per diem building commissioner.

1526
02:06:20,313 --> 02:06:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a per diem veteran services director.

1527
02:06:23,676 --> 02:06:24,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't we do that with code?

1528
02:06:26,638 --> 02:06:28,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a great idea to me.

1529
02:06:32,028 --> 02:06:32,230
Thank you.

1530
02:06:32,452 --> 02:06:33,037
Tessa Collins.

1531
02:06:34,565 --> 02:06:35,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1532
02:06:37,126 --> 02:06:44,348
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate this discussion and I always find it, I'm always gratified we have the opportunity to make it clear.

1533
02:06:44,428 --> 02:06:56,011
[SPEAKER_20]: I think for the benefit of residents and knowing how to navigate our government, what specifically the powers of this council are and on what matters, we have to be advocates.

1534
02:06:56,071 --> 02:06:58,532
[SPEAKER_20]: And sometimes being the role of an advocate can be very gratifying.

1535
02:06:58,572 --> 02:07:03,373
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we've talked a lot about different ways of addressing this enforcement problem.

1536
02:07:04,093 --> 02:07:18,666
[SPEAKER_20]: Throughout this meeting we've talked about you know the resolutions that are out because we've talked about we've tried to do in budget seasons, we've talked about convening a meeting with the building department and code enforcement and dpw and the mayor's office to talk about how can we address this from multiple angles we've talked about.

1537
02:07:20,026 --> 02:07:28,311
[SPEAKER_20]: better allocating revenue to better fund these specific departments that we know need to be at least doubled, it seems like, if not more so.

1538
02:07:28,331 --> 02:07:32,594
[SPEAKER_20]: I also really appreciate bringing up pilot, you know, pilot agreements.

1539
02:07:32,894 --> 02:07:38,517
[SPEAKER_20]: I, you know, as a Tufts alum myself, I feel like it needs to be, I try to say as often as possible,

1540
02:07:39,978 --> 02:07:55,782
[SPEAKER_20]: This is specifically an area because the neighborhoods that that affects that Tufts puts a lot of I would call, you know, abstract or immaterial things into its pilot agreement with the city, and we have existing material needs that are going on that that are exacerbated by the presence of the university for all the good that it does.

1541
02:07:56,182 --> 02:08:02,184
[SPEAKER_20]: This is another issue where I think it's one where this council, what if it could would make direct appropriations more directly.

1542
02:08:03,084 --> 02:08:30,325
[SPEAKER_20]: help with these problems, and in a lot of cases we can't do those things, you know, just like making resolutions to advocate in the budget for allocations that should be made to put more resources into code enforcement and whatever else we need to start meeting residents' needs, you know, I would love to see us build up a process like that with PILOT as well, so that it's more related to the actual needs going unmet in this community, and not

1543
02:08:30,945 --> 02:08:36,068
[SPEAKER_20]: these, you know, less than immediately relevant community functions.

1544
02:08:36,908 --> 02:08:47,213
[SPEAKER_20]: When, you know, I mean, we've been talking about code enforcement for feels like five hours, you know, it can go on all week just talking about code enforcement with the issues that get brought up to us.

1545
02:08:48,854 --> 02:09:00,119
[SPEAKER_20]: So I, I appreciate all the energy around coming to this issue from a lot of different angles, I think that we need to advocate for all of it, you know, the stuff that we can do directly legislatively,

1546
02:09:00,964 --> 02:09:01,824
[SPEAKER_20]: we'll continue to do.

1547
02:09:02,285 --> 02:09:03,706
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll continue to advocate around the budget.

1548
02:09:03,726 --> 02:09:08,869
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we should redouble our efforts to, you know, for this council to advocate around pilot as we do around the budget as well.

1549
02:09:09,309 --> 02:09:10,910
[SPEAKER_20]: But I appreciate everybody who's weighed in on this.

1550
02:09:12,691 --> 02:09:13,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1551
02:09:14,332 --> 02:09:15,492
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll finish up with this, Madam President.

1552
02:09:15,512 --> 02:09:21,576
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we've all sat around and touted all the ordinance that we passed in order to be good.

1553
02:09:21,996 --> 02:09:25,238
[SPEAKER_23]: But at the conclusion is,

1554
02:09:26,684 --> 02:09:29,626
[SPEAKER_23]: Are any of those ordinances that we passed enforceable?

1555
02:09:30,246 --> 02:09:34,009
[SPEAKER_23]: Because by our city charter, we're supposed to have a city solicitor.

1556
02:09:34,309 --> 02:09:40,953
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you recall, we sent something to the state attorney general's office for an opinion, and the opinion came back was what?

1557
02:09:41,654 --> 02:09:42,715
[SPEAKER_23]: Ask your city solicitor.

1558
02:09:44,276 --> 02:09:46,077
[SPEAKER_23]: If you recall that we did that not too long ago.

1559
02:09:46,637 --> 02:09:53,822
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, so, and that's a really a grave concern that, Isaiah, we talked about all the great work we've done,

1560
02:09:54,505 --> 02:09:59,749
[SPEAKER_23]: Is all that great work that we've done, is it really enforceable?

1561
02:10:00,450 --> 02:10:01,771
[SPEAKER_23]: So just something for thought.

1562
02:10:03,032 --> 02:10:03,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1563
02:10:04,193 --> 02:10:04,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

1564
02:10:05,614 --> 02:10:06,354
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just be fast.

1565
02:10:06,594 --> 02:10:11,638
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been here so long and talked so long that I'm sure some folks have had to use the bathrooms at City Hall.

1566
02:10:12,259 --> 02:10:19,224
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that the bathrooms at City Hall are actually one of the best examples of how deeply underfunded the entire city is.

1567
02:10:19,584 --> 02:10:21,946
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think they've been updated since the building was built in 1937.

1568
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:31,941
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it is not it is it is not a good experience for a resident to use the bathroom and city hall for any staff to use it, and I just bring it up because

1569
02:10:33,351 --> 02:10:41,613
[SPEAKER_17]: On every single issue, all of the capital infrastructure that the city owns and manages, we have one of the worst water and sewer systems in the state.

1570
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:53,115
[SPEAKER_17]: We have roads and sidewalks that are in a state of disrepair, trees, you know, we have public buildings like this building that are needing massive renovation, and that's just the capital side.

1571
02:10:53,135 --> 02:11:02,417
[SPEAKER_17]: You come to the operating side, and it's a massive underfunding of code enforcement, health sanitarians, rodent control and animal control, you know,

1572
02:11:03,493 --> 02:11:07,892
[SPEAKER_17]: people to look at the ADA issues around the city, teachers.

1573
02:11:08,934 --> 02:11:21,099
[SPEAKER_17]: basically everything that the city is doing, with the exception of a couple of things that have been highly prioritized, like public safety and emergency response, have been massively gutted over the last 40 years.

1574
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:29,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, if the plan is, hopefully there'll be enough, you know, we're gonna pass the zoning and new projects are coming in and that's great.

1575
02:11:29,523 --> 02:11:37,026
[SPEAKER_17]: If the plan from the administration is fingers crossed in five to 10 years, the council zoning will bring in enough commercial development that maybe we'll start being able to fund things again.

1576
02:11:38,447 --> 02:11:39,528
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not acceptable.

1577
02:11:40,188 --> 02:11:48,175
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, we talked about being a broken record we've I think brought up all the great broken record subjects tonight of all of our different priorities.

1578
02:11:48,996 --> 02:11:58,844
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll bring up mine, which is the city needs more money to do its job the city does not have enough money to effectively staff, basic operations or maintain basic capital infrastructure.

1579
02:11:59,464 --> 02:12:14,418
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think that new growth and waiting to do that is the plan, but I also agree with my fellow counselors that in addition to that understanding, and those are just the numbers of the budget if you look at over the last 40 years, we're in an even worse position, because we're not

1580
02:12:15,058 --> 02:12:17,959
[SPEAKER_17]: even using what we have to the best of its effectiveness.

1581
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:20,040
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is a double-edged sword.

1582
02:12:20,521 --> 02:12:29,425
[SPEAKER_17]: It is both not having enough resources to do everything we need to do and not prioritizing the limited resources we have to be used to their most effective.

1583
02:12:29,965 --> 02:12:36,408
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that basically rules the day on almost every topic that comes before this council at every meeting that we have.

1584
02:12:37,769 --> 02:12:38,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1585
02:12:38,929 --> 02:12:40,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli.

1586
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:43,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have the language for that B paper, Mr. Clerk?

1587
02:12:48,288 --> 02:13:00,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli's B paper was to ask the administration to sit down with the unions and bring retired people in to assist city staff with code enforcement efforts.

1588
02:13:01,712 --> 02:13:04,693
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could amend that too, Councilor Knight brought up a good point.

1589
02:13:05,793 --> 02:13:07,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Per diem payments

1590
02:13:10,956 --> 02:13:11,196
[SPEAKER_14]: to assist.

1591
02:13:11,216 --> 02:13:12,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that amendment for you or from Councilor Knight?

1592
02:13:13,278 --> 02:13:21,783
[SPEAKER_14]: No, if you can add that to that amendment to that B paper that add that or either word it.

1593
02:13:23,124 --> 02:13:23,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1594
02:13:23,484 --> 02:13:23,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk.

1595
02:13:24,005 --> 02:13:27,287
[SPEAKER_13]: So in other words, pay those former employees with per diem payments.

1596
02:13:27,527 --> 02:13:32,070
[SPEAKER_14]: As she's been doing, as the mayor has been doing multiple times in multiple positions in City Hall.

1597
02:13:32,590 --> 02:13:32,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1598
02:13:33,391 --> 02:13:33,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1599
02:13:33,791 --> 02:13:37,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for the B paper for Councilor Scarpelli is seconded by...

1600
02:13:38,715 --> 02:13:40,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1601
02:13:40,796 --> 02:13:44,018
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Councilor Collins is temporarily absent.

1602
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:51,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, is your hand up again or still up?

1603
02:13:53,182 --> 02:13:54,183
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an oldie but goodie.

1604
02:13:55,223 --> 02:13:55,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1605
02:13:56,524 --> 02:13:57,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured you would let me know.

1606
02:13:58,525 --> 02:13:59,745
[SPEAKER_13]: I will call the roll.

1607
02:14:00,246 --> 02:14:00,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Bears?

1608
02:14:00,966 --> 02:14:01,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1609
02:14:02,787 --> 02:14:03,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello?

1610
02:14:03,447 --> 02:14:03,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1611
02:14:04,568 --> 02:14:06,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins, temporarily absent.

1612
02:14:08,032 --> 02:14:08,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1613
02:14:09,253 --> 02:14:09,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1614
02:14:11,114 --> 02:14:11,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1615
02:14:12,454 --> 02:14:12,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1616
02:14:13,835 --> 02:14:14,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

1617
02:14:14,515 --> 02:14:14,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1618
02:14:15,256 --> 02:14:15,836
[SPEAKER_13]: President Morell.

1619
02:14:16,236 --> 02:14:16,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1620
02:14:16,656 --> 02:14:19,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

1621
02:14:19,598 --> 02:14:23,119

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1677
02:16:40,518 --> 02:16:40,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1678
02:16:42,148 --> 02:16:42,770
[SPEAKER_13]: else's capillary.

1679
02:16:42,990 --> 02:16:45,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Councilor Tseng, Yes, President room.

1680
02:16:45,716 --> 02:16:49,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I mean it for zero negative motion passes counselor night we look forward to your brief synopsis.

1681
02:16:50,553 --> 02:16:51,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1682
02:16:51,754 --> 02:17:00,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring this resolution forward requesting that we have a little bit more accountability and some tracking and measurement of data when it comes to the use of take-home vehicles here in the community.

1683
02:17:00,258 --> 02:17:11,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there are certain positions in the community that one would expect as a take-home vehicle, the chief of police, the chief of fire, the DPW commissioner, but there are other positions in this community where people are allowed to take-home vehicles.

1684
02:17:12,123 --> 02:17:18,626
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question therein remains, how much use and wear and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being utilized for purposes

1685
02:17:21,357 --> 02:17:21,617
[SPEAKER_05]: work.

1686
02:17:22,517 --> 02:17:29,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, this council has appropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars for the replacement of equipment and part of our fleet.

1687
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:40,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we go through the process of replacing vehicles that are becoming, I guess we'd say, less equipped to deal with the wear and tear of our everyday

1688
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:43,742
[SPEAKER_05]: work that we perform here in our community.

1689
02:17:44,883 --> 02:17:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting to see where these new vehicles are going and what their uses are for.

1690
02:17:49,046 --> 02:17:59,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, you know, I think that there are some protections that we need to put in place to prevent the city from getting into circumstances where we might be liable for things that we didn't anticipate we were going to become liable for.

1691
02:18:00,193 --> 02:18:08,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, whether or not these trucks are provided by contract or by grant, the department head or the mayor, they do have implications.

1692
02:18:08,036 --> 02:18:16,158
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Madam President, if someone were provided a take-home vehicle and they were injured in the line of work, the cost of that take-home vehicle goes towards their wage.

1693
02:18:17,139 --> 02:18:23,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they're out of work collecting compensation, they'd be compensated based upon the wage that they earn plus the value of the vehicle.

1694
02:18:25,073 --> 02:18:31,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So that greatly increases the city's liability when it comes down to certain issues of employees that are into the line of work, number one.

1695
02:18:31,299 --> 02:18:40,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, take-home vehicles also increase the city's liability if there were an accident to occur outside of working hours, outside of city limits.

1696
02:18:41,387 --> 02:18:47,292
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a question about how much of the city's resources in the form of gasoline

1697
02:18:48,392 --> 02:18:58,595
[SPEAKER_05]: and other maintenance and upkeep necessities are being placed on these vehicles through the commute to and from work and they're not used inside the city limits or for city purposes.

1698
02:18:59,276 --> 02:19:13,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So the intention of the ordinance, Madam President, is to put some restrictions upon this and put some data reporting requirements on this so the city knows where their fleet is, what their fleet is doing, when they're doing it outside of city limits and outside of city operating hours and how much

1699
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:22,528
[SPEAKER_05]: wear and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being done not in the performance of the city duties but in the performance of traveling to and from work commuting and other items for life.

1700
02:19:22,988 --> 02:19:37,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean ultimately a take-home vehicle would be only utilized for the purpose of going to your house and from your house and when you get home you're going to get into your own private vehicle so tracking this mileage is very important I think for us in this community to be sure that our fleets are being maintained in the proper and most satisfaction in the court.

1701
02:19:38,742 --> 02:19:44,267
[SPEAKER_05]: also take on vehicles to present tax implications, if I'm not mistaken, Madam President.

1702
02:19:44,287 --> 02:19:50,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are things that we need to take a look at and be sure that we're complying with all standards of our federal state statute as well going forward.

1703
02:19:51,113 --> 02:19:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I raised the issue.

1704
02:19:52,114 --> 02:19:53,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that seemed important to me.

1705
02:19:53,896 --> 02:19:58,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem too important to many of you, but I certainly think that asking that a city

1706
02:20:01,411 --> 02:20:15,257
[SPEAKER_05]: vehicle isn't something that's too much to ask, and that we track where these vehicles are going when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, and that we track the mileage on these vehicles when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, Madam President.

1707
02:20:15,297 --> 02:20:22,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the basis of the ordinance, and I ask for my council colleagues to support sending this to subcommittees so that we can have a further discussion with our future legal counsel.

1708
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:25,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that synopsis, Councilor Knight.

1709
02:20:26,716 --> 02:20:33,800
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to propose a B paper to ask the clerk to compare the length of the captions to the length of the ordinance.

1710
02:20:36,442 --> 02:20:38,003
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would also, that's a joke.

1711
02:20:38,063 --> 02:20:41,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll move to refer to, do you have a preference of subcommittee, Councilor Knight?

1712
02:20:43,284 --> 02:20:44,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up to you guys, really.

1713
02:20:45,305 --> 02:20:58,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an ordinance, so it probably should be fitting to go to that subcommittee, but if it wants to go to public safety, or if it wants to go to, I do believe there was a request prior to put together a subcommittee on legal services and litigation that we're still waiting to see.

1714
02:20:58,288 --> 02:21:04,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It could go there once that gets created, but whatever it is that you see fit, council, if it has any divine wisdom, I'd be happy to support.

1715
02:21:06,330 --> 02:21:08,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to refer to subcommittee on ordinances and rules.

1716
02:21:09,811 --> 02:21:10,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

1717
02:21:10,692 --> 02:21:11,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

1718
02:21:13,519 --> 02:21:18,103
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1719
02:21:25,029 --> 02:21:25,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Bears.

1720
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:26,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1721
02:21:27,410 --> 02:21:28,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

1722
02:21:28,071 --> 02:21:28,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1723
02:21:29,032 --> 02:21:29,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

1724
02:21:29,712 --> 02:21:29,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1725
02:21:30,393 --> 02:21:30,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1726
02:21:31,474 --> 02:21:31,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1727
02:21:33,135 --> 02:21:33,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1728
02:21:34,196 --> 02:21:34,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1729
02:21:34,676 --> 02:21:35,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

1730
02:21:35,357 --> 02:21:35,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1731
02:21:36,017 --> 02:21:36,498
[SPEAKER_13]: President Morell.

1732
02:21:36,823 --> 02:21:39,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1733
02:21:39,924 --> 02:21:45,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders, and resolutions, 23-392, offered by Vice President Bears, Councilor Collins, and Councilor Hsuang.

1734
02:21:45,485 --> 02:21:54,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the union workers of United Labor of Tufts Residence Assistance, ULTRA, went on strike on Tuesday, August 29th, and whereas the Medford City Council unanimously passed the resolution, paper 22-569,

1735
02:21:56,212 --> 02:22:01,775
[SPEAKER_09]: In November 2022, asking Tufts University to recognize the RA workers union and negotiate their contract agreement now.

1736
02:22:01,915 --> 02:22:12,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we stand in solidarity with ultra workers on strike and call on Tufts University leadership to return to the bargaining table and provide these workers with compensation and contract they deserve.

1737
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I will start with Vice President Bears.

1738
02:22:15,301 --> 02:22:16,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

1739
02:22:17,241 --> 02:22:18,422
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be as brief as I can.

1740
02:22:18,442 --> 02:22:25,105
[SPEAKER_17]: The Tufts RAs went on a one-day strike last week, and I was happy to support them and this council also.

1741
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:30,842
[SPEAKER_17]: asked Tufts to recognize their union and instead Tufts forced an election, which lengthened the process by months.

1742
02:22:30,882 --> 02:22:33,443
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we have the contract process lengthened by months.

1743
02:22:33,943 --> 02:22:36,684
[SPEAKER_17]: So these folks don't have a fair contract when the new school year started.

1744
02:22:37,184 --> 02:22:50,990
[SPEAKER_17]: But the bigger and more important point I wanna make about this is I spent four years working to bring together students and workers and community members and communities to hold universities accountable to treating everybody fairly.

1745
02:22:51,890 --> 02:22:53,851
[SPEAKER_17]: And really the most important thing about that is

1746
02:22:55,011 --> 02:23:13,356
[SPEAKER_17]: whether it's RAs or students on campus or residents in the neighborhood around Tufts who are not getting fair and equitable treatment by Tufts or Tufts is taking actions that negatively impact the community or the folks on campus, we're all in the same fight.

1747
02:23:14,056 --> 02:23:22,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Tufts is a billion dollar institution, multi-billion dollar institution run by a small group of people who make decisions that a lot of people disagree with.

1748
02:23:23,027 --> 02:23:28,229
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can all fight our fights with Tufts separately if we want, but we're actually stronger together.

1749
02:23:28,710 --> 02:23:40,575
[SPEAKER_17]: So one of the reasons I think it's important for community members and the city council to support the Tufts RAs is because if we build that relationship, we can call on the Tufts RAs to support us in asking for and fighting for a bigger pilot.

1750
02:23:41,055 --> 02:23:46,437
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was an interview today, the Tufts Daily interviewed the new president of Tufts, and

1751
02:23:48,178 --> 02:23:51,000
[SPEAKER_17]: the student reporters were making that point too.

1752
02:23:51,661 --> 02:23:54,784
[SPEAKER_17]: They said, well, what about the impact that Tufts has on the surrounding community?

1753
02:23:54,804 --> 02:23:58,066
[SPEAKER_17]: And the president says, oh, we, you know, new president says that we try really hard.

1754
02:23:58,106 --> 02:24:02,150
[SPEAKER_17]: And to give him fair credit, he seemed to be taking a better tone on it than I've heard in the past.

1755
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:04,752
[SPEAKER_17]: But he said, you know, we wanted to hear about this.

1756
02:24:04,772 --> 02:24:06,293
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to try really hard to support this.

1757
02:24:07,054 --> 02:24:07,975
[SPEAKER_17]: And the student pushed back.

1758
02:24:08,715 --> 02:24:20,380
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have the narrative that we've been talking about by reaching out to Tufts students, reaching out and working with the workers on campus about the impact of Tufts on the communities and the neighborhoods that it lives in.

1759
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:22,361
[SPEAKER_17]: That message is breaking through.

1760
02:24:22,761 --> 02:24:28,023
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we can all work together to hold Tufts accountable to do better, we have a much better shot than we do of doing it alone.

1761
02:24:28,343 --> 02:24:37,147
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is the larger message and point of why it's important to build relationships and show solidarity like this, because what goes around comes around.

1762
02:24:37,167 --> 02:24:38,247
[SPEAKER_17]: They're mistreating the RAs today.

1763
02:24:38,746 --> 02:24:45,831
[SPEAKER_17]: that we mistreat in the neighborhood tomorrow and someone else the next day, and it's better off if we work together to fight that than if we do it alone.

1764
02:24:46,251 --> 02:24:46,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1765
02:24:46,791 --> 02:24:47,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1766
02:24:47,211 --> 02:24:47,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

1767
02:24:49,273 --> 02:24:51,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears.

1768
02:24:51,414 --> 02:24:53,636
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that was very eloquently put.

1769
02:24:55,437 --> 02:25:01,821
[SPEAKER_20]: As I like to remind people, I'm a Tufts alumni, so this is my atonement.

1770
02:25:01,921 --> 02:25:02,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kidding.

1771
02:25:04,643 --> 02:25:07,825
[SPEAKER_20]: But as an alumna, I do feel a particular responsibility to

1772
02:25:09,790 --> 02:25:19,694
[SPEAKER_20]: speak up in this case for the Tufts resident assistants who are seeking simply just to collectively bargain and a fair contract with their employer.

1773
02:25:19,714 --> 02:25:25,516
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to remind people that we're talking about an institution with a $2.4 billion endowment.

1774
02:25:25,556 --> 02:25:37,721
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the same institution with a $2.4 billion endowment that doesn't pay taxes to us and does not volunteer to help us fill the gaping holes in our various municipal civil service needs.

1775
02:25:39,581 --> 02:25:51,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Particular to the Tufts RAs fight, you know, I think that, you know, labor is labor and workers are workers and it's time to stop entertaining the narrative that seeking to collectively bargain is anything other than reasonable.

1776
02:25:52,223 --> 02:25:55,544
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish that Tufts would more enthusiastically respond with that attitude.

1777
02:25:56,724 --> 02:26:05,946
[SPEAKER_20]: All experts, I mean, all workers are the experts on their work and RAs are the experts on their role in the campus community, which of course affects the Medford community in myriad ways.

1778
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:11,348
[SPEAKER_20]: They stabilize and counsel and provide logistical support for the dorms.

1779
02:26:11,708 --> 02:26:18,873
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's also true that the dorms that they serve have become more complicated and more needful in the past few years because of the pandemic.

1780
02:26:20,554 --> 02:26:33,482
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm thankful to my fellow counselors and community members for coming together to say, you know, Tufts has to quickly proceed towards a compromise solution and a fair contract because anything other than that would be

1781
02:26:35,202 --> 02:26:40,426
[SPEAKER_20]: Candidly, a truly bizarre waste of their administrative time and resources, of which we know they have many.

1782
02:26:40,626 --> 02:26:54,978
[SPEAKER_20]: And we know that there's so many more important needs that those could be put to, not just making the campus experience more livable for those living and working on campus, but for the community as well.

1783
02:26:55,058 --> 02:26:55,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1784
02:27:00,231 --> 02:27:04,353
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be very brief because I think Councilor Bears and Councilor Collins have covered a lot of it.

1785
02:27:06,414 --> 02:27:22,200
[SPEAKER_22]: We, I think tonight have talked about the need to cooperate more with each other and with Tufts to make sure that Medford is more livable and that we are tackling a lot of the broader challenges that our neighbors in the Tufts neighborhood see.

1786
02:27:23,641 --> 02:27:25,842
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Councilor Bears makes a great point that

1787
02:27:26,522 --> 02:27:34,048
[SPEAKER_22]: we need to work with students to bring about that change, because a lot of what we're fighting for is aligned with what they're fighting for as well.

1788
02:27:34,548 --> 02:27:42,975
[SPEAKER_22]: When I go to Tufts, and I have more connections there in the way that a lot of them are my classmates or classmates from high school.

1789
02:27:43,776 --> 02:27:48,139
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a lot of folks there who've been asking me how they can contribute to

1790
02:27:49,642 --> 02:27:53,127
[SPEAKER_22]: to Medford and how their school contributes to Medford.

1791
02:27:53,167 --> 02:27:59,938
[SPEAKER_22]: And oftentimes, I have to give the hard answer, which is that, you know, to be fair, Tufts isn't doing enough.

1792
02:28:00,058 --> 02:28:05,286
[SPEAKER_22]: And we can be getting the university and students to be doing more for our community as well.

1793
02:28:06,166 --> 02:28:08,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Tufts does, you know, that's not to say that Tufts does nothing.

1794
02:28:08,627 --> 02:28:17,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Tufts does do things, but it doesn't match up with the shortfall that we get with in terms of them not paying property taxes.

1795
02:28:17,812 --> 02:28:21,174
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we need to build those connections to bring them to the table.

1796
02:28:22,354 --> 02:28:28,257
[SPEAKER_22]: Ultimately Tufts workers, be it students or faculty or researchers, they're Medford workers as well.

1797
02:28:28,797 --> 02:28:33,580
[SPEAKER_22]: And we need to make sure that Medford workers are working to the best standards possible.

1798
02:28:34,921 --> 02:28:40,127
[SPEAKER_22]: When you look at what ultras put out what the union is put out in terms of what they're asking for it's really not a lot.

1799
02:28:41,829 --> 02:28:50,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Back in college I did, I did similar work to being an RA without the residency part, and I got paid more than what you know I got more benefits than what they

1800
02:28:50,499 --> 02:28:51,299
[SPEAKER_22]: they're getting right now.

1801
02:28:51,419 --> 02:28:55,260
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're doing more work than I was ever doing in college in that position.

1802
02:28:55,540 --> 02:29:00,301
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I think when you ask, oh, and you look at what they're asking for, it's really not a lot.

1803
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:07,082
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a really, it's really a minimal action for us to pass this resolution tonight and to stand with them.

1804
02:29:10,663 --> 02:29:15,984
[SPEAKER_14]: President, I appreciate bringing this forward as a strong union supporter.

1805
02:29:16,424 --> 02:29:18,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I support anything dealing with unions, but I,

1806
02:29:22,489 --> 02:29:29,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be remiss if I didn't bring up the fact that we're talking about, we're talking about RAs from Tufts University.

1807
02:29:29,614 --> 02:29:34,958
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I recall back, we talked about our own unions being affected.

1808
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:48,245
[SPEAKER_14]: and counselors that are sitting here talking about the effect that it had, you know, on the process of moving forward on a nonunion contract is because maybe we need to move forward.

1809
02:29:48,265 --> 02:29:50,065
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to help things going forward.

1810
02:29:50,966 --> 02:29:52,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember those conversations?

1811
02:29:52,686 --> 02:29:56,948
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a fire department that hasn't had a contract in almost 800 days.

1812
02:29:57,508 --> 02:29:59,169
[SPEAKER_14]: We have secretaries that didn't have

1813
02:30:00,009 --> 02:30:01,430
[SPEAKER_14]: a contract for six years.

1814
02:30:01,450 --> 02:30:06,032
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about the RAs at Tufts University, a contact at Tufts University today.

1815
02:30:06,613 --> 02:30:14,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And boy, I tell you what, correct me if I'm wrong, free room and board, free meals plan, stipend.

1816
02:30:16,198 --> 02:30:20,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So when I talked today with the representative of Tufts University, that's what they told me.

1817
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:24,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to say, I'm just sharing to you what they've told me.

1818
02:30:24,162 --> 02:30:25,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just, and you know what?

1819
02:30:26,043 --> 02:30:41,510
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I'm saying is this, understanding that, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna vote for this because I think any union, any person that wants to work together as a union and have representation, you can never deny it.

1820
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:43,871
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just want you to realize and understand

1821
02:30:44,953 --> 02:30:49,295
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a good point to bring it forward that we have unions right now in our own backyard.

1822
02:30:49,316 --> 02:30:54,658
[SPEAKER_14]: My father always told me, don't worry about your neighbor's backyard till you clean your own backyard.

1823
02:30:54,678 --> 02:30:59,161
[SPEAKER_14]: 800 days, 800 days without a contract for a firemen and women.

1824
02:30:59,781 --> 02:31:11,648
[SPEAKER_14]: They sat through the pandemic, the first ones they applauded how great they were, how amazing what they've done for our community, going into the homes where people are dying and putting their lives first.

1825
02:31:12,861 --> 02:31:17,065
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm using this, yes, I'm using it as a platform that I hope you understand why.

1826
02:31:17,505 --> 02:31:28,815
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for the fact that we have unions in our own community right now in Medford, hardworking men and women residents that live here all year round that haven't been treated fairly.

1827
02:31:31,488 --> 02:31:33,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, two wrongs don't make a right, right?

1828
02:31:33,648 --> 02:31:35,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to support this paper.

1829
02:31:35,089 --> 02:31:36,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a very important paper.

1830
02:31:37,289 --> 02:31:43,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I share what the representative from Tufts University told me today, so we can all understand.

1831
02:31:44,251 --> 02:31:46,211
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the difficult part about negotiations.

1832
02:31:46,611 --> 02:31:50,292
[SPEAKER_14]: You hear what you want to hear, what they want to say, to make it sound good.

1833
02:31:50,952 --> 02:31:51,792
[SPEAKER_14]: But who's affected?

1834
02:31:51,992 --> 02:31:54,233
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the employee, the worker.

1835
02:31:54,313 --> 02:32:00,414
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I think we need to look at our firefighters, because I think, listen, unified message next week.

1836
02:32:01,986 --> 02:32:06,507
[SPEAKER_14]: What can this mayor do to support our firefighters?

1837
02:32:06,707 --> 02:32:07,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Update us right now.

1838
02:32:08,868 --> 02:32:19,810
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that the negotiations now are now in arbitration, it's out of our hands, but what else can we do for our firefighters that we're showing them the unity, right?

1839
02:32:20,290 --> 02:32:24,131
[SPEAKER_14]: That they're standing together and saying, what are you gonna do for them?

1840
02:32:25,772 --> 02:32:26,332
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you.

1841
02:32:26,352 --> 02:32:27,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1842
02:32:31,481 --> 02:32:32,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1843
02:32:33,183 --> 02:32:35,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilor Scarpelli is correct.

1844
02:32:35,885 --> 02:32:43,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Things at Tufts University aren't very different than things at City Hall when it comes to labor relations.

1845
02:32:44,551 --> 02:32:50,015
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference is our friends at Tufts University have the power to strike.

1846
02:32:50,936 --> 02:32:51,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they did.

1847
02:32:51,716 --> 02:32:57,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And I commend them for taking the steps that they see necessary to ensure that they secure a fair collective bargaining agreement.

1848
02:32:58,425 --> 02:32:59,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I support their right to organize.

1849
02:33:00,286 --> 02:33:02,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I support any group's right to organize.

1850
02:33:06,288 --> 02:33:13,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I do feel as though Tufts University this evening has been given a very bad rap.

1851
02:33:14,510 --> 02:33:25,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, in no uncertain terms, agree with the way that Tufts University is handling this issue with their RAs.

1852
02:33:26,716 --> 02:33:28,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Nor do I agree with their position on the issue.

1853
02:33:29,718 --> 02:33:33,100
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they've been taking a pretty good beating this evening.

1854
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:43,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's important that we point out there are many benefits that do come with being host to a university.

1855
02:33:43,906 --> 02:33:45,547
[SPEAKER_05]: One is prestigious as such university.

1856
02:33:48,308 --> 02:33:50,670
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep talking about the fact that they don't pay taxes.

1857
02:33:51,850 --> 02:33:52,811
[SPEAKER_05]: That's patently false.

1858
02:33:54,472 --> 02:33:56,333
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't pay taxes on a portion of their property.

1859
02:33:57,631 --> 02:33:59,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've entered into an agreement voluntarily.

1860
02:34:02,254 --> 02:34:06,837
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've said that they will continue to pay property taxes on newly purchased properties.

1861
02:34:07,257 --> 02:34:08,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has been going on for quite some time.

1862
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:14,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So Tufts University is not the villain that we make them out to be.

1863
02:34:14,782 --> 02:34:19,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Do problems come along with having Tufts University in our community?

1864
02:34:19,265 --> 02:34:19,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1865
02:34:20,826 --> 02:34:24,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Every problem in every community stems from something.

1866
02:34:25,148 --> 02:34:25,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Tufts is not a villain.

1867
02:34:26,647 --> 02:34:51,461
[SPEAKER_05]: when we look at the benefits that they bring to our community, like diversity, like economic stability during unstable and poor economic times, or like the community of academics that tend to call Medford their home after being employed at one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America.

1868
02:34:52,987 --> 02:35:04,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Madam President, I can understand that being a good neighbor is one thing, but I think that they've always been a good partner, they've always lent a listening ear, and they've always invested in this community.

1869
02:35:05,019 --> 02:35:13,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether or not you feel as though they're giving enough is one thing, but they always have been some of us willing to come to the table and sit down with us, and I think that that's important to point out.

1870
02:35:14,969 --> 02:35:29,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wish that Clemson University took that same approach with their RAs and was willing to sit down with them at the table and put this issue behind them and reach a fair collective bargaining agreement for all involved so that we can move on because ultimately the ones that get affected the most are the students and the school.

1871
02:35:30,157 --> 02:35:33,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Madam President, these parents are making a $70,000 investment

1872
02:35:35,488 --> 02:35:39,329
[SPEAKER_05]: for the kids to worry about whether or not their IRAs are gonna have a contract.

1873
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:49,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need Tufts to get back to the table and negotiate this, because these Tufts students are residents of Metro, and the IRAs are residents of Metro, and they deserve our support.

1874
02:35:49,433 --> 02:35:50,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I support the people of Iowa.

1875
02:35:50,853 --> 02:35:51,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1876
02:35:53,534 --> 02:35:54,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1877
02:35:55,335 --> 02:35:55,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

1878
02:35:57,736 --> 02:35:58,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

1879
02:35:58,216 --> 02:35:59,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1880
02:35:59,456 --> 02:35:59,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1881
02:36:00,397 --> 02:36:00,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Just three things.

1882
02:36:01,657 --> 02:36:04,138
[SPEAKER_17]: One, on Tufts, it's not about villain or hero.

1883
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:09,244
[SPEAKER_17]: their budgets $1.2 billion a year the city's budgets 200 million.

1884
02:36:09,785 --> 02:36:14,910
[SPEAKER_17]: They have 2.4 billion in endowment we have 25 million in reserves, they're rich we're not, it's a problem.

1885
02:36:15,351 --> 02:36:15,871
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll leave it there.

1886
02:36:18,554 --> 02:36:24,561
[SPEAKER_17]: The second thing I'll say just on the union workers, I hear you, I understand the issues with the contracts that workers have here.

1887
02:36:25,307 --> 02:36:33,592
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's not a position that everyone back here wants to say, because it's technically a position of saying that there's an unjust law that public sector workers can't strike.

1888
02:36:33,732 --> 02:36:35,934
[SPEAKER_17]: I support state-level legislation to let them strike.

1889
02:36:36,314 --> 02:36:41,517
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said to workers that came up here, if you took a strike action, I would walk on the picket line with you.

1890
02:36:41,537 --> 02:36:44,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't care if it's illegal or not illegal by state law.

1891
02:36:45,199 --> 02:36:46,060
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a bad law.

1892
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:50,803
[SPEAKER_17]: And it means that bargaining goes on forever for 700, 800, 900 days with no timeline on it.

1893
02:36:51,123 --> 02:36:52,664
[SPEAKER_17]: And the workers have no leverage, right?

1894
02:36:53,084 --> 02:36:58,226
[SPEAKER_17]: The point of the union is that you have collective power and part of collective power is taking a job action.

1895
02:36:58,246 --> 02:37:03,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I guarantee you if the firefighters in the community, which is an even bigger thing to go public safety, right?

1896
02:37:04,069 --> 02:37:06,430
[SPEAKER_17]: The firefighters in the community went on strike for 12 hours.

1897
02:37:07,130 --> 02:37:09,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone in the city would lose their minds and they'd have a contract the next day.

1898
02:37:10,031 --> 02:37:17,814
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying that's the best policy in the world, but at the very least state law needs to change so that they don't sit for 700 days before a contract goes to arbitration.

1899
02:37:18,094 --> 02:37:21,556
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to put that point out there that

1900
02:37:22,267 --> 02:37:27,288
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we support the workers to, there's a lot that needs to change around public sector bargaining.

1901
02:37:28,068 --> 02:37:32,009
[SPEAKER_09]: On that point, Madam President, I can't go back to you.

1902
02:37:32,689 --> 02:37:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the direct rebuttal to the statement.

1903
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:45,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know I just don't want I don't want you to think that I'm saying the firefighters should go on strike or that I support that or that number or number two.

1904
02:37:45,862 --> 02:38:07,858
[SPEAKER_05]: that the firefighters would even consider that because I think we've heard time and time again the firefighters come up here and say all we want to do is keep Medford safe and we're going to continue to come to work no matter what and we're going to fight to do that and we're going to fight for fair wages in the meantime and if it takes 800 to 900 days we're not going to lie down but we're going to still continue to come to work today and I don't so I don't I don't think the firefighters would support the statement of saying we're going to go on strike.

1905
02:38:08,809 --> 02:38:14,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want anybody to think that that's what I was intending to say, or intended to say that they should do, because I don't speak for them.

1906
02:38:15,715 --> 02:38:24,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just don't want to be misconstrued or misinterpreted in saying that I think the firefighters should go on strike, or that I think the firefighters would go on strike if they have the power, because I can't speak for them.

1907
02:38:24,403 --> 02:38:31,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I've heard and from my conversations with them, these men and women will come to work every day to make sure this community is safe, and they have.

1908
02:38:32,129 --> 02:38:37,871
[SPEAKER_05]: and they will continue to do so, and I don't see them ever, ever, ever taking a position where they take a strike action against the city.

1909
02:38:38,151 --> 02:38:49,074
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll continue to fight for fair wages in the proper format, but I don't ever see them doing something illegal in order to jeopardize the safety of the residents in this community, nor would I condone it, nor do I think they would.

1910
02:38:49,834 --> 02:38:52,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Madam President, for allowing me the opportunity.

1911
02:38:52,235 --> 02:38:57,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to be very clear in my words, and I didn't want to get them misconstrued, because sometimes that happens over social media.

1912
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:02,403
[SPEAKER_05]: virtual Zoom stuff, not social media.

1913
02:39:02,543 --> 02:39:03,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1914
02:39:04,105 --> 02:39:04,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1915
02:39:04,986 --> 02:39:05,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

1916
02:39:06,128 --> 02:39:07,069
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1917
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:16,281
[SPEAKER_20]: Very briefly, and I think that if I might speculate, I think that the point here is not that there's a strategy that should be taken, but just that clearly the process

1918
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:22,065
[SPEAKER_20]: is broken and that's why we see these labor disputes, these labor struggles in our own community.

1919
02:39:22,085 --> 02:39:31,755
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that we all want to see the overarching process change so that workers in our community, whether they're workers in our community that work for City Hall or workers in our community that happen to live on Tufts for now,

1920
02:39:33,715 --> 02:39:39,259
[SPEAKER_20]: that they can collectively bargain in a way that they can efficiently proceed to a just outcome.

1921
02:39:39,399 --> 02:39:49,127
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm really heartened, and I think that this resolution and previous ones that the city council has worked on are evidence of this, that everybody behind this rail takes the opportunity.

1922
02:39:49,147 --> 02:39:55,251
[SPEAKER_20]: And everybody in this community, I think for the most part, takes the opportunity to stand with labor when they can on the actions that they feel that they can take.

1923
02:39:55,391 --> 02:40:01,036
[SPEAKER_20]: And behind this rail, I think it's our right to sometimes have different ideas of what is possible for us to do and what's strategic.

1924
02:40:01,676 --> 02:40:02,257
[SPEAKER_20]: That's our right.

1925
02:40:02,617 --> 02:40:09,383
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a diversity of opinions, but I think when push comes to shove, we are all doing our best to stand with the laborers and the workers in our community.

1926
02:40:10,004 --> 02:40:11,245
[SPEAKER_20]: With that, I would move for approval.

1927
02:40:12,566 --> 02:40:12,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1928
02:40:13,007 --> 02:40:17,411
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins, Councilor Caraviello.

1929
02:40:17,965 --> 02:40:18,786
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize for that.

1930
02:40:18,806 --> 02:40:29,095
[SPEAKER_23]: I was acting as a non-union plumber in the other room, but someone from the water department is coming down to save thousands of gallons of water that is just going up the- Bathroom's not working?

1931
02:40:29,476 --> 02:40:29,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1932
02:40:29,756 --> 02:40:31,538
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's been running thousands.

1933
02:40:31,558 --> 02:40:33,059
[SPEAKER_23]: So someone's coming down.

1934
02:40:33,259 --> 02:40:42,067
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize for missing, but I know discussions about union workers, but cost of living is going up at a ridiculous pace right now.

1935
02:40:44,201 --> 02:40:48,123
[SPEAKER_23]: All workers deserve fair raises and not waiting for years to get them.

1936
02:40:48,143 --> 02:40:49,604
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I support this resolution.

1937
02:40:50,024 --> 02:40:50,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Karygiannis.

1938

[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand this.

1949
02:41:19,199 --> 02:41:19,779

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1951

1952
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:31,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it so resolved that Medford City Council have the DPW repaint the crosswalk in front of 190 High Street in the interest of public safety.

1953
02:41:31,702 --> 02:41:32,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1954
02:41:32,402 --> 02:41:33,122
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

1955
02:41:33,142 --> 02:41:39,684
[SPEAKER_23]: Madam President, this is a sidewalk, I mean a crosswalk that's been in disrepair for multiple years now.

1956
02:41:40,504 --> 02:41:43,645
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if people remember a woman was killed

1957
02:41:45,649 --> 02:41:48,631
[SPEAKER_23]: on this crosswalk because people couldn't see it as you get run over by a car.

1958
02:41:49,152 --> 02:41:56,317
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would hope that in the interest of public safety, that that sidewalk be, excuse me, that crosswalk be repainted as soon as possible.

1959
02:41:57,398 --> 02:41:58,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1960
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:02,983

02:42:10,428 --> 02:42:10,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1965
02:42:12,470 --> 02:42:13,751

1976
02:42:52,743 --> 02:42:53,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

1977
02:42:53,724 --> 02:42:54,644
[SPEAKER_22]: This meeting's been long.

1978
02:42:54,724 --> 02:42:57,306
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we've all voted in favor of something like this.

1979
02:42:57,446 --> 02:42:59,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to kickstart more action on it.

1980
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:08,974
[SPEAKER_22]: I think these are ideas that are great ideas that have come from a multitude of different councilors.

1981
02:43:10,055 --> 02:43:12,277
[SPEAKER_22]: I think since we all agree on them, we can get it done.

1982
02:43:13,513 --> 02:43:14,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1983
02:43:14,954 --> 02:43:17,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion on the motion?

1984
02:43:18,237 --> 02:43:20,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1985
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:21,781

[SPEAKER_09]: Refer to subcommittee on ordinances and rules.

1987
02:43:32,610 --> 02:43:33,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

1988
02:43:35,493 --> 02:43:37,094
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just waiting on the clerk to call the question.

1989
02:43:38,336 --> 02:43:38,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Call the roll.

1990
02:43:39,116 --> 02:43:39,877

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1992
02:43:48,465 --> 02:43:48,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1993
02:43:49,046 --> 02:43:49,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1994
02:43:50,167 --> 02:43:50,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1995
02:43:50,367 --> 02:44:04,280
[SPEAKER_09]: 740 is negative the motion passes to three dash three nine nine be resolved the city council asked the administration to place more waste disposals by the mystic river to reduce trash by Medford square and prepare for the upcoming clipper ship connector counselor saying

1996
02:44:04,602 --> 02:44:05,002
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1997
02:44:05,242 --> 02:44:17,952
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, this is something that some residents in neighborhoods around the square wrote to me because when you walk towards metric square over the bridge, you can see trash by the river and there are some residents who have been collecting the trash on the weekends.

1998
02:44:18,533 --> 02:44:19,293
[SPEAKER_22]: It'd be.

1999
02:44:19,733 --> 02:44:23,476
[SPEAKER_22]: I so I, I'm going to request that we make one small amendments.

2000
02:44:26,695 --> 02:44:41,001
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically, after where it says, ask the administration to, instead of saying to place, I would move to amend it to say, ask the administration to study placing more waste disposals.

2001
02:44:44,670 --> 02:44:54,699
[SPEAKER_22]: This is just an idea that, you know, once we're trying to get people to use the Clippership connector to walk more to the square to bike more, people are going to be passing by that area more.

2002
02:44:55,239 --> 02:44:58,302
[SPEAKER_22]: And with people comes litter.

2003
02:44:58,602 --> 02:45:03,346
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I would like us to kind of tackle this problem somehow.

2004
02:45:06,044 --> 02:45:13,646
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone did write in with a concern that trash waste disposals, trash bins might create problems of legal dumping.

2005
02:45:14,666 --> 02:45:30,849
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's why I made that amendment to change the language a little bit to soften it and to ask perhaps someone like PDS to, an office like PDS to study what the pros and cons are and how we can reduce litter over there.

2006
02:45:31,735 --> 02:45:32,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Saint.

2007
02:45:32,375 --> 02:45:33,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

2008
02:45:33,116 --> 02:45:33,836
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam President.

2009
02:45:33,856 --> 02:45:39,160
[SPEAKER_23]: If Councilor Saint wouldn't mind amending that, not just on the Clippership Connective, but throughout the whole city.

2010
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:45,645
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we used to have those big belly things there, they used to be, but they're all pretty much broken or gone.

2011
02:45:46,605 --> 02:45:50,068
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see where they used to be, there's nothing in some of those spots.

2012
02:45:50,088 --> 02:45:57,453
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we can amend it to put more trash throughout those, especially in the business districts where they're firing fuel.

2013
02:45:57,713 --> 02:45:59,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it'd be super amenable to that.

2014
02:46:01,004 --> 02:46:05,946
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think you make a great point that there used to be big belly trash cans.

2015
02:46:06,006 --> 02:46:07,447
[SPEAKER_22]: We are disposals.

2016
02:46:07,507 --> 02:46:09,148
[SPEAKER_22]: We can do things like that.

2017
02:46:09,208 --> 02:46:12,029
[SPEAKER_22]: We can tackle the rodent problem in the squares as well.

2018
02:46:13,109 --> 02:46:16,731
[SPEAKER_22]: If we have better disposals, we can put solar powered things on it.

2019
02:46:16,771 --> 02:46:17,891
[SPEAKER_22]: We can put advertisements on it.

2020
02:46:17,931 --> 02:46:19,092
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a way to generate revenue.

2021
02:46:19,132 --> 02:46:22,073

2026
02:46:29,423 --> 02:46:36,086

2027
02:46:36,146 --> 02:46:40,727
