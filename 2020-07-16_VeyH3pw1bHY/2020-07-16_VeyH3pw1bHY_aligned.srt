1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:03,330
So we're going to start with Daphne Bowen.

2
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:16,225
Now Beth has been in the area for decades.

3
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,647
She's one of the leaders of the Paracontract fight.

4
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,829
And you can see her leading the chants at all the rallies.

5
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:23,669
So go check her out.

6
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,411
She's been a really important fight.

7
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:30,574
She also happens to teach in his son, Life, which is pretty amazing.

8
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:35,077
And she's a wonderful teacher that the classroom couldn't do without.

9
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,798
So I'm going to turn it over to you, Daphne.

10
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:41,179
Hello, everyone.

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:49,624
So, as my introduction stated, I am a paraprofessional and a professor of women in school.

12
00:00:50,445 --> 00:01:01,792
As many of you may already know, and some of you don't know, we have been going through a contract fight for the past year.

13
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:03,653
It's been a difficult fight.

14
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:04,774
We have been

15
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,167
which means the school community is not wanting to speak to us.

16
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:22,437
You know, paraprofessionals are vital to the learning and growth of our students.

17
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:27,042
We are there every day working diligently

18
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:33,024
to ensure that these students have the proper education that they deserve.

19
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:36,325
And unfortunately our patriots don't show that.

20
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:44,808
Our professionals are also, they meet the demographic of the students that are in our schools.

21
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:50,930
And so it's important for teachers to be able to have students

22
00:01:51,490 --> 00:02:00,339
that look like them, that understand them, to be able to relate to them and be successful in their journey.

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,421
We are fighting for

24
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:22,970
basic thing, $25,000 a year, which people with even degrees, we have degrees, we have master's and bachelor's and we're not getting paid $25,000.

25
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:26,572
People that's been working for years has not had that.

26
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,153
We make every year,

27
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:41,603
at the end of June or July to know if we are going to have our job back, even though we've had a successful year with our students.

28
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:48,249
So we are fighting hard, and to be honest with you, one of the people that have been at the forefront

29
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:04,028
about the actual disgraceful pay that we've been getting.

30
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:09,212
She has attended community meetings.

31
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:16,258
She has went to our school committee meetings and spoke on two occasions.

32
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:25,546
She has rallied with us and we've caught her in life there just supporting our paraprofessionals and supporting our teachers.

33
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,167
And it has meant so much.

34
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:40,412
And she's also let Dancer Mile to speak to school committee members and to let them know how she stands for this and how important it is for her and the community.

35
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,993
And that says so much about who she is.

36
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:55,844
I had the great opportunity to have a talk with her last month about this venture that she is going on.

37
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:05,980
that I saw come from her was just remarkable.

38
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,942
She believes in fair housing.

39
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,903
She believes in the environment.

40
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:17,828
She believes that we need to be able to get paid fair wages.

41
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,911
And she's not into the whole politics of it all.

42
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,588
And that's why I'm standing here with you today.

43
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:34,312
So good luck.

44
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:37,915
You have our support just as well as you've been giving us.
