[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

23
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Reports of committees.

24
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:25,805
[SPEAKER_18]: 25138 and 25139, offered by Councilor Lazaro, Public Health and Community Safety Committee, October 8th, 2025.

25
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:27,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lazaro.

26
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:28,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

27
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:44,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We discussed two resolutions offered by myself and Councilor Sang regarding some work that, the first resolution was about some work that the Health Department is doing, and we were able to get a wonderful update from the Health Department on the services that they're able to offer our residents.

28
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anybody is curious about

29
00:19:49,107 --> 00:20:02,752
[SPEAKER_04]: special services that are offered by the health department's social services coordinator and our outreach coordinator manager of outreach and special programs and the director of the health department.

30
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:07,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you to watch that video on YouTube on the city of Medford's YouTube page.

31
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:19,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It really highlights a lot of the social services that our residents have access to within the health department, especially if somebody might be losing some federal services.

32
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:22,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was nice to get that review.

33
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:30,262
[SPEAKER_04]: We also discussed a resolution about assisting families of people who are arrested by ICE.

34
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:34,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion to approve the report?

35
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,390
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to approve the committee report by Councilor Zaro, seconded by?

36
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,111
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

37
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,331
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

38
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:43,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

39
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:45,592
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

40
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:50,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Communications from the Mayor, 25105, submitted by Mayor Brianna Lingo-Kern.

42
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:54,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins.

43
00:20:58,374 --> 00:20:59,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Behrs.

44
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:01,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a motion to table this until our next regular meeting.

45
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:08,417
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to the table by Vice President Collins, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

46
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:09,177
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

47
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:09,257
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

48
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:10,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

49
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:16,183
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

50
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:28,232
[SPEAKER_18]: 25.155 submitted by Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern, authorization of a five-year contract with Adam Matthew LTD, DBA AM Quartex for digitization of the library's local history collections.

51
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:38,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear President Behrs and City Councilors, I respect the request and recommend that the City Council approves the following five-year contract with Adam Matthew LTD, DBA AM Cortex.

52
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:46,175
[SPEAKER_18]: As the Council is aware, Mass General Law Chapter 30B, Section 12 requires City Council approval for a contract that exceeds three years.

53
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:55,890
[SPEAKER_18]: agreement authorized the city and the library to enter into a five-year agreement under the Bloomberg Digital Innovation Grant to support the digitization of the library's local history collections.

54
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:04,496
[SPEAKER_18]: This initiative requires two specialized vendors, one to handle document scanning and another to develop and maintain a digital web platform to host the digitized materials.

55
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:10,120
[SPEAKER_18]: This contract pertains specifically to the vendor responsible for the creation and ongoing support of the digital platform.

56
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Given the complexity and long-term nature of this project, a five-year service plan is essential

57
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,614
[SPEAKER_18]: While the platform will undergo an initial build, content will be added on a continuous basis well beyond the initial term.

58
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:23,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Local history materials are inherently complex.

59
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:30,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Unlike standard print materials, they include audio-visual content and oral history recordings that require specialized support for proper integration and presentation.

60
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:33,744
[SPEAKER_18]: This platform will serve as a vital and evolving community resource.

61
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:39,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Ensuring a longer-term vendor support is critical to maintaining the platform's functionality, accessibility, and growth over time.

62
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:42,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lungo Kern, Mayor.

63
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,430
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like we have the library director, Barbara Kerr, with us.

64
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:52,517
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to share more, Barbara, and then I have questions from a couple of counselors, but I'll recognize you, Barbara.

65
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:53,798
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

66
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,521
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's pretty much what it says.

67
00:22:57,682 --> 00:22:59,343
[SPEAKER_16]: This is part of our digitization.

68
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:02,486
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are all set with the people who are doing the scanning.

69
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:05,509
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is the company that's going to build the online

70
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:14,761
[SPEAKER_16]: digital asset management program, or DAM, which is an entertaining anagram, but it's not an anagram, initials.

71
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:23,943
[SPEAKER_16]: So we like the idea of the five-year because this is gonna be, it's not gonna just get one bunch of images.

72
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:28,044
[SPEAKER_16]: This is gonna be ongoing and growing and sort of a living website, we hope.

73
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:29,885
[SPEAKER_16]: all sorts of stuff.

74
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:34,989
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're doing an oral history project now, and getting those recordings up is good.

75
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,590
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's a little complex.

76
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:44,436
[SPEAKER_16]: So having helpdesk and the company available for the long term is really important to this project.

77
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:48,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions?

78
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to Councillor Singh.

79
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

80
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the work you do.

81
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:57,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this has been in the pipeline for a while and people are really excited about it.

82
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:14,653
[SPEAKER_06]: When we think about accessing our local history right now, there's an amazing space in the library for it, but outside of going to that space, I think a lot of residents are looking for that extra step and this would provide that extra step of accessibility.

83
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:30,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some, I've been talking to some city staff who are, you know, view this as an opportunity to maybe digitize some of the records that we have in this building that are also local history related or could pertain to our local history.

84
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:39,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if that would be possible under this agreement or if it's just restricted to what's in the library.

85
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:55,639
[SPEAKER_16]: The Bloomberg agreement is specifically what's in the library, but there's no reason we can't digitize other stuff down the road, there are other grant options out there, and we actually purchased a large format scanner so we can do some scanning ourselves.

86
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,284
[SPEAKER_16]: We actually have a Simmons archival intern for a year so that's going to be very helpful.

87
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:08,833
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's a lot I know that I've heard rumors that there's a box of photographs somewhere in this building that no one has ever seen.

88
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:13,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of potential to get things digitized.

89
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:16,679
[SPEAKER_16]: There are we'll look into other grants too.

90
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,303
[SPEAKER_16]: But the Bloomberg agreement is specifically for our stuff.

91
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:27,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guarantee you there's boxes in this building that people would be happy to give to the library.

92
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:28,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Well that's it.

93
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:35,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Well then that like you know Digital Commonwealth, that's the state photo repository, they've run into some trouble.

94
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:46,330
[SPEAKER_16]: some of the major content on there might end up with us, but we don't know because right now they're, Microsoft shut down their site.

95
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,592
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can't see anything.

96
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:55,136
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a great opportunity to get started because we have the largest collection of stuff.

97
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:58,259
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to get the stuff.

98
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,060
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be good to get the stuff so you can see it.

99
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now it's all somewhere in like Maryland, but not all of it, but 12 boxes of it.

100
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of city staff are looking to use some political history in their work, some of the documents there to inform their decision making policies, look back to see what actually pertains to the city and what doesn't, conversations that we had back then to help interpret the policies that we have now.

101
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:32,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And so maybe there's a path down the road somewhere where we build out the program,

102
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:39,340
[SPEAKER_06]: or where some of those documents make their way to the library so that they can get digitized.

103
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,023
[SPEAKER_16]: And this, you can get it, you'll be able to get into remotely too, which is nice.

104
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:50,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the newspaper microfilm is really the main body of information about 20th century Medford.

105
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:56,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And the only way to search it before now was we have a card file, we still have one card file.

106
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:57,958
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is going to be

107
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,000
[SPEAKER_16]: or optical character recognition.

108
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can put in a name and it will pull them out of wherever they can find them.

109
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:09,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is going to be a huge tool for all sorts of research and history.

110
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:12,071
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish we'd had it when I was doing research.

111
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:16,375
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll miss the microfilm machine myself.

112
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:17,857
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to keep it.

113
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:18,878
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to keep it?

114
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:19,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

115
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:19,498
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

116
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:20,239
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fun.

117
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli.

118
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:29,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, thank House President again I just want to just.

119
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:41,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the dark days when we were talking about just getting enough trash barrels to go into different rooms to collect the rainwater coming through our ceilings.

120
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:42,516
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a bad weekend.

121
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:56,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the fact that we're here and we could celebrate what you've done for us before you move on to some enjoyable time in your life, I think that, again, I just wanted

122
00:27:56,903 --> 00:28:01,944
[SPEAKER_10]: make it public that we, you know, we're thanking you for everything that you've done and where we are today.

123
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:07,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would support this initiative and more if needed.

124
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:08,306
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

125
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:10,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

126
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:13,568
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

127
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:15,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

128
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:16,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a quick question.

129
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:25,791
[SPEAKER_12]: It does say under the Bloomberg Digital Innovation Grant, and I just want to check in that that grant is going to pay for the entire five years of the contract?

130
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:26,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

131
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, yes, thank you.

132
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:30,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins.

133
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:37,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for being here to speak to us about this request.

134
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:39,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think I echo what all of my fellow counselors have said.

135
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,241
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this will be really useful operationally for members of city staff.

136
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:56,068
[SPEAKER_15]: But even more so than that, I think that there are a lot of stories in these right now, still analog materials that will be so positive for Medford residents or non-residents who visit the library and people like us.

137
00:28:56,948 --> 00:29:00,990
[SPEAKER_15]: who are investigating the city just to be able to find these materials in various formats.

138
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:10,915
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think that'll be so important for people thinking, you know, stories about Medford, past and present over the years.

139
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:15,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, the oral history project is going to be about collecting Medford memories.

140
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:16,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

141
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:22,520
[SPEAKER_15]: And having those accessible in every contemporary format, I think will be such a gift to future library patrons.

142
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for your work on this.

143
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:25,762
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have motion for approval.

144
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:30,923
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

145
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:32,123
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have a couple questions.

146
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:33,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

147
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:40,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Will eventually library staff be trained to manage the database, the repository at some point?

148
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:42,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes and no.

149
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:46,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we're going to be doing a lot of the building of it, but the

150
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:48,848
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a cloud-based thing.

151
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:55,551
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be doing the maintenance and training and help desk, which is what we're most concerned about.

152
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,673
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll know how it works.

153
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,574
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be not on site.

154
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:07,217
[SPEAKER_18]: And so is it going to live on the library website, or will it be like a link to some other?

155
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:09,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

156
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:13,097
[SPEAKER_16]: I think definitely linked to our website.

157
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:16,640
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not going to be part of our website because it's going to be much bigger.

158
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:24,345
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you want to see sort of a sample, the Cape Ann Historical Society and the Peabody Essex Archives use this company.

159
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:25,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

160
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:28,428
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to make sure we retain the long-term ownership.

161
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:31,010
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we're going to keep the physical files, right?

162
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

163
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,172
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're getting drives from the scanning company.

164
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:34,572
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

165
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:35,393
[SPEAKER_18]: There'll be drives as well.

166
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:35,873
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, great.

167
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:36,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

168
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:40,068
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to approve all those in favor.

169
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed motion passes.

170
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:42,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

171
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:47,860
[SPEAKER_16]: And we should have something up at the beginning early next year.

172
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,161
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the plan.

173
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,164
[SPEAKER_16]: So probably the microfilm.

174
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:51,545
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope.

175
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:52,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

176
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:03,898
[SPEAKER_18]: 25156 submitted by Mayor Brianna Longo Kern, donation acceptance, Beacon Bank for Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission, bicycle safety equipment.

177
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:14,927
[SPEAKER_18]: I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approves under Chapter 44, Section 53A, a donation in the amount of $500 by Beacon Bank to the Bicycle Advisory Commission to help pay for bicycle safety equipment.

178
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:18,910
[SPEAKER_18]: A member of the Bicycle Advisory Commission plans to attend to address the council.

179
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:20,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on up.

180
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:21,693
[SPEAKER_18]: How you doing?

181
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:29,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what's being asked of me, but it was suggested that someone from the commission attend this meeting.

182
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:52,689
[SPEAKER_09]: For the last few years, I have been supplying bicycle light kits to all the children in Medford through the five public schools and our events that have been sourced from overseas at extremely low cost and had been trying to attract patrons

183
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:54,443
[SPEAKER_09]: to offset those costs.

184
00:31:55,324 --> 00:32:19,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has been bureaucratically problematic, I think, in terms of ensuring that payments are made to the city of Medford, passed through me, and then submitted to the development office, who doesn't know what to do with them, and sticks them in the general fund, and eventually reimburses me, like over a year later.

185
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:21,807
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the issue.

186
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:41,955
[SPEAKER_09]: But there has to be some more automatic means for the commission to take payments from patrons that we ask for support to be credited to some account within the city to acknowledge that that is happening.

187
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:47,023
[SPEAKER_09]: As well, we have a very limited budget of only $1,500 a year.

188
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:57,626
[SPEAKER_09]: That's approximately the cost of the 500 bike-like kits that we supply each year to the kids.

189
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:07,509
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be starting a campaign now to try to get bicycle helmets on all the children in the city.

190
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,170
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a larger expense

191
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:17,866
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm hoping to attract more corporate patrons for that activity and ramp up in the next year.

192
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:28,973
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to have some means of taking donations given to us to be credited to us somehow through the city.

193
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:33,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure what the proposal is for you on the floor or how it works.

194
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:40,020
[SPEAKER_09]: This seems to be a little bit more of a bureaucratic boondoggle than anything that

195
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:44,445
[SPEAKER_09]: we in the Humboldt Commission understand.

196
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:47,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you.

197
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:48,648
[SPEAKER_18]: It often is.

198
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:56,134
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is to accept a donation from Beacon Bank for $500?

199
00:33:56,554 --> 00:34:03,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, which they've been giving to us for the last three years and has been credited to the city and somehow

200
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,841
[SPEAKER_09]: It disappears.

201
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:20,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It has sort of nothing to do with whether I get reimbursed or not, or that our account, which is loosely regarded, is credited to.

202
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:20,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

203
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So that donation's not going to the line of... Yeah, the donation isn't going to us specifically.

204
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:26,813
[SPEAKER_09]: To the line of... We don't care.

205
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,495
[SPEAKER_09]: We just need to know what to do.

206
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:36,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we are being careful that any donations given to us are to the city.

207
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:38,555
[SPEAKER_09]: The checks are made out to the city.

208
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:40,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I give them to Alicia Hunt.

209
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:42,417
[SPEAKER_09]: She doesn't know what to do with them.

210
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,498
[SPEAKER_09]: They end up in the general fund.

211
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:51,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it comes time to pay the piper for the product, and she has to scurry for funds.

212
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:58,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something more internal to the city's bureaucracies that, frankly, the commission doesn't care about.

213
00:34:58,444 --> 00:34:59,765
[SPEAKER_09]: But we want to make it easy.

214
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:15,325
[SPEAKER_09]: for us to continue to exist and to buy supplies for our activities, especially for providing safety lights and helmets to the children in the city.

215
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:19,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that really shouldn't be as complicated as it is.

216
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:22,320
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a line item, it's pretty ridiculous.

217
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know why we're here.

218
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:25,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

219
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:32,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, this piece of it is that the state law requires that we approve all donations to the city, which I think we are more than happy to do.

220
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:41,355
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think it has also advised us that I think continuing ongoing problems of why, you know, there's a line item for the Bicycle Commission.

221
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,009
[SPEAKER_18]: That means there's an account in the system for the Bicycle Commission.

222
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,871
[SPEAKER_18]: They should just put this in there.

223
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,814
[SPEAKER_18]: That would make things much easier, wouldn't it?

224
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not aware that there's an actual account.

225
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we're bequeathed $1,500 a year.

226
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:55,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

227
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:55,562
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a...

228
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:07,599
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a line item, doesn't mean there's a bank account, but there's an account within the city's chart of accounts for you guys, because we see it every year.

229
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:12,042
[SPEAKER_18]: So it shouldn't be that hard to use that number when they deposit these funds.

230
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:23,192
[SPEAKER_18]: So would anybody be open to putting an amendment on this paper to just request confirmation that this donation was placed into the Bicycle Commission's proper account?

231
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:28,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Sang moved to amend, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

232
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Vice President Collins.

233
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:35,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here.

234
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:45,587
[SPEAKER_15]: And in addition to the small donation that we've called you forward to discuss, I think it's I think we're all very appreciative to know that there's a bit of a bureaucratic

235
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:49,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the acoustics are pretty bad.

236
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:54,258
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say thank you for giving voice to this bureaucratic issue that you've been having.

237
00:36:54,438 --> 00:37:03,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm glad that we can try and raise this to the administration to make future donation acceptances a little bit easier for the MBAC and hopefully for other commissions as well in the future.

238
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:10,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, this shouldn't be hard, and especially when you're talking about taking in donations so that you can buy helmets for kids, buy safety kits and distribute them into the community.

239
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,688
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we all want to make that as seamless as possible.

240
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:15,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for raising that as well while you're here.

241
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:34,723
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm glad that Beacon Bank is helping out a little bit getting more safety supplies into the community would really appreciate all of the work that the Bicycle Commission does to not just raise the profile of cycling in the city but also make people who are cycling doing it more safely, every year, much appreciated.

242
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:36,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I would motion to approve.

243
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:43,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

244
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:47,809
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ernest Meunier, M-E-U-N-I-E-R.

245
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:51,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in the commission, obviously, and so for yours.

246
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:52,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

247
00:37:54,872 --> 00:38:00,355
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to approve as amended by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

248
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:07,059
[SPEAKER_18]: And the amendment is to get confirmation that this gets deposited into the Bicycle Commission account.

249
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:07,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

250
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:08,600
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

251
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

252
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:11,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's general law.

253
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:12,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

254
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:17,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Callahan?

255
00:38:17,023 --> 00:38:17,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:21,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lemmon?

261
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:22,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

262
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:24,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scapello?

263
00:38:24,365 --> 00:38:24,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

264
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:25,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Seng?

265
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:25,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

266
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:27,505
[SPEAKER_11]: President Beers?

267
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:30,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I have an affirmative, none on the negative, the motion passes.

268
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:36,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably we should.

269
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:38,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you motion to reconsider?

270
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:45,149
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion to reconsider paper 25155 by Councilor Seng, seconded by?

271
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:48,523
[SPEAKER_18]: by Vice President Collins.

272
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:49,524
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

273
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:50,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

274
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:51,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

275
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:54,387
[SPEAKER_18]: And now someone.

276
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:02,633
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion to approve 25155 by Councilor Singh, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

277
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:03,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

278
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:07,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Callahan?

279
00:39:07,717 --> 00:39:07,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

280
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:09,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins?

281
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:10,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

282
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:11,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lazaro?

283
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:11,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

284
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lemming?

285
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

286
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:14,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scapelli?

287
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:14,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

288
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:16,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Singh?

[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have any questions from members of the Council?

00:41:58,231 --> 00:41:58,912
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

335
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:00,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

336
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:01,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes. 25161.

337
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:24,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas the voters of Bedford will vote yes or no on a ballot question on November 4th, 2025 regarding a new charter for the city, whereas the proposed charter was formulated by an 11 member resident committee after extensive review process with public engagement research interviews with city officials and guidance from the Collins Center for public management, whereas the charter was then reviewed by the city council mayor, state legislature and signed by the governor.

338
00:42:25,895 --> 00:42:37,952
[SPEAKER_18]: And whereas the ballot question is the final step in implementation of Medford's proposed charter, be it resolved that Medford City Council inform voters of Medford about said ballot question, how to find the text of the ballot question, and where to read the proposed charter.

339
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:38,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Scarpelli.

340
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:40,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

341
00:42:40,796 --> 00:42:41,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I think

342
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:52,312
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, I think, a resolution and an initiative that I think is something that our city is starving for.

343
00:42:52,452 --> 00:43:04,398
[SPEAKER_10]: With so many issues and concerns that divide this community, here's a resolution and here's a cause that was done the right way.

344
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:09,981
[SPEAKER_10]: It was done with an organization that was put together

345
00:43:11,827 --> 00:43:28,365
[SPEAKER_10]: with a multiple diverse group of people that went out and spoke to every different corner of the community and sharing the opinions of how people felt and what they wanted to see in the city's charter, something we haven't done in many, many, many years.

346
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:41,612
[SPEAKER_10]: followed up with the call-in center, the professionals in the field, and making sure that we followed all the bylaws and rules that were needed as you move forward with this charter.

347
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:56,017
[SPEAKER_10]: As we can see in the election year, you see, for me, the biggest piece is how difficult it is to have an election when you have seven at-large seats and you have 14 candidates running at-large.

348
00:43:56,995 --> 00:43:59,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes it very difficult to people to get their word out.

349
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:02,180
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes it very difficult to have a more diverse council.

350
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:06,125
[SPEAKER_10]: And this initiative speaks directly to that.

351
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:10,269
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm excited for the fact that this is on the ballot.

352
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:29,244
[SPEAKER_10]: but I would ask my colleagues to join me in solidarity of all seven of us moving to unanimously support the charter initiative like we've already have and then move with motioning that the mayor does everything possible.

353
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:37,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I would recommend a robo call to every resident, letting them know where they'll find the ballot question.

354
00:44:38,287 --> 00:45:07,187
[SPEAKER_10]: um uh maybe a synopsis in the ballot question and we do our due diligence to make sure that our residents are aware that this isn't just an election for city council and school committee but for an initiative that will truly support our community that that has seen a lot of division and use uh this this uh initiative to really bring this city together and I think um voted in

355
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:35,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's an initiative that would really polarize Medford for many many more years in in such a positive way that we can now focus on having representation in every single ward and precinct so people know exactly who they can go to when they need help and there are no questions and no confusion because we see it as we we walk the streets and and ask people for our votes today and we

356
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:37,108
[SPEAKER_10]: across the whole community.

357
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:43,791
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not an easy thing to do, and some people can do it because they have a lot of money, and they can get their message out.

358
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:50,333
[SPEAKER_10]: They can mail four or five mailers to 20,000 people, and it resonates.

359
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:51,253
[SPEAKER_10]: That helps.

360
00:45:51,914 --> 00:46:00,777
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you're talking about a fair election, fair process, you're looking at board representation, really making our council

361
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:07,282
[SPEAKER_10]: a more diverse group that really represents our community in the truest form.

362
00:46:07,382 --> 00:46:10,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank my councilors for your support.

363
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:21,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we would motion for the mayor to not once, maybe a few times send out a reverse 911 informing our residents that

364
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:28,279
[SPEAKER_10]: this initiative is on the ballot to really come out and vote in favor of this initiative.

365
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:35,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I know possibly not in favor or against it, but just to inform everybody that this is what the question is.

366
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:42,269
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why we have this option and to come out and vote for or against it.

367
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:42,829
[SPEAKER_10]: But

368
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:50,135
[SPEAKER_10]: represent that vote that you have for something, like I said, that we haven't done in, oh, many, many years.

369
00:46:50,235 --> 00:47:04,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I say it again, for Melva McDonald and her team, I think many thanks go to that because Melva crossed many different lines and she brought a lot of people together for a cause.

370
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:12,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether you believed it or not, it was an avenue where people listened to each other and then agreed to disagree or agreed to agree.

371
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:16,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And to me, I think that's what we're striving for in the city of Medford.

372
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:21,336
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a great way to kick off a new initiative.

373
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:23,017
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Council President.

374
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:25,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

375
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

376
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:28,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

377
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:29,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I support this.

378
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:31,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I second the Councilor's motion.

379
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's always better when residents know what's on the ballot and have more information about it.

380
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,401
[SPEAKER_06]: This is certainly an important question for our future.

381
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:43,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

382
00:47:43,855 --> 00:47:53,383
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to request that the mayor do a robocall and other means to get information out about the charter ballot.

383
00:47:54,284 --> 00:47:55,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Website, robocall.

384
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:03,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Got it.

385
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:04,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Seng.

386
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:05,293
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

387
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:06,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

388
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:08,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

389
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:14,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we have solicitor Foley with us.

[SPEAKER_18]: 25158, submitted by Mayor Brannon O'Kern.

391
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Approval of funding for law department claim over $2,500, safety insurance company for $3,000.

392
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:30,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Law Department file 25-5, date of accident, July 2nd, 2024.

393
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Date of settlement, September 25th, 2025.

394
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Amount of request, $3,000.

395
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:42,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Going to the claimant name, Safety Insurance Company, ASO Angelo Fiorentino v. City of Medford.

396
00:48:43,560 --> 00:49:00,793
[SPEAKER_18]: The claimant, Safety, a subrogee of Angelo Fiorentino, initially sought reimbursement of damages of $5,341.19 paid to its insured Angelo Fiorentino for damages to a motor vehicle as a result of an incident involving a Department of Public Works vehicle at the intersection of Bradbury Avenue and 3rd Street, Medford, MA on or about July 2, 2024.

397
00:49:00,973 --> 00:49:05,837
[SPEAKER_18]: City DPW confirmed the accident and the liability of the Medford DPW.

398
00:49:06,517 --> 00:49:09,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Safety has agreed to accept 3,000 total to resolve the claim.

399
00:49:09,138 --> 00:49:11,258
[SPEAKER_18]: The necessary lease will be obtained from safety.

400
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:20,900
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will recognize the city solicitor should be able to turn on your video, Kevin, and I'll ask you to unmute.

401
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:31,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, members of the council, can you hear me okay?

402
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:32,982
[SPEAKER_18]: We can hear you.

403
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:34,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Solicitor Foley, good to hear from you.

404
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:35,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for having me.

405
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:40,550
[SPEAKER_08]: As you mentioned, this is a case that preceded a claim that preceded my time in the city of Medford.

406
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:48,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to credit KP Law who came to this arrangement and this resolution, which is a great deal lower than what the damages were.

407
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:55,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping that the council will act favorably upon the request to allow this.

408
00:49:58,885 --> 00:49:59,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, solicitor.

409
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have any questions for the city solicitor?

410
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:07,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing, oh, go to Vice President Collins.

411
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:13,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I have no questions for the solicitor, but this seems reasonable to me and I would motion to approve.

412
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:18,372
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion by Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:56,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Petitioner name, Andrew Castanetti, October 16th, 2025.

431
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,352
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will recognize Mr. Castanetti.

432
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,829
[SPEAKER_18]: at the podium for three minutes.

433
00:51:22,856 --> 00:51:25,177
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Andrew Castanetti, the floor is yours.

434
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Baez.

435
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:30,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, City Councilors.

436
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:33,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Andrew Paul Castanetti.

437
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:37,171
[SPEAKER_05]: of Cushion Street, East Medford.

438
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:41,215
[SPEAKER_05]: First, let me start on a positive note.

439
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:53,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Must thank whoever is responsible for repairing our Crystal Campbell Marathon Memorial Water Fountain at the Senior Citizen Center on Riverside Avenue.

440
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:54,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

441
00:51:55,837 --> 00:52:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, thanks for the DOT, I believe it's Department of Transportation, for cutting down those wild trees at Roosevelt Circle.

442
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,942
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a major, major safety problem at the worst intersection in Medford.

443
00:52:15,142 --> 00:52:22,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three, after 24 years of fighting Department of Recreation, DOR, and

444
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,516
[SPEAKER_05]: eight condo owners in court.

445
00:52:28,297 --> 00:52:34,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally have our Clippership Connector bike path all the way to Memphis Square.

446
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:49,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am pleasantly shocked they did it the right way within 20 feet of mean high tide as required by riparian rights law from a colonial law

447
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:53,979
[SPEAKER_05]: in 1641.

448
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:57,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos to all.

449
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,701
[SPEAKER_05]: We thank you a lot.

450
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And now tonight I'm starting on my fourth mission to help out all of the East Medford residents by stopping geographical discrimination in East Medford Mass.

451
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:27,495
[SPEAKER_05]: One, in 1960, you may recall the Department of Transportation built Interstate Route 93 by Eminence O'Maine.

452
00:53:28,935 --> 00:53:38,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Route 93 split the city in half, destroyed many homes and the old cemetery, et cetera.

453
00:53:40,481 --> 00:53:42,822
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I must thank State Rep.

454
00:53:44,203 --> 00:53:45,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul J. Donato Sr.

455
00:53:46,304 --> 00:53:47,204
[SPEAKER_05]: for installing

456
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:52,837
[SPEAKER_05]: one sound barrier on the west side of Route 93.

457
00:53:53,677 --> 00:54:01,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But we the people also need our own East Medford sound barrier to stop us suffering since 1960.

458
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:09,847
[SPEAKER_05]: The noise is terrible, 24 hours a day and especially at night.

459
00:54:10,728 --> 00:54:16,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And the pollution also sucks as we're sucking in diesel fumes.

460
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:21,747
[SPEAKER_05]: This is very unfair and unhealthy, in my opinion.

461
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:27,108
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past 65 years, it's been going on.

462
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:31,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Please stop our suffering on the east side of town.

463
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:37,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Build our wall now, or yesterday would still be better still.

464
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:41,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not blaming anyone, because I love everyone.

465
00:54:43,282 --> 00:54:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you know, I always do what as I please.

466
00:54:47,624 --> 00:55:03,251
[SPEAKER_05]: In closing, I have started a signature petition to build our East Memphis sound barrier and reverse, stop the geographical discrimination against all 10 to 20,000 East Memphis residents.

467
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:04,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

468
00:55:05,112 --> 00:55:06,753
[SPEAKER_05]: We need our barrier.

469
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:10,715
[SPEAKER_05]: We want our barrier now, period.

470
00:55:11,672 --> 00:55:17,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, I'm offering you honorable city councilors this opportunity to sign my petition now.

471
00:55:19,756 --> 00:55:27,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And the noise is bad, bad, and the pollution sucks too.

472
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you if you're listening.

473
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Route 93 was built in 1960.

474
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:32,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Today is October 21st, 2025.

475
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:33,862
[SPEAKER_05]: That was 64 and a half years ago.

476
00:55:41,692 --> 00:55:43,193
[SPEAKER_05]: You suffered long enough.

477
00:55:51,336 --> 00:55:52,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more time left?

478
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,918
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you're over, but- Thank you.

479
00:55:55,078 --> 00:55:55,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

480
00:55:55,638 --> 00:56:00,880
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to sign the petition, if any of you want to raise your hand, I'll pass it on my own.

481
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,601
[SPEAKER_18]: This is for the 93 Sound Barrier on the east side?

482
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:04,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'll sign it.

483
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of takers.

484
00:56:07,003 --> 00:56:07,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

485
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:13,719
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have anyone else in the chamber or on Zoom who'd like to speak for public participation?

486
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:24,026
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll go to the podium.

487
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:26,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record.

488
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:27,729
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have three minutes.

489
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,271
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I think there's someone who's having an issue on Zoom.

490
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:31,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll take them next.

491
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:34,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Time is yours.

492
00:56:35,388 --> 00:56:36,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Nick Gioleo, 40 Robinson Road.

493
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,989
[SPEAKER_14]: So first, I just want to ask a question.

494
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a procedural question.

495
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:46,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just curious why the mayor's veto of the values aligned ordinance was tabled tonight.

496
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:47,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there a procedural reason for that?

497
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:52,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins made a motion to table.

498
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:55,855
[SPEAKER_18]: You're eating into your time.

499
00:56:57,135 --> 00:56:57,415
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

500
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone have an answer or no?

501
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:02,217
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

502
00:57:03,914 --> 00:57:08,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I don't know it off the top of my head, but I could look it up.

503
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the Charter has a limit.

504
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,701
[SPEAKER_15]: I said I wanted more time to think about it.

505
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:13,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I had to get into my head.

506
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:14,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

507
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:21,168
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the Charter has a limit in which the time a veto may be overridden.

508
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:21,628
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

509
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone know that off the top of their head?

510
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:34,869
[SPEAKER_18]: My understanding is that the mayor has 10 days to consider, but that there's not a time limit under general law for considering the response.

511
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:35,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

512
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:37,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I can, I could look that up.

513
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:38,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone could.

514
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:48,055
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the last thing I'll say is, with Councilor Scarpelli's resolution I don't believe there was a public comment on that but I just wanted to voice my support for it.

515
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:55,231
[SPEAKER_14]: and say that I think the charter, first of all, I think it's good to just educate the public in general as to what a charter is.

516
00:57:55,831 --> 00:57:59,893
[SPEAKER_14]: My conversation with people, a lot of people don't even know what a charter is as like a legal instrument.

517
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:06,957
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's good to kind of educate on that as well as this process of how we got to this point on voting on it.

518
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:10,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So I like this idea of educating as well as just what it is.

519
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very long document.

520
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,781
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that our current charter

521
00:58:15,457 --> 00:58:20,680
[SPEAKER_14]: because it's a planned form of government, you know, it's essentially just taken directly from the general laws.

522
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,802
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of like in several different places.

523
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:28,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's kind of hard to understand, you know, what is our charter now and what will it become later on?

524
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:35,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's a good idea to really emphasize the differences between what we have now and what will come later.

525
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:40,853
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, beyond the obvious switch to ward representation, some of maybe the more subtle differences.

526
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:43,275
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know the charter committee has done a lot of work

527
00:58:43,775 --> 00:58:44,895
[SPEAKER_14]: educating people on that.

528
00:58:44,915 --> 00:58:46,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely praise them for that.

529
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:48,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And hope they'll continue to do that.

530
00:58:48,897 --> 00:58:51,858
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope the council will assist with that process as well.

531
00:58:52,118 --> 00:58:52,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

532
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:54,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

533
00:58:54,539 --> 00:59:01,922
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to recognize on Zoom, Steve Schnapp.

534
00:59:02,302 --> 00:59:05,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Steve, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

535
00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:08,449
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

536
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:11,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave in Medford Square.

537
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:24,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna mention in case anyone doesn't know, Gotta Know Medford, the local digital news outlet published a long article explaining about this city charter.

538
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,622
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really worth looking at, very informative.

539
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:27,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

540
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:30,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Steve.

541
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:35,049
[SPEAKER_18]: I will go back to the podium, then we'll come back to Zoom.

542
00:59:36,629 --> 00:59:38,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

543
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,190
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have three minutes.

544
00:59:40,151 --> 00:59:40,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

545
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:43,533
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Michael Kesselman and I'm at 499 Main Street.

546
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:56,720
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to make some quick comments about the mayor's own comments about the values aligned investment ordinance.

547
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,062
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not gonna get into this sort of litany of

548
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:09,015
[SPEAKER_13]: gaslighting and revisionist disinformation about the history of the drafting of the ordinance.

549
01:00:09,555 --> 01:00:16,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, I think that stakeholders will put together a packet to provide more detailed information on that.

550
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:26,284
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did want to take a quick moment to address some of these references brought up in the KP law letter that was submitted in the opinion and analysis in that.

551
01:00:27,264 --> 01:00:30,926
[SPEAKER_13]: So to be clear, the KP law opinion

552
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:37,878
[SPEAKER_13]: focused on three legal items and a fourth implementation issue.

553
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:42,223
[SPEAKER_13]: The three legal items were MGL chapter 4455B.

554
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,546
[SPEAKER_13]: The second one was the MGL chapter 4455B.

555
01:00:49,903 --> 01:00:54,347
[SPEAKER_13]: effectively, the Prudent Investors Act, and I'll get into that in a second.

556
01:00:54,647 --> 01:01:01,213
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the third thing when it comes to the legal issues that they brought up was existing Medford ordinances.

557
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:15,184
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some significant issues with what the opinion said, and that it didn't provide actionable, accurate analysis that can actually lead to something happening.

558
01:01:15,845 --> 01:01:16,005
[SPEAKER_13]: So

559
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:36,573
[SPEAKER_13]: MGL chapter 455B, or chapter 4455B, it does require, it does put a fiduciary duty upon the treasurers and holders of the accounts.

560
01:01:37,313 --> 01:01:42,215
[SPEAKER_13]: However, in the language itself, and this is something that the opinion glosses over,

561
01:01:44,362 --> 01:01:49,185
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of weight is given to the best yields reasonably available.

562
01:01:50,066 --> 01:01:55,509
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is no expectation, there can't be an expectation of clairvoyance.

563
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:08,458
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously the intention is that within the meets and bounds of what you know about the investments, you have to try and get the best

564
01:02:10,124 --> 01:02:15,908
[SPEAKER_13]: return reasonably available, reasonably does a lot of heavy lifting in a sentence like that.

565
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:20,771
[SPEAKER_13]: That means that you have to look at what the history of similar style ordinances would be.

566
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:30,717
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look at ordinances like this across the country, they have performed at least at the same rate as market, if not exceeded S&P 500 by

567
01:02:33,323 --> 01:02:35,364
[SPEAKER_13]: some years double digit percentages.

568
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:45,248
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is wildly inaccurate to say that there is an inherent violation of this particular mass general law.

569
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:51,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Moreover, I'm going to go into a little bit about the language around the PIA.

570
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:53,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm keeping this really high level.

571
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,913
[SPEAKER_18]: So the PIA issue, you've got like 20 seconds.

572
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:56,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

573
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:56,694
[SPEAKER_13]: The PIA

574
01:02:57,951 --> 01:03:05,173
[SPEAKER_13]: was not legally implicated in the ordinance, it is not legally implicated in the draft, it was used as an exemplary language as a reference point.

575
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:18,596
[SPEAKER_13]: So to state that it is legally implicated without explaining why is more than a little bonkers, and not the greatest lawyering I've ever seen.

576
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:19,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally,

577
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:32,705
[SPEAKER_13]: existing Medford ordinances, the existing ordinance that was referenced in the analysis, very clearly gives a lot of latitude for investment decisions.

578
01:03:33,465 --> 01:03:41,187
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is, there's no inherent basis to say that this would in any way interfere with that.

579
01:03:42,147 --> 01:03:47,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the final aspect that was brought up is that they have stated that it's impractical because it's too vague.

580
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,710
[SPEAKER_13]: However, as I'm sure this council knows,

581
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:54,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford residents should know and understand.

582
01:03:55,248 --> 01:04:04,614
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of diligence went into the drafting of the ordinance, including talking to staff and ensuring that they were able to actually put it into practice.

583
01:04:04,714 --> 01:04:06,535
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is simply wrong.

584
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:08,436
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll take you back at the end, thank you.

585
01:04:08,696 --> 01:04:09,557
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's it for that, thanks.

586
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:14,340
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'll go to Zoom, then we'll come back to the podium.

587
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to Robert Carney on Zoom.

588
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:18,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Robert, name and address for the record, please.

589
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,303
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have three minutes.

590
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:27,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Robert Carney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6, offering public comment on the tabled values-based ordinance.

591
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,982
[SPEAKER_17]: I work for a values-based investing manager in Boston.

592
01:04:31,522 --> 01:04:41,908
[SPEAKER_17]: I started implementing values-based investing in my personal portfolio in 2019, and my wife and I both invest our entire portfolios in that manner as much as possible.

593
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:53,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Since 2014, I have worked in roles connected to asset management slash treasury and have also completed my MBA at Cornell with an immersion in investment research and asset management.

594
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:58,075
[SPEAKER_17]: My comments today are mine and mine alone and don't represent the views of my employer.

595
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:04,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Today, I speak in violation to the ordinance and by opposition to the ordinance in its current state.

596
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:10,740
[SPEAKER_17]: There are many reasons I'm opposed, but I want to speak about my concerns about the practicality of it.

597
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Here is one example.

598
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:19,686
[SPEAKER_17]: It prohibits investing in companies that are complicit in physical abuse, displacement, or other human rights violations.

599
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:26,752
[SPEAKER_17]: According to Good Jobs First, Home Depot, a store that many of us probably frequent, has paid out over $110 million

600
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:33,517
[SPEAKER_17]: and wage and hour violations over a certain time period that is listed on Good Jobs First.

601
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:37,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Wage and hour violations could be considered a human rights violation.

602
01:05:38,221 --> 01:05:41,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Will the treasurer be forced to divest from a company like Home Depot?

603
01:05:42,344 --> 01:05:43,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't get me wrong,

604
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:49,997
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to invest in companies personally that don't respect human rights, but we need more specificity on this point.

605
01:05:50,537 --> 01:06:01,529
[SPEAKER_17]: When determining what is considered a human rights violation, how do you distinguish from systemic injustice and unethical behavior versus human error and honest mistakes?

606
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,851
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also concerned about the timeline of the divestment.

607
01:06:05,272 --> 01:06:10,794
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems aggressive to ask for the treasurer to divest from problematic companies by the end of the year.

608
01:06:11,455 --> 01:06:13,136
[SPEAKER_17]: That's just a little over two months away.

609
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:14,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you asked the treasurer?

610
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:20,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I've heard this council's concern that what not to do is not as constructive as what to do.

611
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:30,925
[SPEAKER_17]: To that end, I'd be more interested in considering this ordinance if the word complicit was changed to directly involved and if we had definition of what that means.

612
01:06:31,645 --> 01:06:37,207
[SPEAKER_17]: and that the ordinance listed specific companies to divest from, such as what is done in Portland, Oregon.

613
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:50,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally, I thought Judy Beatrice of the Commission of Trust Funds made some great points at an earlier council meeting, and I want to know if you've taken her up on her offer to speak to her about her questions and concerns.

614
01:06:51,293 --> 01:06:57,616
[SPEAKER_17]: For these and many other reasons, I hope you won't override the mayor's veto and that you will address the mayor's concerns.

615
01:06:57,996 --> 01:06:58,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

616
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:01,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

617
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:05,401
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to the podium.

618
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:07,383
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

619
01:07:07,643 --> 01:07:09,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'll have three minutes.

620
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:13,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Patrick Clark in 14 Bennett Place.

621
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:25,617
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just wanted to talk about something related to Andrew Castanetti's point and the petition that he was putting forward on geographic discrimination in East Medford.

622
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:29,180
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to share some of my experience over the last couple of months

623
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,421
[SPEAKER_19]: talking to people.

624
01:07:31,021 --> 01:07:46,113
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the impression that I get is that South Medford and North Medford get a disproportionate amount of the attention in Medford, and that's largely because South Medford is urban, and therefore has a disproportionate amount of the problems you know rodents and

625
01:07:47,465 --> 01:07:51,106
[SPEAKER_19]: landlord tenant relations and various other problems.

626
01:07:52,247 --> 01:07:59,109
[SPEAKER_19]: North Medford has more of the homeowners and therefore disproportionately more of the income and the tax base.

627
01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:10,073
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what I've experienced is people in West Medford and East Medford saying that they feel like they kind of get the shaft that they don't get as much attention.

628
01:08:10,693 --> 01:08:15,715
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that the charter that's on the table for November is a step in the right direction.

629
01:08:15,855 --> 01:08:23,717
[SPEAKER_19]: But considering we don't know what exactly is going to happen with that, I think it would make sense to consider in both cases.

630
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:37,182
[SPEAKER_19]: If we do get a new charter, if we don't get a new charter, how we proceed in a way that really brings all the different parts of the city together so that their problems and their concerns are considered fairly.

631
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:37,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

632
01:08:39,423 --> 01:08:39,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

633
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone else who wants to speak in public participation?

634
01:08:45,974 --> 01:08:48,475
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a yes.

635
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:50,977
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we've got someone for the podium.

636
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:54,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

637
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:55,500
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

638
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:58,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, David Rich from West Medford.

639
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to address the so-called values ordinance.

640
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:04,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the mayor did the right thing.

641
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:06,527
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is whether you will.

642
01:09:07,552 --> 01:09:13,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I share many of the values that the council is trying to advance with respect to the ordinance.

643
01:09:13,842 --> 01:09:16,826
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, many people in Memphis do not share them.

644
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:18,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my money.

645
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not your money.

646
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:21,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our money.

647
01:09:21,894 --> 01:09:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Our, meaning not OR.

648
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:26,583
[SPEAKER_07]: our meaning, the taxpayers of the city of Medford.

649
01:09:27,544 --> 01:09:39,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So the responsibility of the council, of the treasurer, of the mayor, with respect to the money, is to handle it reasonably, and to the extent it's invested, to invest it in compliance with state law.

650
01:09:40,413 --> 01:09:41,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is the state law?

651
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:46,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to hire KP Law, use taxpayer money, get an opinion, and ignore it.

652
01:09:47,457 --> 01:09:47,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what it is.

653
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:59,293
[SPEAKER_07]: The state laws chapter 44, the Massachusetts municipal finance statute, section 54, 55B, it's titled investment of public funds.

654
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:02,196
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not ambiguous, it's very clear.

655
01:10:02,576 --> 01:10:04,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna read to all of you from the statute.

656
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:15,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, all monies held in the name of a city shall be invested in such a manner as to require the payment of interest on the money

657
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:23,161
[SPEAKER_07]: at the highest possible rate reasonably available, taking account of safety, liquidity, and yield.

658
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:26,103
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the state law.

659
01:10:27,405 --> 01:10:32,849
[SPEAKER_07]: The ordinance that's under consideration that the mayor vetoed is directly conflicts with that law.

660
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,752
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go ahead and pass it, it won't be the operative law.

661
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:37,993
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be it.

662
01:10:38,513 --> 01:10:42,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor, the treasurer, and each of you must comply with state law.

663
01:10:43,497 --> 01:10:43,978
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't,

664
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:55,164
[SPEAKER_07]: If you choose to impose your own personal values on how you use the funds in contravention to the specific unambiguous state law, there are means for enforcement.

665
01:10:56,405 --> 01:11:13,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Those means of enforcement include the mayor or any single citizen of the city walking into the Superior Court and filing a lawsuit, seeking a court order that the individual or individuals who are not complying with state law do so, that the city comply with state law.

666
01:11:14,194 --> 01:11:23,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I find it very hard to believe that almost every single justice on the state Supreme Court is going to enforce the state law, not the city's ordinance.

667
01:11:24,877 --> 01:11:27,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So I share those values that you're seeking to advance.

668
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:30,299
[SPEAKER_07]: But strategically, this is the wrong way.

669
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,180
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the wrong thing to do.

670
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,521
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor did the right thing in vetoing it.

671
01:11:35,101 --> 01:11:38,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Your job is to protect the citizens of the city of Medford,

672
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:49,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And with respect to money, to handle it prudently, in compliance with state law, and with respect to the adoption of ordinances, not to pass ordinances that conflict with state law.

673
01:11:50,064 --> 01:11:50,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It is what it is.

674
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:53,866
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to change the state law, we have state representatives.

675
01:11:54,446 --> 01:11:55,987
[SPEAKER_07]: But this council should not do it.

676
01:11:56,127 --> 01:11:57,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be expensive.

677
01:11:57,788 --> 01:12:02,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if one of the citizens goes into court to challenge it, and they're likely to be successful,

678
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna have to hire a law firm.

679
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:07,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think KP Law is gonna wanna do this.

680
01:12:07,632 --> 01:12:14,917
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already issued an opinion letter that essentially says, cutting out all the other stuff, that the ordinance conflicts with state law.

681
01:12:15,937 --> 01:12:16,878
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't defend you.

682
01:12:16,938 --> 01:12:18,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to hire somebody else.

683
01:12:18,499 --> 01:12:19,699
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't represent yourselves.

684
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,741
[SPEAKER_07]: You would have to hire a lawyer to do it.

685
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:24,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And the chances of success for the city are very slim.

686
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:30,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not saying the values that you're trying to advance are not important.

687
01:12:30,106 --> 01:12:30,546
[SPEAKER_07]: They are.

688
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:32,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that we agree on all of them.

689
01:12:32,919 --> 01:12:35,841
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are other ways to do it, not with the city's money.

690
01:12:36,342 --> 01:12:37,042
[SPEAKER_07]: You were elected.

691
01:12:37,082 --> 01:12:38,403
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a responsibility.

692
01:12:38,523 --> 01:12:40,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to lecture you, but it is what it is.

693
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:43,007
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to meet that responsibility.

694
01:12:44,088 --> 01:12:45,889
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't put the city's funds at risk.

695
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:50,413
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't be passing ordinances that conflict directly with state law.

696
01:12:50,493 --> 01:12:55,497
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, the mayor or any citizen of the city could walk into a court and they will win.

697
01:12:55,817 --> 01:12:56,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

698
01:12:56,398 --> 01:12:56,998
[SPEAKER_18]: We're over time.

699
01:12:57,038 --> 01:12:57,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

700
01:12:58,799 --> 01:13:00,361
[SPEAKER_18]: We have one hand on Zoom.

701
01:13:01,893 --> 01:13:04,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to Ken on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

702
01:13:05,015 --> 01:13:07,557
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

703
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

704
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to change tacks, sorry.

705
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:16,143
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of actually more of a reaching question than anything else.

706
01:13:17,443 --> 01:13:25,289
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, MassDOT's redo of the Salem Street Rotary is amazing, and I love it.

707
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that needs to kind of be stated.

708
01:13:28,829 --> 01:13:50,201
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I have noticed since they have done the repaving is apparently their asphalt truck basically left droplets of asphalt from the rotary all the way, actually all the way to Haynes Square, but kind of really substantially all the way up until Park Street where the school is.

709
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's actually possible for us to maybe get

710
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:58,257
[SPEAKER_02]: them, MassDOT to potentially remediate some of that.

711
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:07,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I know our roads are kind of in a not great state and it may be a way of maybe taking some of the state funds to get them to maybe

712
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:20,491
[SPEAKER_02]: fix or do a slight quick repave of at least from Salem Street all the way to the Roberts to the school as as kind of a whoops we dropped asphalt all over your street.

713
01:14:21,552 --> 01:14:23,834
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea if it's feasible but I figured I would throw it out there.

714
01:14:23,874 --> 01:14:27,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's potentially useful if we can get away with it.

715
01:14:27,377 --> 01:14:27,698
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

716
01:14:27,858 --> 01:14:28,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

717
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

718
01:14:34,835 --> 01:14:35,975
[SPEAKER_18]: We have one more hand on Zoom.

719
01:14:35,995 --> 01:14:36,676
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Munir.

720
01:14:37,496 --> 01:14:41,798
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll recognize you, Munir, for three minutes.

721
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Just requested you to unmute.

722
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,180
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Munir Germanis.

723
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 3 Summit Road.

724
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:57,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I will briefly make a couple of comments about the values-aligned ordinance.

725
01:14:59,784 --> 01:15:01,885
[SPEAKER_01]: The objection of the mayor

726
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:10,767
[SPEAKER_01]: in the form of an email that was sent to a few of the counselors, came one day before the third reading.

727
01:15:11,748 --> 01:15:20,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is after several months, several months of discussion with KP Law and with city officials.

728
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:31,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am a little bit shocked and disappointed that this last minute decision was made

729
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:33,997
[SPEAKER_01]: just before the final vote was made.

730
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:39,699
[SPEAKER_01]: This to me sounds like somebody is playing politics.

731
01:15:41,179 --> 01:15:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, that's all I have to say.

732
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:44,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

733
01:15:46,461 --> 01:15:51,202
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, is there anyone else who hasn't spoken yet in public participation who would like to speak?

734
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:57,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, I'll recognize anyone who spoke already for one more minute.

735
01:16:01,145 --> 01:16:01,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

736
01:16:02,272 --> 01:16:05,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike has been pouring on Main Street so really quickly just going to briefly reply to this.

737
01:16:07,455 --> 01:16:17,537
[SPEAKER_13]: sort of circular axiomatic reasoning that the ordinance violates the state investment law that keeps being repeated again and again and again.

738
01:16:18,517 --> 01:16:35,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Notice, however, that whenever it's stated, no one has given any sort of actual explanation and set forward a reasonable and codable series of steps for how it actually does violate the state law.

739
01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:40,842
[SPEAKER_13]: it is just assumed to violate state law because it impacts investments.

740
01:16:41,002 --> 01:16:57,947
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently, what the mass gen law says between the lines, not in the black letter words of it, is that you just can't make any laws that have anything to do with excluding very, very specifically defined stocks from investment.

741
01:16:58,187 --> 01:16:59,307
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not what it actually says.

742
01:16:59,688 --> 01:16:59,828
[SPEAKER_13]: So

743
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:12,319
[SPEAKER_13]: stop it like provide facts explain your reasoning by the other thing I really quickly want to get to is the mayor clearly engaged in this in bad faith.

744
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:17,925
[SPEAKER_13]: It is crazy that she provided this at the very last minute like moonier said just a minute ago.

745
01:17:20,621 --> 01:17:29,187
[SPEAKER_13]: You can look at what she's done with zoning and see how it is absurd that she's politicized what has not been a political process until these last few months.

746
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:38,774
[SPEAKER_13]: And also her continued absolute silence on the fact that we have people being kidnapped off of our city streets.

747
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,256
[SPEAKER_13]: This is crazy.

748
01:17:41,776 --> 01:17:44,719
[SPEAKER_13]: She has been silent and totally ignoring it.

749
01:17:45,339 --> 01:17:46,280
[SPEAKER_13]: That is wild.

750
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:57,479
[SPEAKER_13]: All I can say is that she clearly is not suitable for her position, and I encourage everyone to vote for literally anything else, anyone else.

751
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,281
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be great if she won by like two digit numbers.

752
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:05,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

753
01:18:06,582 --> 01:18:12,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have any other comments for tonight's meeting of the public participation?

754
01:18:14,263 --> 01:18:18,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing no one in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, is there a motion on the floor?

755
01:18:19,411 --> 01:18:22,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion adjourned by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Sang.

756
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:23,678
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

757
01:18:24,559 --> 01:18:24,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

758
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes, the meeting is adjourned.

759
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:26,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
