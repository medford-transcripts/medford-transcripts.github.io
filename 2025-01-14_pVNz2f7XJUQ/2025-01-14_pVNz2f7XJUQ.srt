50
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:50,549
[SPEAKER_02]: member in Tapa.

51
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:56,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

52
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:08,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so it came up the other day about possible conflict of interest due to some familial ties within the schools, especially since we are going into union MTA contract negotiations.

53
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:17,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here to say that after talking with the lawyer of the day with the state, they have advised me that due to the severance of how far

54
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:24,510
[SPEAKER_13]: We are in terms of, you know, being family that and because there's no financial gain on my end.

55
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,337
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing I have to do is file disclosure of appearance of conflict of interest as required by general law 26 a section 23 b3.

56
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:38,350
[SPEAKER_13]: And I basically just have to file that that's been filed with the city clerk and I just have to read this on the floor and then we're fine.

57
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,751
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do not have to abstain from union negotiations with the MTA.

58
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:47,493
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just the thing I have to do in order to actually be a voting member when it comes to that.

59
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:53,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's basically, this is on file with the city clerk, but I basically am just an in-law relative to Ms.

60
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:56,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Jacqueline Gatto, the teacher at the Brooks Elementary.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,101
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a second cousin or first cousin removed.

62
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:02,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not really sure to miss Nicole Sulo, teacher at the books elementary.

63
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:09,764
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also technically a member of the math teachers association, but I'm in the association of professional administrators, which at the state level.

64
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:13,926
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a completely different subgroup than the MTA Medford teachers association.

65
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:19,928
[SPEAKER_13]: My union gets no financial gain from any, you know, negotiations that happen between the city and the teachers.

66
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:21,528
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've read this on the floor.

67
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm fine to continue, but just wanted it in record.

68
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:28,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and if people want to see the full thing, they can contact the city clerk, but thank you.

69
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:28,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

70
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:29,546

[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, do we have any student reps?

74
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:17,723

01:04:28,266 --> 01:04:33,147

141
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:17,201
[SPEAKER_10]: As you all know this is my last school committee meeting in my role as superintendent and Friday is my last day serving in this position at large.

142
01:09:18,402 --> 01:09:23,204
[SPEAKER_10]: These past few weeks have offered an opportunity to reflect on the past seven years.

143
01:09:24,444 --> 01:09:37,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultimately, what I keep coming back to is that the Medford Public Schools are in a better position academically, operationally, social, emotionally, and financially than we were when I joined in 2018.

144
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:49,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Together we created the district's first ever strategic vision built on the ACES model of achievement, collaboration, equity, and support.

145
01:09:50,147 --> 01:10:00,795
[SPEAKER_10]: The vision included district wide alignment on measurements of academic success, alignment on observational and evaluative feedback, and alignment on instructional practice.

146
01:10:01,616 --> 01:10:10,758
[SPEAKER_10]: culminating in the district's new instructional vision, which was presented to the school committee and all MPS staff last fall.

147
01:10:12,299 --> 01:10:24,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I've started, we have hired seven new building principals across our eight schools who are each tremendous in not only what they do, but how they do it and how they treat people.

148
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,703
[SPEAKER_10]: A healthy school climate begins at the top.

149
01:10:28,403 --> 01:10:38,169
[SPEAKER_10]: and I am so appreciative and thankful for the work our building principals and district administrators have done to guide Mustang Nation to where it is today.

150
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:53,639
[SPEAKER_10]: When reflecting on the most unforeseen challenge any of us will ever experience, the COVID-19 pandemic, my mind races back to one of the most famous quotes and messages from Dr. King.

151
01:10:55,222 --> 01:11:10,614
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, his quote, the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy, speaks on how we approach the pandemic.

152
01:11:11,575 --> 01:11:23,324
[SPEAKER_10]: We strived to not only meet the needs of all students, but we specifically championed to have our special education and English language students back in the classroom first.

153
01:11:24,705 --> 01:11:35,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I am immensely proud of the work I have done in this district, in collaboration with so many others, to champion the civil rights and freedoms of all of our students.

154
01:11:36,317 --> 01:11:46,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this work, along with the other wonderful events and goals happening in the district, will continue and grow under the leadership of Dr. Galusi.

155
01:11:47,944 --> 01:11:52,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford is a beautiful place to send your students to school.

156
01:11:53,446 --> 01:12:01,228
[SPEAKER_10]: The work towards building a new Medford High School for the students in the city of Medford has only just begun.

157
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:10,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight's agenda is reserved for explaining how we will use money from the city specifically earmarked to invest in education.

158
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:16,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Last but not least, the educators and staff in our school community

159
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:23,272
[SPEAKER_10]: are all deeply passionate and committed to enhancing the lives of our students.

160
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:30,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Throughout these past few days, I have visited our schools and seen our staff members in action.

161
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:44,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to report they are, of course, doing a terrific job in visiting the schools, though I realized I am going to miss seeing pencils drop on the ground and the artwork that decorates classrooms.

162
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:50,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, even at Medford High School, hearing the word bro 500 times in the hallway.

163
01:12:52,079 --> 01:13:02,286
[SPEAKER_10]: However, these past few days and weeks since the separation announcement was made has truly shown me that the district is in a good place.

164
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:10,031
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a tremendous place to work, to live, and even a better place for students to earn an education.

165
01:13:11,502 --> 01:13:15,970
[SPEAKER_10]: And so as I begin my final week and on the heels of Martin Luther King Jr.

166
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:24,084
[SPEAKER_10]: weekend, I hope I have championed the rights and educational opportunities in a way Dr. King would have been proud.

167
01:13:25,962 --> 01:13:35,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe all students have the right to an equal education across all of our schools through achievement, collaboration, equity, and support.

168
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:41,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I am honored to have worked in a community that strives and works towards those values.

169
01:13:43,718 --> 01:13:51,205
[SPEAKER_10]: So in true Mustang fashion, I will share with you one final poem, the Mustang Alma Mater.

170
01:13:53,154 --> 01:13:57,017
[SPEAKER_10]: by the starry mystic waters flowing to the sea.

171
01:13:58,337 --> 01:14:02,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Rise our hallowed halls of learning, rich in memory.

172
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:13,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Bold traditions, truth and honor, alien to all fears, sheltering our fond ambitions through the toiling years.

173
01:14:14,168 --> 01:14:22,594
[SPEAKER_10]: As we now in contemplation view the scroll of time, hearts astir with recollections, wake in worlds sublime.

174
01:14:23,555 --> 01:14:32,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Sing of many sports triumphant, proms of courtly grace, deepening friendships without number, time cannot erase.

175
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:40,556
[SPEAKER_10]: In honor of final parting, this our prayer shall be, guide our strivings, broaden vision,

176
01:14:41,116 --> 01:14:42,517
[SPEAKER_10]: ordain victory.

177
01:14:43,418 --> 01:14:51,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Thus united, firm in purpose, resolute in might, stand we now in dedication to the truth and right.

178
01:14:52,444 --> 01:15:01,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Hail to these our alma mater, long her praises sing, loyalties to proud traditions we in honor bring.

179
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:05,974
[SPEAKER_10]: As her stalwart sons and daughters hold fond memories bright,

180
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:11,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Join we now united voices to the blue and white.

181
01:15:12,301 --> 01:15:21,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank you again and I am forever grateful for this opportunity to have served this wonderful city for seven years and I too am Medford.

182
01:15:22,173 --> 01:15:22,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

183
01:15:41,254 --> 01:15:48,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Benson, and hopefully anybody that is going to be around will stick around at the end.

184
01:15:48,595 --> 01:15:53,717
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to present you with a gift, and we have a cake to thank you for all you've done over the last seven years.

185
01:15:56,497 --> 01:16:05,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our report on the implementation of the budget reductions included in the 2024-2025 annual school budget.

186
01:16:05,879 --> 01:16:09,220
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be presented by our budget analyst, Mr. Gerald McHugh.

187
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:10,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

188
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:34,224
[SPEAKER_01]: At the request of the school committee, a report was requested to summarize how we implemented the cuts that were adopted in the FY 25 budget.

189
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:38,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do have a copy of the report.

190
01:16:38,645 --> 01:16:44,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go through it and summarize it.

191
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,902
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's acceptable, or if you have questions.

192
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:49,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine.

193
01:16:51,884 --> 01:16:59,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to outline the various categories that we approached these reductions.

194
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:07,355
[SPEAKER_01]: In the elementary schools, we had originally proposed to reduce classroom teachers by five.

195
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:11,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of these positions were added back in the final budget.

196
01:17:15,115 --> 01:17:23,179
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result of an extra allocation of funds from the city for a net reduction of three.

197
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:31,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were basically designed to take into account low enrollment in certain classrooms.

198
01:17:35,302 --> 01:17:43,486
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle school, we reduced two guidance Councilor positions and one physical education position.

199
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:54,852
[SPEAKER_01]: The guidance Councilors reductions were adopted in the final budget and the PE position was eliminated.

200
01:17:56,324 --> 01:18:09,993
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it was not ultimately reduced due to issues around seniority and bumping and couldn't be resolved before the beginning of school.

201
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:14,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So the decision was to go with that position for an additional year.

202
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:21,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be a proposal in the supplemental budget to fund that position in FY25.

203
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:30,101
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school, there was a proposal to reduce classroom teachers by six.

204
01:18:30,642 --> 01:18:34,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of these positions were added back in the final budget for net reduction of four.

205
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Of these, three had become vacant.

206
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:43,016
[SPEAKER_01]: during the course of the year were not replaced.

207
01:18:45,316 --> 01:18:58,439
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the vocational program positions was reduced due to low enrollment and adjustments were made to teaching schedules in FY25 to make sure there was coverage in all classes.

208
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:08,401
[SPEAKER_01]: For administrators, the original proposal was to reduce the administrator ranks by

209
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:15,239
[SPEAKER_01]: by six, four of these were restored in the final budget.

210
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:28,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Two positions coordinating finance and music were consolidated for one of the reductions, returning to a previous management structure.

211
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:32,392
[SPEAKER_01]: To implement this cut,

212
01:19:34,456 --> 01:19:50,247
[SPEAKER_01]: A district wide music teacher was hired to cover some elementary classrooms that the coordinator had covered, and also to take on the director responsibilities for the high school band.

213
01:19:51,507 --> 01:19:56,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding for this teaching position is included in the supplemental budget proposal.

214
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:03,837
[SPEAKER_01]: The other position that was eliminated was the director of professional learning and assessment.

215
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:14,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And this work was distributed among nine administrators for a total of $23,000 in stipends.

216
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:33,008
[SPEAKER_01]: The distribution of that work was by design, so it wouldn't be burdensome on any one particular administrator.

217
01:20:33,388 --> 01:20:42,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those stipends is only through the end of this year and will not be carried into FY 26.

218
01:20:44,857 --> 01:20:47,800
[SPEAKER_01]: For administrative assistance,

219
01:20:50,626 --> 01:20:54,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven positions were supposed to be eliminated.

220
01:20:56,051 --> 01:21:07,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these savings allowed us to convert two 10-month positions to 12-month positions and to create a position that was responsible for transportation.

221
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:22,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we combined certain programs like health services was combined with the guidance program in terms of support.

222
01:21:25,185 --> 01:21:32,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple curriculum departments were handled by one individual instead of two.

223
01:21:34,304 --> 01:21:47,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were four stipends, three stipends created to take on any work that could not be distributed to other administrative assistants.

224
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,083
[SPEAKER_01]: In the total of those stipends, there were three stipends for $950 each.

225
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:55,925
[SPEAKER_01]: for a total of 28,050.

226
01:21:57,867 --> 01:22:07,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, the school committee provided a early retirement program for administrative assistants, which was quite successful.

227
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:12,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And five individuals retired under that program.

228
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:20,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And that meant that we only had to make one layoff out of the administrative assistant ranks.

229
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:29,224
[SPEAKER_01]: For nurses, we had proposed a reduction in nursing staff by four district-wide.

230
01:22:30,305 --> 01:22:42,634
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these positions was added back in the final budget, and we are proposing to add back an additional nurse as part of the supplemental appropriation.

231
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:58,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Other positions included five positions that were formally funded in the ESSA program, two literacy coaches, and three paraprofessional behavior specialists.

232
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:06,768
[SPEAKER_01]: These positions were not originally carried into FY25 under our initial budget proposal.

233
01:23:07,728 --> 01:23:15,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these positions were added back in the final budget due to the additional city funding.

234
01:23:18,482 --> 01:23:24,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that provides you with the context you were interested in, and I'm happy to answer any questions on it.

235
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:26,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

236
01:23:26,649 --> 01:23:27,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

237
01:23:30,553 --> 01:23:31,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

238
01:23:32,134 --> 01:23:33,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Just one quick question or clarification.

239
01:23:33,836 --> 01:23:41,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe the one administrative assistant who was laid off was pretty quickly recalled.

240
01:23:42,497 --> 01:23:43,779
[SPEAKER_17]: to fill an open position.

241
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:44,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

242
01:23:44,721 --> 01:23:45,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?

243
01:23:45,983 --> 01:23:46,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

244
01:23:46,303 --> 01:23:46,904
[SPEAKER_17]: And she declined.

245
01:23:46,924 --> 01:23:47,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

246
01:23:47,265 --> 01:23:54,017
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to make sure that the committee knew that because it happened within like weeks of July one.

247
01:23:54,077 --> 01:23:55,199
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

248
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:58,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Graham.

249
01:23:59,120 --> 01:23:59,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld?

250
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:01,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for this overview.

251
01:24:01,641 --> 01:24:04,502
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I was the one who initially wanted this report.

252
01:24:04,722 --> 01:24:14,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And one thing that I don't see a lot of here and I imagine will be coming up in presumably that some of it is going to be addressed in the supplemental proposal.

253
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:18,607
[SPEAKER_16]: But part of the reason for this report was to inform the fiscal year 26

254
01:24:19,887 --> 01:24:23,328
[SPEAKER_16]: budgets, particularly around the impact on students.

255
01:24:23,468 --> 01:24:28,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I know at the elementary level, it ended up tweaking some of the class sizes.

256
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:34,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Middle schools, I'm still concerned about the loss of the guidance Councilors and bringing that back.

257
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:37,493
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I have a middle schooler I've seen

258
01:24:39,235 --> 01:24:52,261
[SPEAKER_16]: It's working, but I think we've lost some of the aspects of student support because these guidance Councilors are spending their whole time teaching, and it's affecting also other classes in teaching.

259
01:24:53,061 --> 01:24:58,423
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm hoping to see a little more information about the impact on the students.

260
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:19,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham mentioned what was happening with the administrative assistance and the, you know, these stipends were, I talked to a few of the people who received the stipends to cover some of the responsibilities from the Director of Professional Learning and Assessment, and that seems to be working reasonably well.

261
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:21,430
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm curious where you see

262
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:35,096
[SPEAKER_16]: needing to invest in fiscal year 26 for some of the less budgetary impacts, but the student experience.

263
01:25:35,836 --> 01:25:45,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so first of all, this report just really addresses the cuts that were made.

264
01:25:45,564 --> 01:25:53,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the course of the year, we're responding to the needs of the schools as they come up.

265
01:25:53,811 --> 01:26:01,737
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody resigns, if somebody is out long-term and needs coverage.

266
01:26:01,817 --> 01:26:03,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always that.

267
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:14,304
[SPEAKER_01]: that issue when you implement the budget is kind of your best theory of the case when the year starts and then you have to make adjustments as you go along.

268
01:26:14,384 --> 01:26:17,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do make those adjustments when it's necessary.

269
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:29,050
[SPEAKER_01]: For the supplemental budget, we're also at the same time evaluating proposals from the directors and principals.

270
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:32,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of that has informed

271
01:26:32,944 --> 01:26:35,626
[SPEAKER_01]: our supplemental appropriation proposal.

272
01:26:37,428 --> 01:26:44,854
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to identify things that we thought we could get going now versus waiting until July 1st.

273
01:26:46,395 --> 01:26:52,300
[SPEAKER_01]: With respect to the guidance Councilors, that is a proposal from the director.

274
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:58,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're addressing that as part of the FY26 budget.

275
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:02,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's a lot of needs.

276
01:27:02,538 --> 01:27:08,240
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some, I think, exciting new programming too in some areas.

277
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:19,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to crunch all those numbers, get it all together, and then kind of collectively figure out what is affordable or sustainable.

278
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:21,522
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

279
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:34,845
[SPEAKER_16]: That's useful to hear kind of what are the urgent needs that are being addressed by this immediate infusion of override funds, but to note that this is still a conversation that we're having about the next budget.

280
01:27:34,865 --> 01:27:35,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, correct.

281
01:27:35,945 --> 01:27:45,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And with fidelity to the way the questions kind of directed us, we are to make the investments.

282
01:27:45,728 --> 01:27:45,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

283
01:27:46,488 --> 01:27:46,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

284
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:50,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

285
01:27:50,664 --> 01:27:58,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go on to number three, which is also a presentation by you, our supplemental appropriation presentation.

286
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:38,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide.

287
01:28:39,924 --> 01:28:46,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is two sums of money that were approved by the voters.

288
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:49,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Question seven provided the $3.5 million, $3 million to the schools.

289
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:11,523
[SPEAKER_01]: for operational costs, but called out certain areas, funding for the cost of teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and regular facilities maintenance.

290
01:29:12,963 --> 01:29:18,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Another $5,000 was directed to the city's Department of Public Works.

291
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:20,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Question eight.

292
01:29:22,526 --> 01:29:34,632
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically provided for compensation for teachers and paraprofessionals, funds that might be needed to develop a new high school schedule.

293
01:29:36,853 --> 01:29:38,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a schedule, thank you.

294
01:29:38,854 --> 01:29:48,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a schedule will be designed to improve access to the arts and vocational programming and to expand classroom instructional opportunities.

295
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:57,696
[SPEAKER_01]: and that it's presumed that these funds will carry forward into future fiscal years.

296
01:30:02,119 --> 01:30:14,284
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide is more of a value statement of how we look at

297
01:30:16,798 --> 01:30:33,929
[SPEAKER_01]: look at how we distribute fundings, and we wanted to be first, what's in the best interest of students, and then making sure that all areas of operations are adequately funded.

298
01:30:37,151 --> 01:30:38,311
[SPEAKER_01]: For question seven, the

299
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:53,823
[SPEAKER_01]: We have kind of broken up question seven into five different categories.

300
01:30:54,704 --> 01:31:02,627
[SPEAKER_01]: We have money that was advanced by the city at the time the FY25 budget was adopted.

301
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:04,748
[SPEAKER_01]: You might remember that,

302
01:31:06,914 --> 01:31:34,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Early in the process, I had identified, I think, a little over $2 million in cuts that would have to be affected to balance the budget and that there were still an additional $4 or $5 million cuts that weren't addressed at that time when I was just trying to communicate to the school committee kind of the magnitude of our budget problem in FY25.

303
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:45,537
[SPEAKER_01]: the city heard that and proposed new money and then proposed an additional sum of

304
01:31:48,554 --> 01:31:59,205
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,750,000 as more or less a down payment in advance of the override vote.

305
01:31:59,325 --> 01:32:06,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a bit of a risk for the city to undertake that because it wasn't necessarily sure that it would pass.

306
01:32:07,136 --> 01:32:28,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it has passed, we will reserve that amount of money to allow the city to retain those funds for things that it's already, for expenses that were already provided for when the initial budget was passed.

307
01:32:29,668 --> 01:32:34,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I alluded to in my previous report, there were,

308
01:32:35,232 --> 01:32:36,679
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of positions that.

309
01:32:38,008 --> 01:32:48,333
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not originally funded in the FY25 budget, but we're still retained in FY25 that have to be funded now.

310
01:32:49,073 --> 01:33:00,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We've identified certain new positions during the course of the year that we would like to use these funds to balance our budget.

311
01:33:02,139 --> 01:33:05,461
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proposing new positions as well.

312
01:33:07,742 --> 01:33:23,189
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result of budget discussions with principals and administrators and other expenses for facilities, technology to shore up funding in those areas.

313
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:27,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the money that the city advanced, $1,400,000

314
01:33:33,339 --> 01:33:50,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Positions were added back to the budget to elementary teachers, to high school teachers, to literacy coaches, a nurse, four curriculum administrators, and three pair of professionals, behavior specialists.

315
01:33:50,695 --> 01:33:56,261
[SPEAKER_01]: 500,000 was also provided to do a refresh of our Chromebooks that our students use.

316
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:11,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will, in this, you know, provides a budget now for the annual refresh of our, all our deployed devices.

317
01:34:14,948 --> 01:34:23,793
[SPEAKER_01]: The positions that were not originally funded in the FY25 budget include a kindergarten teacher,

318
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:28,382
[SPEAKER_01]: that was retained because of projected enrollment.

319
01:34:29,603 --> 01:34:44,501
[SPEAKER_01]: The PE teacher at the middle school had talked about an administrative floater, which was a position that had existed but was funded in the food service budget.

320
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:56,869
[SPEAKER_01]: That person did some work for the food service department but was frequently deployed out into the other schools as needed.

321
01:34:56,889 --> 01:35:08,197
[SPEAKER_01]: This position, however, we failed to provide for this position in the general fund budget in FY25 because we

322
01:35:10,376 --> 01:35:16,980
[SPEAKER_01]: depended on having that position when we reduced the administrative assistance staff.

323
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:24,345
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking to reinstate that position on the general fund with the supplemental funding.

324
01:35:26,267 --> 01:35:29,549
[SPEAKER_01]: We had also positions that were identified

325
01:35:30,745 --> 01:35:37,627
[SPEAKER_01]: is needed after the FY 25 budget was adopted.

326
01:35:37,647 --> 01:35:47,130
[SPEAKER_01]: These include two swing shift custodians that were provided for in the custodians collective bargaining agreement and this provides

327
01:35:48,411 --> 01:36:01,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Public Schools with coverage over the weekends when we have different community groups in using the schools and reduces our reliance on overtime to provide that coverage.

328
01:36:02,385 --> 01:36:03,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We hired an additional

329
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:05,948
[SPEAKER_01]: payroll administrative assistant.

330
01:36:07,249 --> 01:36:15,533
[SPEAKER_01]: During the course of the year, there were medically related leavers' absences.

331
01:36:17,474 --> 01:36:29,001
[SPEAKER_01]: In the payroll department, there was only two administrative assistants that provide payroll, provide that payroll function.

332
01:36:29,776 --> 01:36:41,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that you probably were aware of payroll problems within the payroll department in FY 24 and prior.

333
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:49,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And our view is that was related to understaffing in that department.

334
01:36:49,729 --> 01:36:59,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel like the payroll supervisor and three payroll administrative assistants is really the proper staffing to the amount of

335
01:37:00,296 --> 01:37:18,464
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are on the payroll fee for the variety of fringe benefits that Midford offers to its employees and the issues around payroll have been greatly reduced now that we have a staffing up to snuff.

336
01:37:19,184 --> 01:37:28,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we talked about the district-wide music teacher that we hired to make sure we had adequate

337
01:37:30,723 --> 01:37:36,186
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching capabilities for our students in the middle school and the Medford High School band.

338
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:53,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Continuing on, these are new positions.

339
01:37:53,055 --> 01:37:54,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, let me think.

340
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:55,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have missed a page.

341
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:11,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So new positions we've identified since the passage of the supplemental appropriations should say FY25 budget.

342
01:38:13,883 --> 01:38:28,726
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel like we, based on community input, we're proposing a teacher to identify and implement inclusion opportunities.

343
01:38:29,486 --> 01:38:31,587
[SPEAKER_01]: for our students with disabilities.

344
01:38:31,727 --> 01:38:51,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be paired with another program that we'll talk about in a minute called the Best Buddies Program, which is kind of provides or links up special needs students with kind of peers in the

345
01:38:51,833 --> 01:39:02,201
[SPEAKER_01]: general ed program and that is designed to support student growth for both students that are participating in that program.

346
01:39:03,001 --> 01:39:06,724
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also proposing that we add back a nurse floater.

347
01:39:10,366 --> 01:39:24,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the implementation, the one coverage issue that we still have is that the McGlynn School has two full-time nurses and a part-time nurse for three days a week.

348
01:39:25,577 --> 01:39:28,999
[SPEAKER_01]: That position, we feel, really should be five days.

349
01:39:34,196 --> 01:39:39,601
[SPEAKER_01]: nursing office suffers, you know, during the two days that part time person is not there.

350
01:39:40,442 --> 01:39:45,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we could add a part time nurse, we feel like.

351
01:39:48,543 --> 01:39:52,244
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could ask the part-time nurse to go full-time.

352
01:39:53,605 --> 01:40:00,867
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a person who's been in the district for a long time, has had this part-time position for a long time.

353
01:40:00,947 --> 01:40:08,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel like the best way to go would be to bring on a nurse floater that could fill in for those two days.

354
01:40:08,849 --> 01:40:20,118
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly a need, particularly over the winter when there's so much colds and flu and everything, and that doesn't just affect our students, it affects the nurses who are seeing those students.

355
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:32,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would provide us some extra coverage and get a nurse on board, kind of train her up in the Medford Health Services.

356
01:40:32,588 --> 01:40:35,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes time for the part-time nurse to,

357
01:40:37,091 --> 01:40:44,837
[SPEAKER_01]: retire or resign, we can evaluate the need for that part-time position at that point in time.

358
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:56,065
[SPEAKER_01]: We did cut one administrative assistant from the McGlynn.

359
01:40:57,066 --> 01:41:03,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the paperwork seems to be

360
01:41:05,736 --> 01:41:17,506
[SPEAKER_01]: being managed correctly, it creates an issue if that one administrative assistant is out or if there's other needs in the school.

361
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:26,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are proposing that we add back that administrative position at the McGlynn at this time.

362
01:41:28,385 --> 01:41:33,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also proposing an assistant director for buildings and grounds.

363
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:43,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one thing that we're also looking at in the FY 26 budget is to kind of look at the management structure that we have.

364
01:41:43,968 --> 01:41:59,474
[SPEAKER_01]: in that department, it does need some more oversight, not only for the staff, but for the maintenance projects, the construction projects that are underway.

365
01:42:00,294 --> 01:42:06,136
[SPEAKER_01]: We're anticipating putting more money in to address maintenance problems in the district.

366
01:42:06,176 --> 01:42:13,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to build up our management capacity in that office to handle that.

367
01:42:15,877 --> 01:42:34,478
[SPEAKER_01]: The salaries for the new positions that we identified have been prorated and anticipating, you know, if the budget, if and when the budget, the supplemental appropriation is passed, they'll be hired in February or March.

368
01:42:36,236 --> 01:42:41,637
[SPEAKER_01]: In this budget proposal, the value of the prorated salaries is a little over $400,000.

369
01:42:41,677 --> 01:42:43,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And annualized, those salaries would be $750,000.

370
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:46,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would mean an automatic increase in FY 26 of $350,000 for those positions.

371
01:43:04,051 --> 01:43:12,857
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of expenses that we'd like to provide in the supplemental, we talked about the Best Buddies Program.

372
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:23,124
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a stipend for a gen ed teacher and a special ed teacher to coordinate that program.

373
01:43:24,925 --> 01:43:31,429
[SPEAKER_01]: The stipends on a prorated basis at 2,500 through the end of the year, but would be about 10,000 in FY26.

374
01:43:34,991 --> 01:43:54,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also proposing a project that has been developed to implement electronic key access controls and video intercoms at all schools in the buildings as a safety measure, refinishing the gym floor at the McGlynn.

375
01:43:58,383 --> 01:44:04,431
[SPEAKER_01]: conducting facility conditions assessments at five of our schools.

376
01:44:04,531 --> 01:44:11,660
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a project that will provide a lot of very good information about our

377
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:24,255
[SPEAKER_01]: our maintenance needs in each of the schools and help us to prioritize when those maintenance needs should be addressed.

378
01:44:25,876 --> 01:44:43,446
[SPEAKER_01]: That facilities conditions assessments is projected to be about $125,000 and the balance of that appropriation would just go into ongoing facilities maintenance needs.

379
01:44:48,885 --> 01:44:57,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also proposing an E-rate project to replace all the wireless network access points in our network.

380
01:44:57,252 --> 01:45:04,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are beyond their use of life and have limited availability.

381
01:45:05,919 --> 01:45:07,140
[SPEAKER_01]: bandwidth capacity.

382
01:45:08,221 --> 01:45:20,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will have, it's a project that I think is going to come in around $600,000 to $700,000 an hour.

383
01:45:21,113 --> 01:45:25,137
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford Public Schools share of that would be $140,000 balance coming out of E-rate funds.

384
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:39,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also proposing a camera system for the Curtis Tufts to provide hallway coverage, and this exists in all of the schools except for Curtis Tufts.

385
01:45:40,825 --> 01:45:50,389
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proposing to fund new and replacement musical instruments, $12,000 district-wide

386
01:45:54,731 --> 01:46:12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the budget for that is about $2,000 right now, and that would give us a budget of $14,000, and it could be a little more when we come around to the FY26 proposal.

387
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And a new van for the vocational program

388
01:46:16,394 --> 01:46:27,665
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a couple of older vans that are battling needs of service and there's no way to take those vans off the road so we can address the maintenance needs properly.

389
01:46:27,725 --> 01:46:33,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thought is to buy an additional van and get those other vans up to snuff.

390
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:39,877
[SPEAKER_01]: These vans take the students to different programs and work sites that are part of their program.

391
01:46:49,682 --> 01:47:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next slide is just a summary of how we allocated the question seven funds, 1.7 reserved by the city to fund those, that supplement, that appropriation, that additional appropriation to the FY 25 budget.

392
01:47:13,201 --> 01:47:14,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another 1.8,

393
01:47:18,525 --> 01:47:25,328
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,250,000 in other expenses as identified.

394
01:47:27,168 --> 01:47:31,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll stop here if people have any questions on the question seven part.

395
01:47:35,352 --> 01:47:35,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Bramley?

396
01:47:36,012 --> 01:47:41,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was slide four, question seven, slide four.

397
01:47:45,836 --> 01:47:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

398
01:47:49,358 --> 01:47:51,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just say again what you said about the nurse floater?

399
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You said there's two full time and one part time right now?

400
01:47:54,822 --> 01:47:56,223
[SPEAKER_01]: At the McGlynn.

401
01:47:56,483 --> 01:47:57,023
[SPEAKER_06]: At the McGlynn.

402
01:47:58,064 --> 01:48:04,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it would be beneficial if we had another part timer as a two day floater, correct?

403
01:48:05,455 --> 01:48:07,577
[SPEAKER_06]: That what you just said, make sure I made my notes correctly.

404
01:48:07,757 --> 01:48:14,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no I said I said one option would be to hire a part time nurse to fill in for those two days.

405
01:48:14,744 --> 01:48:16,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

406
01:48:17,027 --> 01:48:23,073
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think a better option would be to use these funds to hire a full time person.

407
01:48:24,048 --> 01:48:26,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you get a better quality of candidate.

408
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:31,692
[SPEAKER_01]: That person could fill in for the other two days so the blend would be fully staffed.

409
01:48:32,212 --> 01:48:40,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question is, what do you do with these persons other three days so we would say, use that position instead of hiring.

410
01:48:43,057 --> 01:48:44,898
[SPEAKER_01]: day nurses for coverage.

411
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:49,419
[SPEAKER_01]: This person would be a floater, so they could go to different schools.

412
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:51,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So at McGlynn, two days and then three days.

413
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:51,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

414
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Where needed.

415
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:52,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

416
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:53,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

417
01:48:53,421 --> 01:48:58,623
[SPEAKER_01]: The director will assign that person where he or she is best needed.

418
01:48:59,623 --> 01:49:04,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the nurse at the McGlynn shared between both McGlynn Elementary and Middle School?

419
01:49:05,925 --> 01:49:06,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe so.

420
01:49:08,586 --> 01:49:08,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Laurie?

421
01:49:10,527 --> 01:49:10,967
[SPEAKER_05]: She's shared.

422
01:49:16,739 --> 01:49:18,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

423
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:20,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you meant the Andrews and the McGlynn.

424
01:49:20,421 --> 01:49:22,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say McGlynn and McGlynn or did I say Andrews?

425
01:49:22,241 --> 01:49:23,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have very well said the wrong thing.

426
01:49:23,662 --> 01:49:24,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

427
01:49:24,602 --> 01:49:24,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

428
01:49:24,882 --> 01:49:25,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

429
01:49:25,143 --> 01:49:26,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So McGlynn all shared.

430
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:26,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

431
01:49:28,584 --> 01:49:29,544
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole complex.

432
01:49:33,846 --> 01:49:34,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was it.

433
01:49:35,547 --> 01:49:35,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

434
01:49:40,563 --> 01:49:41,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade.

435
01:49:44,524 --> 01:49:44,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

436
01:49:45,124 --> 01:49:46,104
[SPEAKER_00]: So a quick question.

437
01:49:46,164 --> 01:49:50,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you said, and I think it's on slide nine, about the Best Buddies stipend.

438
01:49:50,726 --> 01:49:54,666
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the $2,500 per advisor.

439
01:49:54,726 --> 01:49:55,587
[SPEAKER_00]: That's prorated.

440
01:49:55,607 --> 01:49:56,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would go up for $26,000?

441
01:49:56,947 --> 01:49:57,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

442
01:49:58,067 --> 01:49:59,248
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

443
01:49:59,288 --> 01:50:01,868
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said it was $10,000 across each student?

444
01:50:02,128 --> 01:50:02,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

445
01:50:02,368 --> 01:50:02,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

446
01:50:02,989 --> 01:50:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The position we'll request is $5,000 for each student for the whole year.

447
01:50:07,290 --> 01:50:08,610
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

448
01:50:08,690 --> 01:50:09,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

449
01:50:09,797 --> 01:50:12,699
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and this might be talked about a little bit in question.

450
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been some discussion about bus monitors.

451
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people in the community have been wondering about what that may look like.

452
01:50:17,281 --> 01:50:23,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have any, if that's gonna be further in the brief or if you have any suggestions about that.

453
01:50:23,964 --> 01:50:28,866
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that when we get to question eight.

454
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:31,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We are attempting to address it.

455
01:50:31,628 --> 01:50:33,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

456
01:50:33,269 --> 01:50:33,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld.

457
01:50:35,815 --> 01:50:40,444
[SPEAKER_16]: clarifying question on the restoring of the administrative system at McGlynn.

458
01:50:40,484 --> 01:50:45,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Will that end up being two administrative assistants for two schools or will it be one per school?

459
01:50:45,393 --> 01:50:46,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it designated?

460
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:50,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the funding, it will be one per school.

461
01:50:50,762 --> 01:50:52,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So one will be funded.

462
01:50:52,283 --> 01:50:56,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know people fill in for their person next to them.

463
01:50:56,345 --> 01:50:57,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how that works.

464
01:50:57,085 --> 01:51:00,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that school runs as kind of one whole facility too.

465
01:51:00,507 --> 01:51:04,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if there'll be, I'm sure there's backup and sharing.

466
01:51:05,569 --> 01:51:09,371
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of funding, it will be one for the middle and one for the elementary.

467
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:10,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

468
01:51:10,843 --> 01:51:13,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Branley covered my other clarifying question.

469
01:51:13,464 --> 01:51:17,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And then one last one, you mentioned that the administrative floater had been supporting food services.

470
01:51:18,145 --> 01:51:21,926
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not leaving food services in the lurch by transferring that.

471
01:51:21,946 --> 01:51:22,626
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no.

472
01:51:22,666 --> 01:51:31,308
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, and really that we shouldn't have been using that position the way we were.

473
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're correcting.

474
01:51:33,141 --> 01:51:42,504
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the, we talked about some work that was left over that had to be distributed amongst existing administrative assistants.

475
01:51:43,064 --> 01:51:45,645
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of those pieces is for food service.

476
01:51:46,285 --> 01:51:46,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

477
01:51:46,625 --> 01:51:47,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to make sure we were in.

478
01:51:50,071 --> 01:52:08,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the chair, if I may, I believe you had mentioned you'll be working on some sort of draft, even if it's just for staff that outlines which sections of this were prorated and which sections were one time funding so that we can make sure we're budgeting accordingly and don't land ourself.

479
01:52:09,524 --> 01:52:13,065
[SPEAKER_02]: in the same spot a few years down the road.

480
01:52:13,145 --> 01:52:17,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So just reminding you of that, hopefully I'd love to be able to check it out.

481
01:52:17,246 --> 01:52:25,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Our FY26 proposal will be full funding for all the positions that we're requesting.

482
01:52:25,783 --> 01:52:35,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems when I reviewed it a few days ago, it seems that the prorated is even dealt by the one time funding spent within the next six months.

483
01:52:35,889 --> 01:52:40,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure we're going to need one time funding for different things down the line.

484
01:52:40,252 --> 01:52:42,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure we're not overspending.

485
01:52:42,473 --> 01:52:42,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

486
01:52:44,374 --> 01:52:46,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Our budget will be balanced when it's presented.

487
01:52:47,076 --> 01:52:47,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

488
01:52:48,937 --> 01:52:49,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

489
01:52:49,257 --> 01:52:50,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the end?

490
01:52:50,758 --> 01:52:51,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, question eight.

491
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:53,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, question eight.

492
01:52:55,874 --> 01:52:56,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue, thank you.

493
01:52:57,955 --> 01:53:03,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So question eight provided for $4 million in funding.

494
01:53:05,737 --> 01:53:08,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be used for compensation.

495
01:53:08,817 --> 01:53:22,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used for expanding educational opportunities and for the costs associated with developing and implementing a new schedule.

496
01:53:22,994 --> 01:53:26,657
[SPEAKER_01]: for the high school and potentially other schools as well.

497
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:33,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this instance, we're also providing

498
01:53:34,662 --> 01:53:38,326
[SPEAKER_01]: for $170,000 for a curriculum, ELA curriculum, that was purchased in FY24.

499
01:53:38,506 --> 01:53:42,990
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of that curriculum for ELA was $170,000 per year for three years.

500
01:53:59,925 --> 01:54:18,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I came to Medford, the business office had attempted to fund the full contract using ESSA funds, which was a good idea because we had to spend down our ESSA funds by the end of FY24.

501
01:54:21,711 --> 01:54:34,496
[SPEAKER_01]: However, because of the way the proposal was developed, the city's purchasing department would not allow all three years to be funded in a single year.

502
01:54:35,077 --> 01:54:37,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first year was funded by ESSA.

503
01:54:39,759 --> 01:54:44,921
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were surprised when we got an invoice last fall for $170,000.

504
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:45,982
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not covered in the budget.

505
01:54:49,783 --> 01:54:55,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to ask for money now to cover the FY25 portion.

506
01:54:55,649 --> 01:55:10,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this will be part of our FY26 proposal to get the final year of that curriculum purchase finally funded.

507
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:31,092
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of our FY 2060 discussions, the vocational program director was seeking to have three teachers added, one metal fabrication, one in automotive, and a culinary teacher.

508
01:55:32,813 --> 01:55:37,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that these metal fabrication and the automotive teachers have

509
01:55:39,292 --> 01:55:42,134
[SPEAKER_01]: mandated lower class sizes for safety reasons.

510
01:55:42,414 --> 01:55:49,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can only have, if we only have one teacher, we can only have 15 students in a class at the time.

511
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:56,904
[SPEAKER_01]: adding these positions now, we'll be able to offer these programs to more students during the course of the year.

512
01:55:57,365 --> 01:55:59,546
[SPEAKER_01]: The culinary program is very popular.

513
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:10,294
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two teachers there now, but those teachers are unable to take their

514
01:56:11,294 --> 01:56:16,780
[SPEAKER_01]: prep periods because they're 100% in teaching mode.

515
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:31,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So this additional teacher will allow us to make sure the teachers get the benefits they're entitled to in the contract and be able to adequately cover that program.

516
01:56:33,215 --> 01:56:51,425
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of stayed away from adding new teachers in the supplemental because we don't feel that we're going to get quality candidates right now and we might be able to get them a few months down the line, but sometimes the

517
01:56:53,298 --> 01:57:02,384
[SPEAKER_01]: For the vocational positions, there's other kind of non-traditional sources that we can attract teachers based on the programming that's offered.

518
01:57:02,804 --> 01:57:10,229
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, I think we do have a good candidate for the metal fabrication teacher right now.

519
01:57:10,789 --> 01:57:18,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're requesting to create those positions now rather than wait till next July.

520
01:57:21,176 --> 01:57:22,337
[SPEAKER_01]: The balance of the funds,

521
01:57:23,146 --> 01:57:32,331
[SPEAKER_01]: are really lumped in to reserve for negotiations with the teachers and the paraprofessionals.

522
01:57:33,731 --> 01:57:36,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And those negotiations have begun.

523
01:57:37,273 --> 01:57:46,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And these funds will have to be spent by June 30th, but they'll be part of a

524
01:57:47,691 --> 01:57:56,420
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-year agreement, hopefully that gets resolved before the end of the year.

525
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:05,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And including in those negotiations would be the new schedule, a potential longer day.

526
01:58:05,389 --> 01:58:07,852
[SPEAKER_01]: We added the

527
01:58:11,201 --> 01:58:14,943
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of the bus monitors in this category.

528
01:58:15,043 --> 01:58:24,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So in discussing this with the leadership team, there's a couple of different ways to provide monitors on buses.

529
01:58:24,249 --> 01:58:28,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We could make it a condition of the contract and have the contractor

530
01:58:28,852 --> 01:58:30,293
[SPEAKER_01]: higher the bus monitors.

531
01:58:31,834 --> 01:58:42,783
[SPEAKER_01]: We could kind of open it up to other staff part-time, maybe food service or other staff at school might be interested in those extra hours.

532
01:58:43,283 --> 01:58:53,871
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think if we could work it out with the paraprofessionals, that paraprofessionals might

533
01:58:55,123 --> 01:58:57,643
[SPEAKER_01]: provide us with a quality bus monitor.

534
01:58:57,984 --> 01:59:00,144
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the kids, they know the school.

535
01:59:02,864 --> 01:59:15,707
[SPEAKER_01]: The complication is that depending on how many hours are added to the day, we could be bumping up into kind of overtime requirements, and it would have to be negotiated.

536
01:59:15,747 --> 01:59:22,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of throwing it into the mix here as part of negotiations, and then we'll see what works out.

537
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:31,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll just have, we'll make sure that there's funding provided in the FY26 budget.

538
01:59:33,344 --> 01:59:42,628
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't work out within the negotiation context, we can have funds to possibly hire people in a different way.

539
01:59:43,328 --> 01:59:48,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of an open question as to whether we need bus monitors on every route,

540
01:59:49,082 --> 01:59:54,206
[SPEAKER_01]: every day or are there specific bus routes that are problematic.

541
01:59:54,826 --> 01:59:59,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of all that will be looked at as part of the negotiations process.

542
02:00:02,632 --> 02:00:07,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, should the new schedule be adopted, there's going to have to be

543
02:00:09,656 --> 02:00:19,878
[SPEAKER_01]: human resources developed because student schedules will have to be input into our school brain system.

544
02:00:20,979 --> 02:00:30,101
[SPEAKER_01]: IEPs will have to be rewritten, IEP meetings will have to be held with parents and caregivers.

545
02:00:30,561 --> 02:00:35,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there'll be funding carved out for that as well.

546
02:00:39,902 --> 02:00:42,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any questions on question eight?

547
02:00:46,346 --> 02:00:49,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing and seeing none, I'll see if member Graham.

548
02:00:53,305 --> 02:00:53,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

549
02:00:54,106 --> 02:00:55,487
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually had a question.

550
02:00:55,507 --> 02:00:59,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it is back on question seven, so my apologies.

551
02:00:59,851 --> 02:01:10,681
[SPEAKER_17]: The facility conditioning assessments, that number looks different than the numbers that we had in our capital plan.

552
02:01:10,701 --> 02:01:13,224
[SPEAKER_17]: So can you just give us a rundown of what that looks like?

553
02:01:13,704 --> 02:01:14,606
[SPEAKER_17]: what number it is.

554
02:01:15,747 --> 02:01:17,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, on page nine.

555
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:21,615
[SPEAKER_17]: So it says 146,000 for the facility condition assessments.

556
02:01:21,956 --> 02:01:24,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And other, I think other maintenance needs.

557
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:28,465
[SPEAKER_17]: So, okay, so it's, it's not just the assessment.

558
02:01:28,785 --> 02:01:29,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they,

559
02:01:31,248 --> 02:01:37,132
[SPEAKER_01]: To kind of balance things out, we're saying $125,000 for the facilities assessment, and that's based on $125,000 for five schools.

560
02:01:37,152 --> 02:01:37,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

561
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:52,541
[SPEAKER_01]: $25,000 per school, roughly.

562
02:01:53,322 --> 02:02:03,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we expect to get, we've been in talks with one of the house doctor contractors, and they're providing us with some preliminary pricing.

563
02:02:03,827 --> 02:02:10,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the passage of the supplemental will kind of dovetail nicely with that process.

564
02:02:12,231 --> 02:02:13,392
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the difference there.

565
02:02:13,908 --> 02:02:19,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and then my other related question, which again I think is question seven.

566
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:22,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there were three there were three specific.

567
02:02:25,932 --> 02:02:43,827
[SPEAKER_17]: capital projects that we identified in our capital plan as things we wanted to see accomplished in FY25, which includes fixing the issue that causes flooding in the kindergarten classroom at the McGlynn, the drainage at the Brooks School, and then the freight elevator motor

568
02:02:44,367 --> 02:02:45,809
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't see those in this presentation.

569
02:02:45,869 --> 02:02:50,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that because they're somewhere else, or are they not able to be accounted for in 25?

570
02:02:50,573 --> 02:03:05,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, as part of our regular budget, we're moving on the Brooks flooding issue, mini splits, which we'll start this year and finish in FY26.

571
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:25,343
[SPEAKER_01]: The flashing issue, I think, because it involves, the roof was part of the HVAC work at the McGlynn, and the freight elevator we're moving forward on as part of our regular budget.

572
02:03:25,703 --> 02:03:26,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great.

573
02:03:26,523 --> 02:03:27,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

574
02:03:28,304 --> 02:03:33,104
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, Mayor, I think there might be some people in the audience who wanna speak when the committee's done.

575
02:03:34,385 --> 02:03:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld, then Member Ruseau.

576
02:03:36,826 --> 02:03:49,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was just hoping you could speak a little more about the logistics of how funds reserved for bargaining for a future contract gets spent in the bargaining fiscal year.

577
02:03:49,575 --> 02:03:54,659
[SPEAKER_16]: You alluded to it for a couple of these items, but just explaining how that works.

578
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:57,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

579
02:03:58,737 --> 02:04:08,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want to get too deep into kind of strategy or topics, but once there was an agreement

580
02:04:15,357 --> 02:04:29,470
[SPEAKER_01]: We would, to utilize these funds, some of that agreement would call for payments to take place before June 30th as part of a three-year contract.

581
02:04:30,631 --> 02:04:39,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be all, you know, if you look at it in terms of what is the total cost of three years, some of that funding will come in FY25.

582
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:44,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

583
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:49,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

584
02:04:49,772 --> 02:04:50,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll open it up to the floor.

585
02:04:50,972 --> 02:04:55,613
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just state your name and address for the record and have about three minutes.

586
02:04:56,014 --> 02:04:56,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So please come on up.

587
02:04:59,195 --> 02:04:59,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need more?

588
02:04:59,715 --> 02:05:01,875
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit, maybe.

589
02:05:02,616 --> 02:05:05,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I have a new best friend, Mr. McCue.

590
02:05:05,757 --> 02:05:08,417
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so happy to hear all the stuff that he just mentioned.

591
02:05:08,457 --> 02:05:11,598
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all like little kids in there.

592
02:05:11,678 --> 02:05:13,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Patricia Cherry, 20 Wellesley Street, Medford.

593
02:05:15,362 --> 02:05:28,127
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to switch it up a little bit because I thought we were going to be coming to ask for these things to be put in the budget, and now we're finding out that you guys, after meeting with you, already put them in the budget, so this is a huge thing for us right now.

594
02:05:30,362 --> 02:05:31,542
[SPEAKER_15]: We are so late.

595
02:05:32,403 --> 02:05:33,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I know, I know.

596
02:05:33,603 --> 02:05:37,465
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just need to let you know that we're all caught off guard here.

597
02:05:37,665 --> 02:05:45,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I had this whole thing written out on why these things are so important to our kids and to our families and why they need to be passed.

598
02:05:46,008 --> 02:05:47,928
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's time that they get passed.

599
02:05:49,449 --> 02:05:52,550
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time that our kids and our families have a seat at the table.

600
02:05:54,173 --> 02:05:56,894
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to be supported by the community.

601
02:05:57,114 --> 02:05:59,194
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to be part of the community.

602
02:05:59,895 --> 02:06:02,835
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're here to say, we're not gonna take anything less.

603
02:06:05,796 --> 02:06:07,657
[SPEAKER_15]: The bus monitors is a huge thing.

604
02:06:07,697 --> 02:06:11,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I will read a little bit on that because I think it's very important that people know.

605
02:06:13,838 --> 02:06:17,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Our children are among the most vulnerable students in the district.

606
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:22,741
[SPEAKER_15]: The bus ride is often one of the most concerning experiences in terms of safety for our children.

607
02:06:23,314 --> 02:06:32,550
[SPEAKER_15]: It's deeply unsettling to rely on a bus to take your child to school when they may not always have the ability to communicate if or when they are being harmed.

608
02:06:33,325 --> 02:06:41,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether that harm is sexual, emotional, or physical, it has come to light that one of our students endured such harm for an extended period of time.

609
02:06:42,172 --> 02:06:45,314
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is likely that many others have faced similar situations.

610
02:06:45,855 --> 02:06:54,581
[SPEAKER_15]: To us, this is unacceptable and, quite frankly, appalling that the safety of our children with special needs ranks so low on the list of the budget priorities.

611
02:06:56,403 --> 02:06:58,704
[SPEAKER_15]: That person didn't come tonight.

612
02:06:59,704 --> 02:07:03,547
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that they were speaking on behalf of multiple families.

613
02:07:03,987 --> 02:07:11,291
[SPEAKER_15]: It was devastating to hear that that was being done to a child, especially one in what we consider our community.

614
02:07:13,052 --> 02:07:15,293
[SPEAKER_15]: So bus monitors are a must.

615
02:07:18,231 --> 02:07:18,911
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be.

616
02:07:19,692 --> 02:07:26,894
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that for safety, for just everything, just overall, we need the bus monitors for our kids.

617
02:07:27,914 --> 02:07:31,315
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the inclusion specialist, that was another ask that we had.

618
02:07:32,876 --> 02:07:36,437
[SPEAKER_15]: We need an inclusion specialist because right now the gap between typical and

619
02:07:37,575 --> 02:07:41,079
[SPEAKER_15]: atypical children is too wide.

620
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:44,262
[SPEAKER_15]: We need somebody to come into the schools and close that gap.

621
02:07:44,702 --> 02:07:48,687
[SPEAKER_15]: We need somebody to come into the schools and start programs for our kids where

622
02:07:50,154 --> 02:07:53,577
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not coming in as, oh, the kids with disabilities.

623
02:07:54,137 --> 02:08:02,804
[SPEAKER_15]: We're coming in as equals, where these programs are, the participants are all on an equal playing field, where they can learn from one another.

624
02:08:03,225 --> 02:08:05,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Because each child has something to offer.

625
02:08:07,608 --> 02:08:09,450
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we need an inclusion specialist for.

626
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:10,891
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have any programs.

627
02:08:12,759 --> 02:08:21,486
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no real programs that our kids, even afterschool programs are very difficult because there's always an extra ask if you wanna join the afterschool program.

628
02:08:21,826 --> 02:08:25,289
[SPEAKER_15]: There's always, oh, well, is there gonna be an aid for my child?

629
02:08:25,829 --> 02:08:29,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, is this afterschool program gonna fit the needs of our child?

630
02:08:30,013 --> 02:08:41,182
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of the times it doesn't, because there's no staffing, they don't have the extra paras, they don't have somebody who can work with our kids.

631
02:08:43,174 --> 02:08:55,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So it brings it back to needing someone who has the ability and the education and the knowledge on how to tie that all in so that the schools can be a more inclusive place.

632
02:08:55,899 --> 02:08:58,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we always hear about inclusive in Medford.

633
02:08:58,840 --> 02:08:59,820
[SPEAKER_15]: We just don't ever see it.

634
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:02,721
[SPEAKER_15]: You hear so much about the most vulnerable, you know?

635
02:09:02,741 --> 02:09:05,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we need the money for the most vulnerable, the most vulnerable.

636
02:09:05,862 --> 02:09:10,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this, you know, everybody talks about the most vulnerable, but the most vulnerable never get it.

637
02:09:11,515 --> 02:09:14,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's gotta stop, that has to stop.

638
02:09:15,541 --> 02:09:22,149
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to put our kids as high a priority as everybody else's child.

639
02:09:23,192 --> 02:09:26,314
[SPEAKER_15]: We understand programs need money.

640
02:09:26,334 --> 02:09:27,855
[SPEAKER_15]: You need money for instruments.

641
02:09:27,936 --> 02:09:30,057
[SPEAKER_15]: You need money for drama clubs.

642
02:09:30,097 --> 02:09:33,640
[SPEAKER_15]: You need money for whatever other programs you have in the schools.

643
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:43,106
[SPEAKER_15]: But all we're saying is before you give more money to those already funded programs, fund some programs that are non-existent, the ones that we want for our children.

644
02:09:44,747 --> 02:09:48,890
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why the two asks that we have were the inclusion specialists and the bus monitors.

645
02:09:52,492 --> 02:09:54,053
[SPEAKER_15]: I can only speak to my experience.

646
02:09:54,153 --> 02:10:10,245
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have a large group of children that aren't even in district, including mine, who also goes out of district for school and also out of district for all of her activities, because there are none in the city, but that will take up tomorrow with city council.

647
02:10:10,265 --> 02:10:14,868
[SPEAKER_15]: But we lose that.

648
02:10:15,128 --> 02:10:17,510
[SPEAKER_15]: My daughter, I have to make sure

649
02:10:18,430 --> 02:10:27,056
[SPEAKER_15]: to keep this group of people so that our kids can remain to have the small group of friends that we have because there is no opportunity for that in this city.

650
02:10:28,537 --> 02:10:31,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of all over the map because I'm just shocked.

651
02:10:31,759 --> 02:10:32,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so happy.

652
02:10:34,594 --> 02:10:35,955
[SPEAKER_15]: I need you to push this through.

653
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:37,735
[SPEAKER_15]: We need you.

654
02:10:37,995 --> 02:10:39,976
[SPEAKER_15]: We are saying enough.

655
02:10:40,276 --> 02:10:41,016
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here.

656
02:10:41,717 --> 02:10:43,237
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to now be here.

657
02:10:43,277 --> 02:10:44,238
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going anywhere.

658
02:10:44,278 --> 02:10:45,498
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't a one-shot deal.

659
02:10:45,538 --> 02:10:47,739
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to represent this group going forward.

660
02:10:48,579 --> 02:10:50,500
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's time.

661
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:54,101
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time that we have a seat at the table just like everybody else.

662
02:10:55,362 --> 02:10:56,422
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to end it there.

663
02:11:01,024 --> 02:11:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a motion for approval.

664
02:11:05,888 --> 02:11:06,729
[SPEAKER_15]: I ask for your approval.

665
02:11:06,989 --> 02:11:14,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and I appreciate, I appreciate Aaron, who worked with us, and Jenny, and Suzanne, and Joan.

666
02:11:15,053 --> 02:11:20,537
[SPEAKER_15]: We had meetings about this, and Aaron showed up to our library event, and I appreciate all of you guys for doing that.

667
02:11:20,877 --> 02:11:23,358
[SPEAKER_15]: And please, yes, do I say, can you please approve this?

668
02:11:23,518 --> 02:11:24,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that's perfect.

669
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:24,879
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

670
02:11:30,142 --> 02:11:30,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld?

671
02:11:32,624 --> 02:11:33,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, Member Branley.

672
02:11:35,857 --> 02:11:38,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to say you had made a comment.

673
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:43,600
[SPEAKER_05]: You said our community, but I want you to know you're part of our community that we are all one community.

674
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:44,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And that includes you.

675
02:11:44,861 --> 02:11:47,542
[SPEAKER_05]: That includes every child in this district and every single parent.

676
02:11:49,042 --> 02:11:50,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I work in special ed in Somerville.

677
02:11:50,483 --> 02:11:51,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never made that a secret.

678
02:11:52,444 --> 02:11:56,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I love working for special ed because I say this all the time.

679
02:11:56,945 --> 02:12:00,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that sometimes there's this, you know, differential.

680
02:12:00,407 --> 02:12:01,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.

681
02:12:02,327 --> 02:12:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.

682
02:12:03,068 --> 02:12:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not fair.

683
02:12:04,589 --> 02:12:19,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like everybody in special ed, every student, every adult, everybody that works in special ed, every student in the district, every student outside of special ed, we're all a piece to a puzzle here in this room and everywhere else.

684
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:26,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the day, the pieces of that puzzle get put together and it's your child's name, you know, and that matters.

685
02:12:27,265 --> 02:12:30,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And I take it really personal because I think that,

686
02:12:31,809 --> 02:12:33,110
[SPEAKER_05]: You are part of this community.

687
02:12:33,150 --> 02:12:35,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just never want anybody to ever forget that.

688
02:12:35,831 --> 02:12:37,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for coming and advocating for your child.

689
02:12:37,872 --> 02:12:39,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I've stood there and advocated for my own child.

690
02:12:39,893 --> 02:12:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how difficult that is.

691
02:12:41,694 --> 02:12:42,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

692
02:12:42,314 --> 02:12:43,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for being here.

693
02:12:43,515 --> 02:12:45,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will be at city council tomorrow to support you.

694
02:12:45,676 --> 02:12:46,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.

695
02:12:46,997 --> 02:12:47,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your words.

696
02:12:47,817 --> 02:12:48,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

697
02:12:58,556 --> 02:12:58,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

809
02:13:25,347 --> 02:13:39,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of that, I have talked with a lot of parents, especially about the need for bringing a lot of our services in-house and how we need to have programs for students that can equal the playing field, have an equitable experience in our schools, because it's just not there.

810
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:50,847
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank you personally for a lot of the advocacy work that you're doing and for coming here and giving your point of view and thought process.

811
02:13:50,867 --> 02:13:51,307
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

812
02:13:51,327 --> 02:13:51,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

813
02:13:52,008 --> 02:13:52,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

814
02:13:52,969 --> 02:13:53,429
[SPEAKER_15]: One more thing.

815
02:13:53,729 --> 02:13:54,990
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a whole group.

816
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:57,911
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just the mouth, because I have the big mouth.

817
02:13:59,551 --> 02:14:06,514
[SPEAKER_15]: There are people that we've learned for that came before us, like Tonya Sullivan, Melanie, Alex.

818
02:14:06,534 --> 02:14:08,495
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been doing this a lot longer than we have.

819
02:14:08,955 --> 02:14:14,197
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just we're a small group, and because we don't have the resources that we have, we're very tight-knit.

820
02:14:14,217 --> 02:14:15,057
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a bunch of us.

821
02:14:15,237 --> 02:14:16,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have the big mouth.

822
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:33,606
[SPEAKER_13]: over the years that I've been involved in the conversation that I'm just really happy to see where it's at right now.

823
02:14:33,906 --> 02:14:36,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm excited to see where he's going forward.

824
02:14:36,989 --> 02:14:37,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes.

825
02:14:37,570 --> 02:14:41,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a motion for approval on the floor?

826
02:14:41,373 --> 02:14:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve and before we call the roll, member McLaughlin.

827
02:14:48,616 --> 02:14:49,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm former member of McLaughlin.

828
02:14:49,897 --> 02:14:50,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you.

829
02:14:51,878 --> 02:14:54,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street, Medford Moss.

830
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:55,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

831
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:56,581
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to say thank you.

832
02:14:57,041 --> 02:14:59,142
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been 10 years in the making.

833
02:14:59,823 --> 02:15:02,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And Trish, you did fantastic tonight.

834
02:15:02,404 --> 02:15:05,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt like a proud mother, I have to say, myself.

835
02:15:05,486 --> 02:15:07,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And the community is really grateful.

836
02:15:07,968 --> 02:15:09,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And this has been a long time.

837
02:15:10,009 --> 02:15:17,414
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of different special ed directors over the years, and a lot of teachers and hundreds of children have passed through this district.

838
02:15:19,505 --> 02:15:20,026
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's done.

839
02:15:23,609 --> 02:15:28,373
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, and I love that, you know, I can guarantee you Trish is not going anywhere.

840
02:15:29,434 --> 02:15:37,761
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and neither are any of the other families so you know to the families that are watching tonight and to those out there who might hear about this later what have you and

841
02:15:38,443 --> 02:15:46,267
[SPEAKER_14]: who work every day as caregivers with their children, who do extra homework, who advocated IEP meetings, who do all those things that we know how hard they are.

842
02:15:46,647 --> 02:15:54,971
[SPEAKER_14]: We just wanna say that you're not alone and that this is really important that every child matters and that we know that this school committee feels that way and we wanna thank the school committee for that.

843
02:15:55,651 --> 02:16:04,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the things I wanted to mention is that, it was actually the former special education director that used to say this to me and would remind me and I thought it was really important.

844
02:16:04,355 --> 02:16:06,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, there are no special education students.

845
02:16:07,396 --> 02:16:10,177
[SPEAKER_14]: everyone is a general student in our district.

846
02:16:10,297 --> 02:16:12,558
[SPEAKER_14]: There are students who receive special education services.

847
02:16:13,318 --> 02:16:18,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're all part of the community, and we know that, and we appreciate that, and we'll continue speaking up.

848
02:16:18,821 --> 02:16:21,582
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you all, and thank you guys all for what you're doing.

849
02:16:21,722 --> 02:16:22,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate you.

850
02:16:26,664 --> 02:16:27,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

851
02:16:27,044 --> 02:16:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval, I believe, was by Member Graham, seconded by Member Olapare.

852
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:36,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.

853
02:16:39,943 --> 02:16:41,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, motion to amend.

854
02:16:42,805 --> 02:16:58,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that some of our staff representatives from our nursing union were here earlier and they had sent an email asking for support because, you know, looking at how the budget's been and the positions that have been reestablished just really isn't doing it for them.

855
02:16:58,877 --> 02:17:00,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, personally, you know,

856
02:17:01,107 --> 02:17:06,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I have my full support for reestablishing the positions that we lost.

857
02:17:06,532 --> 02:17:10,957
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the big talking points that we had talked about, or that had been happening.

858
02:17:12,198 --> 02:17:13,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would actually motion

859
02:17:15,157 --> 02:17:43,248
[SPEAKER_13]: to pull from the undistributed to either restore at least one floater position, motion to amend the supplemental appropriation of the 2024 just to give them at least, I know that probably having all four positions back isn't something we could swing, but I feel like having at least one other additional floater within the unit might be, especially because as it relates to question eight, with extending the day, we may need some additional staffing needs when it comes to that.

860
02:17:44,649 --> 02:17:47,173
[SPEAKER_10]: That was one of the proposed recommendations for Mr. McHugh.

861
02:17:57,421 --> 02:18:00,723
[SPEAKER_10]: to add a 1.0 position instead of the halftime position.

862
02:18:01,803 --> 02:18:07,186
[SPEAKER_10]: And that person would fill in the two days at the McGlynn and be a floater for the remaining three days.

863
02:18:08,167 --> 02:18:13,450
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would add a 1.0 FTE back to the nursing ranks.

864
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:14,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

865
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:14,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

866
02:18:14,991 --> 02:18:16,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't mean to interrupt you.

867
02:18:16,912 --> 02:18:18,993
[SPEAKER_13]: So then it would go from, so we lost four.

868
02:18:19,053 --> 02:18:20,133
[SPEAKER_13]: We brought in one more.

869
02:18:20,173 --> 02:18:21,194
[SPEAKER_13]: So then three were missing.

870
02:18:21,214 --> 02:18:21,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost three.

871
02:18:22,314 --> 02:18:22,895
[SPEAKER_13]: We lost three.

872
02:18:22,975 --> 02:18:24,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So then now we're missing two.

873
02:18:27,324 --> 02:18:31,607
[SPEAKER_10]: So by adding in the one more, we would have added the two positions back.

874
02:18:32,028 --> 02:18:32,288
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

875
02:18:32,888 --> 02:18:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

876
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:36,571
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

877
02:18:36,611 --> 02:18:38,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll take that motion to amend off.

878
02:18:38,993 --> 02:18:43,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Olapade.

879
02:18:46,278 --> 02:18:46,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

880
02:18:50,601 --> 02:18:51,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Branley?

881
02:18:51,182 --> 02:18:52,082

Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

887
02:18:55,766 --> 02:18:56,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld.

888
02:18:56,687 --> 02:18:56,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

889
02:18:56,987 --> 02:18:57,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rossell.

890
02:18:57,548 --> 02:18:57,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

891
02:18:57,808 --> 02:18:58,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lungo.

892
02:18:58,609 --> 02:18:58,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

893
02:18:58,949 --> 02:19:00,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

894
02:19:01,472 --> 02:19:02,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper passes.

895
02:19:07,959 --> 02:19:11,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, thank you for coming and being advocates for your kids and many others.

896
02:19:11,723 --> 02:19:13,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully you stick around.

897
02:19:14,986 --> 02:19:17,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a long meeting and we want you to enjoy some cake with us.

898
02:19:19,454 --> 02:19:24,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business or new business or reports requested.

899
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:25,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have one condolence.

900
02:19:26,382 --> 02:19:36,372
[SPEAKER_02]: The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincere condolences to the family of Ralph A. Evangelista, father of Lisa Evangelista, former public informations officer for the Medford Public Schools.

901
02:19:36,853 --> 02:19:39,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We all may rise for a moment of silence.

902
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:50,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

903
02:19:51,501 --> 02:20:04,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we let you know when the next regular meeting is, or maybe after we let you know when the next regular meeting is, which is January 27 2025 here in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

904
02:20:05,445 --> 02:20:07,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we adjourn, I'd like to

905
02:20:08,346 --> 02:20:19,448
[SPEAKER_02]: ask everybody to stay and have some cake with us to celebrate seven amazing years put into the Medford Public School, our district by our superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

906
02:20:20,228 --> 02:20:27,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for all you've done for our students, our faculty, staff, everything we went through alongside you.

907
02:20:27,729 --> 02:20:31,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us, some of us, some of you brand new with the COVID crisis.

908
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:37,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a worker and we appreciate everything you've done for us and the district.

909
02:20:39,648 --> 02:20:40,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, come on up.

910
02:20:40,589 --> 02:20:42,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, and then please.

911
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:44,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanna yield?

912
02:20:45,031 --> 02:20:47,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll yield to the most senior member in this room.

913
02:20:51,494 --> 02:20:52,235
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, please.

914
02:20:53,615 --> 02:20:55,657
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm here tonight and I've lost Melanie.

915
02:20:56,778 --> 02:21:11,251
[SPEAKER_12]: So on behalf of Melanie McLaughlin, and also former school committee members, Sharon Hayes, Mia Masone, and Kathy Kreatz, we're all here tonight with you, Superintendent, to thank you and to say,

916
02:21:12,612 --> 02:21:16,576
[SPEAKER_12]: give you our profound thanks for the seven years that you've given to Medford.

917
02:21:17,397 --> 02:21:37,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I was on the committee when you joined us in a rather difficult time, and it was so wonderful to have your enthusiasm and your joy and the sense of pride in Medford and in our students and just excitement.

918
02:21:38,456 --> 02:22:00,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Former athletic coach, and some of you will know who I'm talking about, but it was quite a long time ago, the late Bud Kelly used to say that he'd always be talking about Medford pride, and he'd say, he'd pull up a shirt and he had drawn blue and white on his arm and said that Medford pride runs in his veins.

919
02:22:00,775 --> 02:22:02,377
[SPEAKER_12]: And to you, superintendent,

920
02:22:02,957 --> 02:22:04,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford pride runs in your veins.

921
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:10,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we are very thankful for the time that you have been with us.

922
02:22:10,766 --> 02:22:22,559
[SPEAKER_12]: We are so thankful for the role model you were to so many of our students for your, again, I come back to the word joy, but just, I think about the opening of school.

923
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:33,287
[SPEAKER_12]: outside when you had all the teachers, all of us sort of lined up and the teachers came in and there was so much excitement and your commitment to learning.

924
02:22:33,887 --> 02:22:44,135
[SPEAKER_12]: You took us through a very difficult and dark time with COVID when everybody was scared and anxious

925
02:22:45,115 --> 02:22:49,138
[SPEAKER_12]: And you were our leader, and that was just amazing.

926
02:22:49,858 --> 02:22:53,601
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are here tonight to thank you.

927
02:22:54,201 --> 02:23:07,470
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like it went so fast, but we so appreciate your dedication, the gifts you have brought to Medford, the gifts that you are leaving with us, and that we are better for you having been here.

928
02:23:08,371 --> 02:23:10,332
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so very much, Marice.

929
02:23:13,032 --> 02:23:14,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I ditto, I couldn't say more.

930
02:23:14,955 --> 02:23:28,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think that you've brought so much to the district, the first female in the district, the first black woman in the district after decades of, you know, the same leadership and having to take on an entirely new district and do all that you did.

931
02:23:29,395 --> 02:23:32,636
[SPEAKER_14]: And the short time that you were here has been remarkable.

932
02:23:32,796 --> 02:23:34,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really valued working with you.

933
02:23:34,717 --> 02:23:38,679
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that I will, I really look forward to see where you're going next.

934
02:23:39,259 --> 02:23:42,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will be watching you and looking out for your next successes.

935
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:45,502
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that we'll be proud of you wherever you go.

936
02:23:45,562 --> 02:23:46,122
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

937
02:23:50,043 --> 02:23:50,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

938
02:23:52,304 --> 02:23:53,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

939
02:23:56,903 --> 02:23:57,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

940
02:23:57,383 --> 02:23:58,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that was loud.

941
02:24:00,966 --> 02:24:17,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll wait for... So to limit myself, I wrote it down, because otherwise we'd be here all night.

942
02:24:18,208 --> 02:24:30,198
[SPEAKER_11]: So over the last seven years, I've had the privilege, I'm sorry, over seven years ago, I've had the privilege to be part of the superintendent search process where we selected our first new superintendent in a generation.

943
02:24:30,658 --> 02:24:35,362
[SPEAKER_11]: And from the very first round of interviews, it was evident to me who our next superintendent should be.

944
02:24:35,382 --> 02:24:41,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was pleased that the members of the search committee and finally the school committee agreed with me.

945
02:24:42,315 --> 02:24:47,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent was hands down the right choice for Medford, and I was thrilled when she accepted the job.

946
02:24:48,460 --> 02:24:55,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Working with Dr. Edouard-Vincent has been a pleasure, and I cannot thank her enough for all that I have learned these past seven years.

947
02:24:56,567 --> 02:24:59,650
[SPEAKER_11]: No one could have foreseen what a wild seven years this would be.

948
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:06,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent's focus on curriculum instruction was what we needed in Medford, and she delivered.

949
02:25:07,481 --> 02:25:15,745
[SPEAKER_11]: She started Learning Walks in the fall of 2019, and I am still sad that I did not get to partake in a Learning Walk thanks to the pandemic.

950
02:25:15,805 --> 02:25:25,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that former member Vandra Kloot did, and she spoke very highly of it, but that wasn't meant to be.

951
02:25:25,209 --> 02:25:28,290
[SPEAKER_11]: The pandemic could easily have been the defining event

952
02:25:29,165 --> 02:25:43,811
[SPEAKER_11]: of your tenure with Medford Public Schools, but your focus on curriculum and instruction, which began before the pandemic, continued through the pandemic, and after the pandemic, is what I believe will be your lasting legacy here.

953
02:25:44,511 --> 02:25:47,132
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am pleased to remember you for this great work.

954
02:25:48,853 --> 02:25:50,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, you didn't do it all alone.

955
02:25:50,473 --> 02:25:56,556
[SPEAKER_11]: There were many other leaders and teachers who were a big part of that, but you had to lead, so.

956
02:25:57,469 --> 02:25:59,690
[SPEAKER_11]: The job of the superintendent is truly massive.

957
02:25:59,970 --> 02:26:04,052
[SPEAKER_11]: The day-to-day lives of thousands of students, staff, and families are in your hands.

958
02:26:04,593 --> 02:26:11,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent gave her all, and no one could ever have questioned whether she was doing what she thought was best for students.

959
02:26:12,176 --> 02:26:14,718
[SPEAKER_11]: The pandemic was a trying time for everyone.

960
02:26:15,618 --> 02:26:16,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Many people lost their lives.

961
02:26:17,139 --> 02:26:20,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Many more lost their ability to support their families.

962
02:26:21,501 --> 02:26:24,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Focusing on providing food to students in need,

963
02:26:25,143 --> 02:26:29,107
[SPEAKER_11]: When access to our school meals program was suddenly shuttered was something I'm proud of.

964
02:26:29,787 --> 02:26:32,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dr. Edouard-Vincent was all in on this critical issue.

965
02:26:33,711 --> 02:26:39,136
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no playbook for what to do next when the pandemic began.

966
02:26:40,056 --> 02:26:43,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent led the district through a very trying time.

967
02:26:45,781 --> 02:26:47,323
[SPEAKER_11]: And for that, I am forever grateful.

968
02:26:48,857 --> 02:26:52,898
[SPEAKER_11]: It took a village, but we limited the amount of learning loss as best we could.

969
02:26:53,438 --> 02:27:00,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Expectations for students, teachers, staff, and families about what public education meant were turned upside down.

970
02:27:01,460 --> 02:27:12,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent has continued to lead us as we continue to work to mitigate learning losses caused by the pandemic, and I'm grateful for the focus on the mental health of our students and staff.

971
02:27:13,623 --> 02:27:15,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Education is truly a unique domain.

972
02:27:16,184 --> 02:27:17,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything changes every day.

973
02:27:18,743 --> 02:27:19,904
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not hyperbole.

974
02:27:20,604 --> 02:27:29,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal, state and local laws, regulations and rulings change how education is implemented with breakneck speed and often little time for implementation.

975
02:27:29,948 --> 02:27:35,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Research on best practices and education is released at a completely uncontrolled speed.

976
02:27:36,612 --> 02:27:39,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Our students, staff and families themselves change too.

977
02:27:39,333 --> 02:27:45,596
[SPEAKER_11]: The saying that the only thing that is constant is change is true in education as well.

978
02:27:46,826 --> 02:27:52,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I would further add that each of us from one moment to the next is not the same nor entirely different.

979
02:27:53,969 --> 02:28:00,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent has led thousands of people for seven years through never ending change and we are better for her efforts.

980
02:28:02,072 --> 02:28:08,054
[SPEAKER_11]: On a personal note, I will miss the welcoming nature Dr. Edouard-Vincent brings to every interaction.

981
02:28:09,144 --> 02:28:11,486
[SPEAKER_11]: She arrives with joy and spreads it liberally.

982
02:28:12,287 --> 02:28:28,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether welcoming teachers and students back for the first day in person, for the first day of in-person education during the pandemic, or at a pep rally, or riding school buses, she is always proud to be a Mustang, and in my mind, will always be a Mustang.

983
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:29,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Maurice.

984
02:28:30,942 --> 02:28:31,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, member Rousseau.

985
02:28:31,962 --> 02:28:32,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

986
02:28:37,247 --> 02:28:37,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

987
02:28:39,227 --> 02:28:50,493
[SPEAKER_17]: I also had the chance to sit on the superintendent search committee.

988
02:28:50,513 --> 02:28:52,554
[SPEAKER_17]: I was not on the school committee at the time.

989
02:28:54,375 --> 02:29:00,678
[SPEAKER_17]: But one of the things that was so striking during that process is every time we talked to you, I thought to myself,

990
02:29:02,474 --> 02:29:04,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent has a coaching mindset.

991
02:29:05,276 --> 02:29:12,602
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was one of the like prevailing things I thought about you as we were interviewing what felt like an endless number of candidates.

992
02:29:13,042 --> 02:29:14,123
[SPEAKER_17]: And they all were so different.

993
02:29:14,163 --> 02:29:16,004
[SPEAKER_17]: There was not two people that were the same.

994
02:29:16,845 --> 02:29:23,710
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that is so evident about the work that you've done here is that coaching mindset.

995
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:27,993
[SPEAKER_17]: So you truly look for your entire team to deliver.

996
02:29:28,533 --> 02:29:29,634
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just about you.

997
02:29:29,814 --> 02:29:30,715
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just about,

998
02:29:31,275 --> 02:29:33,256
[SPEAKER_17]: any one person, and I've always appreciated that.

999
02:29:34,897 --> 02:29:36,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like that hasn't always been easy.

1000
02:29:36,598 --> 02:29:52,567
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think there have been times where you have brought forward an idea like investing in professional development so that our evaluators could do a better job evaluating our staff in their service to children.

1001
02:29:52,587 --> 02:29:56,690
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do remember you getting considerable pushback about that.

1002
02:29:56,710 --> 02:29:59,692
[SPEAKER_17]: So the other thing I think about when I think about your time here

1003
02:30:00,592 --> 02:30:07,058
[SPEAKER_17]: is that you weren't afraid to start the ball moving in a direction that it hadn't moved before.

1004
02:30:07,538 --> 02:30:10,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And being the person that starts things is really hard.

1005
02:30:10,881 --> 02:30:16,366
[SPEAKER_17]: It means convincing people that it's gonna be okay to do this new thing.

1006
02:30:16,386 --> 02:30:21,851
[SPEAKER_17]: It means convincing people that we can do this and the other things that we were doing.

1007
02:30:21,871 --> 02:30:25,715
[SPEAKER_17]: And it also means saying no to the way things have always been done before.

1008
02:30:26,535 --> 02:30:34,182
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have really appreciated your willingness to hold the line and to say no to the way things have always been done here in this district.

1009
02:30:35,724 --> 02:30:37,946
[SPEAKER_17]: It's incredibly important in a district like ours.

1010
02:30:38,486 --> 02:30:47,575
[SPEAKER_17]: It is the way change gets made and the people who are willing to start the ball rolling up the hill have the very hardest job.

1011
02:30:47,615 --> 02:30:48,416
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for that.

1012
02:30:49,766 --> 02:30:53,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Lucas asked me the other day what you were going to do next.

1013
02:30:53,749 --> 02:31:00,053
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, whatever she does, I hope she has time to take a nap because it's been seven very long years.

1014
02:31:00,073 --> 02:31:00,573
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1015
02:31:04,095 --> 02:31:07,798
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a gift to present you.

1016
02:31:07,878 --> 02:31:12,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to fully unwrap it because we want to get it home safe, but we'll at least unwrap it.

1017
02:31:26,596 --> 02:31:26,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sure.

1018
02:31:27,277 --> 02:31:40,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So it says, Maurice Edouard Vincent, Superintendent of Schools, presented with gratitude for seven years of dedication, service to the staff and students of Medford.

1020
02:32:46,374 --> 02:32:47,336
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more flowers here.

1021
02:32:47,356 --> 02:32:48,619
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1022
02:33:21,690 --> 02:33:28,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only seven thirty five.

1023
02:33:54,218 --> 02:33:55,078
Thank you.

1024
02:34:05,222 --> 02:34:06,322
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, we'll cut a cake.

1025
02:34:07,222 --> 02:34:14,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Graham.

1026
02:34:14,405 --> 02:34:15,125
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1027
02:34:15,145 --> 02:34:15,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.
