[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

17
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Present.

18
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:34,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:47,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:54,417
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could remain standing to have a moment of silence for the victims of the Las Vegas massacre.

21
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:00,379
Thank you.

22
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,908
[SPEAKER_14]: dated October, is breast cancer month.

23
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:12,309
[SPEAKER_14]: If he could wear pink at the meetings, it would be appreciated.

24
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:16,210
[SPEAKER_14]: My mother had breast cancer on three different occasions.

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,652
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, as everybody knows, it's a very serious disease, and it affects many women in this country.

26
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:27,953
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, motions, orders, and resolutions.

27
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,474
[SPEAKER_14]: 1766, offered by Councilor Knight.

28
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:37,129
[SPEAKER_14]: It resolved that the city engineer required the damage in front of the residence located at 31 Wildwood Road be repaired.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,996
[SPEAKER_14]: This damage as a result of prior contractors using this public way as a staging area from Winthrop Street drained this project.

30
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:45,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

31
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

32
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:56,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the weekend I was out knocking on doors talking to some of my neighbors and one of the concerns that was raised was the fact that the roadway and the small patch of grass in front of 31

33
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:04,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Wildwood Road has been damaged, and it's been damaged for quite some time after the Winthrop Street draining project was conducted, Mr. President.

34
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:17,172
[SPEAKER_13]: They used that location as a staging area for some of their supplies, equipment, pipes, and the like, and what's happened is the roadway has begun to sink in, the grass patch has also sunken in, so it's creating an issue where there's a lot of puddling and pooling.

35
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:24,419
[SPEAKER_13]: You can also see that there's a temporary trench that was made right there at the location, Mr. President, and that has also settled to the point where it's creating

36
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,660
[SPEAKER_13]: an ice hazard come the cold weather.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asking my council colleagues to support this resolution and request that the city engineer contact the private contractor that was hired to perform the Winthrop Street draining project and get out there and fix this problem.

38
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:42,845
[SPEAKER_13]: As we know, we issued a special permit and the special permit requires that all our streets be restored to pristine condition.

39
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:47,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, that wasn't the case in this construction project, so I'm asking that this contract to be held accountable.

40
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:48,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,423
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

42
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,026
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

43
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:56,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

44
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

45
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:07,761
[SPEAKER_14]: 17-767 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Zoning Board of Appeals convene for the purpose of placing restrictions on pre-existing

46
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:14,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Non-conforming use variance issued to the property located at 186 Winthrop Street.

47
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

48
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:16,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

49
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:21,496
[SPEAKER_13]: The property located at 186 Winthrop Street is one that's been familiar to this council in the past.

50
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I've raised issues concerning its operations.

51
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:27,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, this is a business that's on the corner of West Street and Winthrop Street.

52
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:31,744
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's happened is they've continuously exceeded operating hours.

53
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,348
[SPEAKER_13]: In the month of May alone, I've counted 15 violations that I personally reported.

54
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:44,794
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also seeing a large number of trucks using West Street or Residential Street for trucking purposes and for staging purposes while they cook their

55
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:54,426
[SPEAKER_13]: muffins and bagels, that stone and skillet, they're leaving the trucks idling on West Street, bringing them around the block, loading the trucks up, and while they're loading the trucks up, they're blocking the public way.

56
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:56,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Winthrop Street, they're blocking the public way, West Street.

57
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,636
[SPEAKER_13]: The neighbors have reached a point of frustration, the property's in disrepair.

58
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:04,719
[SPEAKER_13]: It's shabbily maintained, the sidewalk's covered in grease.

59
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:09,302
[SPEAKER_13]: The back of the facility looks like an abomination, Mr. President.

60
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:17,466
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm asking the Zoning Board of Appeals to convene for the purpose of placing restrictions on this pre-existing non-conforming use variance that was issued to the property, Mr. President.

61
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asking my council colleagues to support this.

62
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:23,730
[SPEAKER_13]: The way that this would work is we'd make this recommendation, it would go to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

63
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,393
[SPEAKER_13]: The Zoning Board of Appeals would then take the matter up on their agenda, provide notification to the abutters,

64
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:41,619
[SPEAKER_13]: and the property owner, everyone gets in the same room, they can have an opportunity to explain and express some of the concerns that they have and some of the issues that they'd have to deal with, and then the Zoning Board of Appeals can make the appropriate determination because this is something that's under their purview.

65
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,620
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight.

66
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:45,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Dello Russo.

67
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I just want to comment on this matter.

68
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:52,365
[SPEAKER_12]: The council has spoken on this issue a couple times.

69
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:58,709
[SPEAKER_12]: We're aware that this was brought to the Board of Health and Inspectional Services for action.

70
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:12,140
[SPEAKER_12]: I just feel it's quite unfortunate that the business proprietor who rents that spot has obviously chosen not to be a good neighbor and isn't engaged in business practices.

71
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:24,172
[SPEAKER_12]: that are conducive to being in a neighborhood and having the pre-existing non-conforming use variances that it's had.

72
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,296
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's unfortunate that it's come to this.

73
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:29,899
[SPEAKER_12]: I support this motion and second approval.

74
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,542
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor De La Rosa.

75
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:33,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

76
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:40,748
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to point out, Mr. President, that because this establishment's a bakery wholesaler, state law governs the oversight.

77
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And our local board of health has no local control.

78
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:48,435
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's creating a significant problem in our ability to enforce what's going on down there.

79
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:55,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, this non-conforming use variance has been issued, it's been in place since when Marty's for Potties was there with Marty Murphy Sr.

80
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,647
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a non-conforming use variance that's been in place.

81
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was even initiated before the Zoning Act, Mr. President.

82
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,694
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I think that the neighborhood has had enough.

83
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,896
[SPEAKER_13]: They need relief, and I'm asking my council colleagues to support this.

84
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,858
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

85
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:14,599
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

86
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:14,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

87
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

88
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:34,314
[SPEAKER_14]: 17668, offered by Councilor Knight, be resolved that the Medford City Council request that the code enforcement officer investigate the operations of Jack's Gas Station on Main Street, including but not limited to the parking and storage and maintenance of vehicles under their care being performed on Palmer Street.

89
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:35,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

90
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:37,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

91
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:43,498
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been contacted by a number of residents on Thomas Street concerning the operations of Jack's Gas Station.

92
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:55,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Aside from the fact that there are concerns about the hours of operation opening a little bit sooner than the city would permit and staying open a little bit later than the city would permit, there's also a lot of work that's being done on our public way.

93
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:59,885
[SPEAKER_13]: They're staging vehicles on our public way and they're performing repair work on vehicles on our public way.

94
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,267
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a small residential street, it's Thomas Street,

95
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,213
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a business at the top of the street that has four to five employees that are all parking their vehicles on the street.

96
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:14,256
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we're having customers that are bringing their cars into this gas station, this service station for service, and they have no place to put these cars.

97
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:19,820
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're taking those cars and also putting them on Thomas Street, taking up a number of the residential parking spots that are on the street, Mr. President.

98
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:30,768
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm asking the code enforcement officer to go down there and investigate the situation to see if we can come up with some sort of mutual agreement and some sort of enforcement in continuity with operations down there, Mr. President.

99
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:35,671
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a residential neighborhood, and the gas station has been there for a very long time.

100
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:41,055
[SPEAKER_13]: And under previous ownerships, it was able to operate in concert with the neighborhood in good standing.

101
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:49,241
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't see why that cannot continue, provided that we can bring them together and the parties together and talk about what's going on and the impact that it's having on the quality of life of those residents.

102
00:07:49,753 --> 00:08:02,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if I could amend this to ask that the code enforcement officer also investigate their other operation across from the police station for the used car business that they're running there.

103
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:09,700
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a license, but they're parking on, they have over the amount of cars I think are allowed, and they're parking on the state property.

104
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:14,562
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we could amend that to put that in there also.

105
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly have no objection to that, Councilor.

106
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:22,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that anything that we can do to protect the quality of life of the residents in that neighborhood is something that's beneficial to all.

107
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,731
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I move approval on the question and ask for a second.

108
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,714
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

109
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,354
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favour?

110
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:29,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

111
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

112
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:32,497
17669.

113
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

114
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Method DPW remove the following stumps.

115
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:41,084
[SPEAKER_14]: 75 Suffolk Street, 15 Benham Street.

116
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:41,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

117
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:48,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, the tree stump at 75 Suffolk Street and I have a very long and colorful history.

118
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:51,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I think when I was 11 years old, I crashed my bike on it and got stitches in my head.

119
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,093
[SPEAKER_13]: And since that time, the sidewalk in front of the home at 75 Suffolk Street has been broken up from this.

120
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,488
[SPEAKER_13]: tree and not my head.

121
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:03,349
[SPEAKER_13]: The sidewalk's not broken because I fell down, but because I crashed into the tree.

122
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:05,610
[SPEAKER_13]: But the sidewalk's all broken up.

123
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,090
[SPEAKER_13]: The tree is gigantic, Mr. President.

124
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,312
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been cut down, but the stump remains in the same location for an extended period of time.

125
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:17,955
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm asking that the DPW go out there and take the appropriate steps to fix the sidewalk and to remove the stump.

126
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:30,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Likewise, for the location at 15 Benham Street, Mr. President, although my relationship with that tree stump isn't as intimate as the one on Suffolk Street, it's the same circumstances, same situation, same facts, and I'd ask that the DPW remove those following tree stumps.

127
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Falco.

128
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

129
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:45,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I support this resolution, and if the Councilor wouldn't mind, I'd like to add a free stump at 27 Saunders Street that has been there for a number of years, and it hasn't been removed, and it needs to be removed in the interest of public safety.

130
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:57,354
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm at it, if we could also get a list from the DPW Director, updating us as to what stumps were removed this summer, and what sidewalk panels were repaired.

131
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:59,014
[SPEAKER_00]: We appropriated funding for that.

132
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:05,096
[SPEAKER_00]: while back and it would be good to get an update as to see what kind of progress was made during this past summer.

133
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:12,539
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Falco.

134
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,680
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

135
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

136
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

137
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank Councilor Knight for putting this on.

138
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to take it one step further than Councilor Falco.

139
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:30,084
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can get a complete listing of all the stumps, we got one roughly, I think it was about a year and a half ago from Brian Kerins.

140
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:36,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'm looking for, Mr. President, is a list of the age of the stump,

141
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:41,952
[SPEAKER_04]: how long it's been there, and what is gonna be done to remove the stump.

142
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like the address, the age of the stump, and when the city plans on removing the stump.

143
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:50,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

144
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:58,014
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco and Vice President Mox, all those in favor?

145
00:10:58,314 --> 00:10:58,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

146
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

147
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:08,781
[SPEAKER_14]: 17670 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the striping at the intersection of Woobin Street and Wildwood Road be repainted in the interest of public safety.

148
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:09,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

149
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

150
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:19,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Woobin Street is a relatively busy street that's populated with a number of children, and what we're seeing is a lot of kids walking to school in that neighborhood, Mr. President.

151
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:42,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Street right up over Austin Street right down to the Brooke School and the four-way stop sign at Wildwood and Woburn Street is operating but the actual striping on the street is not and in years past they've come out and they've restriped this area and when I was out knocking doors last weekend a number of residents expressed concern over the fact that it hasn't been done

152
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:50,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've also noted that they've seen an increase in the number of cars that are actually running the stop sign now because these controls aren't in place, Mr. President.

153
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,554
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm asking that the DPW take the appropriate steps to rectify the situation for the neighborhood.

154
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:59,677
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Mox.

155
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:01,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

156
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:05,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I would ask, considering this

157
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:16,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this particular petition, but this finds its way on our council agenda, I'd say, probably two dozen times a year regarding unpainted crosswalks.

158
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, as one member of the Council, and this has been supported by the Council on numerous occasions, proposed implementing thermoplastic crosswalks, Mr. President, that last up to five years, slip-resistant, highly resistible.

159
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:37,251
[SPEAKER_04]: State highway uses it on their state roads, Mr. President.

160
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:47,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know why we as a community are still using the old methods of paint, and then within six months, you can't see the crosswalk anymore.

161
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize it's a little more expensive, but I think if you do the math and figure it over a five-year period where you don't have to touch them again, it'll be cost-effective for us to move that way.

162
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still can't fathom

163
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:07,632
[SPEAKER_04]: the number of times that I've brought this issue up, Mr. President, why we don't move in that direction.

164
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:17,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have yet to receive an answer from the past administration under McGlynn and the present administration under Burke why we can't move forward on thermoplastic, Mr. President.

165
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:32,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that this respectfully be amended, Mr. President, to get a response back from the administration on why the thermoplastic is not being used, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

166
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:38,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I put on a resolution last week regarding other streets, Mr. President.

167
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:41,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if you go around, it's already October.

168
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:46,579
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go around the city, I'd venture to say that probably a little less than half are painted.

169
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're already in October.

170
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:55,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure when the ideal time is to paint, but it's certainly not in the winter months.

171
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:56,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

172
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:57,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

173
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

174
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

175
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to second this paper and second the amendment.

176
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:10,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been a Councilor for many years, and Councilman Locke has brought up thermoplastic crosswalks for years.

177
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:15,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something that we do need to explore, and we beg the administration to look into it.

178
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:22,351
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not have the Department of Public Works staff to paint the crosswalks in the spring in a timely manner.

179
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:29,555
[SPEAKER_08]: We just don't have the staff to do it, and we don't have the staff to repair the ones that are faded come September, October, November.

180
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:43,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So to have something that's permanent for five years, we can create a system where we're doing 20% of the streets on a yearly basis, and we'll be able to have all of the crosswalks painted all the time.

181
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:46,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what the residents deserve, and that's for public safety.

182
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:51,870
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the best interest of public safety, so I would move approval on that and beg for an answer at this point.

183
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:52,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

184
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

185
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:57,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass.

186
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:00,400
[SPEAKER_11]: The crosswalks over on Salem Street were painted late.

187
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:10,289
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is very interesting because this is a crosswalk that a resident of Otis Street asked and they made a crosswalk between Tony's Gas and the crossing at Otis Street.

188
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:17,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I had many potholes on the street and I went to Brian Cairns, and God bless him, three days later he fixed the potholes.

189
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:23,362
[SPEAKER_11]: But they put the tar on top of the freshly painted crosswalk.

190
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:27,306
[SPEAKER_11]: It had been painted maybe a month ago, a month before the tarring.

191
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,809
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you have a situation where this administration

192
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:47,219
[SPEAKER_11]: paints the crosswalks late, and then after someone goes to the news media and to Brian Karen's, and I believe that's why it was helpful when I went to the news media, as a resident told me they went to the mayor in May at LaCasse's and the mayor said she couldn't do it on Garfield.

193
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I later got them to do it.

194
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,645
[SPEAKER_11]: You can now get this horrendous crosswalk that is like tarred and feathered.

195
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,125
[SPEAKER_11]: It's black and white.

196
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:55,926
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

197
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's double work.

198
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,767
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. Kearns told me he would then go and repaint it.

199
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,509
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you have painting, tarring, and painting.

200
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Councilor, Vice President Marks is right.

201
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right.

202
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:09,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Thermal plastic would resolve the issue.

203
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,953
[SPEAKER_11]: But they would have to put the roads in good condition.

204
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,354
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a priority.

205
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:17,995
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that the councilors consider amending this

206
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:31,715
[SPEAKER_11]: motion or resolution to have that the crosswalks, if they put thermoplastic or paint, that they also make sure that they are paved correctly, because we'll have problems, sir, if they have uneven crosswalks.

207
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:33,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

208
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:33,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

209
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, just a quick question.

210
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,301
[SPEAKER_04]: The gentleman brings up a great point.

211
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:47,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope, with any new construction that's going on in the community, that thermoplastic would be the practice of this community.

212
00:16:48,386 --> 00:17:00,529
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if we wait to fix our streets, which we know we do roughly 20-odd streets every five years in this community, and they're not full streets.

213
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:08,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we wait to fix our streets to a standard that we believe is acceptable, we'll never use thermoplastic.

214
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:11,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of the cat chasing its tail.

215
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:13,872
[SPEAKER_04]: We're never going to get ahead of this, Mr. President.

216
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:18,996
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm very supportive of the Complete Streets project that's going on now.

217
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:31,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's discussing many issues I've spoken about on traffic calming initiatives over the past 10 years, bump-outs at raised crosswalks, and other initiatives to slow down traffic on our streets, Mr. President.

218
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:36,391
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all fine and dandy, but we also have to meet the basic necessities

219
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:42,476
[SPEAKER_04]: which are painting our crosswalks, which are fixing potholes, which is fixing sidewalks.

220
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:53,287
[SPEAKER_04]: When I talk to business owners and they say, well, you're going to get a bump out in West Method, they say, that's great, but what about the huge hole I have in the sidewalk in front of my business that people are tripping over every day?

221
00:17:53,847 --> 00:18:01,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nice to do those additions, and I support, as I said, complete streets and the $400,000 we got from the state to work on that.

222
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:09,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also have to look at our own infrastructure and start repairing what we currently have, Mr. President, which are basic necessities.

223
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:16,544
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a wish list, basic necessities to fix a pothole and paint our crosswalks.

224
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a public safety issue, Mr. President.

225
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:32,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an item on the agenda a little bit later on in the agenda that's going to talk again about public safety issues, Mr. President, and what can result when the city does not act upon these particular important issues.

226
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:33,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

227
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,449
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Nice,

228
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

229
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:42,516
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

230
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

231
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:44,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion as amended.

232
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:45,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

233
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:56,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please mock Councilor Scarpelli as being present.

234
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:05,763
[SPEAKER_14]: 17761 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Philip Bumpa McGonigal on his recent passing.

235
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:16,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Phillip was a Method High graduate of 1942, World War II veteran, retired Malden firefighter, and a caring father, grandfather, and family man.

236
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

237
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I think this resolution speaks for itself.

238
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:25,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. McGonigal recently passed away, and it's with deep condolences that I bring this matter before the city council.

239
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:33,292
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asking my colleagues to join me in offering our deepest and most sincere condolences to the family of Phillip Bumper McGonigal.

240
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:36,354
[SPEAKER_13]: He's the father of MHS assistant baseball coach John McGonigal.

241
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:40,469
[SPEAKER_13]: John's the son-in-law of former town manager, John Cleone.

242
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,295
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

243
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,640
[SPEAKER_13]: The gentleman lived a strong and long and healthy life.

244
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,564
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could have more, Councilor Knight, if we could read that also.

245
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:48,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

246
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:56,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Al Canava.

247
00:19:56,421 --> 00:20:00,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Canava served our country in World War II in the Navy on the USS Halligan.

248
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:03,728
[SPEAKER_14]: His vessel was attacked and killing 162 crewmen.

249
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:09,134
[SPEAKER_14]: He drifted in the Pacific off the coast of Okinawa several days before he was rescued.

250
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:14,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Canava was decorated by President Delano Roosevelt for his service.

251
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:19,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Canava was also active in many local organizations and was the past president of the Mecca Corners.

252
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:23,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Canava was also a member of our liquor commission for many years.

253
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,821
[SPEAKER_14]: He was known as Crazy Legs Canava and was a star athlete at BC, and he also played with the Green Bay Packers.

254
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,062
[SPEAKER_14]: The president and our community will be missed.

255
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:40,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

256
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:47,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up paper 17673.

257
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:57,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take up paper 17673, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

258
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,315
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

259
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

260
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:06,220
[SPEAKER_14]: 17673, dear President Caraviello and members of Medford City Council,

261
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:15,266
[SPEAKER_14]: This past April, the council approved food trucks at 10 various events that have or will be held in the city of Medford.

262
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:22,408
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, nine of these events have already been held, and there is one scheduled for October at Harvest Energy Festival.

263
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:30,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I respectfully request that the council endorse similar endorsement of food trucks for the Fells 5K that will be held on November 5th, 2017.

264
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:31,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

265
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:34,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval, Mr. President.

266
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:34,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

267
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:40,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion by, under motion by Councilor, Vice President Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

268
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:41,774
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

269
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:42,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

270
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

271
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:44,355
[SPEAKER_13]: We're under suspension, Mr. President.

272
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:45,655
[SPEAKER_14]: While we're under suspension.

273
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper 17-433.

274
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:47,516
17.

275
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:55,398
[SPEAKER_13]: It's under reports and deadlines, reports due and deadlines, Mr. President.

276
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,338
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the 90-day review of Annie's Pizzeria.

277
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:57,378
[SPEAKER_13]: 17-433.

278
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,361
[SPEAKER_14]: In his pizzeria, Middlesex Avenue, special permit hours, 90-day review, October 3rd, 2017.

279
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

280
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:23,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'd ask that this matter be placed on next week's agenda and that the business owner be notified to come and appeal before us so that we can discuss any complaints or concerns that have come up during the first 90 days of operation with the extended hours license.

281
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:24,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

282
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:32,707
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Councilor- Before it's called, I as one councilor haven't got any complaints and I don't know if anybody else has, but usually

283
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:38,571
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's no complaints, we kind of leave it on the agenda for a little longer so they can always take it up at another time.

284
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:41,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how the council feels.

285
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:44,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I just feel like why drag the business owner in if there's been no complaints?

286
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:46,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

287
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Mox.

288
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:59,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Just if I could, in the past when we've had 30, 60, or 90 day reviews, does the city clerk reach out to the petitioner to let him know when the review is before the council?

289
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:00,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk.

290
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:18,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we don't just initiate it based on the day that we're saying 36 this petitioner has been has been checking in no way Okay

291
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:38,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight move approval the paper if I may just one more so Clark Finn the petitioner wants to come before us Yes, I don't have a decision for me, but I think the hours Extended hours are granted

292
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:51,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the council, if I'm correct, staggered the hours, 90 days, these particular hours, based on their view that move to another 90 days.

293
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, yes.

294
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Staggered hours, so that's why.

295
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So after 90 days, he was gonna get an extended.

296
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was one extra hour.

297
00:23:58,381 --> 00:23:59,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, sounds good.

298
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:03,083
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

299
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:04,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I second.

300
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,104
[SPEAKER_14]: By Councilor Scarpel, all those in favor?

301
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:06,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

302
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:06,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

303
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:07,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

304
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

305
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

306
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,275
[SPEAKER_14]: 16-672.

307
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:20,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Petitions, presentations, and civil matters.

308
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:31,147
[SPEAKER_14]: 16-672, petition by Joseph Ignioni, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass., to address the council with a citizen's report on an open meeting law violation of Chapter 74 Board

309
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,822
[SPEAKER_14]: from the Attorney General's office.

310
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:39,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Joe Villione, again, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

311
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:52,906
[SPEAKER_11]: When I attended a film screening in this very room, three members of what they called a public access TV board introduced themselves to me right outside, including Paul Garrity, who I've known for many years, formerly of Medford community, Cablevision.

312
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:59,487
[SPEAKER_11]: As we citizens have kept a firm eye on access, I asked members of the council and school committee

313
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:06,222
[SPEAKER_11]: if they knew about this public access TV board, which is what they told me was the name of it.

314
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:15,450
[SPEAKER_11]: The Councilors and person from the school committee had no idea, no idea, and then Breanna Lungo-Koehn put it on the agenda for the next week.

315
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:29,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So I filed a violation of the open meeting law, and on September 19th, 2017, when we were all at the auditorium, the attorney general's office found that they were not in compliance.

316
00:25:30,188 --> 00:25:35,691
[SPEAKER_11]: that they kept this board, which went on for a year and a half, maybe two years, secret from the public.

317
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:47,857
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no open meeting laws of a board designed to spend the money that a former city councilor worked very hard to save this city, and now we have this room.

318
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:51,199
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of like the fruit of the poisonous tree.

319
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:55,661
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a board that's operating and the public is not aware of it,

320
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:05,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they get to spend our money, ostensibly, or the administration or the high school or whomever spent the money is getting advice from this board.

321
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:12,923
[SPEAKER_11]: It flies in the face of transparency, open government, partners in progress.

322
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,524
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no partners.

323
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:17,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Neil Osborne and I have spoken about this.

324
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:19,007
[SPEAKER_11]: He called it very frustrating.

325
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:21,409
[SPEAKER_11]: The diversity director called it very frustrating.

326
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,293
[SPEAKER_11]: He renamed his, his title is now Director of Diversity and Inclusion.

327
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:30,094
[SPEAKER_11]: which is like, okay, we have to have inclusion in this community.

328
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:36,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, when Mayor McGlynn had his tribunal with a priest, Fred Lasky, and Allison Goldsberry of the school,

329
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:59,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Citizens came up citizens came out to the tribunal but unbeknownst to anyone Mayor McGlynn had decided to put it here And I think vice president of the council might feel our pain when it comes to the parking commission Maybe he felt a similar kind of slight That we're all working with this tribunal the mayor has given us and all of a sudden we come in here in the mayor McGlynn's in the next room with all these

330
00:27:01,674 --> 00:27:03,896
[SPEAKER_11]: this huge dossier that he gave to people.

331
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:07,259
[SPEAKER_11]: They had been planning it all along while a tribunal was happening.

332
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,780
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is not open government.

333
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,641
[SPEAKER_11]: That's deceitful.

334
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,562
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not right.

335
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:14,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And the tribunal itself said, don't put it at the high school.

336
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Put it in a central location.

337
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mayor McGlynn put it here.

338
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:18,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're stuck with it.

339
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So the fruit of the poisonous tree.

340
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:23,733
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a committee that flew under the radar.

341
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:25,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we know about it.

342
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:27,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're on the Attorney General's site.

343
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:27,977
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see Chapter 74 board.

344
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:34,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And Roy Bellson called it a chapter 74 board and they had to have it for vocational school.

345
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:36,390
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that have to do with public access?

346
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:37,753
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we do now?

347
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:44,994
[SPEAKER_11]: The station manager was in attendance at one of the meetings, but they were also discussing the station manager.

348
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:52,976
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this board discussed the hiring of a station manager and the public had no input, we don't know if this person has a thin resume.

349
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:58,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe all the station manager did was the lighting for some tribute band, which is on his resume.

350
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:04,138
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, okay, this public knows a little bit about public access, and it's been held back from us for 30 years.

351
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:06,606
[SPEAKER_11]: We worked very hard.

352
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of us in this room worked very, very hard for this.

353
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:17,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And to find a Chapter 74 board that I have to find out at a film screening in the parking lot of the high school is beyond outrageous.

354
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:23,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we have very smart people in this administration.

355
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:26,245
[SPEAKER_11]: So they cannot feign ignorance.

356
00:28:26,545 --> 00:28:27,986
[SPEAKER_11]: They cannot feign ignorance.

357
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:31,488
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to admit that this was done intentionally.

358
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:32,768
[SPEAKER_11]: What can we do about it?

359
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:33,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we go backwards?

360
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:41,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we forced to live with the determinations of this quasi board, which had people from Revere, New Hampshire.

361
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,274
[SPEAKER_11]: These people were not Medford people.

362
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And the station manager lives in Woburn.

363
00:28:46,783 --> 00:28:48,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And he came from Brookline Access TV.

364
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:50,304
[SPEAKER_11]: What does he know about Medford?

365
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:52,264
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a Medford station manager.

366
00:28:52,324 --> 00:29:06,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So I submit to this council, because of this board violation, which took a lot of hours on my part to bring to the Attorney General's attention, to find that they violated the law, we shouldn't be stuck with their determinations.

367
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,089
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have a whole clean slate.

368
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:11,150
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be an open house here October 15 for two hours.

369
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anyone know about it?

370
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:19,252
[SPEAKER_11]: So October 15th, 10 in the morning to noon, there will be an open house at the TV station.

371
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:20,633
[SPEAKER_11]: No one knows anything about this.

372
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,393
[SPEAKER_11]: You might need a quarry check to come in here.

373
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:30,075
[SPEAKER_11]: But because of our hard work, Ben Brown told me last night that they're going to waive the quarry if you mail your shows in.

374
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:33,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did I have to fight so hard for it September 19th?

375
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:36,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, you shouldn't have to file a court.

376
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:39,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Every access station I talk to about this is laughing at us.

377
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:51,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And they cannot believe that our city solicitor told me on Thursday that he created the quarry in this agreement, but he blamed Ben Brown for all of the five pages.

378
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:55,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll do respect to Mr. Brown and no respect to the city solicitor.

379
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:56,363
[SPEAKER_11]: The legalese in there.

380
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:58,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Some young man did not come up with that.

381
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:02,744
[SPEAKER_11]: This has the fingerprints of a certain lawyer in the city all over it.

382
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:06,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're being denied access.

383
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,846
[SPEAKER_11]: And the material I'm doing is Somerville.

384
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:11,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Woodburn should be seeing it.

385
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:12,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yeah, Medford should be seeing it.

386
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:14,567
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, Dan Hurley does a show after me.

387
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:17,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So Dan Hurley works for State Rep Paul Donato.

388
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,008
[SPEAKER_11]: And he does a great show called Somerville Pundits.

389
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:24,669
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we had a Medford station manager who knew about Dan Hurley and Johnny Byers,

390
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:28,450
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, Councilor Dello Russo's a good friend of Johnny Byers.

391
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:37,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see Councilor Dello Russo step up to the plate, call his friend Johnny Byers, and get him here at the station doing his sports show, because the stumbling blocks are keeping Johnny from coming here.

392
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:38,815
[SPEAKER_11]: He's afraid of getting sued.

393
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:39,935
[SPEAKER_11]: He told me this.

394
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,116
[SPEAKER_11]: He goes, Joe, you told me about the producer agreement.

395
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:42,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't sign it.

396
00:30:42,836 --> 00:30:43,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to get sued.

397
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the problem.

398
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:50,743
[SPEAKER_11]: So Elena Nurever, I guess her name is, from the old TV3, she signed all the documents.

399
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:51,764
[SPEAKER_11]: She's going to be on the air.

400
00:30:52,384 --> 00:31:03,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, because of this Chapter 74 violation, we're watching the Three Stooges, Dedham TV, Westford TV, Owlington TV, it's all coming into Medford.

401
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:09,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And once again, just like TV3, when that woman that was the station manager did her movies with our equipment.

402
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,260
[SPEAKER_11]: We're back to ground zero.

403
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,841
[SPEAKER_11]: We're back to this circle.

404
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:13,781
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone full circle.

405
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,281
[SPEAKER_11]: We are back to the same problem.

406
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:16,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to be here.

407
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:22,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I told Robert Mayocko, the former council president, I'll tell President Caraviello, I don't want to be up here every week, sir.

408
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:23,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you free of me.

409
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be on AXS TV, sir.

410
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:28,164
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think you owe me one.

411
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:29,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like you to go to bat for me, sir.

412
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:31,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Get me on AXS TV.

413
00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:33,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care about the quarry.

414
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:37,781
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and Adam Knight doesn't care about the quarry, but I think 60,000 other people do.

415
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:44,909
[SPEAKER_11]: What I care about, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, is the legalese where we can be sued because it's Tuesday.

416
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,051
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not fair.

417
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:49,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could do me a favor, Councilor Caraviello, and go to bat for me.

418
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:51,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want my shows on the air.

419
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:52,077
[SPEAKER_11]: No nonsense.

420
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:53,379
[SPEAKER_11]: They're good shows.

421
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,440
[SPEAKER_11]: They're clean shows.

422
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,702
[SPEAKER_11]: You would be happy to watch them.

423
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:59,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you won't have to read Medford Info Central because I'd be too busy doing my shows.

424
00:32:00,205 --> 00:32:01,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think it's a fair bargain.

425
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:03,609
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I have to say tonight.

426
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:05,491
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration's in violation.

427
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:06,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Shame on Roy Belson.

428
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:09,375
[SPEAKER_11]: The diversity director asked Roy Belson to leave.

429
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:14,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Belson, God bless him, he's done some good work for this community.

430
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:17,638
[SPEAKER_11]: But sometimes term limits gotta kick in.

431
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:24,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And Belson, I just don't think you're doing the right thing for the community, taking advantage of public access for the school.

432
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:32,925
[SPEAKER_11]: You and Stephanie Burke and my good friend Mark Rumley, shame on the three of you because you were the ones I went to for public access.

433
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:37,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And you people are acting worse than TV3 because you should know better.

434
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:39,168
[SPEAKER_11]: They were a non-profit.

435
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:43,551
[SPEAKER_11]: You are our public servants, and you're serving yourselves.

436
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:44,211
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to end.

437
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to go now.

438
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:50,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Ben Brown should go through the process of really showing us that he knows about feedback.

439
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:51,976
[SPEAKER_11]: One final thing before I stop.

440
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:57,700
[SPEAKER_11]: On September 19th, every speaker at the podium was getting huge feedback.

441
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had just come out of band practice, as you know.

442
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:04,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you all know, I stood eight inches or maybe a foot behind the mic, and I got no feedback.

443
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I asked Ben Brown last night, he said, well, I couldn't run back here to the studio to adjust the volume.

444
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:10,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, what are you talking about?

445
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:12,695
[SPEAKER_11]: All you had to do was get people.

446
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:14,796
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the audio expert on his resume.

447
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:15,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

448
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:18,959
[SPEAKER_11]: All you had to do was stand back here, and the feedback would have went away.

449
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:21,221
[SPEAKER_11]: But we need a station manager that knows this.

450
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:22,562
[SPEAKER_11]: We need an older person.

451
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:26,750
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, as Chris Donovan's out there, Joe Fortunato, I want to help.

452
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,892
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of us out there that know what we're doing.

453
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:30,093
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not young.

454
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:36,657
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, first time managing a station, when I looked at his resume, he claims otherwise, but it's his first time.

455
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,479
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've managed radio stations.

456
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:40,680
[SPEAKER_11]: We know how this works.

457
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Fortunato's out there, Donovan's out there, the Gravity Company was here.

458
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,604
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of great resources in Medford.

459
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:52,628
[SPEAKER_11]: We need someone that knows Medford, that loves Medford, and that wants to help everyone in this room and all 60,000 people.

460
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:54,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your time.

461
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

462
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:58,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to receive and place on file.

463
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion by Councilor Nathan, received and placed on file.

464
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by?

465
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:02,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

466
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:03,496
[SPEAKER_14]: By Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

467
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:04,157
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

468
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:04,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

469
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:05,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

470
00:34:07,223 --> 00:34:08,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, motion to take.

471
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:11,884
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're finished with that part of it right now.

472
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,184
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like to come back after.

473
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:16,645
[SPEAKER_08]: With suspension of the rules.

474
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspend the rules, so to speak.

475
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion by Councilor Lococo to suspend the rules.

476
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:21,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It will only take me a minute.

477
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I spoke long while ago about, I don't want a show.

478
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:26,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a show.

479
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:27,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want anything like that.

480
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:29,268
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know people who do.

481
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:32,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And they cannot understand how we don't have this in Medford.

482
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,490
[SPEAKER_07]: And I talked to somebody who runs the,

483
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,762
[SPEAKER_07]: station in Somerville, and he's right.

484
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:41,583
[SPEAKER_07]: They laughed.

485
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:45,205
[SPEAKER_07]: They said to me, I don't understand what's wrong with you people.

486
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:51,009
[SPEAKER_07]: And when Bob Pinto was running, we had to have somebody come from Somerville to tape it.

487
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:52,930
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely ridiculous.

488
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have someone running for mayor.

489
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:59,275
[SPEAKER_07]: He should be able to go on once a week and introduce himself.

490
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:03,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have nothing personal about it, but I really want to get this done.

491
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in med for 17 years, and for 17 years we've been talking about it.

492
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:10,268
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely crazy.

493
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:12,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you.

494
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:14,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

495
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:14,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

496
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:15,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

497
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:21,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Miffin Mass, former member of the Saugus party.

498
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:31,607
[SPEAKER_10]: The part that I think is concerning is when we go back to that September 19th meeting, and I don't know if Mr. Burns is in the other room or not, but the question that was asked of him when he came to the podium, he couldn't answer the question.

499
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the solicitor is here, so he may want to answer it.

500
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't know what somebody can do.

501
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:44,895
[SPEAKER_10]: to make a presentation if they can submit it by mail, which means they need a query check if they don't need a query check.

502
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:51,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, do all you Councilors need a query check because you're in a building where you're close to children that are outside in the school?

503
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:53,738
[SPEAKER_10]: The next question begs itself to City Hall.

504
00:35:53,758 --> 00:36:04,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Does every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent,

505
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:09,086
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?

506
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:09,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

507
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:14,430
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think this whole issue has opened up a great question needs to be asked.

508
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:18,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do we need a query check and under what conditions and circumstances do we need it?

509
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:30,563
[SPEAKER_10]: If I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your

510
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:42,836
[SPEAKER_10]: take a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a Councilor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check?

511
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:49,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Do employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students?

512
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:49,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

513
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:58,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them, I understand all of that, but I don't know the nuances about everyone, contractors,

514
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:09,051
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query checked.

515
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:10,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's all well and good.

516
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:16,393
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said,

517
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:20,255
[SPEAKER_10]: How is a query check going to be implemented?

518
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:29,120
[SPEAKER_10]: And more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not?

519
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access.

520
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:39,286
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check.

521
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:44,909
[SPEAKER_10]: But I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building.

522
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:52,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used.

523
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:58,778
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner.

524
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And let me just say this one last thing about the election.

525
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,861
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a damn shame.

526
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:15,369
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation.

527
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:17,890
[SPEAKER_10]: This unfortunately seems to be at a last minute.

528
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,551
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a quick ploy to get itself in.

529
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:20,812
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got your notices.

530
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:23,673
[SPEAKER_10]: The last one is tomorrow or the next day this week.

531
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:26,075
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sort of like- I think they've extended the schedule.

532
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:28,537
[SPEAKER_10]: They've extended the schedule, but it's a little bit unfair.

533
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,899
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this has been running around for a long period of time.

534
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:38,787
[SPEAKER_10]: They had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together.

535
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:51,018
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been taking place for a long period of time, and I think it's just a little bit unfair, and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now, I think that's what we need to know, whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office.

536
00:38:51,739 --> 00:39:00,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file.

537
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:01,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

538
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:02,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

539
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Solicitor, the paper's already been disposed of, Mr. President.

540
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:07,245
[SPEAKER_14]: That is correct, Councilor Layton.

541
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:08,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

542
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:09,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

543
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Mark Rumley.

544
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the City Solicitor.

545
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

546
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,264
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some discussion about the Corey Check requirement for producers at cable access television.

547
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to run through it just so it's understood.

548
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:28,933
[SPEAKER_02]: First, Corey Checks are required under Chapter 71 of the Massachusetts General Law and

549
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts Code of Regulations 803.

550
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:35,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't give you the specific sections off the top of my head.

551
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:49,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, anyone who is employed in the school system or who would be a contractor who works here during different things like a roof or lighting or anything of that nature, and it even goes to volunteers, if

552
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:58,563
[SPEAKER_02]: they would have, or the possibility of having, direct and unmonitored contact with a student, with a child.

553
00:39:58,764 --> 00:39:59,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It is required.

554
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,846
[SPEAKER_02]: This studio is part of the high school building.

555
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:11,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have a separate entrance, but it also has other doors in this room which could lead out, which do lead out to the school proper.

556
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is on school grounds now.

557
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:22,134
[SPEAKER_02]: The studio is also used, I'm not sure if, I think it's through the vocational school, but it's for the students who are involved in media arts.

558
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:32,198
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a time every day in which there's an overlap of time in which the studio could be used for public access and can be used by students for media arts.

559
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:44,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that overlap, there is a possibility that producers who come here to produce, bless you, that producers who come here to produce public access television shows could have

560
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:47,565
[SPEAKER_02]: unmonitored and direct contact with students.

561
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, if they're going to be a producer who's going to work here in this school building where this access studio is, they must be quarried once.

562
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are two exceptions to that.

563
00:41:00,652 --> 00:41:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: The first exception is a question that came up a couple of weeks ago when Ben Brown said he'd like to give those candidates for public office the opportunity to have some type of production.

564
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:17,160
[SPEAKER_02]: A limit on the time, perhaps, but it would be given to every single candidate.

565
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:30,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I explained to him in a way which is a lot longer than I can explain tonight how he is the producer of that show and everyone here would be, those who would be running for office, would be invited to come here.

566
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:39,633
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't rise to the level of being the producer of a public access show because you're responded to an invitation to come up and do a political spot.

567
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:41,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would not have to be quarried.

568
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:43,896
[SPEAKER_02]: That was established a couple of weeks ago.

569
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a conversation that I had with Mr. Brown this week, he said, if a producer is going to produce their show or whatever it is, their product, off-premises, and not come to the school, do they have to be quarried?

570
00:41:58,288 --> 00:41:59,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously they don't.

571
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have to be a member of public access, but they wouldn't have to be quarried.

572
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:15,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The requirement of a Cori check arises because of this location, the overlap in time with public access and the media students, and the requirements of state statute and regulation.

573
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:19,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't put in there just to make somebody's life difficult.

574
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:25,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It was put in there because it's required by statute and regulation, and that's why it's in the producer's agreement.

575
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:27,332
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

576
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:27,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

577
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:28,813
[SPEAKER_14]: If I ask a question?

578
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:29,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

579
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:29,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

580
00:42:29,353 --> 00:42:29,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

581
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:34,355
[SPEAKER_08]: President Caraviello, can you further explain, the Cori, I understand.

582
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what about the contract?

583
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:41,977
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could explain why, I think it was a two-page contract that also needs to be signed by anybody that wants to produce a show?

584
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:49,620
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people who... Yes, there's a producer's agreement, and it deals with their productions, their liabilities, and that sort of thing.

585
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The notion that no adult is ever liable for any actions they take

586
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:57,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And a public access producer would be just like that.

587
00:42:57,805 --> 00:43:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That notion is just simply not true as a matter of law.

588
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:06,152
[SPEAKER_02]: If you libel somebody or if you do something to infringe on another person's rights, you could be liable for it.

589
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:09,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And the producer's agreement acknowledges that.

590
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,739
[SPEAKER_02]: The original one which was sent to me by Mr. Brown had some

591
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: clarifications that it needed.

592
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:25,805
[SPEAKER_02]: The major input that the law department made on that was to insert the CORI requirement for the reasons that I've just described to you.

593
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:28,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

594
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:29,015
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

595
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, call for the orders of the day, Mr. President.

596
00:43:33,798 --> 00:43:35,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

597
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:35,699
17, 675.

598
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to respond to Mr. Rumbaugh.

599
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,340
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important.

600
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.

601
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:42,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

602
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:43,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper's been disposed of.

603
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Gentlemen, is that a top and opportunity to discuss on this?

604
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:46,344
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very important for the public.

605
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:47,184
[SPEAKER_11]: This was my paper.

606
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:48,825
[SPEAKER_13]: This isn't even an item that's on the agenda at this point.

607
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:49,845
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper has been disposed of.

608
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:51,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Call for the orders of the day.

609
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Please suspend the rules again.

610
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:55,288
[SPEAKER_14]: If somebody wants to suspend the rules again,

611
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,296
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only fair because Mr. Rumley was not appropriate and I have to straighten it out.

612
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:02,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

613
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:03,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

614
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:05,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe Villion, 59 Garfield Ave.

615
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:11,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Now at Somerville Cable, we are separate in Union Square and we have children come in and they pay $200 a week so we generate $2,000.

616
00:44:14,825 --> 00:44:21,928
[SPEAKER_11]: every 10 children that come in and the children are all around us producers and they do annoy us because we're trying to do radio and they're all yelling and screaming.

617
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:26,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I shut down Winchester High School four nights, four weeks in a row.

618
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,591
[SPEAKER_11]: No one had a Corey check and Mr. Rumley, all due respect, is incorrect.

619
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:32,072
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have direct

620
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:39,549
[SPEAKER_11]: contact with children unsupervised in a school, not in a public access center.

621
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:46,411
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are doors here, they should be locked, because in Winchester and in Wakefield, we have public access centers and there are no quarries.

622
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:51,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I talked to many TV stations, many, and one of the executive directors said to me, Joe,

623
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:53,113
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just absurd.

624
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:54,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is a stumbling block.

625
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,475
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a scary thing for people who want to do Access TV.

626
00:44:58,555 --> 00:45:00,016
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the antithesis of outreach.

627
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:12,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a separate facility on the high school ground, but Wakefield and Winchester and so many stations around the Duxbury, so many using the high school, do not ask for CORI checks.

628
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:13,962
[SPEAKER_11]: That is absolutely wrong.

629
00:45:14,343 --> 00:45:18,885
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be contested in a court of law, and I guarantee you I can win on that point.

630
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:24,370
[SPEAKER_11]: But the second point is the five-page producer agreement, not two-page producer agreement.

631
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Solicitor Romley.

632
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:30,096
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to have the libel statute in there, but you can have one page.

633
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:32,719
[SPEAKER_11]: One page from Hingham, one page from Malden.

634
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:34,160
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need five pages.

635
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And what the law department seems to have inserted into this, which I don't believe Ben Brown could have done, but allegedly, I'm not sure.

636
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:45,811
[SPEAKER_11]: you would have to hire a city attorney along with your own attorney.

637
00:45:46,391 --> 00:45:52,155
[SPEAKER_11]: And it goes on and on and on in a way that is the antithesis of outreach, the facilitation of programming.

638
00:45:52,535 --> 00:45:58,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I've been doing this since 1979, so I think I know more than the city solicitor on this aspect of it.

639
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been in access longer than anyone.

640
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:01,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been on the BBC.

641
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:01,862
[SPEAKER_11]: What a clarification, Mr. President.

642
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:02,962
[SPEAKER_13]: What a clarification, Councilor Knight.

643
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,264
[SPEAKER_13]: The gentleman's talking about a legal document.

644
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he proclaiming that he has more knowledge than the city solicitor about the law?

645
00:46:09,787 --> 00:46:10,807
[SPEAKER_11]: know about the document.

646
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:11,948
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a big difference, sir.

647
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:15,969
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, all you do is do point of interruption.

648
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of interruption.

649
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:19,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just trying to clarify, because it's getting a little off track.

650
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,810
[SPEAKER_11]: We're clarifying it.

651
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I know more about public access and signing those documents, I believe, than the city solicitor.

652
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,712
[SPEAKER_11]: A five-page document's unheard of in Access TV.

653
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:27,312
[SPEAKER_11]: What do I know?

654
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:30,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only been doing it about as long as you've been alive.

655
00:46:30,573 --> 00:46:36,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you had a little respect for your elders and listened instead of talked, you might learn something about Access TV.

656
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of personal reference, Mr. President.

657
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:40,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, respect the council.

658
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:41,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is why we have an agenda, Mr. President.

659
00:46:41,457 --> 00:46:43,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if he respects his elders, I can respect the councilor.

660
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:46,620
[SPEAKER_13]: The point of personal privilege is the councilor of this body, Mr. President.

661
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:47,961
[SPEAKER_13]: We have an agenda.

662
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:48,602
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

663
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:50,663
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we have an agenda, so things like this don't happen.

664
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I call for the orders of the day.

665
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:54,625
[SPEAKER_11]: What things like this is, is five pages is too much.

666
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:55,406
[SPEAKER_11]: One page.

667
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:59,248
[SPEAKER_11]: One page to express liability is very simple.

668
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:00,469
[SPEAKER_11]: One page.

669
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:01,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And then,

670
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:05,328
[SPEAKER_11]: The Cory check, out the window.

671
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:05,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's insane.

672
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:09,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes no sense on school grounds because no one else does it.

673
00:47:10,071 --> 00:47:16,014
[SPEAKER_11]: The city of Medford is always the city that is being ridiculed by other stations for censorship policies.

674
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:17,155
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pure censorship.

675
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:18,315
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

676
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:19,496
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's bad.

677
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:19,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

678
00:47:20,196 --> 00:47:20,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

679
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:25,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, as the city solicitor, I am not going to sit back and say,

680
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:36,448
[SPEAKER_02]: that censorship is ever part of the mission of the law department, of the city of Medford, of any of its officials, elected or otherwise.

681
00:47:36,668 --> 00:47:47,257
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not censoring anything, but what we're going to do is to make sure that our school children are going to be able to come to this building and that this is going to be a safe environment.

682
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,121
[SPEAKER_02]: A quarry check is not prohibited, it is required.

683
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:52,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

684
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:55,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, may I?

685
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:56,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

686
00:47:56,607 --> 00:48:01,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Roy Bellson, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.

687
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, members of the Council, I just want to clarify a couple of things.

688
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:11,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Chapter 74 is the Vocational Education Act that governs vocational education.

689
00:48:11,873 --> 00:48:13,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been around for a long time.

690
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:17,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Advisory committees have been part of Chapter 74 for a long time.

691
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:18,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not new.

692
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:30,069
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford School Committee knows about Chapter 74 advisory committees, and many of you have participated on it, including Councilor Penter at one time, and others have been on these advisory committees.

693
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:31,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an unknown thing.

694
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,192
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one error that was made.

695
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:36,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made without thinking it was an error.

696
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:44,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It was simply that advisory committees meet and they go over the program that they were interested in, the Multimedia Center for Students.

697
00:48:44,877 --> 00:48:51,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Their issue wasn't community access, their issue was the multimedia program for students, because it's required by Chapter 74.

698
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:56,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Chapter 74 put out a manual and they increased the idea that the open meeting law should apply.

699
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:07,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The director at that particular time didn't see that, didn't pay attention to it at that particular time, put it on the website for the school thing and didn't think it needed to be posted.

700
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:12,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically a public body is a body that deliberates and then can make a decision.

701
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:22,292
[SPEAKER_03]: as opposed to a public body or a body that simply advises an administrator who then advises a governing body like a school committee what to do.

702
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:23,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was an error.

703
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:24,794
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it was.

704
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:29,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't necessarily affect anything to deal with community access.

705
00:49:30,692 --> 00:49:33,533
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask the question, well, what does Ben Brown fit in this situation?

706
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:39,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Ben Brown, if he's going to manage this place, is going to interact with the teaching staff of the vocational school.

707
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:45,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So his name is going to come up, or his position will come up in that process.

708
00:49:46,076 --> 00:49:47,616
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no attempt to block anything.

709
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:55,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all recognize that this space is a good space, and we hope that it will be a terrific space for the community and a terrific space for the young people.

710
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:59,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good news is that we can share it, and we can do a lot of good things together.

711
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:07,123
[SPEAKER_03]: As to the CORI check, what's to prohibit a program that's being jointly produced by young people along with community members?

712
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:08,144
[SPEAKER_03]: What if they're together?

713
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: What if they do a program together?

714
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:12,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's highly desirable that our young people do that.

715
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:21,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they do that, then it would be good for them to know that the people who are going to be doing it in this space are people that we have checked out.

716
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:24,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I think safety is always on our minds.

717
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all agree on that.

718
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:26,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't hurt.

719
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:34,466
[SPEAKER_03]: If an individual feels that the Cori check has been unduly denied, they have the right to get it and appeal.

720
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:43,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, do you think that any of us would ever be able to stand up in front of you and say that a person who had an insurance violation is a reason for denying them the right to come in here?

721
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:53,468
[SPEAKER_03]: But if a person has been involved with molestation or the person been involved with assault and battery and a person been involved with destruction of property, maybe we should know that.

722
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:55,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should know that.

723
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:57,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think it's unreasonable.

724
00:50:57,952 --> 00:50:59,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that we should consider.

725
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:00,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's there.

726
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as far as Chapter 74 goes, despite what the individual has to say, it was totally different than the community media thing.

727
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really a part of us making sure that we're in compliance with the state.

728
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:13,837
[SPEAKER_03]: We can stay on the open meeting law.

729
00:51:14,377 --> 00:51:15,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't happen again.

730
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,859
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we've posted all the meetings going forward to the advisory committees.

731
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:21,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And every shop in the school has an advisory committee.

732
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Every shop.

733
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,761
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of you have participated.

734
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:31,704
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate that because it's important for the young people to get expertise, not only from Medford, but from practitioners around the commonwealth.

735
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate you listening.

736
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

737
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:35,186
16, 675.

738
00:51:35,866 --> 00:51:36,386
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may?

739
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:38,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lovell, go ahead.

740
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:47,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the chair, if we could get a copy of the, I'm not sure who has it, a copy of the decision stating there was an open meeting law violation.

741
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it more than a simple error and I definitely want to

742
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a read.

743
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:55,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to address that, surely we can give you a copy of that.

744
00:51:55,102 --> 00:51:58,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd also say this, and I know this is beleaguered a little bit.

745
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: When the allegation of the open meeting law violation came up from the petitioner back in June, there was a response made by the school department almost immediately in which all of the documents of this committee were given.

746
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:14,857
[SPEAKER_02]: About 280 pages were given to the petitioner.

747
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:27,365
[SPEAKER_02]: He continued to allege the violation of the open meeting law and when the city responded, when the city responded in the very beginning of July, we said it was a violation of the open meeting law to the petitioner.

748
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:32,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Attorney General, months later, said, yes, it is a violation.

749
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:33,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never hid that.

750
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:36,592
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the school calendar, but it was not posted.

751
00:52:37,173 --> 00:52:43,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So the immediate response by the law department when this allegation was made was that, yes, it should have been posted, and it wasn't.

752
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: The Attorney General said, yes.

753
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have been posted, and it wasn't.

754
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:49,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So next time, post it.

755
00:52:49,884 --> 00:52:51,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have all of that documented.

756
00:52:51,485 --> 00:52:54,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And through the chair, Solicitor Rumley, whose fault was that?

757
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:56,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it you blaming the board?

758
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what official in the school department is responsible for the posting.

759
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:03,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the school calendar from the beginning of the year.

760
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:09,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And also keep this in mind, that the Chapter 74 committee is required to meet twice a year.

761
00:53:10,163 --> 00:53:12,044
[SPEAKER_02]: once before the holidays, once after.

762
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:13,285
[SPEAKER_02]: They did meet twice.

763
00:53:13,345 --> 00:53:19,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the school calendar, but not posted the way you would post an open meeting notice.

764
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:24,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure who in the school department is responsible to do that, but it was not done.

765
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:29,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we made our response to the petitioner, we said it wasn't done and it should have.

766
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:34,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So it isn't something where there was this clandestine effort to hide anything.

767
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:36,937
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, the response was an admission.

768
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:38,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was made months ago.

769
00:53:39,419 --> 00:53:48,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So the notion that there was some type of James Bondish effort here to hide up some vocational committee is absolutely nonsense.

770
00:53:48,368 --> 00:53:48,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

771
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:51,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't just my last question.

772
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't City Hall's doing.

773
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:54,274
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the school department.

774
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:55,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the school department, yes.

775
00:53:56,496 --> 00:53:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

776
00:53:57,477 --> 00:53:58,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Romley?

777
00:53:58,198 --> 00:53:58,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

778
00:54:02,428 --> 00:54:15,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to put you on the spot, but several weeks ago when this issue was brought up, I asked the superintendent at the time whether or not this would also apply to outside entities that rent this particular building.

779
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:16,166
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean quarry checks?

780
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:29,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct and the reason why I asked is because as we all know safety of our students is the utmost important and I agree What you laid out tonight was the fact that there may be an overlap in time.

781
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:35,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and the fact that it's in this building Would lead you to believe that chat was a chapter 74.

782
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:35,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I

783
00:54:36,440 --> 00:55:02,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Chapter 71 on the quarry chapter 71 would apply my question and I didn't expect the superintendent to answer but I expected a different answer out of the superintendent is is this something we also have to look at if we have an entity that rents this building just say on a Saturday and Students are up here on a Saturday and there may be some type of interaction whether it's in a restroom or walking by someone in a hallway With the same apply to that.

784
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:04,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Mr. Solicitor.

785
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:04,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I

786
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very interesting question.

787
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets into a gray area.

788
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you an example.

789
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I am quarried in another capacity in my life.

790
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:17,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I am quarried every single year as a requirement of my vocation.

791
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,861
[SPEAKER_02]: However, and that's part of the church.

792
00:55:20,622 --> 00:55:24,206
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in that, people that go to church every week are not quarried.

793
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:30,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But because I'm a deacon, there's a possibility that I might have unmonitored direct contact with children.

794
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:33,075
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, it's probable, given the role of a deacon.

795
00:55:33,515 --> 00:55:43,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, using that analogy here at the school, with renters, the time when they would be renting, if it's like a Saturday or Sunday, I think that would come into play.

796
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:51,309
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that the overlap comes in, that comes into play with this room is the fact that that would happen during the day or at the end of the school day.

797
00:55:51,889 --> 00:56:07,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I would defer to the judgment of the superintendent, of course, but I would say that if there is a higher likelihood of direct unmonitored contact with students in this building, and that's who we have jurisdiction over, then they should be quarry checked.

798
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:11,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have contractors quarry checked, bus drivers quarry checked,

799
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:17,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody you could imagine, people who would do the grounds if they were doing them under contract would be quarry checked.

800
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:29,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not the superintendent, I can't answer that for him, but I would say the higher the likelihood of the unmonitored in direct contact with a child, yes, they should be quarry checked.

801
00:56:30,882 --> 00:56:33,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So how can we gauge the likelihood of interaction?

802
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:35,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's the question.

803
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:36,948
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we know?

804
00:56:36,968 --> 00:56:53,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you from firsthand experience that a particular entity that's been renting this community has been here consistently for probably over 20 years in the same location, in the same building, with probably the same interaction, so this is not a one-off

805
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:55,563
[SPEAKER_04]: that you'd say, well, they're coming into the building once.

806
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it warrants at least some investigation.

807
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:12,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope that it would be from your law office or your law department and not the superintendent of schools, because the feedback I've received from the superintendent is kind of, there's no concern.

808
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:18,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it needs to be looked into a little further by the law office.

809
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:26,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always be available to the superintendent or to any other municipal or school official to assist them in their positions.

810
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:41,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask if then you can get together with the superintendent and have a discussion over this because as we've all stated and it's not just lip service from when I stated about security in this building or the lack of security in this building after hours.

811
00:57:42,561 --> 00:57:49,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And following up with this particular issue, it's all in the same breath as to say we have to look out for the interest of our children.

812
00:57:50,728 --> 00:58:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are people in this building that I'm corey-checked, I believe they, as we said with this particular media room, this should be reviewed, Mr. Solicitor.

813
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:05,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also feel this before I yield to, I guess, the superintendent.

814
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:10,477
[SPEAKER_02]: The key is direct, unmonitored contact.

815
00:58:11,097 --> 00:58:15,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's a possibility, it's very – it's not very prohibitive to have a Cori checked on.

816
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:16,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done very quickly.

817
00:58:16,979 --> 00:58:20,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not – and it's not a very intrusive process.

818
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

819
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:26,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It all – that level of – that level of protection, especially for children.

820
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:28,452
[SPEAKER_02]: especially for children.

821
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:35,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can be of assistance to the superintendent and I would never give that lip service then I would have.

822
00:58:35,499 --> 00:58:37,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean lip service for you.

823
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:41,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant in the past when we were talking about security and safety of our students.

824
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:43,427
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just lip service.

825
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:45,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that I really believe in.

826
00:58:46,430 --> 00:59:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And having three children go through the public schools and knowing what took place today at the Columbus School with someone wielding a knife in a lockdown, it brings it that closer to us and people that are concerned about this issue.

827
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:02,974
[SPEAKER_02]: A very relevant example.

828
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:03,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

829
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I may, just for a minute.

830
00:59:06,634 --> 00:59:08,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have football games at Hormel Stadium.

831
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:13,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone comes through the gate, should be quarry checked, because they might sit next to a student.

832
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Superintendent, that's not clouding the issue.

833
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:17,361
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not clouding the issue.

834
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:18,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's talking about Hormel Stadium?

835
00:59:18,742 --> 00:59:20,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Hormel Stadium is a site.

836
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:23,124
[SPEAKER_04]: The building you're standing in right now, Mr. Superintendent.

837
00:59:23,264 --> 00:59:24,925
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's talking about Hormel Stadium.

838
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:27,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Hormel Stadium is the site of student activities.

839
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: We have football kids there, we have cheerleaders there, we have other people there.

840
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:37,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Public access, public areas are not subject to the quarry.

841
00:59:37,913 --> 00:59:42,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's direct, these key words, direct, unsupervised.

842
00:59:43,216 --> 00:59:49,440
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm working with you, if I'm in the area where I'm working directly with you, that's direct and unsupervised.

843
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Indirect is not the issue.

844
00:59:52,261 --> 00:59:54,203
[SPEAKER_03]: People in areas, you could be anywhere.

845
00:59:55,204 --> 00:59:58,730
[SPEAKER_03]: and have people who are near students and the like, or near young people.

846
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:04,560
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the way the Corey statue has been interpreted and has been applied across the commonwealth.

847
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:08,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we could check everybody out everywhere they go.

848
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to the statehouse, you have to empty your pockets, you have to take off your belt, and you check everything like that.

849
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep going and going and going.

850
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:20,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But at some point in time, the terms are direct and unsupervised.

851
01:00:21,365 --> 01:00:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, every public gathering, whether young people and families, would require everyone to be quarry checked.

852
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:28,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same thing.

853
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:34,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the way it's been interpreted across the Commonwealth, and I'm sure there are plenty of people that would comment on it.

854
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

855
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, just if I could.

856
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:38,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Mox.

857
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:45,813
[SPEAKER_04]: The superintendent is excellent at circumlocution when it comes to diverting what the issue is.

858
01:00:45,853 --> 01:00:46,253
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that word?

859
01:00:46,553 --> 01:00:47,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll teach you after.

860
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:58,616
[SPEAKER_04]: What the issue is, Mr. President, and clearly the issue is not outside of this building because we're not talking about outside this building.

861
01:00:58,636 --> 01:01:01,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about a media room inside of the high school.

862
01:01:02,457 --> 01:01:27,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mentioned is if you have an outside group, and when I say outside, I mean from outside the city, that rents this particular facility, Mr. President, on a weekly basis for the past, every Saturday for the past 20 years, and they are coming into contact with our students up here, Mr. President, I think it warrants a discussion.

863
01:01:28,072 --> 01:01:31,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so I'm not cloudy on the issue.

864
01:01:31,374 --> 01:01:38,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what the issue is, and it's not going outside of this building, checking out every little venue that we have to make sure people are quarry checked.

865
01:01:39,638 --> 01:01:40,958
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just to cloud the issue.

866
01:01:41,278 --> 01:01:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue is whether or not we're providing adequate security up at this high school and whether or not we're making sure that when our students are within this building, Mr. President,

867
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:54,384
[SPEAKER_04]: They come in contact with people they should come in contact with.

868
01:01:54,985 --> 01:02:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the superintendent alluded to a couple weeks ago, he made it sound like a Corey check could be done within 24 hours.

869
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:14,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the city solicitor mentioned, that's not a large undertaking to ask an entity that's coming into our building, using our classrooms, using our cafeterias, using our

870
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:27,401
[SPEAKER_04]: gymnasium to ask them to be subjected to the same requirements that someone from the city of Medford would come up here and want to put a show on local access.

871
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:35,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a hardship, Mr. President, and I think in the interest of safety for our students, I think it warrants it, Mr. President.

872
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:42,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a little troubled when I address these particular issues with the superintendent, how he tries to dismiss them, Mr. President.

873
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:46,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And I honestly, I think this issue needs to be addressed.

874
01:02:46,936 --> 01:02:49,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope that he could sit down with the city solicitor.

875
01:02:49,698 --> 01:02:52,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be more than happy to attend if we want to have a meeting.

876
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,701
[SPEAKER_04]: But this issue needs to be ironed out.

877
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I heard from the city solicitor, as he mentioned, this is a gray issue.

878
01:02:59,585 --> 01:03:04,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it deserves at least discussion, Mr. President.

879
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:05,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

880
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:08,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Very quickly... Name and address of the record, please.

881
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:10,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe Villion, 59 Garfield Ave.

882
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:17,562
[SPEAKER_11]: When the three people talked to me outside, they called it a public access board, which is why I was so investigative on it.

883
01:03:17,882 --> 01:03:22,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when I got the documents that the city solicitor referenced, it said radio television board.

884
01:03:23,088 --> 01:03:26,272
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the Attorney General's office that, and Mark Rumley,

885
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:29,674
[SPEAKER_11]: who told me through Belson it was a chapter 74.

886
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:33,977
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is what the attendees called it, a public access board.

887
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:37,319
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what the document said, radio and television board.

888
01:03:37,759 --> 01:03:45,044
[SPEAKER_11]: So it got me very concerned that the city council and the school committee didn't know about it, and in conclusion,

889
01:03:46,578 --> 01:03:57,482
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just it's it is a lot of gobbledygook These are these are professionals when mayor Burke and other people including the council president had to respond about the compliance with the Open meeting law.

890
01:03:57,862 --> 01:04:13,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe their documents were filed Mr. Carey element have filed it on time, but the certification paper I believe was filed late and I found that with Paulette van de Kloot Stephanie Burke didn't even do her online training her online training was

891
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:18,031
[SPEAKER_11]: for the ethics until I filed an open public records request.

892
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:22,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So this whole thing of that, it was just an honest mistake.

893
01:04:23,095 --> 01:04:24,435
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been in business far too long.

894
01:04:24,896 --> 01:04:26,097
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't an honest mistake.

895
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:27,257
[SPEAKER_11]: It was deliberate.

896
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:27,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

897
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,939
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may move the question.

898
01:04:29,959 --> 01:04:33,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Move the question to get a copy of the attorney general's decision.

899
01:04:33,722 --> 01:04:39,706
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Council Member O'Karen to get a copy of the complaint from Solicitor Romney.

900
01:04:41,273 --> 01:04:42,934
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

901
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:43,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

902
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:44,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

903
01:04:46,294 --> 01:04:47,075
[SPEAKER_01]: May I comment?

904
01:04:47,695 --> 01:04:48,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless.

905
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:52,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have very little comment.

906
01:04:52,696 --> 01:05:08,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say it's a sad state of affairs that TV 3 has been off the air for approximately four years and also it would be nice if it was housed instead of here in a central location.

907
01:05:11,088 --> 01:05:23,794
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, in my opinion, the demise of Medford Square back in 1970 is when they closed Medford High School in Forest Street and opened up this high school.

908
01:05:24,774 --> 01:05:25,795
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about TB3.

909
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:27,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

910
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:28,696
[SPEAKER_01]: In TB3.

911
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:32,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put the high school here in the West Medford Woods.

912
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:36,734
[SPEAKER_01]: which in effect was the kiss of death in Medford Square.

913
01:05:37,035 --> 01:05:39,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the middle of Glen Mall was finally in the coffin.

914
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:45,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And coincidentally, ironically, they went bankrupt, except for Wegmans, bail them out.

915
01:05:45,381 --> 01:05:50,105
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, we're repeating, we're not learning from history, in my opinion.

916
01:05:50,665 --> 01:05:52,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We're repeating the same mistakes.

917
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:54,528
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not putting it in a central location.

918
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:56,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you understand my point.

919
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

920
01:05:59,438 --> 01:06:01,963
[SPEAKER_14]: 16, 17, 765, offered by Councilor Lockern.

921
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:07,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved, the building departments update the Medford City Council with regards to the Rock Pile and Winter Street.

922
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:08,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lockern.

923
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:10,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, President Caraviello.

924
01:06:11,037 --> 01:06:12,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I received a few complaints.

925
01:06:12,398 --> 01:06:21,884
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the neighborhood around this area has been talking about the rock pile that sits across from the gas station on Winthrop Street.

926
01:06:22,284 --> 01:06:28,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've received two emails from abutters questioning what is going on at the site.

927
01:06:28,808 --> 01:06:34,012
[SPEAKER_08]: They started work, I believe, started bulldozing, drilling, and blasting on the site.

928
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:35,372
[SPEAKER_08]: September 2016.

929
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:42,714
[SPEAKER_08]: This past August in 2017, work has ceased and now nothing's going on.

930
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:49,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The neighbors also have a very reasonable concern about the attractiveness of this site to a child.

931
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:52,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a large rock pile, large hole.

932
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:57,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Children could get hurt and there's really nothing blocking it off.

933
01:06:57,297 --> 01:07:00,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could get a written response from the building department of

934
01:07:01,978 --> 01:07:20,532
[SPEAKER_08]: what is going on on that site, what is planned to go on on that site, when will it happen, and in the meantime, if we can somehow, it's an eyesore at this point, but somehow, as best we can, block it off so people do not, especially children, do not go near the site.

935
01:07:20,552 --> 01:07:22,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's extremely important.

936
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:28,218
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that the neighbors asked me to put on the agenda and see if we can get some answers and a resolve on.

937
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:30,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Del Rosa.

938
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I just like the wording of it being called a rock pile.

939
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:41,091
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds punitive in nature and it's certainly been punitive towards the neighbors in that area.

940
01:07:42,129 --> 01:07:42,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

941
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,671
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Laura Kern, seconded by Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

942
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,012
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

943
01:07:47,132 --> 01:07:47,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

944
01:07:48,013 --> 01:07:49,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

945
01:07:49,494 --> 01:08:03,564
[SPEAKER_14]: 17-676 offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the meeting of the City Council on Tuesday, November 7, 2017 be canceled due to the municipal election that will take place on that same day.

946
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:04,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

947
01:08:04,344 --> 01:08:05,505
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may before the roll call.

948
01:08:06,846 --> 01:08:07,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you President Mayako.

949
01:08:07,986 --> 01:08:09,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We obviously have to cancel this.

950
01:08:10,428 --> 01:08:11,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, geez.

951
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:12,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

952
01:08:12,149 --> 01:08:14,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Thinking about you, Bob.

953
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, Tuesday, November 7th is the election.

954
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,072
[SPEAKER_06]: The week prior is October 31st.

955
01:08:18,212 --> 01:08:18,893
It's Halloween.

956
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I shot an email to everybody, and we heard little tweet birds because nobody responded.

957
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand it's an important meeting.

958
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:44,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Tuesday night before the election, but I just wanted to start a discussion.

959
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:46,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I promised my seven-year-old I would ask.

960
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,471
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my children's favorite holiday.

961
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,212
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Halloween.

962
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:56,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's possible, if anybody would be agreeable to move the meeting to the Monday prior, which would be Monday, October 30th.

963
01:08:57,257 --> 01:09:02,860
[SPEAKER_08]: and even potentially have a second screening on October 31st for those who plan on watching.

964
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something I want to throw out there.

965
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I obviously will be here if we're going to have a meeting.

966
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:10,024
[SPEAKER_08]: But October 31st, I have three young children.

967
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:15,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some others have children as well, maybe a little older, maybe a little younger.

968
01:09:15,387 --> 01:09:18,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just think it's something to discuss.

969
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:19,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, is that a?

970
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

971
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:23,852
[SPEAKER_05]: What location?

972
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:24,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday.

973
01:09:30,836 --> 01:09:47,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's why I'm asking now so maybe we can look into it and people can think about it I don't want to pressure anybody I know it's I don't want to pressure anybody but we can look into it and maybe I think the city clerk might have some work to do leading up to these elections too if I'm not mistaken

974
01:09:53,546 --> 01:09:57,768
[SPEAKER_14]: If the clerk could take a look at that and have a report for next week.

975
01:09:58,669 --> 01:10:03,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll reach out to see if the school committee has a meeting and maybe that would be a potential resolve.

976
01:10:03,611 --> 01:10:04,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

977
01:10:04,192 --> 01:10:04,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

978
01:10:05,872 --> 01:10:07,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Move approval on your paper.

979
01:10:08,314 --> 01:10:10,575
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion is seconded by Councilor Falco.

980
01:10:10,595 --> 01:10:11,515
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

981
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:11,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

982
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:12,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

983
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:31,521
[SPEAKER_14]: 17677, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Ed O'Neill, Medford' Chief Assessor, for the past 14 and a half years, and thank him for his dedicated service to the community, and wish him well on his new assignment as the Assessor of the Town of Bonneville.

984
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:32,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

985
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:35,044
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by- Mr. President, if I may.

986
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:36,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

987
01:10:37,592 --> 01:10:42,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to thank Ed O'Neill publicly for the work that he's done for the city of Medford and for me personally.

988
01:10:42,115 --> 01:10:47,097
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a great guy to give a call and ask some questions to, and he always gives you answers.

989
01:10:47,157 --> 01:10:52,080
[SPEAKER_13]: He's always been readily accessible and sometimes referred to as the smartest man in city hall.

990
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,342
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think we're going to fill a void.

991
01:10:55,382 --> 01:10:59,244
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to be greatly missed, and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavor.

992
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:03,846
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to thank him for his friendship, his help, and being a mentor to me during my early years on the council.

993
01:11:04,086 --> 01:11:12,890
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a good man, and it's gonna be a big loss to this community, and I hope that the person who replaces him is equal to his talents.

994
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,611
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, through the- Councilwoman O'Brien.

995
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:16,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to second that.

996
01:11:16,732 --> 01:11:18,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Ed's done a great job.

997
01:11:18,512 --> 01:11:22,694
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been here quite a while, and definitely very knowledgeable.

998
01:11:23,715 --> 01:11:27,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish him good luck in his retirement or new job.

999
01:11:27,636 --> 01:11:29,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate all the work he's done.

1000
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:31,018
[SPEAKER_08]: If we also could maybe get an update,

1001
01:11:31,623 --> 01:11:34,926
[SPEAKER_08]: on a B paper with regards to when the job will be posted.

1002
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:35,646
[SPEAKER_08]: It is posted.

1003
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:36,427
[SPEAKER_08]: It's posted, okay.

1004
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know two people in the office left over the summer.

1005
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:44,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Ed left kind of short notice recently and that concerns the entire council, I'm sure.

1006
01:11:45,854 --> 01:11:48,416
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by President Calvillo, seconded by Councilor Dela Luzo.

1007
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:49,056
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1008
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:49,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1009
01:11:49,656 --> 01:11:50,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1010
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:53,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Papers in the hands of the clerk.

1011
01:11:53,728 --> 01:11:53,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1012
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:55,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Langley-Curran.

1013
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,350
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1014
01:11:56,891 --> 01:11:57,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1015
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:03,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Eversource project be discussed.

1016
01:12:03,716 --> 01:12:04,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

1017
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:06,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1018
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:20,909
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the fourth time I've offered this resolution, or something similar, to alert residents of this community about the project that Eversource is going to be moving forward with.

1019
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:28,654
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to be a large undertaking and quite a disruption on our thoroughfares and our community.

1020
01:12:29,815 --> 01:12:39,622
[SPEAKER_04]: If people aren't familiar, there is a project that's underway, that's in the process, that is going to be the Mystic-Wubin line project.

1021
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:48,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And the proposed underground transmission line, which is an electrical line, will connect the Mystic substation in Everett to the Wubin substation.

1022
01:12:49,888 --> 01:12:56,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I understand, it's not going to have any benefit to our community.

1023
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:58,671
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's going to be a major disruption.

1024
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:08,795
[SPEAKER_04]: The line will extend approximately eight miles between the two substations, passing through Everett, Boston, Somerville, Medford, Winchester, and Woburn.

1025
01:13:09,995 --> 01:13:16,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The proposed project also includes improvements within the existing fence line of the Mystic and Woburn substations.

1026
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Eversource has made a commitment to elicit feedback from neighbors, public officials, and stakeholders.

1027
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:38,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And to date, we had one public hearing that this council called for, where representatives from Eversource came forward.

1028
01:13:38,776 --> 01:13:43,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, this was probably a year and a half, two years ago, when we found out about the project.

1029
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have not heard anything

1030
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,365
[SPEAKER_04]: other than what we've inquired about, Mr. President.

1031
01:13:52,025 --> 01:14:03,132
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go on to the leaflet I got from Eversource, it also mentions the projected schedule, and it said start of construction first quarter 2017.

1032
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:11,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a mathematician, but I would think we're past the first quarter in 2017.

1033
01:14:12,283 --> 01:14:17,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, Mr. President, we need to get some answers on this project.

1034
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:23,795
[SPEAKER_04]: This project will stretch from the Winchester line on Winthrop Street in Method

1035
01:14:24,595 --> 01:14:25,875
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way down Winthrop Street.

1036
01:14:26,376 --> 01:14:28,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll take a left onto Salt Street.

1037
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:38,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll go down a portion of Main Street in front of the police station, and then hang a left onto Mystic Ave and follow Mystic Ave all the way down.

1038
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:50,882
[SPEAKER_04]: This project also includes manhole installations, trench evacuation, and pipe installation, cable pulling, and pipe fluid filling.

1039
01:14:53,080 --> 01:15:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, the manhole structures deteriorate due to constant traffic resulting in increased noise and vibration to the area.

1040
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:17,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Manhole installation of 19 precast concrete vaults located underground will be, in addition to the trenching they're gonna be doing, and each underground vault is gonna be eight feet wide by 22 feet long.

1041
01:15:19,455 --> 01:15:34,428
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 feet high and it's going to take roughly 7 to 10 days to install and then the trenching will be 100 to 200 feet per day followed by 10 to 18 days of construction.

1042
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:46,394
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very lengthy project where residents that abut Winthrop Street, Salt Street, Mystic Ave, may not have access to their driveway for a period of time.

1043
01:15:46,934 --> 01:15:53,557
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been no communication from what I can see other than what this council is trying to pull out of Eversource.

1044
01:15:54,237 --> 01:16:01,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Eversource also mentioned that they were going to do a briefing and presentations, email updates.

1045
01:16:02,181 --> 01:16:03,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone on this council get email updates?

1046
01:16:04,582 --> 01:16:07,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're not getting them, you can assure the general public's not getting them.

1047
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:09,506
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to put out door hangers.

1048
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:11,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen any door hangers.

1049
01:16:11,588 --> 01:16:21,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize construction hasn't started, but the time to do this public outreach is not when construction starts, it's prior to construction.

1050
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:33,285
[SPEAKER_04]: They also mentioned that they were going to do direct monitoring to homes along the route, and I have yet to hear anything about that, Mr. President.

1051
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:46,340
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to the disruption that's going to take place on all our streets because of additional traffic They're gonna have to reroute traffic and so forth There's also been discussion about mitigation

1052
01:16:47,478 --> 01:17:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And with any large project, like we saw with the FAST 14 project, when they did the largest building bridge reconstruction in the state's history, there was mitigation done by the contractor with the city of Medford.

1053
01:17:04,384 --> 01:17:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I have yet to hear about any mitigation.

1054
01:17:07,505 --> 01:17:34,791
[SPEAKER_04]: How we are going to assist residents of this community and those discussions need to take place and they need to be open and transparent and Residents should have input whether it's power washing a house that may have these vaults You know in front of their homes that are going to be constructed whether it's the trenching that's going on that may have an impact on someone's driveway Whether it's the hours of operation when the project takes place

1055
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this is being discussed at all.

1056
01:17:37,572 --> 01:17:39,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a huge project, Mr. President.

1057
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:50,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I get phone calls, reverse 911 calls on a daily basis telling me about the migration of pigeons or something that I don't need to know about.

1058
01:17:51,381 --> 01:18:01,447
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't get a call on a project that's going to cut through our city, 2.3 miles of excavation through our city of drenching.

1059
01:18:03,235 --> 01:18:10,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a whole other issue I brought up, Mr. President, about when they put these particular wires underground.

1060
01:18:11,905 --> 01:18:17,667
[SPEAKER_04]: They emit transmission, radio emission, not radio, transmission from them.

1061
01:18:18,387 --> 01:18:25,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been studies done about long and prolonged contact for infants and young children.

1062
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,891
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the things that have to be discussed and looked at.

1063
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:32,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure why we're not discussing this with the president.

1064
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,653
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't come before us for a public meeting yet, public hearing yet.

1065
01:18:35,098 --> 01:18:36,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they did come before.

1066
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:38,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I requested a public hearing, which they did come before.

1067
01:18:39,121 --> 01:18:40,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was just with the council.

1068
01:18:40,862 --> 01:18:46,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have an open and notorious process with the general public that can come up and ask questions.

1069
01:18:46,386 --> 01:18:48,828
[SPEAKER_04]: How is this going to impact their routine?

1070
01:18:49,268 --> 01:18:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there going to be a disruption in their electrical service?

1071
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:56,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there going to be a disruption in getting out of their driveway to work or driving their kids to school?

1072
01:18:56,353 --> 01:18:57,474
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a million issues.

1073
01:18:57,934 --> 01:19:01,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is going to be the platforming where they put their construction equipment?

1074
01:19:02,077 --> 01:19:09,103
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to set up shop in the city of Medford for 2.3 miles, they're going to want construction areas where they can put their equipment.

1075
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:13,246
[SPEAKER_04]: As we heard tonight on Wildwood and Winthrop Street.

1076
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:14,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, Councilor Markswell.

1077
01:19:14,347 --> 01:19:15,708
[SPEAKER_14]: You can leave that door open, please.

1078
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:27,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, so these are the issues that we've already been confronted with regarding smaller projects, and you can imagine what's going to take place with the larger projects.

1079
01:19:28,475 --> 01:19:31,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've gone through this with utility companies.

1080
01:19:32,357 --> 01:19:36,940
[SPEAKER_04]: When they do trenching, they feel that they don't have to do a curb-to-curb restoration.

1081
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:42,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as part of the mitigation, is all the streets that are impacted going to be curb-to-curb?

1082
01:19:43,343 --> 01:19:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to get new handicap-accessible sidewalks?

1083
01:19:46,444 --> 01:19:47,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to get new sidewalks?

1084
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:50,466
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the things we have to discuss, Mr. President.

1085
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:58,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, on Winthrop Street alone, we've all fielded the phone calls regarding these slopes and peaks and valleys in Winthrop Street.

1086
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:03,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So when cars go up and down, as we hear, it creates noise for the residents on Winthrop.

1087
01:20:04,413 --> 01:20:07,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Will we be able to mitigate that when this construction's over?

1088
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:17,861
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have a serious conversation with the city engineer, the mayor's office, DPW, Eversource, and really start discussing this, Mr. President.

1089
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:26,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would offer that in a form of a resolution, knowing that their own literature is saying construction is going to start the first quarter of 2017.

1090
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:33,330
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to get ahead of the curve and start discussing these issues on behalf of our residents, Mr. President.

1091
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:44,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you could send a letter to Eversource requesting a meeting so we could have a possible council of the whole meeting with Eversource and a public meeting.

1092
01:20:44,354 --> 01:20:56,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to let you know, the Eversource petition for grants of location had been submitted almost about a month ago.

1093
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's currently in the hands of the

1094
01:21:06,933 --> 01:21:18,098
[SPEAKER_05]: submits it back to me, that'd be placed on the agenda for a public hearing, which should be probably, I would think, three to four weeks.

1095
01:21:18,918 --> 01:21:19,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1096
01:21:19,978 --> 01:21:21,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate all that.

1097
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:26,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do we tell residents that are calling us up anticipating the work being done?

1098
01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:27,461
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a question for you.

1099
01:21:28,002 --> 01:21:35,745
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mr. President, what do we tell residents that are calling us up as their elected officials saying, you must be in the know, you must know what's happening,

1100
01:21:36,265 --> 01:21:37,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have to tell you, you know what?

1101
01:21:37,886 --> 01:21:39,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We know as much as you do.

1102
01:21:39,486 --> 01:21:40,967
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been trying to get answers on this.

1103
01:21:41,387 --> 01:21:53,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, this administration has failed to present any type of cohesive meeting on this so we can get some answers and let the residents know what's going to take place.

1104
01:21:54,512 --> 01:21:56,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my intent tonight, Mr. President.

1105
01:21:56,993 --> 01:22:02,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you could contact Eversource, if we can set up a meeting before they come before us.

1106
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:06,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1107
01:22:06,276 --> 01:22:08,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Carolyn Jones, 32 Arlington Street.

1108
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:23,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering, is it possible that they can just come in and make this deal without the residents of Medford knowing that it's going to take place?

1109
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:24,329
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1110
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,631
[SPEAKER_09]: It sort of splits Medford up.

1111
01:22:27,392 --> 01:22:31,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's traffic enough at rush hour and at other times during the day,

1112
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:49,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And very often I have to get on 93, but if they're going to have the streets all dug up, how do I get there without going past Tufts and- There will be a public meeting at some point to discuss that.

1113
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:57,222
[SPEAKER_14]: At the moment we don't have a date, but they do come before us before they start any project.

1114
01:22:57,878 --> 01:23:04,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just want to be sure that there's no deal that's been made before the citizens know that a deal's been made.

1115
01:23:04,642 --> 01:23:05,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Or that it even exists.

1116
01:23:05,842 --> 01:23:09,244
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be a public hearing which you'll be able to attend.

1117
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:10,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1118
01:23:10,304 --> 01:23:10,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1119
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:12,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1120
01:23:13,486 --> 01:23:24,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the city engineer, before granting the petition for a right of way, or before resubmitting it to the city clerk, that you take several steps and collect certain information.

1121
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:29,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's going to be very important that we have this information in our hands when it comes down to make a decision.

1122
01:23:30,576 --> 01:23:33,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of it, it would piggyback on what Councilor Mark said.

1123
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, a residential mitigation plan's important.

1124
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:36,560
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's something that we need.

1125
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:44,845
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that the city clerk needs to provide, I mean the city engineer needs to provide that with us before she submits back to us the special application for a permit for the grant right away.

1126
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:49,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Mr. President, I think we need to have a comprehensive review of the traffic management plan.

1127
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,868
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to identify critical path items.

1128
01:23:51,888 --> 01:23:55,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we're thinking about this project, it's going to come right past this high school, right past this high school.

1129
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:56,789
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to go right in front of our police station.

1130
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:57,910
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

1131
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:01,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Our police and fire headquarters, we're going to have construction in front of them for an extended period of time.

1132
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:11,715
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when the construction's over, they're going to tell us they're going to come back in a year, and they're going to retrench and repave to bring it back to city of Medford standards, which we haven't seen happen from these public utility companies.

1133
01:24:12,275 --> 01:24:15,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, Mr. President, I think we need a clear and concise schedule with dates.

1134
01:24:16,077 --> 01:24:19,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Dates of when shuttles are going to be in the ground, dates when we can anticipate that this work's going to take place.

1135
01:24:20,118 --> 01:24:22,861
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think Councilor Marks put together a great resolution on this issue.

1136
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:31,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to amend the paper and ask that the City Clerk express to the City Engineer that we need, number one, a clear and concise plan and schedule with dates.

1137
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:36,895
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to identify the critical path items that are going to affect the operation of day-to-day government.

1138
01:24:38,677 --> 01:24:41,220
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a traffic management plan that needs to be reviewed.

1139
01:24:42,497 --> 01:24:44,838
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also need a residential mitigation plan, Mr. President.

1140
01:24:44,858 --> 01:24:56,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I think those are four key items that would make a big difference in helping move this project along, helping inform residents in the community what's going on, and helping us maintain a strong quality of life while it's going on.

1141
01:24:57,126 --> 01:25:03,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, when you think about where the project's going, Winthrop Street, the residents on Winthrop Street dealt with two years of a drainage project.

1142
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:13,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Then the day the drainage project was over, we got a letter from MassDOT saying that they were going to do 135, not even 130 feet of bridge, and it was going to take three years down to Medford Square.

1143
01:25:13,553 --> 01:25:18,774
[SPEAKER_13]: And the traffic management plan was to revert all the traffic right back up Winthrop Street on the new street that just got fixed.

1144
01:25:19,694 --> 01:25:25,716
[SPEAKER_13]: And now, when that project's over, we're going to see Eversource come in, and they're going to put their shovels in the ground, and they're going to tear that road up again, Mr. President.

1145
01:25:25,736 --> 01:25:28,237
[SPEAKER_13]: The residents in that area and that neighborhood have faced a lot.

1146
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:31,678
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not something that's happened for two years or three years or four years.

1147
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:32,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're looking on a half a decade.

1148
01:25:34,057 --> 01:25:44,324
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd ask that these matters be added to the paper as a B paper as an amendment, Mr. President, sent to the city engineer and forwarded to us prior to her submitting the application for the permit for the grants right away.

1149
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1150
01:25:45,511 --> 01:25:47,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1151
01:25:47,132 --> 01:25:52,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna thank Councilor Marks, and I agree with him wholeheartedly, and I also agree with Councilor Knight.

1152
01:25:52,675 --> 01:25:56,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I just see if we could amend this as well to include the city solicitor.

1153
01:25:57,658 --> 01:26:12,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Residents on South Street have been advocating for, obviously, reduced speed, reduced heavy trucking and speed, and they have a number of concerns and a whole checklist of things that they want done on South Street, and that will be the case for every street that Eversource is gonna dig up.

1154
01:26:12,988 --> 01:26:20,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we looked into it, we found out through the mayor's office that the city solicitor will be negotiating the contract with Evisource.

1155
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:27,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think he needs to be involved and I think the residents need to be involved as well before the contract is finalized.

1156
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:34,875
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no better person than a resident who lives on a road that can tell you what should be in that contract as far as

1157
01:26:36,153 --> 01:26:42,135
[SPEAKER_08]: before it's dug up, while it's being dug up, and what needs to be done when it's going to be permanently reinstalled.

1158
01:26:42,555 --> 01:26:44,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm glad this is put forth.

1159
01:26:44,956 --> 01:26:49,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to add that the solicitor be involved in this meeting that is going to hopefully take place.

1160
01:26:49,978 --> 01:26:51,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with Councilor Marks.

1161
01:26:51,358 --> 01:26:53,779
[SPEAKER_08]: People come to us all the time asking for answers.

1162
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,931
[SPEAKER_08]: When we can't give them, it's just a sad day.

1163
01:26:56,951 --> 01:27:01,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should be more informed, and Eversource should be on the forefront.

1164
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:12,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And this city administration should be in the forefront of educating the public and the city council so that everybody knows what's going on, when it's going to take place, how it's going to take place, and for residents and the city council to give input.

1165
01:27:13,301 --> 01:27:15,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So I second the resolve.

1166
01:27:15,102 --> 01:27:15,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1167
01:27:17,786 --> 01:27:22,170
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Locario.

1168
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,531
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

1169
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:24,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote.

1170
01:27:24,191 --> 01:27:25,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

1171
01:27:26,193 --> 01:27:26,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Please call the roll.

1172
01:27:39,145 --> 01:27:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1173
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:40,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1174
01:27:40,866 --> 01:27:41,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco?

1175
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:41,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1176
01:27:42,266 --> 01:27:42,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

1177
01:27:42,806 --> 01:27:43,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1178
01:27:43,426 --> 01:27:44,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Locker?

1179
01:27:44,267 --> 01:27:44,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1180
01:27:44,987 --> 01:27:45,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox?

1181
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:46,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1182
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:47,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Falco?

1183
01:27:47,288 --> 01:27:47,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1184
01:27:47,568 --> 01:27:48,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello?

1185
01:27:49,028 --> 01:27:49,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1186
01:27:50,049 --> 01:27:52,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

1187
01:27:53,510 --> 01:28:01,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the administration update the council on the promised raised crosswalks on Harvard Street and Central Ave.

1188
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:02,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

1189
01:28:03,473 --> 01:28:04,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1190
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:10,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a commitment back – that's actually three years now – that I wasn't going to let this issue die.

1191
01:28:11,418 --> 01:28:13,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm moving forward with my commitment.

1192
01:28:13,999 --> 01:28:24,225
[SPEAKER_04]: We were promised back three and a half years ago by then-Mayor McGlynn that there was going to be a pilot program in this city to implement three raised crosswalks.

1193
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:34,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor did his homework and research and decided that Harvard Street, Central Ave, and Winthrop Street were going to be the pilot locations.

1194
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:40,553
[SPEAKER_04]: To date, we have only installed one, Mr. President, on Winthrop Street.

1195
01:28:41,334 --> 01:28:53,440
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two raised crosswalks, I have offered several, actually countless, resolutions to this administration on an update on when we're going to see these other two raised crosswalks.

1196
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:01,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just because I want to see a raised crosswalk, because it's a proven way, Mr. President, for traffic calming.

1197
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:03,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's done in many other communities.

1198
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a speed bump.

1199
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a raised crosswalk.

1200
01:29:07,866 --> 01:29:21,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It slows down traffic, which is probably one of the top concerns I get from residents in this community, speeding cars and the fact that it's very difficult for a pedestrian to get around this community.

1201
01:29:23,512 --> 01:29:44,015
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with all these different projects going on, as I stated earlier, it's great to do complete streets and look at bump outs in some other areas, but we also have to attend to things that we've already approved and already decided are going to get done, whether it's filling a pothole, whether it's doing thermoplastic on a crosswalk, or

1202
01:29:44,595 --> 01:29:50,442
[SPEAKER_04]: completing the other two raised crosswalks that we discussed three and a half years ago.

1203
01:29:50,882 --> 01:30:04,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize it's a different administration, but if this administration doesn't want to honor what Mayor McGlynn put forward three and a half years ago in that pilot project, then the administration should come out and say, I don't want to honor it.

1204
01:30:04,677 --> 01:30:07,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll know where I stand with the issue, Mr. President.

1205
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll still fight for it, but I'll know where I stand.

1206
01:30:09,842 --> 01:30:15,648
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have yet to get an answer that at least satisfies me where we stand on the other two raised crosswalks.

1207
01:30:16,049 --> 01:30:24,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And residents on Central Ave and on Harvard Street deserve to know, Mr. President, because they were all wondering, where are these crosswalks?

1208
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:28,499
[SPEAKER_04]: They were originally told, well, we got to wait for the construction on Harvard to stop.

1209
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Central Ave, they were talking, well, there's some other things pending right now.

1210
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:35,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start with the crosswalk in front of the park.

1211
01:30:36,463 --> 01:30:38,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have yet to see anything, Mr. President.

1212
01:30:39,104 --> 01:30:44,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would put that, again, the mayor's going to get sick of seeing this every several weeks.

1213
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:48,167
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe the squeaky wheel will get the oil in this case.

1214
01:30:48,828 --> 01:30:53,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get raised crosswalks for pedestrian safety, Mr. President.

1215
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:53,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1216
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:55,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1217
01:30:55,411 --> 01:31:03,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to add a B paper to this, Mr. President, and ask the DPW commissioner to provide us with a report listing the pros and the cons of the use of race crosswalks.

1218
01:31:03,804 --> 01:31:09,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we're missing something here because I think it's something that the council supported in the past, but it's really not moving forward.

1219
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,674
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe there's a reason why that we don't know about.

1220
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:13,655
[SPEAKER_13]: So like Councilman Mox said, we'll know where we stand.

1221
01:31:13,795 --> 01:31:20,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we have the DPW commissioner send us a list of the pros and the cons, what's good about it and what they see as bad, and then why it hasn't been implemented.

1222
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:21,720
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that we're on the right track.

1223
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:28,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Race crosswalks, anything that could be used to improve pedestrian safety in this community is necessary, Mr. President.

1224
01:31:28,144 --> 01:31:29,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Every week we hear the same old stories.

1225
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Traffic, crosswalks.

1226
01:31:33,127 --> 01:31:34,527
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1227
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:40,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I don't mind the bee paper.

1228
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:41,900
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look into that.

1229
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:48,884
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're talking about a raised crosswalk, there's study after study if you go on to the Internet.

1230
01:31:49,324 --> 01:32:01,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And all you need to do is look at Cambridge, look at Somerville, look at Arlington, look at every surrounding community that uses raised crosswalks for pedestrian safety and also to slow down speeding traffic.

1231
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:02,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1232
01:32:03,672 --> 01:32:12,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you look at other communities that are using thermoplastic or doing bump-outs or extending the curbs to slow down traffic, this is not a secret.

1233
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:14,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being done everywhere else.

1234
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:17,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that we're not doing it, I don't think it means there's

1235
01:32:18,537 --> 01:32:24,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Cons, I think it's a lack of the administration to get something done, to be quite frank with you.

1236
01:32:24,802 --> 01:32:32,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the stuff that I'm seeing is window dressing, saying, hey, look what we're doing, but we're not taking care of the very important issues, Mr. President.

1237
01:32:33,368 --> 01:32:40,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mind that as a B paper, but clearly, you know, this has been on the table for three and a half years now.

1238
01:32:40,874 --> 01:32:45,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And to go back and look at the city coming back and say what the pros and cons are,

1239
01:32:45,717 --> 01:32:50,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the host is already out of the bond on this, to be quite honest with you.

1240
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

1241
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:51,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1242
01:32:51,941 --> 01:33:01,947
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason I say let's get the pros and cons is so that if there are cons on the list, that maybe we can do some research and refute them and drive a better bargain to make a more convincing argument.

1243
01:33:02,768 --> 01:33:04,569
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying, no, this is why we don't want to do it.

1244
01:33:04,689 --> 01:33:09,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's find out the reasons why, look at them, and see if we can come up with reasons why we should.

1245
01:33:10,032 --> 01:33:12,914
[SPEAKER_13]: And some counterargument, Mr. President, was all I was saying.

1246
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:13,934
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it's a great resolution.

1247
01:33:13,974 --> 01:33:15,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll support it wholeheartedly.

1248
01:33:15,135 --> 01:33:16,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I could, Mr. President.

1249
01:33:16,996 --> 01:33:17,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Vice President.

1250
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:19,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight brings up a valid point.

1251
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:27,961
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is a pilot program, I would assume you create a pilot program to, when you're done with the pilot program, you say, was this a success?

1252
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:29,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we implement more?

1253
01:33:30,102 --> 01:33:31,843
[SPEAKER_04]: What should we do to improve this?

1254
01:33:32,564 --> 01:33:37,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have yet to hear any discussion with the Winter Street raised crosswalk.

1255
01:33:37,826 --> 01:33:40,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if we sit here and wait for the city to react,

1256
01:33:41,568 --> 01:33:43,829
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hold our breath till we turn blue in the face.

1257
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly, the city's not going to react.

1258
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:56,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's time that we as a council push for the things that we want to see happen and not give them a way out saying, well, what are the pros and cons?

1259
01:33:56,313 --> 01:33:59,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the pilot program has been in existence for three and a half years now.

1260
01:34:00,554 --> 01:34:04,135
[SPEAKER_04]: If the city hasn't figured out the pros and cons yet, they never will, Mr. President.

1261
01:34:04,936 --> 01:34:05,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1262
01:34:06,794 --> 01:34:07,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

1263
01:34:07,654 --> 01:34:10,815
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by?

1264
01:34:10,835 --> 01:34:11,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1265
01:34:12,156 --> 01:34:13,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lococo, in all those in favor?

1266
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:14,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1267
01:34:14,477 --> 01:34:15,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1268
01:34:15,797 --> 01:34:22,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the safety of our traffic supervisor and residents be discussed.

1269
01:34:22,619 --> 01:34:23,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

1270
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1271
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually traffic supervisors.

1272
01:34:26,001 --> 01:34:27,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have misprinted it.

1273
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:41,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, today, as we saw on the news, first of all, the Medford Police de-escalated a very potential explosive situation at the Columbus School.

1274
01:34:42,254 --> 01:34:52,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to praise the Medford Police Department for their response and how they handled the situation at the Columbus School, as well as the faculty and principal and so forth.

1275
01:34:53,438 --> 01:35:00,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Mr. President, today — and this is an issue near and dear to me for a number of years — our traffic supervisors.

1276
01:35:01,621 --> 01:35:05,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're the ones, Mr. President, that you never hear anything about.

1277
01:35:05,902 --> 01:35:08,603
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a tiny union in the city.

1278
01:35:08,923 --> 01:35:10,204
[SPEAKER_04]: They never ask for anything.

1279
01:35:10,664 --> 01:35:15,465
[SPEAKER_04]: But they handle our most precious item every day — our children.

1280
01:35:16,186 --> 01:35:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day, they cross our children on these busy, busy roads.

1281
01:35:20,955 --> 01:35:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: on these busy, busy thoroughfares, and you never hear anything.

1282
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:28,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, there was an incident where one of them was struck in West Method, Mr. President.

1283
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:39,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope everything works well with that particular traffic supervisor, and my thoughts and prayers go out to the traffic supervisor.

1284
01:35:39,969 --> 01:35:43,972
[SPEAKER_04]: But for a number of years, Mr. President, I've been talking about this issue.

1285
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:56,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And not just because, you know, I want to talk about it, it's because I heard directly from the traffic supervisors that they need a way to communicate to the police department.

1286
01:35:57,178 --> 01:36:09,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they're on a thoroughfare, just say High Street or Winthrop Street or one of the major roads, Riverside Ave, Salem Street, and a car's driving by very aggressively and doesn't stop for

1287
01:36:10,084 --> 01:36:16,387
[SPEAKER_04]: or poses a threat, they really have no means of communicating directly to the police department.

1288
01:36:16,747 --> 01:36:18,328
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the eyes and ears on the street.

1289
01:36:19,228 --> 01:36:21,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a number of them throughout the community.

1290
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:31,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not take that information and be able to use that information to possibly send out a message to these people that refuse to stop for a traffic supervisor?

1291
01:36:31,973 --> 01:36:33,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that's wearing a multicolored vest.

1292
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:40,857
[SPEAKER_04]: that's in a crosswalk with signs and children and they refuse to stop at a crosswalk, Mr. President.

1293
01:36:41,777 --> 01:36:48,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I proposed an idea, I think it was two years ago, that they receive just small little walkie-talkies, maybe even the

1294
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:54,546
[SPEAKER_04]: second ones that are discarded after the police get the new walkie-talkies, our police department.

1295
01:36:54,946 --> 01:37:08,000
[SPEAKER_04]: That way they can have direct communication and be able to call in a license plate or be able to say, hey, there was just a red Mercedes that ran through and almost created a catastrophe here at this particular location.

1296
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you be on the lookout?

1297
01:37:09,782 --> 01:37:13,464
[SPEAKER_04]: These type of things would be very, very helpful, Mr. President.

1298
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:24,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure why, as a community, we're not being a little more aggressive when it comes to creating a safer environment.

1299
01:37:25,009 --> 01:37:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: The second issue, Mr. President, and I talked about this earlier, is many of our crosswalks that have the traffic supervisors that are crossing our kids aren't clearly marked.

1300
01:37:35,675 --> 01:37:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not painted.

1301
01:37:36,795 --> 01:37:37,716
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no signage.

1302
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:44,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're putting our traffic supervisor and our kids in a very unsafe predicament out there.

1303
01:37:44,748 --> 01:37:54,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I talked earlier about the need to repaint our crosswalks, it wasn't just to bring it up again, it's because of issues like we saw today, Mr. President.

1304
01:37:55,462 --> 01:38:03,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And that may not prevent something from happening, but it'll surely help when the crosswalk is clearly marked.

1305
01:38:03,489 --> 01:38:19,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll surely help when a car coming up can see from a distance that that's a crosswalk, can see the neon signs and saying people are crossing, maybe even blinking signs that Councilor Longo has been talking about installing throughout the community.

1306
01:38:19,662 --> 01:38:29,672
[SPEAKER_04]: But clearly, Mr. President, there's a need to integrate a communication process with traffic supervisors as our eyes and ears, Mr. President.

1307
01:38:29,952 --> 01:38:43,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There's clearly a need to revisit what's happening with crosswalks throughout the city, that they're not safe for our students and our traffic supervisors and residents that are crossing.

1308
01:38:43,765 --> 01:38:56,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And clearly what I'd like to see done, Mr. President, is some type of sting where we have police that are around the corner waiting to see during the course of a day what happens when people go through.

1309
01:38:57,321 --> 01:39:01,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I hear from traffic supervisors that people will flip the bird.

1310
01:39:01,967 --> 01:39:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they yell out the window, how dare you stop traffic.

1311
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you have to see the abuse that the traffic supervisors are putting up with kids across the street.

1312
01:39:13,034 --> 01:39:14,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no need for it, Mr. President.

1313
01:39:15,075 --> 01:39:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And we as a community have to send a message out.

1314
01:39:17,357 --> 01:39:19,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be tolerated in our community.

1315
01:39:19,658 --> 01:39:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize people get frustrated sitting in traffic and so forth, but when it comes to public safety, we're not going to take a backseat in this community.

1316
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:43,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that Chief Sacco revisit the direct communication with our traffic supervisors so they can report things on a timely manner, also that we revisit our crosswalks

1317
01:39:44,503 --> 01:40:09,637
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that they're highly visible and the correct signage and painting is done properly, Mr. President, and that the Medford police do a sting in certain locations to send out a message in this community that we're not going to tolerate abuse of our traffic supervisors or cars speeding through intersections where our children and our pedestrians are crossing, Mr. President.

1318
01:40:09,997 --> 01:40:11,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1319
01:40:11,098 --> 01:40:11,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1320
01:40:12,554 --> 01:40:13,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

1321
01:40:13,635 --> 01:40:15,416
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1322
01:40:15,716 --> 01:40:16,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded.

1323
01:40:16,297 --> 01:40:17,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Lerner.

1324
01:40:17,698 --> 01:40:18,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Karen, all those in favor?

1325
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:19,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1326
01:40:20,299 --> 01:40:22,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, roll call vote has been requested.

1327
01:40:31,827 --> 01:40:31,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1328
01:40:31,967 --> 01:40:32,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1329
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:32,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1330
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:32,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1331
01:40:32,308 --> 01:40:32,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1332
01:40:32,488 --> 01:40:32,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1333
01:40:32,748 --> 01:40:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1334
01:40:33,489 --> 01:40:33,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1335
01:40:51,423 --> 01:40:52,524
[SPEAKER_14]: involved in the accident today.

1336
01:40:52,544 --> 01:40:56,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, for those of you who don't know, there was a crossing guy to West Mephitt.

1337
01:40:56,907 --> 01:40:58,908
[SPEAKER_14]: He got hit by a car, but he got hit by a backhoe.

1338
01:40:59,969 --> 01:41:14,739
[SPEAKER_14]: And I say, if you could, maybe when you get back to the office tomorrow, find out what his status is in West Mephitt, at the place that in High Street this afternoon.

1339
01:41:14,779 --> 01:41:18,302
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I hope the young lady is okay.

1340
01:41:19,181 --> 01:41:40,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Longo-Kurian be it resolved that the council receive a copy of the updated data that was requested by the school committee last night as it relates to adding developments of 100 or more and including all non-school age children within the study of lower developments are affecting our schools.

1341
01:41:40,309 --> 01:41:41,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Longo-Kurian.

1342
01:41:41,849 --> 01:41:43,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1343
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:46,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching the school committee meeting last night.

1344
01:41:47,161 --> 01:41:50,404
[SPEAKER_08]: a group of teachers were going to speak, and I wanted to take a look.

1345
01:41:51,204 --> 01:42:15,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And before that happened, school committee woman Erin DeBettidetto had brought up the issue with regards to just the research that took place, data that was collected of children from developments entering, and how many are entering Medford Public Schools, and I think it's just something we need to keep track of, especially since we're developing all over the community.

1346
01:42:15,843 --> 01:42:25,728
[SPEAKER_08]: She asked for a further report with regards to including developments with 100 or more versus the 150 or more that was done in the last round of data.

1347
01:42:26,128 --> 01:42:33,072
[SPEAKER_08]: She also asked for school-age children and non-school-age children so we can get an idea of what will

1348
01:42:33,621 --> 01:42:38,265
[SPEAKER_08]: the amount of children that will be entering our schools coming down the line so that we can plan accordingly.

1349
01:42:38,645 --> 01:42:50,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was a great resolve, it was supported unanimously, and I would just like, once that is drafted and complete, I would like to get a copy so that we can include it with the data that we received two weeks ago.

1350
01:42:51,075 --> 01:43:00,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's just one of the, like again, one of the many parts that we need to look into with regards to development and how it's affecting our community.

1351
01:43:00,222 --> 01:43:00,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1352
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:04,508
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Lococoon, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1353
01:43:04,528 --> 01:43:05,108
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1354
01:43:05,288 --> 01:43:05,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1355
01:43:05,768 --> 01:43:06,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1356
01:43:07,508 --> 01:43:07,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Records.

1357
01:43:08,668 --> 01:43:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1358
01:43:09,909 --> 01:43:10,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Mox.

1359
01:43:11,049 --> 01:43:14,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you call for the records, I just want to bring to the council's attention.

1360
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:19,091
[SPEAKER_04]: We got responses back from the mayor in our packet.

1361
01:43:20,351 --> 01:43:23,071
[SPEAKER_04]: One was for paper 17-637.

1362
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:30,793
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an update offered by myself and Councilor Lococoon for the future and current plans for the Hagner Center.

1363
01:43:31,633 --> 01:43:38,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Councilor Lungo and I have put this on the agenda, along with other members of the Council, three times at least.

1364
01:43:39,258 --> 01:43:51,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And the response we received on this latest was, as stated on the Council paper June 13th, which is one of the other responses, we will apprise the Council on the needs once an evaluation is completed.

1365
01:43:52,366 --> 01:44:01,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So clearly, Mr. President, the city has at least no intent right now to do anything with that particular building.

1366
01:44:02,432 --> 01:44:13,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We know the city's track record when it comes to the maintenance of buildings, and the lung of this particular building remains vacant.

1367
01:44:13,978 --> 01:44:22,907
[SPEAKER_04]: and unkept, Mr. President, the more it's going to cost this community and taxpayers to eventually fix it for another repurpose.

1368
01:44:23,747 --> 01:44:37,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I, as one member, have put out looking at potential, which I think Councilor Scarpelli would agree upon, potential location for new athletic facilities.

1369
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:44,882
[SPEAKER_04]: recreation department or a potential use for an art center, Mr. President, in this community.

1370
01:44:45,242 --> 01:44:51,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, we don't have a home for Method Arts, and that building would be of tremendous use.

1371
01:44:51,644 --> 01:44:55,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that we get a better response, Mr. President.

1372
01:44:56,485 --> 01:45:00,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the mayor doesn't have any idea what she wants to do with the building,

1373
01:45:02,247 --> 01:45:03,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me retract that.

1374
01:45:03,948 --> 01:45:16,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, when the company that was renting this particular building wanted to sell the building, after the city turning the building over for $1,

1375
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:26,011
[SPEAKER_04]: for their use to provide support for people with disabilities.

1376
01:45:26,793 --> 01:45:32,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to the city, if it was no longer to be used for that purpose, it would revert back to the city.

1377
01:45:33,322 --> 01:45:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So this particular company, not-for-profit, was no longer moving.

1378
01:45:39,546 --> 01:45:40,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They moved out.

1379
01:45:40,587 --> 01:45:41,988
[SPEAKER_04]: They were no longer using the building.

1380
01:45:42,348 --> 01:45:43,209
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to sell it.

1381
01:45:43,229 --> 01:45:45,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this councilor who made that proposal?

1382
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:53,216
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to sell it for over, I think it was $650,000, a building the city gave to them for $1 for a particular purpose.

1383
01:45:53,636 --> 01:46:00,961
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor came and said she negotiated an agreement that would give the city, I think, don't quote me on this, but I think it was about $100,000

1384
01:46:03,382 --> 01:46:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was this council, and I led the charge, Mr. President, that stopped it from happening, Mr. President, and requested the city solicitor look into taking that building back.

1385
01:46:13,689 --> 01:46:18,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city solicitor reached out to the entity, and we were able to secure the building.

1386
01:46:19,252 --> 01:46:24,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's been close to a year, and we've been asking, what are we going to do with the building, Mr. President?

1387
01:46:25,336 --> 01:46:28,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And we still have no answers from this administration.

1388
01:46:28,918 --> 01:46:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, again, ask that we get a response on behalf of the residents of this community and the direct abutters that want to know what's going on, Mr. President.

1389
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:40,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1390
01:46:40,232 --> 01:46:43,413
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1391
01:46:43,573 --> 01:46:45,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1392
01:46:45,814 --> 01:46:47,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you President Caraviello.

1393
01:46:47,474 --> 01:46:58,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with my colleague and I just want to go further and ask for what type of evaluation is being done and how long are we expecting for it to be complete?

1394
01:46:58,698 --> 01:47:05,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have been asking for answers for a year and I think it's time that we get a little more than half a sentence.

1395
01:47:06,412 --> 01:47:09,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're not asking, I don't live, I'm not a direct abutter.

1396
01:47:09,995 --> 01:47:14,618
[SPEAKER_08]: The direct abutters are emailing and calling us to find out what is going on with the property.

1397
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:18,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Once in a while, they'll see a couple shrubs tidied up.

1398
01:47:18,802 --> 01:47:20,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Once in a while, they'll see some activity.

1399
01:47:20,643 --> 01:47:22,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe our police department's using it.

1400
01:47:22,825 --> 01:47:27,328
[SPEAKER_08]: But what evaluation's being done, how long is it gonna take, and what's our plan?

1401
01:47:28,029 --> 01:47:28,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time, it's time.

1402
01:47:29,169 --> 01:47:34,814
[SPEAKER_08]: If we need to, whatever we need to do to get some answers in more than a half sentence, it would be much appreciated.

1403
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:35,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1404
01:47:36,002 --> 01:47:37,823
[SPEAKER_04]: On to motion by Vice President Mox.

1405
01:47:38,084 --> 01:47:39,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I could.

1406
01:47:39,124 --> 01:47:39,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1407
01:47:39,905 --> 01:47:57,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to belabor the point, but anytime the administration talks about an evaluation or a study, it just brings back some real bad thoughts in my head about the study that was commissioned to look at a water taxi on the Mystic River.

1408
01:47:58,776 --> 01:48:09,559
[SPEAKER_04]: or a study on whether or not we needed a parking garage behind Colleen's, Mr. President, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent to realize something that we already know.

1409
01:48:10,219 --> 01:48:23,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I hope that the city's not going to move forward with some type of study on this, Mr. President, because all we need to do is get the wealth of knowledge we have in this community and move forward on a need that we have in this community.

1410
01:48:23,822 --> 01:48:24,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1411
01:48:25,482 --> 01:48:28,725
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor McCurran.

1412
01:48:29,406 --> 01:48:29,967
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1413
01:48:30,147 --> 01:48:30,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1414
01:48:30,747 --> 01:48:31,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1415
01:48:32,069 --> 01:48:37,214
[SPEAKER_14]: The table records of the meeting of September 19th were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

1416
01:48:37,554 --> 01:48:39,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

1417
01:48:39,856 --> 01:48:43,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Please forgive me if I could extend that to next week.

1418
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd appreciate it.

1419
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:47,984
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could table those records another week for Councilor Scarpelli.

1420
01:48:48,825 --> 01:48:54,910
[SPEAKER_14]: The records of the meeting of September 26th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Dello Russo.

1421
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:57,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Dello Russo, how have you found those records?

1422
01:48:57,231 --> 01:49:03,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, after examining the records to the best of my ability, I see them to be without error and move their approval.

1423
01:49:03,557 --> 01:49:04,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1424
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:06,719
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor, please step to the right.

1425
01:49:06,739 --> 01:49:07,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President?

1426
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Vice President.

1427
01:49:08,601 --> 01:49:14,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before we end, I think you let us know that next week we may be back at City Hall.

1428
01:49:14,827 --> 01:49:17,130
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back at City Hall next week for everyone.

1429
01:49:18,989 --> 01:49:20,969
[SPEAKER_14]: So people know not to come up to the high school.

1430
01:49:20,989 --> 01:49:22,070
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want people to come up here.

1431
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:28,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Barry might make a call, let everybody know that we're back at City Hall, our regular home.

1432
01:49:28,851 --> 01:49:30,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask that in the form of a motion then.

1433
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:39,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you could ask the administration if we can get a call letting people know that we will be back at City Hall next week.

1434
01:49:39,813 --> 01:49:41,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1435
01:49:41,333 --> 01:49:43,714
