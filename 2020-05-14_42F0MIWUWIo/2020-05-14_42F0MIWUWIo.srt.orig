00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:03,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:06,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much for tuning in to Solidarity Live.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:11,190
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we take questions and stories from our community here in Somerville and Medford.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to bring in some experts to talk about what's happening and how we're being affected by COVID.

5
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:22,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And then together we figure out how we can solve our issues.

6
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:27,340
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always make a comment in YouTube and I can pull that comment in.

7
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We can answer it live, so don't hesitate.

8
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:37,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am going to bring in my first guest for the day, which is Nicole.

9
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:38,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole Mosalem.

10
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me if I said that right, because I think I used to pronounce your name wrong.

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,410
[SPEAKER_07]: You did.

12
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:43,951
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.

13
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

14
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:47,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole, so happy to see you.

15
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:48,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy to see you.

16
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:52,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so there's different things we can chat about.

17
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:58,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if we can start, I would love to have you just say who you are.

18
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:06,021
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will begin with a conversation about the Muslim community here and Ramadan.

19
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that, I'd love to talk a little bit about your run for state.

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

21
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:19,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, I'm the director for the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford.

22
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:22,778
[SPEAKER_05]: In that role, I help with programming.

23
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:24,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I oversee administration.

24
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:30,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a woman of many hats, doing my best to serve the community in that capacity.

25
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:33,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as you mentioned, we're in a

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: separate vein, I'm also running for state representative of 35th Middle Six, which covers both Malden and a great big chunk of Medford.

27
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:44,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

28
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:51,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you talk about the Islamic Cultural Center and its mission and, you know, sort of what you do there?

29
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:58,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford, or ICCM for short,

30
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: They seek to provide spiritual programming for our community, help to strengthen our youth and their identity, as well as in their service.

31
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:15,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also seek to be of service to the community at large.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did

33
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, JT.

34
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:27,874
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I apologize.

35
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:36,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I answered the call from you, and I accidentally lost Nicole and Paola.

36
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:38,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if I can grab them.

37
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I was right in the middle of talking to Nicole.

38
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:41,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.

39
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea how to use Skype for this.

40
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,716
[SPEAKER_01]: You just ping me when you're ready.

41
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:46,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

42
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:48,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so, so much.

43
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to grab the two of them.

44
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:53,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So hang on everybody.

45
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:55,778
[SPEAKER_07]: JT is coming right up.

46
00:02:57,119 --> 00:03:08,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

47
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm dialing them in.

48
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:13,744
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have them on the line in just a second.

49
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:20,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

50
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole, I am so sorry.

51
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,847
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a Skype kerfuffle.

52
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me go ahead.

53
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:30,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't yet have your video.

54
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got JT on here with Nicole's name under it.

55
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:44,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.

56
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:44,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to switch.

57
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:46,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to switch out JT.

58
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to switch in Nicole.

59
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're doing this thing here.

60
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've got everybody on the call now, so that's great.

62
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Nicole, so sorry about the interruption.

63
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:20,583
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can talk a little bit about, yeah, you were talking about the mission of the Islamic Cultural Center, providing, you know, sort of spiritual space for them, and if you don't mind picking up from there.

64
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:27,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the last piece you heard then was the service to our community?

65
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:27,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

66
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:45,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when exactly it got cut off, but basically, you know, so we provide that strong foundation for our own community, for our youth to be able to have a strong identity, especially in service to the community at large.

67
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:50,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also strive to be of service

68
00:04:50,847 --> 00:05:07,174
[SPEAKER_05]: To all of Medford and the greater Boston area, by providing programs such as the Open Mosque Day, we hosted Medford Conversations, which are circles where people can gather to discuss relevant topics of the community and get to know one another.

69
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:12,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do quite a broad range of programming.

70
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:15,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We've only been open for a little over a year now.

71
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: in February was when we celebrated our one-year anniversary and Right before everything that's recently happened.

72
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:41,568
[SPEAKER_05]: We had quite a bit of programming that we had planned to kick off and That's okay you know, um What oh my mind went blank, but I was gonna say it's just gonna make it that much stronger when we do roll it out and

73
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:47,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, we're sort of all in the same boat on that front.

74
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's programming, doing everything had to be cancelled.

75
00:05:50,285 --> 00:06:00,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so great that there is this physical space for the Muslim community in the area.

76
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:08,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And I imagine that you, given your role, that you hear from a lot of the Muslim families and the Muslim people in the area.

77
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:13,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd love to kind of ask you, how is that community faring during COVID-19?

78
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:19,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say about the same as everybody else.

79
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:27,738
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their struggles dealing with being at home, having children at home, bouncing off the walls.

80
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Which both you and I know about.

81
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:30,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

82
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what's very unique for our community at the moment

83
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: is that it's Ramadan.

84
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:54,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, today began the most spiritually intensive time of Ramadan, the last 10 days, where we seek a very strong divine connection with God.

85
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And we usually do that communally.

86
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of that is to spend the last 10 nights

87
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:03,206
[SPEAKER_05]: inside the mosque.

88
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:27,663
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some people who will make a vigil there and they never step even a foot outside the mosque the last 10 days of Ramadan and this is a very special observance and you know, a lot of people are struggling with that this year spiritually and it's so we're doing our best to provide that programming to help fill that space.

89
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,906
[SPEAKER_05]: been doing Zoom prayers.

90
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:34,228
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a special prayer every single night during Ramadan.

91
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:39,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people have been doing that congregationally as best as possible via Zoom.

92
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,232
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been having lectures via Zoom.

93
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:48,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really led to a lot of creativity for our community.

94
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:53,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm proud to say many of us have risen to the challenge.

95
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:54,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

96
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:56,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

97
00:07:56,628 --> 00:08:03,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sure that is tough to have that going on at the same time.

98
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:16,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and especially Ramadan, even I, for myself, one of the things that I look forward to the most all year long is Ramadan and the communal aspect of it.

99
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: You never have Iftar alone, really.

100
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:24,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single night the mosque hosts an Iftar and not just

101
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,024
[SPEAKER_05]: the ICCM, but every mosque in the area has Iftar for the community.

102
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:38,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's been somewhat, it feels a little empty inside without that.

103
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:44,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And I imagine that for people who live alone, it's maybe even more difficult.

104
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:45,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

105
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:47,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

106
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:58,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, mostly this is about sort of reaching out and hearing from the Muslim community and how you're doing, but I can't resist asking you about your own race.

107
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:14,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would just love, you know, without spending too much time on it, I would love to kind of hear, you know, why you're running and, you know, just to say, feel free to talk a little bit about your race.

108
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:29,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, uh, I would say, you know, I began this, this path, so to speak back in 2016, uh, when my son came home from school and he was crying that day.

109
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:44,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason he was, was one of his friends at school had told him that they didn't like Muslims and that, you know, if Trump were ever elected, he would get rid of all the Muslims.

110
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:50,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, as a mom, that's just, it broke my heart.

111
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a real wake up call to find out, you know, I had always been part of a very welcoming community.

112
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:01,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always done a lot of interfaith work.

113
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:10,591
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes you can clue out a little bit of those who are a little less tolerant, who don't know about us as much.

114
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,326
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that really struck home.

115
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:19,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized, okay, I can't, I can't stay within these same circles.

116
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:28,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to broaden out and I need to find another path of service to make this a better world for our children to grow up in together.

117
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started becoming more involved in activism and in politics.

118
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ran in 2017,

119
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:48,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a very rewarding experience because people said, you know, we've never met a Muslim before, we've never, you know, had that interaction and you've really changed our opinions.

120
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:57,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of the people who, you know, weren't with me the first time have come forward and said, we've learned so much about you, we're looking forward to you running.

121
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:05,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, for me, it's about service to the community first and foremost, it's about

122
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:09,311
[SPEAKER_05]: the, you know, we always hear that phrase representation matters.

123
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:19,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, now that I see it, and now that I have members of our own community saying, you know, I never thought that we could run for office.

124
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:23,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have children saying, one day I want to run for office like you.

125
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's opening doors, it's opening minds.

126
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that aspect of it.

127
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:35,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also, you know, the issues aspect of it, which I believe the current crisis

128
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:42,961
[SPEAKER_05]: has shown us so much how precarious our situation is as a society when healthcare is tied to employment.

129
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:44,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

130
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:57,729
[SPEAKER_05]: People can't even go to the doctor to get tested because it would bankrupt them, but yet it's a public health issue that everybody gets tested, that everybody has access to healthcare.

131
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're finding out we're only as strong as our weakest link and people now,

132
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:11,858
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we hear in the news all the time that families are living paycheck to paycheck and they're only one missed paycheck away from complete financial ruin.

133
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:12,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And that just happened.

134
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:15,943
[SPEAKER_07]: For all those families, that just happened.

135
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:20,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it becomes a litany, you know, and you almost become numb to it.

136
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:24,454
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that this has happened, people are seeing what those effects are.

137
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:34,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have such a wide swath of our society, of our workers who are living this way, then our economy is so fragile.

138
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Our society is so fragile.

139
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:52,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I believe it's time that we start looking at these policies that lift workers up, that lift people up and families up out of poverty so that we all have a solid foundation, a baseline of a quality of life.

140
00:12:53,265 --> 00:13:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And that should be something very simple to do in the United States of America, in Massachusetts, as wealthy of a country as we are.

141
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:03,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

142
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:05,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Hair, hair.

143
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:09,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I am totally with you on that one.

144
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:15,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, if anybody wants to comment, ask questions, we'll take those questions live.

145
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:18,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So feel free to just comment in the YouTube comment section.

146
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:20,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, wonderful.

147
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:23,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know candidates are very busy.

148
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:32,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if you can stick around, um, and be on at the same time as, uh, like a little bit later as Paola and JT, um, that would be great.

149
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:36,091
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also completely understand if there are other things that you have to do.

150
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:38,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, uh, so yeah.

151
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:48,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if, is there any final words that you want to say, talk about in terms of, um, the Muslim community or the work that you're doing, uh, right now under COVID?

152
00:13:50,354 --> 00:14:00,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say we, you know, if there's anybody who's experiencing food insecurity within the community, we do have a food bank right now at the mosque.

153
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:08,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So please feel free to send us a message and we'll work really hard to help bring those supplies to you.

154
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:14,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been out into the community myself, taking supplies to families and dropping them off.

155
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,323
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a no contact delivery.

156
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:29,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So know that we're here also for everybody else, we're members of this community, and we're looking forward just like everybody to when we can reopen and host all of you again.

157
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:31,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

158
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:33,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

159
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:34,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

160
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to bring in Paola.

161
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

162
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:46,269
[SPEAKER_07]: One second, let me switch this here.

163
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Paola, you are live.

164
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:48,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

165
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is Paola Masoli with Mothers Out Front.

166
00:14:52,515 --> 00:15:00,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Paola, if you can introduce yourself and a little bit about Mothers Out Front, that would be great.

167
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:02,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

168
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:08,506
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a little bit of connectivity problems.

169
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:19,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what your data reception is like right now.

170
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, can you hear me?

171
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:27,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we're getting a lot of sort of connectivity issues, so it's very difficult to understand you.

172
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:35,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can, let's try again in a second or two, or if there's a place near you that you get better data.

173
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:38,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, you know...

174
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:47,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the idea of doing it without video that maybe we'll get better audio.

175
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Try speaking again.

176
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:57,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we just did not.

177
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we are not able to.

178
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:04,863
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not understandable.

179
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:15,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had had this idea earlier today that maybe we would just call you on the phone and we won't be able to see your face.

180
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:26,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe leave your... No, yeah, it's unfortunately just not working.

181
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,660
[SPEAKER_07]: We might be able to, the video was actually not too bad.

182
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:40,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you mute your audio, I'm gonna call you on the phone and we will have that play if that sounds good to you.

183
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:44,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're welcome to put your video up if you'd like.

184
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:48,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, we'll just go.

185
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:53,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I think I'm in.

186
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, so we can hear you fine now.

187
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm very sorry.

188
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:09,285
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not the way I wanted to be, but it was nice to briefly see you and see Nicole and see JT very briefly.

189
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:09,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

190
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:10,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

191
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, awesome.

192
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:16,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will just leave your name up here, but I'm going to, um,

193
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:22,108
[SPEAKER_07]: not have your video on because we don't see you.

194
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,755
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to turn your video on, that's fine, and I'll put you in there over Skype.

195
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:34,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Paola, go ahead and let us know sort of a little bit about you and about Mothers Out Front.

196
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:36,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

197
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:41,356
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thanks a lot for asking me to be on your show.

198
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,377
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a great honor.

199
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,877
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to talk to you.

200
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to meet Nicole.

201
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:53,478
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very inspiring story that we just heard.

202
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:58,779
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am a Somerville resident.

203
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Somerville.

204
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,180
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for about 10 years.

205
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:16,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am a member of Mothers Up Front, which is a national organization that started in Massachusetts maybe six or seven years ago.

206
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:23,758
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, it's expanded nationwide, and it's doing a lot of great work all over the US.

207
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,381
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who don't know the organization,

208
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:41,185
[SPEAKER_00]: As the name suggests, this was started by a few moms who were very worried about the climate change crisis and decided to get together and do something.

209
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:46,387
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided to target one of the most

210
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:59,135
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing issues that we are actually having, which are methane emissions that are coming from the extraction of gas, which in the U.S.

211
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:05,117
[SPEAKER_00]: has been going up extremely rapidly in the last 10 years.

212
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:08,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about natural gas, right?

213
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:14,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so we don't call it natural because there's not much natural about natural gas.

214
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I'm with you.

215
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:18,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted, like, because gas, when I think of gas, it's like gasoline for the car.

216
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:24,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we call it, we try to call it gas because, you know, the name natural actually gives this false

217
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:42,324
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that it's, you know, all good and great, but basically the mission of Mothers Up Front is to bring the collective power of mothers to push for legislative change and move decision makers to the extreme.

218
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:50,988
[SPEAKER_00]: to take action against climate change and to also build an inclusive community and also work on climate justice.

219
00:19:51,508 --> 00:20:02,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually much of what Nicole was saying resonated with me because some of the things that she was talking about, you know, pointing out, you know, the injustices and the inequalities

220
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:29,859
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the problems that we are experiencing right now with access to public health infrastructure are really common to the climate crisis and what people that belong to minority communities, belong to communities of color are experiencing when it comes to climate-related disasters.

221
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:36,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the state and local level, we are working on several issues.

222
00:20:37,560 --> 00:21:00,870
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, at the state level, there's been a lot of activity in the last few years in support of the community in Huemos that has been for now five plus years trying to stop the construction of a compressor station, which is a piece of the gas distribution infrastructure.

223
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:06,586
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline that would bring the gas to Canada.

224
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:12,690
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a constant and ongoing source of engagement.

225
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:25,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Weymouth Compressor Station, as I understand, this five-year battle to prevent this new infrastructure for fossil fuels coming

226
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:32,144
[SPEAKER_07]: to a not wealthy community in Massachusetts.

227
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:42,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you build new infrastructure, then the only way to get the money back from that investment is to do more fossil fuel extraction for the next 20 or 30 years.

228
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:47,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, yeah, so you pointed out two very important things.

229
00:21:48,455 --> 00:22:03,362
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the Waymo is actually an environmental justice community, because they have a history of pollution, and they also have a history of higher than average rates of cancer and leukemia, heart disease.

230
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:10,886
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually an environmental justice community already, so they don't need extra pollution on top of that.

231
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:13,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you pointed out

232
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:29,232
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that these big pieces of infrastructure lock you in using more fossil fuels for the next 20 or 50 years, which is absolutely the thing that we cannot do for the climate crisis.

233
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:46,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, this situation that we are in brought by the COVID pandemic has really exposed the fact that fossil fuel infrastructure in general is just a bunch of stranded assets.

234
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:58,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there is no economic viability of building any more of what we have, because the price of oil and the price of gas has reached basically negative.

235
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:00,985
[SPEAKER_00]: value a few days ago.

236
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:19,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an entire economic argument that really points to the fact that this infrastructure is not needed, is not economically viable for the community and even for the state, and only a few people will really profit from it.

237
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:19,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

238
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:30,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And can I ask you, I know that you've been particularly involved here in Somerville with the gas, the problem with gas leaks.

239
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So natural gas, which is not natural, right?

240
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:40,576
[SPEAKER_07]: The methane that is pumped into our houses to supply heating.

241
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:41,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

242
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: that the infrastructure in Somerville leaks, and in other places as well.

243
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:57,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a problem in Medford, and it's a problem across the state, that it leaks so much that, and I'm going to let you finish this sentence, how bad is it?

244
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,113
[SPEAKER_07]: How bad are these leaks in Somerville and Medford?

245
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:13,503
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty bad statewide and it's actually really bad all over the East Coast because the infrastructure is really old and all the infrastructure is leak prone.

246
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:16,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a problem that actually has been

247
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:23,312
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, has been around for a while and has been known and quantified for a while.

248
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:32,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually there is an organization that is based in Cambridge called HEAT, Home Energy Efficiency Team, that have been pioneering

249
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:49,789
[SPEAKER_00]: at different levels from the research and the advocacy with people from different universities over here in Massachusetts, methods to actually try to quantify the leak rates.

250
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:57,432
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, gas leaks are a problem from the environmental point of view.

251
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:59,953
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a problem because they are dangerous.

252
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:12,006
[SPEAKER_00]: gas is explosive, and there have been accidents that we had to go through in the last few years.

253
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It also kills trees.

254
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:17,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas actually has 60 root trees.

255
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:36,538
[SPEAKER_00]: The one reason why I actually got involved with Mothers Upfront is because I live in an area that is actually pretty gas leak prone because the infrastructure is a little bit older than the rest of Somerville.

256
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:42,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized with my neighbors that there were many dead trees around us.

257
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,362
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how actually I found out that my mother's up front.

258
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:52,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I began to be involved about three years ago.

259
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:56,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually, it's been great.

260
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:57,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot.

261
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:02,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had several successes.

262
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,131
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with the city.

263
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,992
[SPEAKER_00]: The city has been extremely supportive.

264
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:21,093
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of working with the utilities and trying to figure out what are the best times that the city and the utilities can actually work and fix these leaks.

265
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:26,796
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extremely disruptive.

266
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:35,618
[SPEAKER_00]: type of work, so roads have to be closed, you know, you have to open up the streets, so it is pretty involved.

267
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:45,764
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last couple of years, we've been making quite a bit of progress, actually, in Zomberville, so we are really happy, but there's a lot more to do.

268
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:51,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, and as long as we have those, as long as we have gas flowing through those lines,

269
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,836
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to fix them.

270
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:59,100
[SPEAKER_07]: But ideally, we move totally away from fossil fuels.

271
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:01,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll never need to repair those again.

272
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:02,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

273
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:13,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to completely move away from using gas, which, of course, requires an entire different plan.

274
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:19,098
[SPEAKER_00]: So it requires some policy, some serious policy.

275
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:27,192
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and policy plan requires collaboration with a lot of entities.

276
00:27:27,692 --> 00:27:31,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, it cannot be done as quickly as we want it to.

277
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:41,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes the best thing to do is actually repair the leak and keep using gas, although the long game is to actually get rid of gas altogether.

278
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:45,758
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is actually a lot of movement on that front as well.

279
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably many of you know that California is

280
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:58,732
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly moving away from using gas in new constructions.

281
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:09,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I think 15 cities, including large cities like San Jose, Berkeley, have actually passed ordinances

282
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:15,666
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish that there will not be any more gas in new buildings.

283
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:21,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're basically going through, yeah, so the plan is to electrify everything eventually.

284
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:33,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're starting from new buildings because it is actually easier to start a full electric building from scratch rather than retrofit.

285
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,217
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of reasons.

286
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:40,821
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New England, there's also the problem of very old housing stock.

287
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:46,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're one of the dense, like Somerville is one of the densest cities in the whole New England area.

288
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:51,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So the percentage of our housing that is new is small.

289
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there is construction going on.

290
00:28:54,893 --> 00:29:09,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, actually, in the Boston area, there's so much construction going on and so much construction has been happening in the last few years that honestly, I can actually make a list of many missed opportunities.

291
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:13,767
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true.

292
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:22,066
[SPEAKER_00]: The housing stock is mostly already built, but it's good to start from the new constructions because it's actually easier to do.

293
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:29,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot going on, actually, already in Boston.

294
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are plenty of examples of all-electric buildings.

295
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're cheaper to run.

296
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:39,317
[SPEAKER_00]: They're healthier, because you have no burning gas inside.

297
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:42,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't have pollution coming from your gas stove.

298
00:29:43,702 --> 00:30:02,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from the public health perspective and from the economics perspective, there is a way to go, but we need a lot to happen in terms of, again, legislation and policy to make it happen in a consistent way.

299
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:04,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

300
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:04,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

301
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:13,812
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the work that you are doing here and that Luggage Out Front is doing all over the country is very important.

302
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:26,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I know sort of, you know, uplifting the stories of like, you know, the health stories that have happened to people because of these gas leaks, because of the Weymouth Compressor Station.

303
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:35,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And also the trees, I remember you talking about, you know, these trees that have died and going there and actually testing the ground and finding that it's-

304
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:43,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so much more gas in that soil than is allowable.

305
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:48,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So, those things are really important as well.

306
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:48,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

307
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:50,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

308
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:56,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's actually, yeah, it's definitely, right now, of course, you know, we're all

309
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:11,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing not much in terms of actions and legislative activity that is a little bit slowed down, but we are still meeting online and organizing.

310
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:15,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually also part of the National Health Impact Team.

311
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:38,824
[SPEAKER_00]: In that capacity, I'm mostly working on the school bus campaign, because one other thing that Mothers of Fra is also doing across the country is to actually work with school districts and with the utilities and parents and teachers to try to get rid of these old school buses and replace them with electric school buses.

312
00:31:42,443 --> 00:32:00,812
[SPEAKER_00]: different problem, but um, but yeah, it's very exciting and and Again, we are very lucky in Somerville because Everybody is very supportive And so it's easier than in other places.

313
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:10,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine yeah, so yeah, in fact as I speak that big gas line that has been leaking outside of my street is being replaced so

314
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:11,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

315
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done.

316
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:23,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So the city has accelerated, yes, the replacement to try and do it before the street would be repaved, which is convenient for everybody and saves money and time for everybody.

317
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:34,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're very happy that there is this coordination happening lately between utilities and city to actually do repair before repaving, which is really the smart thing to do.

318
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:35,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

319
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:39,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any ways that people can get involved in Mothers Out Front?

320
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:43,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there is a website.

321
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mothersoutfront.org.

322
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:51,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that website, you can actually go into your local team.

323
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:58,402
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see different states, and then you go into Massachusetts, and then you can join your team.

324
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:04,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is also a team in Medford, if I'm not mistaken.

325
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:08,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, right now,

326
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:18,792
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I said, we're still connected online and there will be, there's always things to do.

327
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:26,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So more hands on deck are very welcome because this is a lot of work to do.

328
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:29,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no shorter job ways to get involved.

329
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

330
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:34,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that you say more hands on deck because I always talk about it is an all hands on deck moment.

331
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:37,685
[SPEAKER_07]: for climate and other things.

332
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:40,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you so much.

333
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been really great talking to you and hearing.

334
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:43,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

335
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:44,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

336
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:47,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing more about the work you guys are doing.

337
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:54,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So glad that things are moving forward in terms of Somerville and we will keep pushing on the way with the compressor station.

338
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, thank you so much.

339
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:07,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Anna, and I am very sorry that I could not connect via Skype and via video, but I am glad that this has worked somehow.

340
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:08,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.

341
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

342
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:09,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

343
00:34:09,977 --> 00:34:10,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

344
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:11,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

345
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:12,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

346
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:12,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

347
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

348
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next guest that we're going to have on is J.T.

349
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:22,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Scott, who is a Somerville city councilor.

350
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:27,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to remove Paola's name and move that front and put yours.

351
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got you in, JT.

352
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,912
[SPEAKER_07]: JT, how are you doing?

353
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:36,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we don't have your audio.

354
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

355
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

356
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm back.

357
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have no idea how to answer those questions nowadays.

358
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:47,265
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

359
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting by, right?

360
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting by.

361
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

362
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is as it was.

363
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:08,854
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to tell you, I was really excited when you asked me to come by, especially just because, you know, it's always good to hear from people who are running and what you're working on, what you're really excited about.

364
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:15,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And also because Paola is just incredible and the work she's done with Mothers Out Front in Somerville.

365
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,933
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the work of the wave method compressor is absolutely essential.

366
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:23,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the kind of thing that a state rep can have more influence in.

367
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:28,236
[SPEAKER_02]: But here at the city level, it makes a difference for our quality of life.

368
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a difference for our air pollution.

369
00:35:30,057 --> 00:35:34,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a difference for our trees staying alive, our environment, our very local environment being healthy.

370
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:38,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always love to hear from Paola and what she's working on.

371
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:43,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And also for Nicole,

372
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, Nicole are you still on?

373
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:49,417
[SPEAKER_06]: You know she is and I can you know what I'm gonna bring her in in a couple minutes.

374
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:53,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have you by yourself just for just for a minute or two.

375
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,001
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

376
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:57,063
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's all right and then we'll pull Nicole in.

377
00:35:58,144 --> 00:35:59,044
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

378
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,186
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, don't go anywhere Nicole.

379
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So JT, I didn't even really introduce you.

380
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:18,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love you to talk a little bit about who you are and really we're focusing on COVID-19 and how it's affecting Summerville and Medford.

381
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can talk to us about what's happening at the city council now and what you guys are doing around COVID-19.

382
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:26,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

383
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:31,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a huge question because everything is kind of on COVID-19 right now.

384
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,492
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, the work has been pretty intense over the last eight weeks.

385
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:53,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, the nice thing about a really active city council, like we have here in Somerville.

386
00:36:53,898 --> 00:37:00,561
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've actually, we're having a little bit of trouble understanding you as well, JT.

387
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:01,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me just a second.

388
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:08,977
[SPEAKER_07]: How is your data?

389
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:26,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to say it, but I actually cannot understand you.

390
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:27,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that bad.

391
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:33,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me wonder if maybe it is my data, but I hope it's not.

392
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:34,845
[SPEAKER_07]: You think it might be mine?

393
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,460
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be mine.

394
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is.

395
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:45,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on a 5G network.

396
00:37:45,784 --> 00:37:46,884
[SPEAKER_07]: That's usually pretty good.

397
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:47,545
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

398
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to move from my lovely background here.

399
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Background will probably, hey, we're all in COVID-19, right?

400
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:57,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody knows that you're at home and things look weird.

401
00:37:57,348 --> 00:38:00,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to plug right into the internet here.

402
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hardline it.

403
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:05,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get my lights to work.

404
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,539
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

405
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,361
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get this in here.

406
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one second.

407
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:18,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and of course, my computer does not have this kind of jack.

408
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:24,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Say another couple things.

409
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:43,279
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all facing challenges right now.

410
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,420
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all facing challenges.

411
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am going to ask, I'm going to do something here.

412
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:52,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have one of those?

413
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:55,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can't hear through mine.

414
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:58,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all hear the same thing.

415
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:07,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so apparently everybody here is the same thing that I hear, which is that folks can hear me fine, but they can't hear you.

416
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:08,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Drat.

417
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:10,764
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

418
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:11,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I would love.

419
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:15,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this worked for Paola.

420
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Your video is actually fine.

421
00:39:18,669 --> 00:39:19,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally fine.

422
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:19,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave your video on.

423
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Mute the audio.

424
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,311
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have the audio by phone.

425
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:24,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'll work great.

426
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:40,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have two numbers for you.

427
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:43,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd hate to read them off on, do you end in 3-2 or end in 2-1?

428
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:43,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

429
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:06,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

430
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:09,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we can see you and now we can hear you.

431
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:10,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

432
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:12,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, lovely.

433
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:21,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm just trying to figure out how to do this.

434
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:30,289
[SPEAKER_07]: The best thing is if you can mute the computer completely, not just yourself, but also mute the computer and then use the phone for audio, that would work great.

435
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,770
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, sweet.

436
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:44,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing City Council meetings online basically every night for the last eight weeks So having having a solid connection is definitely something you all struggle Mm-hmm

437
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:02,259
[SPEAKER_02]: So you asked a question about, you know, what's happening in the city in COVID-19.

438
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:08,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what I was trying to say is just, it's, that's a big question to answer because everyone is COVID-19 right now.

439
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:21,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Even all the struggles that were already there are being, I think, as Nicole very, very eloquently put, are being highlighted, are being emphasized.

440
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:23,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's,

441
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's happening with COVID-19?

442
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everything that was happening before, only more so.

443
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:40,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And with one hand tied behind her back, because we can't necessarily just go out in the community and knock on doors and talk to people the way we used to.

444
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a ton.

445
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where to start with this.

446
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:46,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll ask you some questions.

447
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:59,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that a lot of great things have been passed in terms of making sure that we're all safe, that the whole shutdown and all of that, and Somerville was very early on in that.

448
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to look a little bit at the future.

449
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:09,515
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the plan, right?

450
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:17,378
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you guys handling the, do we have enough testing kits in Somerville?

451
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any sort of a tracing plan?

452
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:21,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that something that the state will really take care of?

453
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,782
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that side of things look from the city perspective?

454
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:33,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great question, and it's a fairly complicated one.

455
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:48,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what I said earlier, one of the great things about having such a really active and engaged city council is that so many of us in these roles, in addition to the constituent services that we deliver to our wards, are working

456
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:55,232
[SPEAKER_02]: on advocacy around various aspects of this, working on policy and various aspects of this.

457
00:42:56,593 --> 00:43:09,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I'm engaged in right now is basically a task force to distribute a million dollars in community development block grants to retail or ground level small businesses in summer.

458
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:12,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just closed applications for that.

459
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:14,120
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got an enormous number of them.

460
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:31,707
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to be able to help everybody, but finding with the other people on this task force, you know, what we can do to help these really essential cornerstone businesses that mean a lot to the community, that are either delivering vital

461
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:38,725
[SPEAKER_02]: or have an outsized role in terms of their efforts in the community, their legacy.

462
00:43:38,805 --> 00:43:46,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one piece that I could give probably an example for everybody on the city council.

463
00:43:46,447 --> 00:44:02,812
[SPEAKER_02]: The question you asked about testing kits and policies, the city council was very early in encouraging the mayor to move to the kind of restrictions, the lockdown restrictions that we currently have in place.

464
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:12,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where the advocacy helps, because it built the momentum that Somerville could do it, and Cambridge could do it, surrounding communities.

465
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:14,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, Boston came on board.

466
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:20,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've seen over and over is what Somerville does, kind of three days later, Baker does.

467
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:21,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Well done.

468
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:22,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him a push there.

469
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:27,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a team effort.

470
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,952
[SPEAKER_02]: If we couldn't get Mayor Joe on board, then it would stop there, right?

471
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:37,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he can't get other regional mayors on board, it stops there.

472
00:44:38,097 --> 00:44:41,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is absolutely a team effort, and we're all just pulling together.

473
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:51,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, most of those restrictions are executive orders, and the restrictions statewide are executive orders.

474
00:44:51,807 --> 00:45:02,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So the danger comes when those executive actions happen without consultation or against the advice or advocacy of the legislature.

475
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:13,316
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think it's really important to have not just a responsive legislature, but an activist legislature.

476
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:24,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people who are really public in their advocacy, and that's, I love what Brett McKinley, he's my state rep, is doing around that, and he's shown leadership around that.

477
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:33,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say look to the future, what really concerns me is that right now, we've had yesterday and today,

478
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:38,168
cases in Massachusetts increased, today dramatically so.

479
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:43,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet the governor is still talking five days from now about opening everything up.

480
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he started with gun shops and golf courses.

481
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:53,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult because I'm grateful for the governor's responsiveness.

482
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're grading on a curve of 50 states, how does that go?

483
00:45:57,397 --> 00:45:59,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're grading on an international curve,

484
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:11,713
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even within the United States, Massachusetts is third in terms of cases per capita and deaths per capita.

485
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:15,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that is absolutely a failure.

486
00:46:15,135 --> 00:46:20,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand people like the way he delivers this message, but what's been lacking there is leadership.

487
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:26,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, it's the advocacy around that it's working with, uh, you know,

488
00:46:27,197 --> 00:46:33,145
[SPEAKER_02]: working with epidemiologists, working with colleagues, trying to build that broader understanding.

489
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:38,213
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this isn't really the time to blame anybody for what's happened.

490
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to focus on doing what I can to keep as many people safe as possible.

491
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

492
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I, can I ask you a little question about that?

493
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:52,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think some of the stuff that Somerville has done amazingly well is to provide aid to people.

494
00:46:52,936 --> 00:47:04,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk a little bit about, um, what, what sort of things are available, like even to people who are listening here, like what they can, how they can, um, look to the city of Somerville for some of their needs during COVID.

495
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd say yes, absolutely look to the city of Somerville.

496
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:10,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Also look to your neighbors.

497
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:22,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to absolutely shout out Mutual Aid Medford in Somerville is a group of just, it is grassroots, it is sometimes block by block, and this is just neighbors helping neighbors.

498
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:34,012
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't seen a flyer in your neighborhood for Mutual Aid Medford in Somerville, go to MutualAidMamas.com and sign up to be your block point person.

499
00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:45,680
[SPEAKER_02]: and put up the flyers, because even a couple weeks ago, a completely volunteer, completely unfunded organization distributed over $80,000 in direct aid to people.

500
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:55,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in addition to giving people rides places, bringing people groceries, handling small things that otherwise would be impossible for people to take care of.

501
00:47:57,303 --> 00:48:01,708
[SPEAKER_02]: they manufactured hand sanitizer in bulk for our elder care facilities.

502
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So that group has really been outstanding and that's kind of my dream of the world I want to live in.

503
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:15,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, they were the very first, our very first show was someone, one of the founders of Mamas.

504
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:17,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

505
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:23,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I've been talking to him up at the City Council since the idea was just a Google Doc.

506
00:48:24,447 --> 00:48:26,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep shouting about as many chances as I can get.

507
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:32,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say there's been incredible leadership from the Somerville School District.

508
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:46,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Tens of thousands of meals handed out, over 500 laptops distributed, not just laptops, but also wireless access for families that didn't have a computer at home, didn't have internet access at home.

509
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:53,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that could be important for distance learning, but frankly, that's just important for getting by right now.

510
00:48:53,278 --> 00:49:00,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I've constantly said if we are going to ask people to stay home because of the public health importance of it, we have to give them resources to do that.

511
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:15,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether that's food, whether that's making sure they don't have to pay rent, whether that's getting them, it just demonstrates the importance of broadband access as a utility.

512
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:19,998
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different points of advocacy, there's so many inequities that are being highlighted by this.

513
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's tough to know where to start.

514
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

515
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:30,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two organizations, the school district and Mutual Aid Mamas, were at the lead there.

516
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:38,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, you know, the mayor announced there's enhanced mass distribution happening.

517
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:46,387
[SPEAKER_02]: We're emphasizing mass distribution in the places where we're seeing most of it, like in the 02145 section of town.

518
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:47,868
You know, there's

519
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:56,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, this small business block grant program that's going to hopefully help people weather the storm.

520
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:03,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just trying to get people the resources to keep their businesses closed until we can get to a place where it's safe.

521
00:50:04,094 --> 00:50:06,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not there.

522
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:10,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It is catastrophic when I consider that

523
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:19,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, Massachusetts had more new cases reported than Germany as a country.

524
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:28,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And Germany, in response to about 70 percent as many cases as we had, brought back lockdown restrictions while we were talking about releasing ours.

525
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:32,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an absolute fad move, and we need to do better.

526
00:50:33,944 --> 00:50:39,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I could talk to you forever, and I'm wondering if you're okay with it.

527
00:50:39,347 --> 00:50:44,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see if Paula and Nicole are still around.

528
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:52,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if Paula and Nicole, if you guys are still here, go ahead and turn on your video.

529
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:54,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Paula, hopefully we can get you in.

530
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:55,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

531
00:50:55,796 --> 00:50:57,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole is... Oh, good.

532
00:50:57,857 --> 00:50:59,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me add Nicole.

533
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:01,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah-ha-ha.

534
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:02,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Nicole.

535
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:03,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

536
00:51:03,764 --> 00:51:06,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so good to meet you, Nicole.

537
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:08,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to meet you, too, JT.

538
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:09,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what?

539
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:13,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my computer audio off, so I can't hear anybody but Anna.

540
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:13,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

541
00:51:14,311 --> 00:51:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

542
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:16,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to figure out a way to do this.

543
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:18,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to turn that volume down.

544
00:51:19,595 --> 00:51:19,875
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

545
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:25,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to bring in a couple of seconds for you guys, and then I'll bring Paul in.

546
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:26,999
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

547
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pleasure to meet you.

548
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:32,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say I was visiting a friend

549
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:38,891
[SPEAKER_02]: and ended up seeing a flyer.

550
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: This had to be late February.

551
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:47,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been campaigning for a long time out there, haven't you?

552
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been.

553
00:51:49,354 --> 00:51:50,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to get an early start.

554
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:53,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're taking on an incumbent, yes?

555
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:55,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

556
00:51:55,236 --> 00:52:03,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm taking on Paul Donato, a very great state rep.

557
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:09,418
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's been in office, just state rep, for going on 20 years now.

558
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:23,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I admire anybody who has the guts to serve in public office, I hear what you're saying, too, about the stats that our state is facing.

559
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:33,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody in leadership shares in that, especially the House, where a lot of the legislation that you're talking about that could help municipalities

560
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:40,021
[SPEAKER_05]: is getting bogged down in a very untransparent, opaque process.

561
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:42,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody knows why.

562
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:50,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to really learn to find out what's going on.

563
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:51,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I've been doing.

564
00:52:52,403 --> 00:53:00,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe we need someone in there who's going to stand up for our district, who's going to do what's best for our working class families with an eye to the future.

565
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:09,463
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've got three children and just like everybody else's children and who are parents, we want what's best for them.

566
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:12,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't it.

567
00:53:12,764 --> 00:53:14,324
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have right now, it's not it.

568
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:15,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mess.

569
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:19,405
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, that is an understatement.

570
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:22,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's,

571
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you put it very well.

572
00:53:25,473 --> 00:53:32,355
[SPEAKER_02]: The leadership team shares an incredible amount of blame and being willing to stand up and advocate this.

573
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:38,017
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talk about having an activist, really public voices about this, that's what we need.

574
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:41,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I really admire about the state reps that

575
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:44,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, represent my district.

576
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no overlap.

577
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I don't even have any overlap there.

578
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:49,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Mike.

579
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:50,535
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome.

580
00:53:51,096 --> 00:53:51,736
[SPEAKER_07]: We all love Mike.

581
00:53:51,756 --> 00:53:52,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't love Mike?

582
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:02,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's been a long day of working on this.

583
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:03,536
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

584
00:54:03,636 --> 00:54:08,919
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've never had four people on.

585
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:12,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how it's going to position people in the frame.

586
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me give it a shot.

587
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to bring Paula in here as well.

588
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:16,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Aha.

589
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

590
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:19,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

591
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:20,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I see everybody.

592
00:54:21,188 --> 00:54:21,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that.

593
00:54:21,748 --> 00:54:22,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

594
00:54:23,069 --> 00:54:24,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to move the names around.

595
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So JT is over there.

596
00:54:26,852 --> 00:54:27,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, JT.

597
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:27,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole is there.

598
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:30,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Paola is here.

599
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:31,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wonderful.

600
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see everybody.

601
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:36,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Paola.

602
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:38,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Nicole.

603
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,124
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to meet you.

604
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's nice to see JT.

605
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:46,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Nicole, this being your second time,

606
00:54:48,515 --> 00:54:54,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be tough coming in thinking, all right, I've got lessons learned, I've got a plan, I'm ready to rock and roll, I'm starting early.

607
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:01,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I saw your flyer at a friend's house and went and looked you up to figure out a little bit about what you were about.

608
00:55:02,865 --> 00:55:11,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, for it all to get thrown up into the air, not just because of these circumstances, but because you yourself were sick for a while, correct?

609
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:17,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so right before the stay-at-home orders were issued, I became sick.

610
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And it happened very suddenly within the space of a few hours.

611
00:55:21,744 --> 00:55:27,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within just two, three days, our whole family had it, all three kids, my husband.

612
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I never want to be that sick.

613
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:32,298
[SPEAKER_05]: ever again.

614
00:55:32,598 --> 00:55:37,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my heart goes out to everybody who's having to deal with this right now.

615
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't beg you enough.

616
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:43,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Those masks, these stay at home orders, they're no jokes.

617
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,303
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to catch this.

618
00:55:46,183 --> 00:55:50,264
[SPEAKER_05]: You can survive, but I'm telling you, it's not good.

619
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Not good.

620
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:55,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm very glad your whole family came through this.

621
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's,

622
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:10,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question that I think all candidates are working with right now, you know, you and Anna, is how to campaign in this age, how to actually get out and reach people.

623
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:27,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, you know, when I ran for the first time in 2017, it was just a matter of knocking on all the doors and talking to all the people, because there is so much we have in common, regardless of, you know, you have a Trump sign in your lawn or a Hillary sign, these things,

624
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:30,682
[SPEAKER_02]: across these boundaries.

625
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:33,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is about class in a lot of ways.

626
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:47,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I guess my question is, you know, how, for both of you, you know, what is that key message that you're getting to, trying to get out to your district, trying to get people to hear?

627
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:52,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before we log off, Anna, to answer your question, I really want to make a pitch for one of the public health services.

628
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I want to hear these answers.

629
00:56:58,693 --> 00:56:59,893
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you take a turn, Anna?

630
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:00,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

631
00:57:01,174 --> 00:57:03,395
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny because this is such a listening session.

632
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:10,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week I'm listening and hearing stories from the district and bringing in experts to figure out how we can solve these together.

633
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't really talk about my race on the show, but now is my opportunity.

634
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:15,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, JT.

635
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:29,447
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm running because I really believe that we cannot... I think the other side has the money and we have the people, but if that's true, we cannot win if we're preaching to the choir.

636
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:34,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we will not win a Green New Deal if we don't have a movement behind it.

637
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we will not win Medicare for All if we don't have a movement behind it.

638
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:42,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been training people for four years in a style of...

639
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,952
[SPEAKER_07]: build movements through local electoral organizing.

640
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:58,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see the primary role of an elected official as a movement builder.

641
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:06,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we must have movement builders as elected officials, because that is the only way that we will

642
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:11,036
[SPEAKER_07]: get the policies that we want, need, and deserve.

643
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:31,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am running to be a movement builder in the district and across the state with some very specific tactics that I learned from some amazing union organizers and other elected officials and other folks, very specific tactics that I've been training people in for years now.

644
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm excited to do it as an elected official.

645
00:58:37,088 --> 00:58:38,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, very cool.

646
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I agree.

647
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:47,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you mostly from your activism in those spheres.

648
00:58:47,195 --> 00:58:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about you, Nicole?

649
00:58:53,540 --> 00:59:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say, you know, when I knock on someone's door and I get to meet them the first time, I'm always, you know, a little shy, but it's mainly about them.

650
00:59:02,726 --> 00:59:03,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear,

651
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:09,568
[SPEAKER_05]: what they have to say and what issues are important to them because we're a community and we're all neighbors.

652
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:22,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main message that I want to get across to everybody is that we all struggle together and we need somebody who has that mindset.

653
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:27,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We need somebody who hasn't forgotten, you know, where their roots are at.

654
00:59:28,781 --> 00:59:29,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up

655
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:38,216
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom was single, single mom trying to raise me and we were homeless for a period of time.

656
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:44,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know what it's like to go dumpster diving in the back of a store for your dinner at night.

657
00:59:44,522 --> 00:59:52,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know what it's like to, you know, not have a roof over your head, but only the comfort of your mother's arms around you at night.

658
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:54,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know some children don't even have that.

659
00:59:55,609 --> 01:00:03,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that that perspective has made me open to other people's experiences and their situations.

660
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:16,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I see that everybody works hard regardless of their circumstances and deserves to be able to have a better life and be honored for that hard work.

661
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:19,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think we have that in a society anymore.

662
01:00:19,154 --> 01:00:21,174
[SPEAKER_05]: We put people down.

663
01:00:21,714 --> 01:00:24,935
[SPEAKER_05]: We've lost sight of that humanity.

664
01:00:25,758 --> 01:00:37,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, because I come from a more, I guess, you know, service and faith type of background, I got started on this path, you know, working at a mosque, being an administrator and getting involved in government work.

665
01:00:40,055 --> 01:00:51,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I want to share with everybody that passion for service that I have and that, you know, I've had to fight so much throughout my whole life, you know, lots of struggles.

666
01:00:51,678 --> 01:01:01,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's really molded me and crafted me to where I know when I need to take a stand and I know when it's time to take a step back and let others lead.

667
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:05,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope people will see that and respond to that message.

668
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:08,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

669
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:10,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

670
01:01:10,964 --> 01:01:19,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I really could stay in this call for a long time, but I believe it or not, you know, candidates have busy schedules and I have a meeting starting now.

671
01:01:19,274 --> 01:01:23,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was listening to everything that you said and

672
01:01:28,877 --> 01:01:30,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Your work is absolutely amazing.

673
01:01:30,778 --> 01:01:34,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't I wasn't aware of Your organization mom's out front.

674
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:56,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So i'm very interested in learning more I'd love to get involved because those issues with the the gas pipes that you were talking about same thing in malden I just ripped up my street, you know a couple months ago to do the exact same thing Yeah, um, I actually I don't know if I should give the conclusive remarks over here because I

675
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:09,040
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally, I don't know, I don't feel I have the, I don't know, the closing, I don't know, the closing remark kind of skill, but- We'll let JT wrap it up.

676
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:09,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

677
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:20,469
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very inspired by you guys, by you, Anna and Nicole running, and by all the work that JT, you've been doing, and all the people that you have mentioned.

678
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:24,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was also my rep, and I'm very, very happy about it.

679
01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:36,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really inspiring at this moment where people like me in the climate movement feel completely left abandoned.

680
01:02:37,576 --> 01:02:51,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially on top of that, me who has a scientific background that feels even more like crushed because science has been torn apart and destroyed and mystified and completely trashed.

681
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:56,472
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in some parts, not everywhere.

682
01:02:56,892 --> 01:03:06,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really inspiring to see people like you engaged and also ready to change minds and hearts and ready to do the work.

683
01:03:06,997 --> 01:03:11,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people want to give up, and we really cannot give up right now.

684
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:14,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's extremely inspiring.

685
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be happy to touch base with you, Nicole.

686
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:21,243
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to talk about Gas Leaks, I can tell you everything about Gas Leaks.

687
01:03:21,903 --> 01:03:28,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have JT say a final word, and then I hate to do it, but I'm going to have to close out.

688
01:03:34,755 --> 01:03:35,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

689
01:03:35,336 --> 01:03:36,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use the rest.

690
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:37,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nicole, she's not kidding.

691
01:03:38,178 --> 01:03:40,079
[SPEAKER_02]: She will tell you all about DASWIT.

692
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, totally.

693
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:42,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

694
01:03:42,761 --> 01:03:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be a worthwhile experience.

695
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:45,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

696
01:03:45,403 --> 01:03:46,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, absolutely.

697
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:50,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Mothers out front, incredible organization, doing incredible work.

698
01:03:50,327 --> 01:04:02,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said about the city council and about all of us, whether you're on a city, town, board, or in the state legislature, or part of our federal delegation, we all have to pull together.

699
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to be part of this movement.

700
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:19,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the beautiful things about it is I know even when I'm not focused today on natural gas leaks I know that Paula is and I know that she has my ear and that I have you know I'm giving her my respect and attention and

701
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:35,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And can I also say many, many other people in Massachusetts, in Somerville, around the country, you know, I kind of came to this group late, so tons of people before me have done the work.

702
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:40,864
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to recognize everybody in this group.

703
01:04:41,425 --> 01:04:41,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

704
01:04:42,314 --> 01:04:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, absolutely.

705
01:04:44,395 --> 01:04:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: We all stand on the shoulders of giants and we say goodbye with a little help from our friends.

706
01:04:49,937 --> 01:05:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that, just as a final plug, in terms of testing, we do have access to about 4,000 tests in Somerville and we're really trying our best to make sure that we are completely consuming that capacity.

707
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:09,188
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere between 100 and 150 tests a day at the center of a hospital.

708
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:11,831
[SPEAKER_02]: You can walk up, you can bike up, you can drive up.

709
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:13,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's accessible to anybody.

710
01:05:13,693 --> 01:05:14,194
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a 19.

711
01:05:15,275 --> 01:05:16,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need citizenship.

712
01:05:16,797 --> 01:05:17,778
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need papers.

713
01:05:17,878 --> 01:05:18,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need anything.

714
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:22,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Just call the number, make a reservation.

715
01:05:23,203 --> 01:05:29,886
[SPEAKER_02]: and get in there to get tested because that data, we have a lot more visibility and granularity in than the state data.

716
01:05:30,086 --> 01:05:48,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we see the lack of leadership that we've seen at the state level, it makes it even more important that we can gather great data here at the local level and use that to make the argument about what responsible policy is and what we have to do, whether that's legislatively or through executive orders or through advocacy to make sure it carries forward at the state level.

717
01:05:49,165 --> 01:05:52,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's just a great way to try to keep our neighbors safe.

718
01:05:52,588 --> 01:05:57,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've been waiting, thinking, oh, other people need those tests, they're completely free.

719
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,174
[SPEAKER_02]: They're available to all Somerville residents.

720
01:06:01,075 --> 01:06:01,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Nicole.

721
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:05,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are, you know, make the call.

722
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:06,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get in there.

723
01:06:06,959 --> 01:06:09,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's use up all those tests and we will find more.

724
01:06:10,562 --> 01:06:10,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

725
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:13,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all so much.

726
01:06:13,164 --> 01:06:14,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been wonderful talking to you all.

727
01:06:14,545 --> 01:06:16,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much for all the work that you do.

728
01:06:17,525 --> 01:06:18,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks for tuning in.

729
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:20,375
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be back in a couple weeks.

730
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:21,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.
