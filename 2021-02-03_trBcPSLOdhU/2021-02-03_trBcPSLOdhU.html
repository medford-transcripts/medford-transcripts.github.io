    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=270.665s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=271.978s">So</a>  having the affirmative zero negative, we can now enter executive session.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=275.004s">Would</a>  you be coming out and back in public, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=277.189s">We'll</a>  be coming back out in public to adjourn and to report anything out that we choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1754.795s">Thank</a>  you everybody for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1756.515s">We</a>  are recording, we are out of executive session and we did take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1761.137s">I'm</a>  gonna turn it over to Mr. Murphy to give a brief summary for those who are watching of the memorandum of agreement and then we will announce the vote.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1774.4s">Thank</a>  you, mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1776.161s">As</a>  the mayor said, the school committee tonight in executive session was considering <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1780.907s">tentative</a>  agreement that was reached between the Medford Teachers Association and the Medford Public Schools on January 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1787.47s">This</a>  memorandum of agreement governs the working conditions for the 2020-2021 school year and only the 2020-2021 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1792.132s">The</a>  negotiations began in the summer of 2020 and were pertaining to the restart of school after the shutdown due to the pandemic in the spring of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1810.123s">important</a>  as was noted to the committee and I know has been shared with the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1816.004s">There</a>  were a series of tentative agreements reached in September of 2020 that put the position the district to bring students back into school without objection from the teachers union and the conditions and the circumstances were set that I can say as a member of the negotiating team and I know I speak on behalf of the superintendent and our leadership team that <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1839.063s">put</a>  the district in a very positive footing to bring students in. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1843.705s">It's</a>  a large, big part of why we've been able to have the amount of in-person instruction that we've been able to have during the course of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1851.77s">And</a>  so for that and for all that was achieved during the course of this negotiation, the administration is grateful to the Teachers Union and to the union leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1862.535s">I</a>  know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1862.895s">Douglas</a>  is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1864.333s">here,</a>  and I imagine members of her team are watching or listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1867.836s">And</a>  I can say with sincerity to both Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1871.439s">Douglas</a>  and the MTA representative, Mr. Katz, we're grateful to them for their leadership and contributions to what was a constructive dialogue that has led to an agreement that we believe is grounded in the best interests of students and fair to the educators whose work and conditions it will govern. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1891.281s">The</a>  MOA will be available on the district website as a public document effective this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1896.085s">And</a>  there are a few highlights that we think are important from the improved, excuse me, the heightened air quality standards that were a key part of bringing students back into school and making sure that educators both were in a working environment that was in fact safe, but also was giving the <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1918.657s">the</a>  peace of mind to combat the very understandable anxiety that all of us are experiencing in the course of this pandemic and having to continue on with our responsibilities and our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1929.683s">The</a>  mandatory COVID testing that is taking place as a result of the partnership that the district enjoys with Tufts University and is continuing this week and will continue on for the remainder of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1944.871s">There's</a>  important provisions around <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1947.169s">making</a>  sure that we as a district and in collaboration with our union partners are being mindful and cognizant of the risk of disengagement that we have for all students under these conditions and additional responsibilities that are part of the agreement to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1964.354s">And</a>  a number of other provisions, including participation in additional information session that we will plan with the union to make sure that parents and family members <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1975.903s">are</a>  given as much information as possible going into the 2021-2022 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1985.165s">So</a>  the administration has recommended the approval of this agreement to the school committee on the basis that, again, we believe it is in the best interest of students and fair to educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=1998.007s">I'll</a>  reiterate our gratitude to the union for the work that we've engaged in with them over the past several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2004.433s">And</a>  I would just say as a final comment that I think every MOA, every time that we engage in one of these negotiations, it's either a step backwards or a step forward with regard to the relationship between the district and our bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2019.344s">And</a>  I think in this instance, where we've ultimately landed, it's a step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2024.908s">And</a>  to that effect, we look forward to engaging with the union as we're now contractually obligated to do on a monthly basis in terms of making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2034.5s">effectuating</a>  our health and safety committee provision that's in the MOA, and also in preparation for additional negotiations that we know will be coming up in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2044.943s">So</a>  with that sort of positive, a positive foundation on which to build, and certainly the foundation is long preceded this negotiation, but hopefully it's adding additional layers to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2058.727s">And</a>  we look forward to our continuing work with the Medicare Teachers Association.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2064.907s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy, very well said. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2068.43s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot and then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2069.872s">Douglas,</a>  did you want to, member Van der Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2072.074s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to also extend our thanks to Charlene Douglas and to the members of the negotiating team. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2080.221s">It's</a>  a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2081.242s">It</a>  was many hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2082.523s">I</a>  remember how many meetings, you know, throughout the summer you guys attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2088.008s">Sometimes</a>  tensions ran high. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2090.288s">But</a>  it is certainly great work and our teachers do great work every day, educating our kids, getting them back into school. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2098.013s">And</a>  Charlene, I personally want to thank you for your leadership and for getting this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2103.877s">So</a>  thank you very much and to your team.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2222.236s">I</a>  think Mr. Greenspan can certainly weigh in on this, but under the AG's guidance, you actually are permitted to take the vote in executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2230.638s">I</a>  promise we would have stopped you <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2234.872s">you</a>  are allowed to vote in executive session provided that you disclose the outcome of that vote as soon as possible, which would be now.</p>
