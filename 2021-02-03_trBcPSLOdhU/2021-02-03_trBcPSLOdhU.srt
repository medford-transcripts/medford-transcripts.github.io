[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Mungo-Kern?

68
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:30,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

69
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the affirmative zero negative, we can now enter executive session.

70
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you be coming out and back in public, Mayor?

71
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:42,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be coming back out in public to adjourn and to report anything out that we choose.

72
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody for your patience.

73
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:21,097
[SPEAKER_03]: We are recording, we are out of executive session and we did take a vote.

74
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:32,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna turn it over to Mr. Murphy to give a brief summary for those who are watching of the memorandum of agreement and then we will announce the vote.

75
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, mayor.

76
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:39,942
[SPEAKER_00]: As the mayor said, the school committee tonight in executive session was considering

77
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:46,830
[SPEAKER_00]: tentative agreement that was reached between the Medford Teachers Association and the Medford Public Schools on January 23rd.

78
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,092
[SPEAKER_00]: This memorandum of agreement governs the working conditions for the 2020-2021 school year and only the 2020-2021 school year.

79
00:29:52,132 --> 00:29:59,495
[SPEAKER_00]: The negotiations began in the summer of 2020 and were pertaining to the restart of school after the shutdown due to the pandemic in the spring of 2020.

80
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:15,224
[SPEAKER_00]: important as was noted to the committee and I know has been shared with the union.

81
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:36,970
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a series of tentative agreements reached in September of 2020 that put the position the district to bring students back into school without objection from the teachers union and the conditions and the circumstances were set that I can say as a member of the negotiating team and I know I speak on behalf of the superintendent and our leadership team that

82
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:43,565
[SPEAKER_00]: put the district in a very positive footing to bring students in.

83
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:51,209
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large, big part of why we've been able to have the amount of in-person instruction that we've been able to have during the course of this year.

84
00:30:51,770 --> 00:31:02,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for that and for all that was achieved during the course of this negotiation, the administration is grateful to the Teachers Union and to the union leadership.

85
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:02,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Ms.

86
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:03,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Douglas is on the call.

87
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,796
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and I imagine members of her team are watching or listening.

88
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:11,419
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say with sincerity to both Ms.

89
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:30,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Douglas and the MTA representative, Mr. Katz, we're grateful to them for their leadership and contributions to what was a constructive dialogue that has led to an agreement that we believe is grounded in the best interests of students and fair to the educators whose work and conditions it will govern.

90
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:35,484
[SPEAKER_00]: The MOA will be available on the district website as a public document effective this vote.

91
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:58,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few highlights that we think are important from the improved, excuse me, the heightened air quality standards that were a key part of bringing students back into school and making sure that educators both were in a working environment that was in fact safe, but also was giving the

92
00:31:58,657 --> 00:32:08,722
[SPEAKER_00]: the peace of mind to combat the very understandable anxiety that all of us are experiencing in the course of this pandemic and having to continue on with our responsibilities and our work.

93
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:24,171
[SPEAKER_00]: The mandatory COVID testing that is taking place as a result of the partnership that the district enjoys with Tufts University and is continuing this week and will continue on for the remainder of this school year.

94
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,412
[SPEAKER_00]: There's important provisions around

95
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:43,434
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that we as a district and in collaboration with our union partners are being mindful and cognizant of the risk of disengagement that we have for all students under these conditions and additional responsibilities that are part of the agreement to that effect.

96
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:55,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of other provisions, including participation in additional information session that we will plan with the union to make sure that parents and family members

97
00:32:55,903 --> 00:33:04,265
[SPEAKER_00]: are given as much information as possible going into the 2021-2022 school year.

98
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:17,247
[SPEAKER_00]: So the administration has recommended the approval of this agreement to the school committee on the basis that, again, we believe it is in the best interest of students and fair to educators.

99
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:23,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reiterate our gratitude to the union for the work that we've engaged in with them over the past several months.

100
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:38,924
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just say as a final comment that I think every MOA, every time that we engage in one of these negotiations, it's either a step backwards or a step forward with regard to the relationship between the district and our bargaining partners.

101
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:44,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in this instance, where we've ultimately landed, it's a step forward.

102
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:53,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that effect, we look forward to engaging with the union as we're now contractually obligated to do on a monthly basis in terms of making sure that

103
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:04,863
[SPEAKER_00]: effectuating our health and safety committee provision that's in the MOA, and also in preparation for additional negotiations that we know will be coming up in the near future.

104
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:18,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that sort of positive, a positive foundation on which to build, and certainly the foundation is long preceded this negotiation, but hopefully it's adding additional layers to that.

105
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:23,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look forward to our continuing work with the Medicare Teachers Association.

106
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy, very well said.

107
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Van der Kloot and then Ms.

108
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Douglas, did you want to, member Van der Kloot?

109
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:39,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just wanted to also extend our thanks to Charlene Douglas and to the members of the negotiating team.

110
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:41,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of work.

111
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:42,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It was many hours.

112
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:47,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember how many meetings, you know, throughout the summer you guys attended.

113
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:49,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes tensions ran high.

114
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is certainly great work and our teachers do great work every day, educating our kids, getting them back into school.

115
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:03,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And Charlene, I personally want to thank you for your leadership and for getting this done.

116
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much and to your team.

117
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

118
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Douglas.

119
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

120
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:16,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the administration working with Mr. Murphy and all the administrative team and members of school committee.

121
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:32,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I too agree that this is a very fair and equitable MOA, and it really has the interest of our students in the city as a whole at heart, safety and various other aspects that Mr. Murphy so elegantly spoke about.

122
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:37,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am pleased with that, that union membership was very pleased.

123
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:43,741
[SPEAKER_01]: We held a ratification meeting for over two hours, went through it with many, many questions.

124
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every member was an attendant at that meeting,

125
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,671
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we held our vote.

126
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:53,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and again, it was a very positive and people feel very, very good about it moving forward.

127
00:35:53,736 --> 00:36:03,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to continue our work with the administration, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Edouard-Vincent, it was well done.

128
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:07,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, yes, well, it was a lot of hours and a lot of time.

129
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's always gonna be a little disagreement.

130
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:15,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we worked well together and I am really pleased that we have found, we have bonded

131
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:16,453
[SPEAKER_01]: with that relationship.

132
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:20,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to working on the health and safety committee as we continue forward.

133
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll have those names to you, hopefully by this evening.

134
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

135
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:25,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Douglas.

136
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:29,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll echo member van de Kloot's sentiments.

137
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I think between the administration and the teachers union and the teachers themselves, everybody had the best interests of the students and obviously employees at the forefront.

138
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really appreciate that.

139
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:43,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to moving forward

140
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're just happy to have our kids back in school.

141
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:48,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thank you very much.

142
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did take a vote.

143
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:52,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

144
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:58,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have to re- Do we vote it in public?

145
00:36:58,455 --> 00:36:59,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have to vote in public, right?

146
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's my question.

147
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:00,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

148
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:10,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mr. Greenspan can certainly weigh in on this, but under the AG's guidance, you actually are permitted to take the vote in executive session.

149
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise we would have stopped you

150
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:22,374
[SPEAKER_00]: you are allowed to vote in executive session provided that you disclose the outcome of that vote as soon as possible, which would be now.

151
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's a motion by member Graham, seconded by- Member Ruseau.

152
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:31,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau to- Member Van der Kloot.

153
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'll let member Van der Kloot.

154
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:38,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a 7-0 vote to accept the MOA.

155
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So that motion has been approved and that will cover the school year 2020 to 2021.

156
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:42,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will cover us through

157
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:45,699
[SPEAKER_03]: June.

158
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

159
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:49,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all.

161
00:37:50,723 --> 00:38:04,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say thank you to Charlene and and the entire negotiating team for getting this done, but also to all the teachers who are showing up under the most extraordinary of circumstances this year.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Graham.

163
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:11,380

164
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:25,957

[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all set mayor.

166
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,781

00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the leadership of Charlene Douglas, all the members that participated in the negotiations that brought us to this point, but also to just formally acknowledge and thank the hard work that's happening with all the teachers.

170
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:58,506
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that Medford Public Schools has students participating in in-person instruction from pre-K to 12 is a wonderful accomplishment.

171
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to say thank you for the support and thank you for all that you are doing working together on behalf of the students in Medford.

172
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:11,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just add my congratulations once again.

173
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:11,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

174
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

175
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will adjourn.

[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you are on the right.

180
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:29,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, no, I didn't wanna, I don't wanna repeat what everyone else said.

181
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:41,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say, getting the most vulnerable students in on a four day schedule as early as was done comparatively to so many other districts around us is so appreciated.

182
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:49,185
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there are many, many families that are very grateful for that having happened as early as it did in the negotiation.

183
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:50,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So just wanted to echo that as well.
