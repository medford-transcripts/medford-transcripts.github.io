00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:02,693
Adorable.

00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,654
Yeah, we're loving her.

4
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:07,155
That's great.

5
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:12,178
I rile her up in the morning and then try to get her not to bite me.

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,180
You have any scars yet?

00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:20,883

00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:25,566

Oh, member Russo.

31
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,379
I think we have to take attendance before we can do that.

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,580
Member McLaughlin, sorry.

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,681
Thank you, yes.

34
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:23,263

Yes, here.

38
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:30,886

00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,671
We're all here.

43
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:45,751
Yep.

44
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:54,455
Motion to enter executive session by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kratz.

45
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:55,055
Roll call.

46
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,136
Uh, member Kratz here.

47
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,777
Yes, member Graham.

48
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:07,297
You guys see Jenny at my screen?

49
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:07,838
I can't see her.

50
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:09,898
I can see her.

51
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:11,479
Jenny, can you hear?

52
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:12,719
My apologies.

53
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,240
I had not made her a co-host.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,780
That's on me.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:14,940
OK.

56
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:19,221
Member Grant?

57
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:19,821
Yes.

58
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:20,662
Yes.

59
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:21,422
Member McLaughlin?

60
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:21,722
Yes.

61
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,522
Member McStone?

62
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,242
Yes.

63
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:24,683
Member Russo?

64
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:24,823
Yes.

65
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,184
Member Van de Kloop?

66
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:27,804
Yes.

67
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:30,345
Mayor Mungo-Kern?

68
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:30,865
Yes.

69
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,984
So having the affirmative zero negative, we can now enter executive session.

70
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,728
Would you be coming out and back in public, Mayor?

71
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:42,881
We'll be coming back out in public to adjourn and to report anything out that we choose.

72
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,335
Thank you everybody for your patience.

73
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:21,097
We are recording, we are out of executive session and we did take a vote.

74
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm gonna turn it over to Mr. Murphy to give a brief summary for those who are watching of the memorandum of agreement and then we will announce the vote.

75
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,021
Thank you, mayor.

76
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:39,942
As the mayor said, the school committee tonight in executive session was considering

77
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:46,830
tentative agreement that was reached between the Medford Teachers Association and the Medford Public Schools on January 23rd.

78
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,092
This memorandum of agreement governs the working conditions for the 2020-2021 school year and only the 2020-2021 school year.

79
00:29:52,132 --> 00:29:59,495
The negotiations began in the summer of 2020 and were pertaining to the restart of school after the shutdown due to the pandemic in the spring of 2020.

80
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:15,224
important as was noted to the committee and I know has been shared with the union.

81
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:36,970
There were a series of tentative agreements reached in September of 2020 that put the position the district to bring students back into school without objection from the teachers union and the conditions and the circumstances were set that I can say as a member of the negotiating team and I know I speak on behalf of the superintendent and our leadership team that

82
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:43,565
put the district in a very positive footing to bring students in.

83
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:51,209
It's a large, big part of why we've been able to have the amount of in-person instruction that we've been able to have during the course of this year.

84
00:30:51,770 --> 00:31:02,355
And so for that and for all that was achieved during the course of this negotiation, the administration is grateful to the Teachers Union and to the union leadership.

85
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:02,875
I know Ms.

86
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:03,876
Douglas is on the call.

87
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,796
here, and I imagine members of her team are watching or listening.

88
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:11,419
And I can say with sincerity to both Ms.

89
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:30,356
Douglas and the MTA representative, Mr. Katz, we're grateful to them for their leadership and contributions to what was a constructive dialogue that has led to an agreement that we believe is grounded in the best interests of students and fair to the educators whose work and conditions it will govern.

90
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:35,484
The MOA will be available on the district website as a public document effective this vote.

91
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:58,220
And there are a few highlights that we think are important from the improved, excuse me, the heightened air quality standards that were a key part of bringing students back into school and making sure that educators both were in a working environment that was in fact safe, but also was giving the

92
00:31:58,657 --> 00:32:08,722
the peace of mind to combat the very understandable anxiety that all of us are experiencing in the course of this pandemic and having to continue on with our responsibilities and our work.

93
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:24,171
The mandatory COVID testing that is taking place as a result of the partnership that the district enjoys with Tufts University and is continuing this week and will continue on for the remainder of this school year.

94
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,412
There's important provisions around

95
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:43,434
making sure that we as a district and in collaboration with our union partners are being mindful and cognizant of the risk of disengagement that we have for all students under these conditions and additional responsibilities that are part of the agreement to that effect.

96
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:55,377
And a number of other provisions, including participation in additional information session that we will plan with the union to make sure that parents and family members

97
00:32:55,903 --> 00:33:04,265
are given as much information as possible going into the 2021-2022 school year.

98
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:17,247
So the administration has recommended the approval of this agreement to the school committee on the basis that, again, we believe it is in the best interest of students and fair to educators.

99
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:23,588
I'll reiterate our gratitude to the union for the work that we've engaged in with them over the past several months.

100
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:38,924
And I would just say as a final comment that I think every MOA, every time that we engage in one of these negotiations, it's either a step backwards or a step forward with regard to the relationship between the district and our bargaining partners.

101
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:44,688
And I think in this instance, where we've ultimately landed, it's a step forward.

102
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:53,514
And to that effect, we look forward to engaging with the union as we're now contractually obligated to do on a monthly basis in terms of making sure that

103
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:04,863
effectuating our health and safety committee provision that's in the MOA, and also in preparation for additional negotiations that we know will be coming up in the near future.

104
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:18,107
So with that sort of positive, a positive foundation on which to build, and certainly the foundation is long preceded this negotiation, but hopefully it's adding additional layers to that.

105
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:23,228
And we look forward to our continuing work with the Medicare Teachers Association.

106
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,468
Thank you, Mr. Murphy, very well said.

107
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,852
Member Van de Kloet and then Ms.

108
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,753
Douglas, did you want to, member Van de Kloet?

109
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:39,821
Yes, I just wanted to also extend our thanks to Charlene Douglas and to the members of the negotiating team.

110
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:41,182
It's a lot of work.

111
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:42,363
It was many hours.

112
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:47,248
I remember how many meetings, you know, throughout the summer you guys attended.

113
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:49,450
Sometimes tensions ran high.

114
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:57,513
But it is certainly great work and our teachers do great work every day, educating our kids, getting them back into school.

115
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:03,597
And Charlene, I personally want to thank you for your leadership and for getting this done.

116
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,078
So thank you very much and to your team.

117
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,240
Ms.

118
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,740
Douglas.

119
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,681
Thank you.

120
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:16,265
I want to thank the administration working with Mr. Murphy and all the administrative team and members of school committee.

121
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:32,855
I too agree that this is a very fair and equitable MOA, and it really has the interest of our students in the city as a whole at heart, safety and various other aspects that Mr. Murphy so elegantly spoke about.

122
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:37,057
So I am pleased with that, that union membership was very pleased.

123
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:43,741
We held a ratification meeting for over two hours, went through it with many, many questions.

124
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,383
Almost every member was an attendant at that meeting,

125
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,671
and then we held our vote.

126
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:53,415
So, and again, it was a very positive and people feel very, very good about it moving forward.

127
00:35:53,736 --> 00:36:03,383
And I look forward to continue our work with the administration, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Edward Vincent, it was well done.

128
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:07,547
And it was, yes, well, it was a lot of hours and a lot of time.

129
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,468
And of course, there's always gonna be a little disagreement.

130
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:15,073
I think we worked well together and I am really pleased that we have found, we have bonded

131
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:16,453
with that relationship.

132
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:20,915
And I look forward to working on the health and safety committee as we continue forward.

133
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,976
And I'll have those names to you, hopefully by this evening.

134
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,516
Thank you, Ms.

135
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:25,897
Douglas.

136
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:29,778
And I'll echo member van de Kloot's sentiments.

137
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:40,562
I think between the administration and the teachers union and the teachers themselves, everybody had the best interests of the students and obviously employees at the forefront.

138
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,262
And we really appreciate that.

139
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:43,663
And we look forward to moving forward

140
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,772
and we're just happy to have our kids back in school.

141
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:48,093
So we thank you very much.

142
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:49,873
And we did take a vote.

143
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:52,414
Member Graham?

144
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:58,135
Do I have to re- Do we vote it in public?

145
00:36:58,455 --> 00:36:59,635
I think we have to vote in public, right?

146
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:00,635
I think that's my question.

147
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:00,935
Thank you.

148
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:10,617
I think Mr. Greenspan can certainly weigh in on this, but under the AG's guidance, you actually are permitted to take the vote in executive session.

149
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,578
I promise we would have stopped you

150
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:22,374
you are allowed to vote in executive session provided that you disclose the outcome of that vote as soon as possible, which would be now.

151
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:28,355
Yes, there's a motion by member Graham, seconded by- Member Russo.

152
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:31,455
Member Russo to- Member Vander Kloot.

153
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,556
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll let member Vander Kloot.

154
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:38,217
It was a 7-0 vote to accept the MOA.

155
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,877
So that motion has been approved and that will cover the school year 2020 to 2021.

156
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:42,858
So that will cover us through

157
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:45,699
June.

158
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:48,742
So thank you.

159
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:49,282
Thank you all.

160
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:49,783
Member Graham.

161
00:37:50,723 --> 00:38:04,735
I just wanted to say thank you to Charlene and and the entire negotiating team for getting this done, but also to all the teachers who are showing up under the most extraordinary of circumstances this year.

162
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:08,157
Thank you, Member Graham.

163
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:11,380
Member McStone, then Dr. Edward Vincent.

164
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:25,957
Okay.

165
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,360
I'm all set mayor.

166
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,781
Thank you.

167
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:30,769
Talk to Edward Vincent.

168
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,184
Yes, I just wanted to echo the thanks.

169
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:48,437
Thank you to the leadership of Charlene Douglas, all the members that participated in the negotiations that brought us to this point, but also to just formally acknowledge and thank the hard work that's happening with all the teachers.

170
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:58,506
The fact that Medford Public Schools has students participating in in-person instruction from pre-K to 12 is a wonderful accomplishment.

171
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:06,893
And I just wanted to say thank you for the support and thank you for all that you are doing working together on behalf of the students in Medford.

172
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:11,196
And so I just add my congratulations once again.

173
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:11,917
Thank you.

174
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:16,360
Thank you.

175
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,421
So this will adjourn.

176
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,822
We'll motion to adjourn.

177
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:21,364
I know we have a regularly scheduled meeting.

178
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:22,946
I have my hand up.

179
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:25,548
Oh, you are on the right.

180
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:29,353
Sorry, no, I didn't wanna, I don't wanna repeat what everyone else said.

181
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:41,780
I just wanted to say, getting the most vulnerable students in on a four day schedule as early as was done comparatively to so many other districts around us is so appreciated.

182
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:49,185
And I know that there are many, many families that are very grateful for that having happened as early as it did in the negotiation.

183
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:50,946
So just wanted to echo that as well.

184
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:51,926
Thank you, Charlene.

185
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,788
Thank you to the team and to the teachers.

186
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:56,009
Thank you, member McLaughlin.

187
00:39:57,246 --> 00:40:04,049
I'm not sure if there's any other meetings this week, but I know we have our regularly scheduled meeting on Monday at 6 p.m.

188
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,430
We're gonna have a Committee of the Whole at 5 p.m.

189
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,611
that night to go into executive session on a couple things.

190
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:17,154
And then we're also potentially gonna have Wednesday the 10th, if everybody wants to put in their calendar, a Committee of the Whole meeting.

191
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:25,918
And then we will be scheduling the Columbus School renaming for some time at one of the Committee Whole meetings, March dates.

192
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:32,193
I know they'll be under old business on Monday, but we are going to try to schedule that in March.

193
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:33,654
So I just want to give everybody the heads up.

194
00:40:33,714 --> 00:40:35,115
We're working on those few things.

195
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,676
Have a great night.

196
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:37,517
