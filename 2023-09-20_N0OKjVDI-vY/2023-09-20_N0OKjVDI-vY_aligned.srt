00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,496
Hello, happy Monday, and this is Brianna Lungu-Kern, Mayor of Medford, just here with some good news.

2
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:11,323
First up, if you've been up to Wright's Pond, you will notice that the art mural is pretty much complete.

3
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,708
Our artist, Jamie Chan, has been working on that over the last several weeks.

4
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:16,810
It looks amazing.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,640
So please go check it out.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,281
And if you haven't got your pass to the to the pond, please do so.

7
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:24,442
And then Tufts pool is also open for use.

8
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:31,344
Also, there's a free summer park program put on by recreation from 7-11 to August 15th at Hormel.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:31,984
It's 9 to 12.

10
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,047
That's in the morning, so go check it out.

11
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:43,091
And from July 12th to August 16th, it's at Tufts Park from 9 a.m.

12
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:43,892
to 12 p.m.

13
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:47,035
Also, Medford Recreation is putting on its movie nights.

14
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,577
There'll be a series of three movies on

15
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:54,257
was one Friday and our second one is on July 21st.

16
00:00:54,657 --> 00:01:00,340
That's at Tufts Park and the third is on August 18th which is at Wright's Pond.

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,842
So you get there around 7 30 you set up and the movie starts right at 8 30.

18
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:05,462
So please join us.

19
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:08,984
Also we are doing a lot of work on our streets.

20
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,665
We have almost 50 streets that we're patchworking.

21
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:16,528
You'll see that work was done recently on Lawrence Road and we have another

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,210
30, 40 to go.

23
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:24,694
We also got bids back for the remaining crack seal projects that we're working on.

24
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:25,994
That's 94 streets.

25
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:34,518
So we're doing about 150 streets just with patchwork and crack sealing over the next several months, which is very exciting and well needed.

26
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,740
Also good news on some of our park projects.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
We have Gillis Park.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,502
We are breaking ground on that mid to end of July.

29
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:48,793
We have Car Park that's going to be late July, early August, that will break ground on phase one.

30
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:52,817
Morrison Park will be done at the end of August.

31
00:01:53,177 --> 00:02:03,348
And then Hickey Park, because we needed time to let the pavement settle, those basketball courts and tennis courts will be done end of August, beginning of September.

32
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:09,456
And then also great news, a lot of people ask all the time, Riverside Ave is in bad shape.

33
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:16,823
So we were repaving, milling and paving and doing a lot of the additional work that's needed on that road.

34
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:22,628
That will be done, hopefully start next week and take several weeks to complete.

35
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:26,351
And things are a little bit delayed because of the rain.

36
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:31,215
So just keep an eye out that any projects that we have going on are a bit delayed due to the rain.

37
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:35,820
But as you can see, a lot in the works, a lot is going on in this city.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,544
And we're super excited and thankful for all the hardworking employees that are making it happen.

39
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:44,988
Otherwise, have a wonderful, great week and talk soon.
