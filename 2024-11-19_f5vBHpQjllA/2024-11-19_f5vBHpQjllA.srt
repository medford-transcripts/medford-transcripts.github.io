[SPEAKER_13]: motions orders and resolutions to zero dash 328 offer by console and I be a result that the method city council be provided with the monthly progress reports from the city administration on the status of all draft ordinances requested by the council console tonight.

27
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

28
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a rather self explanatory ordinance.

29
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,993
[SPEAKER_00]: two thirds of the way through the second quarter of the calendar year.

31
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:54,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the first five or six meetings that the city council assembled we had requested draft ordinances related to a number of issues that are

32
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,989
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting our community, issues that we need to take a look at.

33
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:04,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And the council initiated as prerogative to look at these by way of ordinance.

34
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:13,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a discussion about whether or not the council would have the right and ability to hire its own attorney to work on this stuff.

35
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:20,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are, some almost five, almost six months later, Mr. President, and we still haven't gotten one draft ordinance back.

36
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:32,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I bring this resolution forward asking that we get monthly progress reports from the administration as to the status of the requested draft ordinances that the council seeks.

37
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:35,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this measure.

38
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:37,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

39
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

40
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:40,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

41
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, did you have a question or were you just seconding the resolution?

42
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I second the amendment, the motion.

43
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:48,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

44
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:52,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the public or clerk or to be is do we receive any emails.

45
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no email on this topic.

46
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Council night.

47
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:11,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, I do think it's important that we also get a copy of the contract that was signed with KP Laura I believe we requested that a number of occasions and we still have not received that yet to determine what the scope of services.

48
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward we know what resources are available to us.

49
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, you broke up on me a little bit.

50
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you offering that as an amendment?

51
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, Mr. President.

52
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:25,515
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a resolution that's been offered a number of times in the past and has gone unanswered.

53
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:28,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

54
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,145
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Knight.

55
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

56
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

57
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:41,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

58
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

59
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:42,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

60
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:43,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

61
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:43,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

62
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:44,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

63
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:45,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

64
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:45,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

65
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:45,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

66
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:46,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

67
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:16,531
[SPEAKER_13]: We have resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the mayor meet with the council president to develop a plan to safely hold pre-budget and budget hearings in a non-virtual setting.

68
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Council on the night.

69
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

70
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:30,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Although technology is wonderful, it's not so wonderful sometimes when we're trying to conduct the efficient operation of government.

71
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:49,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think that we're at a point right now where we understand COVID-19 and the coronavirus to ensure that we're protected and meet in a non-virtual setting to address the very important issue of the city's finances in the upcoming budget for the fiscal year.

72
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:52,647
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

73
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:57,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Although virtual meetings are great, I don't think that they have the same.

74
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:06,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we lost Councilor Knight.

75
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:11,995
[SPEAKER_13]: We had number two, Vice President Caraviello, you wanted to speak on this if you could.

76
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:12,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

77
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:13,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

78
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:19,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I had made a suggestion to you I think some time back on a setting that we could probably do.

79
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:26,427
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably use the little theater at the high school and place the Councilors on the stage six feet apart.

80
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:37,413
[SPEAKER_05]: the whoever department head would be down on the floor and whoever's representing the administration could be down on the floor and the clerk.

81
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:40,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would make 10 people which would be allowed by law.

82
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:50,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, like I said, this is probably the most important budget that the city's faced in the last 30 years.

83
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:55,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as we all know, just being on these meetings

84
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:05,046
[SPEAKER_05]: with simple stuff is difficult, nevermind things as difficult as a budget that really should be done in person.

85
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:08,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So I offered that as a suggestion.

86
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:16,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the little theater is plenty big enough to put everybody on stage and keep it within the 10 people as required by law.

87
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

88
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:21,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

89
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:37,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think my question just got addressed I was just trying to identify whether there was idea of any in person public participation but this is solely to clarify for the council and then any representatives, relative to their specific budgets that would be presented, correct.

90
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:41,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Council night.

91
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:47,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the way I envisioned it is that we can all be in a room.

92
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,807
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting the business of the city.

93
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:59,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And if individual residents have questions or concerns, I do believe based upon your leadership, we've been able to enable some video conferencing in certain areas.

94
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:03,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that could transcend over to the little theater or to other aspects.

95
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:05,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Our community media center is very successful.

96
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:06,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick Gordon's done a great job.

97
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,496
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an award-winning producer that we have over here.

98
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that if we put our heads together, we'll be able to come up with something.

99
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:19,518
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at the resolution, the resolution is to ask the President and the Mayor to meet and discuss ways that we can do this.

100
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:23,121
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should have everything on the table, Mr. President, and come up with something that works for all.

101
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:24,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

102
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:26,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

103
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:29,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell, did you have any further questions?

104
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:30,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Did that answer your question?

105
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:31,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, that covered it.

106
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:31,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

107
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

108
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the Council?

109
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,713
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will be more than happy to talk with the mayor to see if that's something that we can do, see if it's feasible.

110
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:49,735
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can reach out to her to discuss that and we can go from there.

111
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other questions from the council?

112
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the public?

113
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk Cardavis, any emails regarding this issue?

114
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:06,382
[SPEAKER_14]: No emails on this, Mr. President.

115
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:12,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

116
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:15,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

117
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

118
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

119
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

120
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:26,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

121
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:28,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

122
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

123
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:30,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

124
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:31,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

125
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:32,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

126
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:33,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

127
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:34,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

128
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:35,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

129
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

130
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,450
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco?

131
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

132
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

133
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:57,617
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-0-330 offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council address the issues at Oak Grove Cemetery with people abusing the social criteria imposed by the city administration and potential safety issues.

134
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:58,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello?

135
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:00,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:08,968
[SPEAKER_05]: When I had put this on there, there were some issues over there, and I had talked to the chief of staff and the mayor about this.

137
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:17,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad that the mayor did put out a robo call over the weekend addressing what was going on over there.

138
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:27,734
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you who don't know, our cemetery is nice as it is, but I don't think it was meant to be a playground for people to go there and play.

139
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:31,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Children were running over the graves and running, riding their bikes.

140
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:37,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And the day before someone is buried, they usually dig the hole and put plywood over it.

141
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And the kids were jumping on the wood.

142
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd hate to see somebody, a child, get hurt over there.

143
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:48,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And also due to the fact, there's a lot of cars driving, heavy equipment.

144
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:56,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the people that are over there, maybe their driving skills have been a little bit diminished over the years.

145
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:01,935
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a young kid rides out on his bike and someone may not see them.

146
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I'd hate to see someone get hurt over there.

147
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:10,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad the mayor took the steps to get this done.

148
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the weekend, there wasn't many people there.

149
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,626
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank her for that.

150
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:21,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I say, the problem has hopefully been eliminated.

151
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:24,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

152
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:28,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

153
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:38,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I live, I can see that gate to the cemetery from my front stairs, and the amount of volume of people that are going through there is tremendous right now.

154
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you

155
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:44,714
[SPEAKER_00]: see the faces, they're not familiar faces.

156
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:56,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of out-of-state license plates parking along, out-of-city license, out-of-city stickers, out-of-city people parking along Placeland Road, utilizing the cemetery for open space because the parks and their communities have been closed down too.

157
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:12,194
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we utilize it quite frequently for passive recreation purposes, but it's getting to the point now where I've had discussions with operators of heavy equipment that work in the DPW that have said that they're being approached

158
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:15,897
[SPEAKER_00]: by people saying, can you not drive the bulldozer down this street?

159
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want my kid to ride the bike down here.

160
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,259
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have a job to do as well.

161
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:26,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So I too echo councilor Caraviello's sentiment statements and I support his resolution wholeheartedly and second it.

162
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:28,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you councilor Light.

163
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:29,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

164
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a separate, nevermind.

165
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

166
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:36,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

167
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:38,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the council?

168
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the general public?

169
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Hernebies, can you let us know if you've received any emails?

170
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this topic.

171
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:50,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Clerk Hernebies.

172
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:55,585
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

173
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Hernebies, please call the roll.

174
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears?

175
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:02,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

176
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:03,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

177
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

178
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

179
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:12,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

180
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:13,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell?

181
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:14,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

182
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:15,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

183
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

184
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,626
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco?

185
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:18,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

186
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:20,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

187
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,509
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

188
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:30,916
[SPEAKER_13]: 20-331 offered by Councilor Bears, being resolved that the city administration provide an update on how residents can receive masks purchased by the city.

189
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

190
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:34,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

191
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:43,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some information has gone out from the city since I filed this resolution.

192
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:49,674
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that we have joined in regional compact, brought some masks in and we're distributing them.

193
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:55,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that Chief of Staff Rodriguez could share what the plan is for that.

194
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

195
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:01,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's unmute him.

196
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:10,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

197
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I promise to keep my remarks G rated.

198
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:22,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, the city was able to purchase 10,000 masks, of which 5,000 will be distributed at a drive-through this Thursday.

199
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:26,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Between 12 and two, it's available to all Medford residents.

200
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:32,757
[SPEAKER_10]: We're packaging up in Ziploc bags with three masks each, and we'll distribute as many as we can.

201
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:37,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Supplies, of course, are limited, but we'll be handing them out until we're out.

202
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,441
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll also be able to, we were also,

203
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:45,164
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a gifted number of plants from Encore Boston Harbor, about 1,000 different plants.

204
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,766
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be distributing those as well ahead of Mother's Day.

205
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:52,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do have volunteers who are going to be working there down at Hormel Stadium between 12 and 2.

206
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,253
[SPEAKER_10]: We're excited to be able to provide the resource as well as the benefit of the flowers to the public.

207
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:00,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, supplies are limited.

208
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,335
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a first come, first served basis.

209
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:04,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

210
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:05,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

211
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:06,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Dave.

212
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

213
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:15,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to be the first of hopefully many or is this just as far as we've gotten in the planning right now?

214
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:16,795
[SPEAKER_10]: We hope so.

215
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:28,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, as we all know, stuff like this is very hard to come by, but we're doing the best we can to try to track it down for the protection of first responders, as well as the general public.

216
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,160
[SPEAKER_10]: These are non-surgical masks, these are just face coverings.

217
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,461
[SPEAKER_10]: so they would not be appropriate in a medical setting or a first responder setting.

218
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:46,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are designed to comply with the standing Medford order that's been in place for about three and a half weeks, as well as the governor's order, which echoes our order starting tomorrow.

219
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:59,305
[SPEAKER_10]: So the 5,000 of which will be distributed at the drive-through, the other 5,000 will be available for senior citizens at the senior center and to other vulnerable populations to deliver, as well as DPW and some other public employees.

220
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:02,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.

221
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

222
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:06,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

223
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:16,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I was curious if Chief of Staff Rodriguez could clarify, are these like cotton washable masks or the single-use masks, if you could just provide a little information.

224
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:18,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so they're not the washable fabric ones.

225
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:26,197
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the disposable kind of medical paper ones that are suitable for everyday face coverings.

226
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:34,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're a little better than the fabric ones in terms of face coverings, but they don't reach the N95 or the medical grade.

227
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:42,510
[SPEAKER_12]: And will information be provided as far as, I guess, the recommended number of uses of this type of mask?

228
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, some guidance will be included within each packet by the board.

229
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:52,008
[SPEAKER_10]: appropriate amount of time to wear them.

230
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:55,610
[SPEAKER_10]: How many times you can wear them and the appropriate amount of use.

231
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:57,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

232
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:05,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the council?

233
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:06,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions from the public?

234
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:24,511
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of the Council of Beers, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to receive a place on file.

235
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:26,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, please call the roll.

236
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:34,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Hang on.

237
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:39,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

238
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:40,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

239
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

240
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

241
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

242
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:44,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

243
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

244
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:46,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

245
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:47,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

246
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:47,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

247
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

248
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

249
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:51,252
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco.

250
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:58,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

251
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,834
[SPEAKER_13]: 20-332 offered by Councilor Bears be it resolved.

252
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:06,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, we have a couple of similar resolutions offered by Councilor Bears and Councilor Marks.

253
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:13,487
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will read them both now, if you wouldn't mind.

254
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:24,773
[SPEAKER_13]: 20-332 offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Lieutenant Michael Endicott on his retirement from the Medford Fire Department after 32 years of service to the city of Medford.

255
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:35,859
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also have 20-334 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Lieutenant Michael Endicott on his retirement

256
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:42,621
[SPEAKER_13]: after an exemplary 32 years of dedicated service to the residents of Medford.

257
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:44,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

258
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

259
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:59,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think this is a good story and a bad time of someone who's served the city for so long and has retired with such honor.

260
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:04,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be happy though to defer to Council Dean Marks to start this off.

261
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Dean of the delegation, Councilor Marks.

262
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:11,816
[SPEAKER_11]: In length of service, not age, by the way.

263
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:31,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Endicott, anyone that knows Lieutenant Mike Endicott, he is a tremendous firefighter, led by example, well liked among his peers, was the first to volunteer for anything going on in the community.

264
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:39,762
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, from what I hear from other firefighters, he would be someone that you'd want to go to a fire with.

265
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:42,022
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the type of firefighter Mike was.

266
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:45,643
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a terrific husband, a great father.

267
00:19:46,183 --> 00:20:04,066
[SPEAKER_11]: a family man, and I wish him well, Mr. President, on his retirement and want to thank him on behalf of the residents of this community for the exemplary service for 32 years for the life and property of Method residents.

268
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:05,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

269
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Locks.

270
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:08,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears?

271
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:10,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I just want to second that.

272
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:15,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Lieutenant Endicott, but from everything I've heard and everything I've seen,

273
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:19,269
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just been a great service to the people of Medford.

274
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:23,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important for us to highlight small positives in this time.

275
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

276
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:28,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else?

277
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, if I may?

278
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:31,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Councilor Light.

279
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

280
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:38,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten to know Mike over the years, and I'll tell you, he's just someone you like to be around.

281
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:45,660
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a soft-spoken guy, a gentleman, and I really just want to congratulate him on his 32 years of service.

282
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:50,201
[SPEAKER_00]: and wish him all the best as he pursues his golden years.

283
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:59,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to point out that right around the same time that Lieutenant Endicott retired with 32 years of service, he also turned 65 years of age.

284
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:11,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. President, that'll tell you that half of this gentleman's life was spent providing service and public safety to the city of Medford and its residents.

285
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:15,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's certainly commendable, and I wish him all the best moving forward.

286
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:17,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

287
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:39,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I may add, I didn't meet Michael until I was actually gone out to the city council, but Lieutenant Endicott is a great person, very committed to the community and like to thank him for his continuous commitment to the city of Medford and to the highest service.

288
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:43,679
[SPEAKER_13]: So we thank him for his many years of service to our city.

289
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,620
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Lieutenant Endicott.

290
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:47,839

[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Bears.

292
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:55,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

293
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:57,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just need to clarify.

294
00:21:57,906 --> 00:22:01,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you joining 332 and 334 together as one paper?

295
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:05,570
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's okay with my fellow councilors, I'd like to do that.

296
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:06,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

297

[SPEAKER_04]: So this is on 332 and 334.

00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:12,535

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:18,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

307
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:19,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

308
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:20,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

309
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:21,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell?

310
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:22,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

311
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:23,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

312
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:24,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

313
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco?

314
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:26,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

315
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:29,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

316
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:41,417
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-0-333 offered by Councilor Bears be a result that the Medford City Council dedicate this meeting to the residents and families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus crisis.

317
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:42,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears?

318
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:47,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

319
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:56,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're all starting to process just the amount of people that we know that we're losing.

320
00:22:56,845 --> 00:23:03,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think anything hits home more than the stories that are out today around the courtyard facility here in Medford.

321
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:13,355
[SPEAKER_01]: The projections are that we're losing 2,000 people a day across the country and hundreds of people

322
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:38,257
[SPEAKER_01]: a day in massachusetts and um, I think We just need to take every moment when we're together such as it is on zoom and and the other ways that we're communicating right now to really um, just to say talk about this to to mention and and uh honor and and Think about the folks who who we've lost and the families that are impacted.

323
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:38,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Um

324
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:46,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any of us have the answers as to what this means for us as a country to see so many people dying so fast.

325
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:52,711
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we need to start the conversation just honoring and remembering these folks we've lost.

326
00:23:52,751 --> 00:24:03,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that going forward, we can think about the ways that we're going to remember the people who we're losing to this coronavirus crisis right now.

327
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:19,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just hoping that my fellow Councilors will join with me in dedicating this meeting to, to the folks that we've lost in their families and hopefully going forward we can we can talk more about how we're going to, how we're going to work through this as a community.

328
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's why I put this resolution forward.

329
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:22,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

330
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Councilor Bears.

331
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello and then Councilor Knight.

332
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:29,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello.

333
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:30,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

334
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:34,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank Councilor Bears for putting this on.

335
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:46,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I've done in the last three weeks, I've tried to do our best to make mention every week of those who have passed and we'll continue to do so going forward.

336
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:53,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully this will pass at some point, we'll finally be able to start doing this.

337
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:57,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, and I second that motion.

338
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:00,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

339
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

340
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:26,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank Councilor Bears for bringing this measure forward and him bringing up the Courtyard nursing home and the circumstances surrounding that raised further concern and, you know, with everything that's going on in the community and all the discussions and talks and rumors about what's going on,

341
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:34,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important that we really take a long, hard look at the circumstances and situation that's been surrounding the courtyard nursing home.

342
00:25:35,974 --> 00:25:46,360
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from what I understand, I think the Holyoke Soldier's Home has the highest rate of infection for nursing homes in the state, and the courtyard isn't too far behind it.

343
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:53,545
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, my understanding that various federal and state entities have reached out

344
00:25:54,792 --> 00:26:00,456
[SPEAKER_00]: some help and some planning to prevent the further spread of COVID and were turned away.

345
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:04,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumors, I don't know if there's any truth to it, but we had the chief of staff here.

346
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:11,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he can, you know, explain to us a little bit about what circumstances had happened, when and where, who knew what, when and what was happening.

347
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:22,012
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest I heard was that the Army National Guard had offered its services to help with the circumstances at the courtyard.

348
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:22,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the,

349
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,511
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteerism was refused.

350
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:36,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that, you know, we really need to take a long hard look at it, but first and foremost, um, you know, I'm not one that usually chases rumors down and we have the cheapest staff this evening with us right now.

351
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:44,436
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can put it into that, uh, you know, rumor mill discussion that's been going on around the community, because if that is factual, then it's very concerning to me.

352
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:49,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President, I do raise the question, um, you know, what's,

353
00:26:50,050 --> 00:27:00,278
[SPEAKER_00]: what circumstances are going on at the courtyard that the city has been involved in, and what steps have been taken to help them address the issue there.

354
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:09,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And was any state or federal body extending help that was refused by the administration of the city during this time?

355
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:10,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the questions that I have.

356
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:12,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Dave can help us out with this a little bit.

357
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

358
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:17,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on.

359
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

360
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:27,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, thank you, Councilor Bears, for highlighting this issue.

361
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,416
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is something that we've been focused on since the...

362
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:38,610
[SPEAKER_10]: opening days of the pandemic, especially in our most vulnerable locations, the long-term care facilities, the nursing homes, of which Medford has three.

363
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:56,025
[SPEAKER_10]: From the first case that we learned of at Courtyard, we mobilized immediately to try to advocate for them and get additional resources from the state level, both from the Department of Public Health, as well as the National Guard, to get them testing, to get them staffing help,

364
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:59,790
[SPEAKER_10]: to get them whatever resources they may need in order to combat it.

365
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:11,507
[SPEAKER_10]: The unfortunate reality is that this is, these are our most vulnerable populations that are all living in one place in the serious nature of the virus, in the contagious nature of the virus itself.

366
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,869
[SPEAKER_10]: it will spread in a place like this like wildfire.

367
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:22,313
[SPEAKER_10]: So getting them PPE, getting them testing, getting them staffing as appropriate was an immediate concern of ours.

368
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:30,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the mayor has been in constant contact with Secretary Sutter's office, the command center, the National Guard, Tom Mangan from MEMA.

369
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:35,540
[SPEAKER_10]: the Lieutenant Governor calling anybody and anybody in order to get resources there.

370
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:46,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any direct knowledge that Courtyard either turned down the circumstances of which the National Guard was there, and they turned away services, the nature of that, the circumstances of that.

371
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:55,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably refer the question to Genesis and to Courtyard for the circumstances of that, as well as DPH, because I don't wanna talk out of school.

372
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:56,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't there, I didn't see it.

373
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I can say is that the city has taken

374
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:10,051
[SPEAKER_10]: every step it could possibly take to advocate for these residents, for these patients to get resources to these facilities in order to help them.

375
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:23,855
[SPEAKER_10]: The National Guard has been to Medford no fewer than six or seven times to do testing, multiple rounds of testing, testing patients, testing staff, testing administrators, whatever we can do in order to do that, we've done.

376
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:26,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm confident in the city's

377
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:30,823
[SPEAKER_10]: confident in the city's response to the problem.

378
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:33,404
[SPEAKER_10]: If there was more we could have done, we would have certainly done it.

379
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:44,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But connecting the resources to those that could provide it, the DPHs and the National Guards of the world is exactly what we should have done and exactly what we did.

380
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:48,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, I thank Mr. Rodriguez for that breakdown.

381
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:56,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to propose a B paper requesting that the administration provide us with a timeline of events and a breakdown of those discussions.

382
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:04,684
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to what services and assistances were offered and which ones were accepted and rendered.

383
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,685
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd offer that in the form of a B paper, Mr. President.

384
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:09,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

385
00:30:10,947 --> 00:30:14,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Arnaviz, before we move any further, do you have the language in the B paper?

386
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:18,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I do.

387
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:20,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

388
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:23,598
[SPEAKER_13]: There were a number of people that wanted to speak.

389
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:27,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello, then Councilor Markson, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Caraviello.

390
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:28,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

391
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:36,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, you know, having a loved one right now in one of those facilities, I can speak firsthand about them.

392
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:43,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these facilities are at their best on a good day, somewhat marginal.

393
00:30:44,396 --> 00:31:11,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, i've noticed the difference Um where my dad and my dad's at glenridge where the situation is only slightly better there than it is up at uh courtyard and that's also owned by genesis and i've talked to many people uh at at glenridge since genesis has brought has taken them over along with the courtyard and uh, i'm i'm gonna fall genesis a little bit on this, uh, because

394
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:19,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Staffing has gone down, and the level of care has gone down since Genesis has taken these facilities over.

395
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:24,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's say, I know the mayor has done everything she's could.

396
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's only so much that the administration can do.

397
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,551
[SPEAKER_05]: These are private facilities.

398
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:34,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, people that are in these facilities, a lot of them are sick, and they're frail.

399
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:42,066
[SPEAKER_05]: it's very hard to take someone that has Alzheimer's or dementia and ask them to stay in their room.

400
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:46,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, every day they're herded into this common area where they eat and convene.

401
00:31:46,951 --> 00:31:49,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I say it just festers.

402
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,516
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they say there's just really no way that they can control it.

403
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:57,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I say, you know, my father's tested positive.

404
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:03,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortunately, he's, you know, he's not showing any signs, but, you know, these facilities,

405
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:13,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I think after this is done, they're all going to need a major wake up call going forward.

406
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:19,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like I said, even on a good day, they're somewhat questionable or marginal.

407
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:26,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, and I know the administration has done everything that they possibly can do to get help to them.

408
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:30,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President Caraviello.

409
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:31,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

410
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

411
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:37,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank council beers for bringing this up, uh, this evening.

412
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:51,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to concur with council tonight that it's very important that the council receive a timeline of events, uh, through over the past eight weeks on, uh, what has occurred within the courtyard in particular.

413
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:54,640
[SPEAKER_11]: I also heard some troubling comments by a representative.

414
00:32:55,073 --> 00:33:02,016
[SPEAKER_11]: from courtyard, Mr. President, as early as today regarding what took place at the courtyard.

415
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:07,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was stated, well, these particular clients are all over the age of 80.

416
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:12,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's a pretty troubling comment to make, Mr. President.

417
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:24,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize the nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, but that comment, I think, Mr. President, speaks volume on how maybe the situation was handled.

418
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:30,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I appreciate what Councilor Knight offered, and I want to concur with the timeline.

419
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

420
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

421
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:38,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, thank you, Councilor Bears for bringing this forward.

423
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:42,970
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a time that we need to, as a community, reflect and really, uh,

424
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,191
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, pay homage to those people that have lost their lives.

425
00:33:47,311 --> 00:34:00,814
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that with what Councilor Knight brought up, if I could ask the Chief of Staff, Mr. Rodriguez, I'm so excited these masks are going out, but it also raises a question.

426
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:05,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we hitting, are we reaching our most vulnerable population?

427
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:08,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know it's nice that we're doing our home out in this pickup of flowers,

428
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:20,481
[SPEAKER_09]: But have we set some aside that are going directly to the senior centers, that are going directly to housing, that are going to the population that probably won't get to the homeless sites, pick them up?

429
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we done that, have thought of that yet?

430
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, yeah.

431
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:26,083
[SPEAKER_10]: 5,000 will be handed out through the drive-thru.

432
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:30,784
[SPEAKER_10]: 5,000 are being held back for seniors and vulnerable population as well as public employees.

433
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:31,405
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, good.

434
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have identified that and that's what, okay.

435
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:36,187
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be, yeah, they'll be part of, they'll be at the senior center for folks to grab.

436
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:36,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

437
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:37,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

438
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:39,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

439
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

440
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:43,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:48,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on this courtyard thing too, you know, I've talked to some residents and seen some posts online.

442
00:34:49,990 --> 00:35:02,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I think getting the timeline and also, you know, this big question around Genesis, you know, folks are posting online, you know, they made X billion dollars and they're asking us for donations and, you know, we need to protect the idea that

443
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:07,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insulting to say, oh, they were over 80, and then to also be making this money.

444
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:10,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a question.

445
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,786
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what this resolution was about, but just hearing from everybody, hearing from Vice President Caraviello, we need to do something on that, too.

446
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:21,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So I support Councilor Knight's B paper, and I hope we'll also revisit it in the future.

447
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

448
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the council?

449
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions in general from the public?

450
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:35,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Clerk Carterby, are there any emails that have come in on this issue?

451
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'm just going to check.

452
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe there are any emails, but I'm just double checking.

453
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:51,477
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no emails on this.

454
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:55,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

455
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me note for the record, though, that Mr. Rodriguez has responded to Councilor Knight's request and provided a copy of the KP agreement in my email.

456
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,740
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

457
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:09,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

458
00:36:10,841 --> 00:36:11,521
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's see.

459
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:18,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Hurtubise, could you please read back the language of the B paper offered by Councilor Knight?

460
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:28,418
[SPEAKER_04]: The B paper requests from the administration, the timeline of the events and responses that took place at Courtyard.

461
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:33,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, on that motion, the B paper offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

497
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:26,086
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-0-335 offered by Councilor Marks.

498
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:29,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that Medford's current fiscal concerns be discussed.

499
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:31,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

500
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:33,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

501
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:43,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to tune in last, I believe it was Thursday, the school committee had a meeting regarding concerns of budget.

502
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:48,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had the city's auditor present, Mr. President.

503
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:54,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought it was quite enlightening to hear some of the concerns on the school side.

504
00:37:54,707 --> 00:38:09,278
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was equally as stressful to hear that we're looking at potentially a 20% cut in local aid, which amounts to about a little over $5 million.

505
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:14,122
[SPEAKER_11]: We are also looking at cuts in permits.

506
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:20,228
[SPEAKER_11]: when I say cuts and permits, a reduction in permits close to $2 million.

507
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:23,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Vehicle excise is down 7%.

508
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:28,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Hotel and mails tax is down about a million dollar reduction.

509
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:34,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Fixed costs are up, health insurance and unfunded liabilities.

510
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:37,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And the list goes on, Mr. President.

511
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:46,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, I think what was stated, we're looking at a little over $8.2 million shortfall in the budget.

512
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:52,522
[SPEAKER_11]: And depending on what happens this June 1st, they extended the deadline for taxes.

513
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:55,426
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't receive the full $29 million in taxes,

514
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:09,588
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, which, uh, many people, uh, this community might be had press to send their taxes on time, uh, even with the extension, uh, that'll only add to our budget deficit gap.

515
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:15,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so the 8 million could quickly grow, uh, to 10, 12, 14 million, Mr. President.

516
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:21,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think as many Councilors are aware, our budget is probably about 85% salaries.

517
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:29,548
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you look at tightening your belt, unfortunately, the belt tightening mostly is around personnel.

518
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:43,198
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where you can get into issues of furloughs and other options, days off and so forth, which I hope we never have to explore, Mr. President.

519
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,658
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing that was stated, and it was just stated briefly, we hear so much about the federal government bailing everyone out, right?

520
00:39:53,554 --> 00:40:08,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, we have yet to receive, uh, any, uh, idea from the federal government, uh, about federal assistance, um, for a bailout of cities and towns that are really getting impacted by this COVID-19.

521
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:15,805
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, in my opinion, we as a council should be soliciting or lobbying, uh, right now.

522
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:22,265
[SPEAKER_11]: to make sure that whatever we experience in a budget gap is made up by the federal government.

523
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:31,214
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think right now, I would ask that we send a letter from the council to our federal delegation

524
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:52,702
[SPEAKER_11]: asking that the city of Medford, and I'm sure Dave is probably already in the process of doing this, but asking our federal delegation to assist us with a bailout, knowing that the state local aid is going to be cut, local receipts are down, taxes are probably going to be down, and fixed costs are up.

525
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:58,225
[SPEAKER_11]: And our options right now, we do have about 10 million in free cash.

526
00:40:58,765 --> 00:41:05,128
[SPEAKER_11]: But as the mayor mentioned, we don't want to go through all our free cash because that leads us in a vulnerable position.

527
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:14,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So even though we do have an ample amount of free cash, I think we have to look for just as that kind of a rainy day fund.

528
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:23,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, um, there was some discussion during the school committee meeting and with the city auditor, uh, about what should we do with this year's budget that's coming up.

529
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:40,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one of the recommendations was a level funded budget makes most sense and most appropriate at this time, uh, knowing that there's probably going to be a shortfall and any additions to the budget, uh, is going to mean deletion somewhere.

530
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:50,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, not to say there's some good ideas floating out there that could be revenue generators, uh, or, uh, cost savings.

531
00:41:51,303 --> 00:42:06,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I think those should be explored, but I think a level funded budget right now, in my opinion, uh, makes sense, Mr. President with COVID and knowing that, uh, receipts are limited right now in the city and maybe that way for some time.

532
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,732
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to put a finger on it right now.

533
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:11,812
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to bring it up.

534
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:12,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

535
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're meeting Thanks to your leadership.

536
00:42:14,853 --> 00:42:21,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's what Thursday Thursday night at 530 and we're gonna get another briefing on it.

537
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:30,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President and hopefully we'll start I know we were promised we were gonna start looking at the budget in April and I realized there's a million things going on believe me and

538
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not trying to be critical at all.

539
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,921
[SPEAKER_11]: But the school committee has started their process.

540
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:43,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to say that I think we need to start meeting with the department heads and so forth very shortly.

541
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:52,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Because as Council Vice President Caraviello mentioned, this is going to be a trying budget for all of us.

542
00:42:53,294 --> 00:43:01,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the earlier we start, the earlier we get a grasp on what direction we want to go in, the better off we'll be as a council and as a community.

543
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:06,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to put that out there, Mr. President, and I look forward to hearing what my other colleagues have to say.

544
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:08,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

545
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:16,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks, would you like to, as far as the, would you like to amend the resolution to include the letter to the federal delegation?

546
00:43:16,853 --> 00:43:19,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I would, Mr. President, and we can add our state delegation in as well.

547
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:20,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

548
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will add that in as an amendment, Clerk Hurtubise.

549
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:27,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve.

550
00:43:31,721 --> 00:43:32,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I have it, Mr. President.

551
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:34,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect, thank you.

552
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:35,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

553
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:37,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

554
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:41,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Marks.

555
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:49,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely, well, looking forward to, might not be the right words, but the meeting on Thursday is an important meeting.

556
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,286
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's an important discussion to have.

557
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:58,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I support a letter to the federal delegation from this council and also the state delegation.

558
00:43:58,808 --> 00:44:12,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also wondering if, and whether we do it as two separate things or one thing, sending a joint resolution from both the school committee, the council and the mayor saying that we're all in agreement on this is our need as a city and sending that.

559
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:17,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I'm happy to discuss that or hear what my other Councilors have to say about that.

560
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:28,500
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing I wanted to say is, you know, in many of our departments, they haven't even recovered from 2008 recession and the budgets that were passed then.

561
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:40,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to put forward any and every alternative, whether it's advocacy for this federal money or working with the state and other municipalities to find a solution on this level.

562
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:47,068
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right now we really are at the mercy of Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump when it comes to a state and local bailout.

563
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:47,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think

564
00:44:48,314 --> 00:44:54,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that could be, we all know that could potentially change in the next, uh, several months.

565
00:44:54,618 --> 00:45:02,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think if, if they choose to follow through on some of the more ridiculous things that they've suggested, like cities and states can go bankrupt.

566
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:15,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think we might need to work with the state level to find an alternative to get us through, uh, the next several months because, um, with, with public services, we're gonna need more public services after this crisis than we needed before.

567
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:17,808
[SPEAKER_01]: schools are going to have a bigger mental health crisis.

568
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,849
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have, we need people at the Board of Health.

569
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,549
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people in the DPW.

570
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:39,033
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to be, work as hard as we can and look at every possible option and alternative to make sure that we can get through this and maintain the services that our residents are going to need even more of on the other side of this crisis.

571
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:41,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

572
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe Councilor Knight, you were up next.

573
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

574
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,759
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly agree with Councilman Mox that a level funded budget would be a win.

575
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:56,422
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think at this point in the game, it's wishful thinking to get a level funded budget for the next fiscal year.

576
00:45:57,163 --> 00:45:59,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reality of the situation.

577
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:06,989
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another reality of the situation, Mr. President, and that reality is that by law, we need to pass a fiscal year budget by July 1st.

578
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,193
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for us to do that, during these trying times, we need to stop meeting now.

579
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:15,014
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't wait any longer.

580
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:17,374
[SPEAKER_00]: We were supposed to meet last month.

581
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:20,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncontrollable circumstances have arisen.

582
00:46:20,795 --> 00:46:21,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.

583
00:46:22,476 --> 00:46:24,937
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we are now, another four weeks behind where we should be.

584
00:46:25,797 --> 00:46:33,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as one councilor, am not crazy about the idea of going down the road for a 1-12 budget or an emergency budget.

585
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:35,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's appropriate.

586
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:38,222
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's the way we should handle a fiscal crisis.

587
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's short-term planning, not long-term planning.

588
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:44,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, for one, would like to ask the question,

589
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:56,959
[SPEAKER_00]: will we have an annual budget as required by the state law for us to debate and vote upon by July 1st?

590
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my question, Mr. President.

591
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:05,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we have a budget available for us to vote on at this point in time?

592
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:11,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And where are we in the process right now in terms of the preparations so that we can better work our schedules around

593
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:17,032
[SPEAKER_00]: what to expect in the forthcoming weeks when these budget hearings do start.

594
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:19,834
[SPEAKER_00]: So I offer that the form of a question to the administration.

595
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:26,440
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done by way of a mentor, by way of an answer from the gentleman that's here in the audience this evening, I represent the administration.

596
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief of staff Rodriguez, do you like to take that question?

597
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:31,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

598
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:35,017
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that the question begets other questions.

599
00:47:35,037 --> 00:47:38,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the real trouble that we've had in the budget process.

600
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:44,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And we certainly would have wanted to be further along in the process, but for the current public health crisis.

601
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:51,276
[SPEAKER_10]: The issue is that there are too many unanswered questions about how we're going to develop the budget.

602
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,297
[SPEAKER_10]: in this, at the state level, they've kicked out their fiscal year.

603
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:57,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So the house budget won't even be in place until June 1st.

604
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:02,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So we rely on that state level number in order to develop our revenue number.

605
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:05,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So a 112 budget is of course on the table.

606
00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:07,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Final decisions haven't been made.

607
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:17,881
[SPEAKER_10]: We do want to have the meeting on Thursday with Tony Roselli so that you're able, so the council is able to ask questions and that he's able to provide his unbiased opinion on these things.

608
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:20,602
[SPEAKER_10]: So of course a 112 budget is on the table.

609
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:33,767
[SPEAKER_10]: fully aware that it is a short-term solution, but given the fact that we will have additional answers further down the road, whether there will be a federal bailout, whether there will be additional state funding, the hard number for state funding that we can rely on.

610
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:39,769
[SPEAKER_10]: There is also a bill pending that was just passed before the Senate that would push out the municipal fiscal year.

611
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,231
[SPEAKER_10]: So the mayor would not be required to submit a budget until July 31st.

612
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:53,477
[SPEAKER_10]: and that cities and towns will be able to pass one-quarter budgets instead of one-twelfth budgets in order to get further development and the answers and further solutions down the road.

613
00:48:53,497 --> 00:49:00,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we're closely monitoring that legislation in order for us to be able to address that and contemplate whether that would be appropriate.

614
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:06,126
[SPEAKER_10]: But at this time, there is no decision being made whether it will be a one-twelfth budget or a full fiscal year budget.

615
00:49:06,626 --> 00:49:09,008
[SPEAKER_10]: We are planning for both at this point.

616
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:11,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

617
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:11,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Cots all night.

618
00:49:12,905 --> 00:49:26,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, I request we get that response in writing if possible, just so that we can have it on the record as we move forward and are all prepared so that we're all on the same page when we begin our budget discussions.

619
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:31,670
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of Tony Roselli now, his position with the community as outside auditor, is that what it is?

620
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:34,184
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been the outside auditor for Medford.

621
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,505
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been doing work for the city for, I believe, over 30 years.

622
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:39,007
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's been the outside auditor for quite some time.

623
00:49:39,048 --> 00:49:42,190
[SPEAKER_10]: He represents, I believe, 67 cities and towns in Massachusetts.

624
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:42,951
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

625
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:48,215
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it common for an outside auditor to establish new forecast municipalities?

626
00:49:49,216 --> 00:49:55,321
[SPEAKER_10]: It is in this case, given that the finance director is currently not available and out sick.

627
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:59,364
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a common thing to have outside auditors assist in these sorts of things.

628
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:03,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President.

629
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Larkins.

630
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:16,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was mentioned that he was hired by the city about two years ago, because Melanson was our outside auditor for 30 years.

631
00:50:17,036 --> 00:50:17,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

632
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:23,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I only know what Tony has told me that he remembers doing work for the city back in the 80s.

633
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,684
[SPEAKER_10]: So I believe that there have been a number of firms that have provided outside auditing services, but he has been doing work for quite some time.

634
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:31,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It certainly predates this administration.

635
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:36,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

636
00:50:37,263 --> 00:50:42,904
[SPEAKER_00]: It is common that the answer is commonplace for outside auditors to provide revenue forecast for municipalities.

637
00:50:43,364 --> 00:50:44,264
[SPEAKER_00]: To assess correct.

638
00:50:45,704 --> 00:50:46,904
[SPEAKER_00]: To assess, okay, thank you.

639
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:51,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight, any further questions?

640
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,286
[SPEAKER_00]: That does it for me, sir.

641
00:50:53,986 --> 00:50:54,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

642
00:50:54,406 --> 00:50:59,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more comment, Mr. President.

643
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:06,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it goes back to what Councilor Monk said with a level funded budget.

644
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:17,658
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've stated that I think a level funded budget is going to be wishful thinking based upon the current financial and fiscal situation that we're in.

645
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,741
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also have to look at the term level funded budget.

646
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is a level funded budget?

647
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:27,587
[SPEAKER_00]: A level funded budget is taking the money we gave last year and giving it to them again this year.

648
00:51:28,328 --> 00:51:39,077
[SPEAKER_00]: But something's getting lost in the middle there, Mr. President, and that's a measure of the performance and whether or not the goals and objectives were met or established when we made that funding.

649
00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:51,708
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're funding a department that says these are our goals and objectives for this term, we give them the money to do that, and they don't meet those goals and objectives, why are we funding them at the same level?

650
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:55,211
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obvious that they haven't been able to accomplish the job,

651
00:51:55,776 --> 00:52:06,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we might want to look at something what's called zero-based budgeting, which means that instead of level funding a budget every year, the goals and objectives that are set are either retained or they're not.

652
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:13,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And the money that is appropriated is not a reoccurring appropriation.

653
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,573
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to show that this money in this investment is giving us a return.

654
00:52:17,473 --> 00:52:24,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's something that we might want to consider and might want to look at, Mr. President, is going to a zero-based budget at this point in time.

655
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:37,349
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're in very strange financial times, but I think that, you know, with the amount of talent that we have here in the community, we should be able to put together an annual budget.

656
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:39,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

657
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:43,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no more, that's really it.

658
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:47,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello.

659
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:48,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

660
00:52:48,434 --> 00:53:00,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I share Councilor Mark's hope that a level funded budget would be, I think we'll wish for, but Councilor Knight is right.

661
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:04,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to start working on this now.

662
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is new territory for, I think, everybody on this council.

663
00:53:12,174 --> 00:53:23,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've got raises that are coming through that I'm told that are close to $1.5 million, $1.6 million in negotiated raises that are going to have to be paid.

664
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the rubbish contract that is coming up this year that's due.

665
00:53:29,057 --> 00:53:34,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we met with the Waste Management last year, they told us, plan on a hefty raise.

666
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:40,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that we more than have our work cut out for us.

667
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:50,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Going forward and Councilor Knight's right, the longer we wait, I think the bigger the problem is gonna be.

668
00:53:50,502 --> 00:54:00,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we all need to sit down together and say, and again, what we talked about earlier, this is not something you can do through a Zoom conference.

669
00:54:01,424 --> 00:54:06,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to sit down in a room and really get this done collectively.

670
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:13,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I think we're really going to struggle going forward.

671
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:16,418
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be my fifth budget with the councilors.

672
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:21,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know how it is to do just on a regular basis when we're in the room.

673
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:26,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind with the president trying to run the screen and run the budget at the same time.

674
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very difficult.

675
00:54:27,521 --> 00:54:32,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in new waters here for a lot of us.

676
00:54:32,322 --> 00:54:36,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody in the council has ever had a face

677
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:39,174
[SPEAKER_05]: a budget with a deficit.

678
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say, I agree with Councilor Knight.

679
00:54:42,855 --> 00:54:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get moving as soon as possible.

680
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:48,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

681
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:51,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the council?

682
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,279
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may add quickly, I thank Councilor, Councilor Knight.

683
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:21,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, I would just like to add that maybe with this new enlarged donation of PPE that the city has received, that the administration would be willing to set some aside with the intention of being able to provide that when we conduct these in-person budget hearings, if, in fact, it's something we can work out if people don't have access to that stuff, you know what I mean?

684
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:28,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can use that as part of our ancillary and secondary plan to provide PPE to individuals while we try to meet

685
00:55:29,564 --> 00:55:33,928
[SPEAKER_00]: non-virtually for the important issue of discussing with community scientists.

686
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

687
00:55:37,571 --> 00:55:39,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, did you want to speak on the matter?

688
00:55:42,775 --> 00:55:42,975
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

689
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:43,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

690
00:55:44,176 --> 00:55:48,500
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

691
00:55:49,401 --> 00:55:56,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I am looking forward to, and it's probably not the proper term, and someone else mentioned that earlier,

692
00:55:57,122 --> 00:55:58,623
[SPEAKER_13]: about meeting Thursday night.

693
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:03,627
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that we need to be on top of this.

694
00:56:04,008 --> 00:56:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a huge deficit that we're talking about.

695
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:13,815
[SPEAKER_13]: When we talk about level funding a budget, level funding a budget is basically cutting.

696
00:56:14,296 --> 00:56:16,177
[SPEAKER_13]: You're starting off by cutting because

697
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:21,427
[SPEAKER_13]: level funded budget is basically cut already.

698
00:56:21,748 --> 00:56:23,430
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's already a reduction of services.

699
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:25,814
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is not that we need to be on top of.

700
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:28,678
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad that we're meeting on Thursday night.

701
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,220
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely long overdue.

702
00:56:30,957 --> 00:56:34,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I look forward to the meeting because this is something that we need to tackle head on.

703
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:39,109
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to really take a look at all of our options with the administration.

704
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:45,097
[SPEAKER_13]: And Tony is going to hopefully be able to walk us through

705
00:56:48,716 --> 00:56:49,797
[SPEAKER_13]: this whole situation.

706
00:56:49,877 --> 00:56:58,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I did call into the meeting last week, and it was interesting to listen to him and to listen to the really dire circumstances that we're under.

707
00:56:59,121 --> 00:57:04,183
[SPEAKER_13]: But we need to take a look at everything, and that meeting will be very important Thursday night.

708
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:08,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other questions?

709
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:10,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anybody else want to comment on this?

710
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:13,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And while I'm at it, Claire Corderby, do you have any emails on this issue?

711
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:17,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I have no emails on this issue.

712
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:21,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and it seems like there's no questions from the public as well.

713
00:57:22,277 --> 00:57:22,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

714
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:30,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I just want to say in these trying times, I think it's even more

715
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:47,075
[SPEAKER_11]: more important that we as a council work collaboratively with the mayor and the school committee and You know, we're one city as you always say, mr. President one method.

716
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:47,696
[SPEAKER_11]: You're correct.

717
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:50,719
[SPEAKER_11]: We're one method and you know when I

718
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,542
[SPEAKER_11]: people make comments regarding putting people on the hot seat.

719
00:57:56,322 --> 00:58:01,344
[SPEAKER_11]: And that does a disservice, Mr. President, to this entire community.

720
00:58:01,985 --> 00:58:04,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not what we need right now.

721
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:11,949
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to support and build up each other and not make comments about putting people on the hot seat and making people take tough votes.

722
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:19,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, this is going to be extremely difficult for everyone, Mr. President.

723
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,273
[SPEAKER_11]: The last thing we need

724
00:58:20,793 --> 00:58:23,734
[SPEAKER_11]: is people acting in a contentious way.

725
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:27,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to put that out there, Mr. President.

726
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:29,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

727
00:58:33,257 --> 00:58:34,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Clerk Hurtubise.

728
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:38,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, so on the motion of Councilor Marks.

[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Councilor Bears?

733
00:58:48,183 --> 00:58:50,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was Councilor Scarpelli, but I couldn't tell.

734
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:51,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Councilor Scarpelli, I'm sorry.

735
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:52,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

736

00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:00,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

741
00:59:01,152 --> 00:59:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

742
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:04,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

743
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:06,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

00:59:06,116 --> 00:59:06,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

745
00:59:07,217 --> 00:59:07,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

746
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:08,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

747
00:59:09,198 --> 00:59:09,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

748
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:10,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

749
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

750
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,501
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco.

751
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:13,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

752
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:17,495
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-0-336.

753
00:59:17,515 --> 00:59:21,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, we're losing you.

754
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:23,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me now?

755
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:29,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just got the resolution over.

756
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:42,029
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-0-336 offered by Councilor Lennart and Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided with a list of all supplemental appropriations requested by the school department for the period of fiscal year 2017

757
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,614
[SPEAKER_13]: through 2020 and copies of the city council votes on these papers.

758
00:59:48,495 --> 00:59:55,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

759
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:56,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

760
00:59:57,144 --> 01:00:01,809
[SPEAKER_00]: As we are all aware, the school department is one of the largest city departments that we have.

761
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:13,583
[SPEAKER_00]: It comprises nearly 30% of our budget annually, and it proves to provide one of the most vital services that we can offer as a municipality along with public safety and public works.

762
01:00:14,964 --> 01:00:25,175
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge that we as a city council face is going to be balancing the many competing needs of the various departments in this community.

763
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:32,699
[SPEAKER_00]: in being able to deliver a level of services that meets the quality and expectation of our taxpayers.

764
01:00:33,779 --> 01:00:43,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think there's been a reoccurring theme this evening about the topic of discussion, and that's the budget.

765
01:00:43,441 --> 01:00:44,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our city's finances.

766
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:51,203
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the underlying theme of this evening's meeting, Mr. President, and these papers that have been brought forward are no different.

767
01:00:51,704 --> 01:00:53,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpelli and I were

768
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:59,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very aware of the commentary that took place at the school committee meeting, the emergency school committee meeting last Wednesday.

769
01:01:00,629 --> 01:01:17,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I quite frankly think if we were going to discuss the city's finances in such a large scope, that discussion should have started with the council and not the school committee, because it's really going to come down to all of us working together on, but the council holds the purse strings and the buck stops here.

770
01:01:18,347 --> 01:01:23,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I really think that this discussion should have started with the council, Mr. President, but we are where we are.

771
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:32,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so with that being said, there were several resolutions, um, that, that I put forward some by myself, some, um, as co-sponsor with councilor Scarpelli.

772
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the speech is going to be the same for them all.

773
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:35,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President.

774
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:39,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ultimately, you know, we have a job.

775
01:01:39,952 --> 01:01:45,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Here and that job is to balance the competing needs and the competing interests that the various departments have.

776
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:52,817
[SPEAKER_00]: and then meeting that objective, delivering those services to the level that our residents and taxpayers expect.

777
01:01:53,657 --> 01:02:09,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this information will be very helpful as we move forward in putting together our budget and preparing for our budget discussions, because we'll have a, you know, historical understanding and a historical perspective of the issue that the school department, again,

778
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:28,199
[SPEAKER_00]: largest department here in the city has been looking for, where appropriations and expenditures have been made historically, what the trends are, and then maybe we can take a look at, Mr. President, coming up with some solutions to stop the bleeding when our state aid numbers come back.

779
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:35,381
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding that the new education funding formula doesn't help Medford that much.

780
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:36,982
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not

781
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,743
[SPEAKER_00]: not much better off than we were under the old education funding formula.

782
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:49,945
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, I think that it's important that, you know, we take a long, hard look at the finances of our largest departments, first and foremost.

783
01:02:50,906 --> 01:03:00,708
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to be moving forward and, you know, looking at hopefully level funding budgets, I think the first place we need to start is public safety and public works in our school time.

784
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:03,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go from there, Mr. President.

785
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:07,150
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many needs right now in the community and many obligations.

786
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:26,163
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be debt service, whether it be health insurance, premium inflation, unfunded pension liability, and the like, we are going to have to comply with the state and federal funded and unfunded mandates and pay the assessments on the certain and various services that we receive from our partners in government.

787
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:30,906
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, this paper that's before us right now, paper 20339, paper 20337, the same goes

788
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:38,810
[SPEAKER_00]: for all three, and I won't have much to say on those, Mr. President.

789
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:46,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll rest my case with that, with this, that, you know, we need to get this information so that we can move forward and be prepared to address this stuff.

790
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:54,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as one Councilor, am prepared to roll up my sleeves and get to work to put together a 12-month budget for the next fiscal year.

791
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the administration shares that goal and that objective.

792
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:10,779
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we collectively, I think we'll be in a better position to sit down and really talk numbers and talk to her.

793
01:04:11,439 --> 01:04:21,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Less time wasted asking questions, because we're all going to be upset.

794
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:23,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Layton.

795
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:26,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I raise the issue right forward, and I defer to my colleague, Councilor Scalia,

796
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

797
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:32,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

798
01:04:32,082 --> 01:04:33,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

799
01:04:33,223 --> 01:04:56,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And like Councilor Marks mentioned earlier and what Councilor Knight brought up, I think that I also was on the meeting with the school department and it's funny because I found myself instead of where we need to be in today's society, where as a unified front, as a mayor, a city council and school committee working together in the most trying times,

800
01:04:57,443 --> 01:05:10,132
[SPEAKER_09]: It was disheartening that a member of the school committee made comments in the context that questioned what our goals are and what's driving the city council.

801
01:05:10,692 --> 01:05:17,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And it left me presenting resolutions

802
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:23,524
[SPEAKER_09]: to support what we've done as a committee and to support what we'll try to do in the future.

803
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:30,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I talked to one constituent, you know, isn't this too early to be grandstanding politically?

804
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:35,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't this destructive from another constituent?

805
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:36,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is.

806
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,361
[SPEAKER_09]: getting this information.

807
01:05:39,922 --> 01:05:42,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope like Council Mark says this brings everything out.

808
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:51,415
[SPEAKER_09]: We as a committee work together with the school department being the amount of the budget that they do carry and that we work together.

809
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:57,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Falco and myself were part of the school committee that went through probably

810
01:05:57,842 --> 01:06:01,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's toughest times back in 2008, Councilor Falco, if you remember.

811
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:13,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things we did is we worked together with the city council, and we didn't leave that room at the high school until the mayor came back with $300,000 that we needed to make sure that our basic

812
01:06:15,832 --> 01:06:19,575
[SPEAKER_09]: basic duties were being performed for our students in Medford.

813
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:21,497
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been there.

814
01:06:22,057 --> 01:06:24,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have two kids in the system right now.

815
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,183
[SPEAKER_09]: To say something that, whether it was meant one way or meant another way,

816
01:06:30,212 --> 01:06:41,258
[SPEAKER_09]: has led us to put these resolutions in to move forward to make sure that our constituents see what we've done as a council, see how we've worked together in the past with the school committee.

817
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:49,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, if we had an open bank of funds, I would love to give the school committee everything they need.

818
01:06:49,202 --> 01:06:58,546
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, we're held as a group to make sure that we're holding the city fiscally responsible and making sure that we're looking at pieces of pie for everybody that's needed.

819
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:02,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be honest with you, we're looking at.

820
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:11,738
[SPEAKER_09]: budgets that have come to us, especially for me for the last two years on the council, that were passed unanimously to the school committee.

821
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:15,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was a little taken back when there were questions that evening.

822
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:18,963
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, my hope is moving forward.

823
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:21,084
[SPEAKER_09]: The council Mark said, he's our leader.

824
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:27,909
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, he's been here the longest in years, not of age, but understanding to get through these times, we need to be together.

825
01:07:28,249 --> 01:07:29,370
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to work as a group.

826
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:32,932
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to cross lines and make sure that we're doing what's right.

827
01:07:33,013 --> 01:07:33,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And listen,

828
01:07:35,647 --> 01:07:48,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working in a municipal budget where I work, and we're already asking for furloughs, and we're already asking to hold back future raises, and we're looking at moving people out.

829
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's tough.

830
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,772
[SPEAKER_09]: These are tough times right now.

831
01:07:53,672 --> 01:07:55,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to use our

832
01:07:56,563 --> 01:08:10,857
[SPEAKER_09]: our leadership roles in this community, why we were all voted for our positions, to make sure that we're doing what's best for our community, and rest assured that we're preparing our city to get through these tough times, because better times are coming, we know that.

833
01:08:11,377 --> 01:08:14,360
[SPEAKER_09]: But we just have to work together to make sure that we get through this together.

834
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Councilor Knight said,

835
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we were putting resolutions through the very similar, uh, working together and getting these out.

836
01:08:23,388 --> 01:08:30,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that my comments are going to be saying every, every one of my resolutions that are in for the remainder of the evening are meant for.

837
01:08:31,412 --> 01:08:35,734
[SPEAKER_09]: this point specifically, that we truly need to work together.

838
01:08:35,794 --> 01:08:39,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And being contentious, it just, there's no place for it right now.

839
01:08:39,476 --> 01:08:46,800
[SPEAKER_09]: There's too much going on in our society right now to have any negativity going on, especially in our leading governing body.

840
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:55,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for listening, and thank you for Councilor Knight for presenting the first half with these resolutions.

841
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:55,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

842
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:56,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

843
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:58,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Scarpelli, Vice President Caraviello.

844
01:08:59,246 --> 01:08:59,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

845
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:08,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll thank the Dean of the Council, Councilor Marks, for saying the correct thing.

846
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:14,064
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't the time to be putting people on hot seats and calling people out.

847
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:17,026
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be working together on this.

848
01:09:17,906 --> 01:09:20,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is gonna be a tough time.

849
01:09:21,008 --> 01:09:24,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna rely on Councilor Scarpelli and President Falco.

850
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: They were recently on the school committee

851
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: for their help in this school budget more than we ever have.

852
01:09:33,563 --> 01:09:45,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, like I said, like all my councilors, this is the time that we need to be working together and putting all our collective heads together to get this done.

853
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:50,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Because again, we all live in the city and we all take part here.

854
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we're here.

855
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:55,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here for everybody.

856
01:09:57,133 --> 01:10:03,617
[SPEAKER_05]: please, you know, going forward, people shouldn't be making comments that just aren't called for.

857
01:10:03,697 --> 01:10:10,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would hope that going forward, cool heads will prevail and we'll all sit down and do the right thing by the people of this community.

858
01:10:11,861 --> 01:10:13,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

859
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

860
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

861
01:10:16,324 --> 01:10:20,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on.

862
01:10:21,067 --> 01:10:25,049
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Mr. President, when the school committee votes for their budget,

863
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:33,262
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a majority vote, and that's the will of the school committee, which is then presented to the council.

864
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:44,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't recall, I've been on a number of years, I can't recall ever the council cutting the school budget once it's submitted to us, ever.

865
01:10:45,493 --> 01:10:54,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Mr. President, I can recall many times where this council has stood up and voted for new technology, school building assistance.

866
01:10:55,323 --> 01:11:00,008
[SPEAKER_11]: You name it, Mr. President, we've stepped up to the plate on numerous occasions.

867
01:11:00,669 --> 01:11:08,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there are concerns with the school budget that relies on the school committee, not the city council.

868
01:11:08,817 --> 01:11:11,102
[SPEAKER_11]: We're presented with their budget, Mr. President.

869
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:13,447
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't add to it, Mr. President.

870
01:11:13,768 --> 01:11:17,616
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't do anything other than approving the total city budget.

871
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:21,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where we stand with this, Mr. President.

872
01:11:21,286 --> 01:11:29,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So for someone to stand forward and say, well, it's the council, that's being very disingenuous, Mr. President, because it's not the council.

873
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:34,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the school committee that creates the budget and then passes it on to the council.

874
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:41,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the school committee wishes to do other things, increase their budget, that's their prerogative.

875
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:49,143
[SPEAKER_11]: That's their prerogative, and they should do so as elected officials in this community, as an autonomous body.

876
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:50,885
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not tied to the council.

877
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where it is, Mr. President.

878
01:11:53,691 --> 01:12:06,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope we can put this behind us and work forward, Mr. President, so we can address, as Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, so we can address all the needs of the community.

879
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:09,877
[SPEAKER_11]: The council's here not just to address the municipal side.

880
01:12:10,157 --> 01:12:14,199
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here to address all the needs as well as the school needs as well, Mr. President.

881
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,340
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm willing to work with anyone.

882
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:21,369
[SPEAKER_11]: across the aisle, but we have to do this together, Mr. President.

883
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:22,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

884
01:12:22,849 --> 01:12:23,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

885
01:12:24,249 --> 01:12:24,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

886
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:26,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

887
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:36,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And I completely agree with my colleagues that, and I hope we can do it on the stimulus requests and all of the budget areas that speaking with one voice is key.

888
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:44,533
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think actually we need to move beyond specific statements that were made.

889
01:12:44,553 --> 01:12:46,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, contentiousness is not where we need to be.

890
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:56,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what Councilor Knight said about looking at a different way to budget is actually what the comments, at least I was watching the meeting as well.

891
01:12:56,229 --> 01:13:10,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I heard was actually a criticism of the school committee and their own internal actions similar to what you just said, Councilor Marks, and words may have been thrown around and we all know what happens when we're speaking off the cuff.

892
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:13,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I think we've all admitted

893
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:21,758
[SPEAKER_01]: before, not about the schools specifically, but in general, we want to be able to provide the services that the residents want.

894
01:13:22,558 --> 01:13:33,788
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what I heard, at least, is that maybe the school committee is reconsidering how they do their budget exactly to your point, Councilor Marks, to make a different request and change the process.

895
01:13:33,808 --> 01:13:40,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that, I don't think this budget year is going to be the year to do it, but I'd like to see in future budget years us saying,

896
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:45,012
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from every single city department assessing all of our services and saying this is what we need.

897
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:49,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Councilor Knight made an exceptional point about, you know, what are our needs?

898
01:13:49,734 --> 01:13:50,415
[SPEAKER_01]: What are our goals?

899
01:13:50,455 --> 01:13:51,435
[SPEAKER_01]: What are our objectives?

900
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:53,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And are we achieving them every year?

901
01:13:53,076 --> 01:13:55,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we really need to have that conversation.

902
01:13:55,257 --> 01:14:00,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we need to be able to say, you know, this is the reason why we don't have X person at DPW.

903
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:02,080
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why this isn't getting done.

904
01:14:03,183 --> 01:14:05,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I hope we can move forward.

905
01:14:05,305 --> 01:14:14,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, this budget is not going to be the year for us to assess all of the needs that we have, because it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to meet many of them.

906
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:18,732
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope that in future budgets that we can say, you know, this is what we need.

907
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:20,613
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're able to provide.

908
01:14:21,074 --> 01:14:30,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the difference because I think it's very important for all residents to know exactly where we are and exactly what we're doing to try to improve the services.

909
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:32,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I hope we'll go together.

910
01:14:33,005 --> 01:14:34,605
[SPEAKER_01]: school committee Council and the mayor.

911
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:50,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Most important thing to me right now is that we all are together and send a resolution of support around federal federal and state support because, you know, just want to loop back to that we need the people that we have in city government to provide these services right now.

912
01:14:50,948 --> 01:14:52,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's my priority.

913
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:55,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Council beers.

914
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:58,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the counter any other comments.

915
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:05,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, all right.

916
01:15:06,304 --> 01:15:13,289
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may really quick Councilor Knight, I'd like to thank Councilors Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

917
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:17,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And I agree with all the comments from my colleagues.

918
01:15:17,573 --> 01:15:20,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is the time where we need to come together on things.

919
01:15:21,115 --> 01:15:25,558
[SPEAKER_13]: And we need to work together to really move forward, come together as one community.

920
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:28,040
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be the toughest budget.

921
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:30,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even know when there's been a budget

922
01:15:31,295 --> 01:15:32,155
[SPEAKER_13]: that's been this bad.

923
01:15:32,175 --> 01:15:36,157
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is gonna be a really tough budget, but we're gonna get things done if we work together.

924
01:15:36,177 --> 01:15:39,339
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to work together as a team, and I'm sure that we will.

925
01:15:39,759 --> 01:15:41,099
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel very confident in that.

926
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And we need to work together with the school committee and the mayor as well.

927
01:15:45,181 --> 01:15:46,962
[SPEAKER_13]: But we need to stay positive.

928
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:50,964
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to work together as one unified body.

929
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,464
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thank everyone for their comments.

930
01:15:53,025 --> 01:15:55,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, before I call for the roll,

931
01:15:56,206 --> 01:16:00,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other comments from the public or Clark Cardinese, if you could please check your email.

932
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:02,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions from the email?

933
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:08,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this topic.

934
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:09,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

935
01:16:10,876 --> 01:16:11,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Any from the public?

936
01:16:12,537 --> 01:16:13,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions?

937
01:16:14,318 --> 01:16:25,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, seeing that there are no questions, and there are no questions from the council on the motion of Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by

938
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:26,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Second, Mr. President.

939
01:16:27,108 --> 01:16:30,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello, please call the roll.

940
01:16:32,894 --> 01:16:33,454

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

942
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:36,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

943
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:37,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

944
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:38,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

945
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:38,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

946
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:39,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

947
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:40,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

948
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:43,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

949
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:43,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

950
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:44,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

951
01:16:45,405 --> 01:16:45,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco.

953
01:16:47,087 --> 01:16:47,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

954
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:49,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

955
01:16:51,608 --> 01:17:05,859
[SPEAKER_13]: 20-337 offered by Councilor Knight being resolved that the Medford City Council be provided a summary relative to what percentage of the city budget was appropriated to fund the school district for the period of fiscal year 2017 through 2020.

956
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:08,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

957
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:11,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, the host is dead.

958
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:12,004
[SPEAKER_13]: We've beat the death.

959
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:13,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Move for approval.

960
01:17:13,265 --> 01:17:14,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

961
01:17:15,226 --> 01:17:16,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

962
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,850
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, actually,

963
01:17:20,618 --> 01:17:25,720
[SPEAKER_13]: If we call the roll, any questions from the public or Clark-Kennebys, are there any emails on this issue?

964
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:31,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, no emails on this issue.

965
01:17:31,802 --> 01:17:32,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

966
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:33,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

967
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:37,804
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

968
01:17:38,084 --> 01:17:39,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Clark-Kennebys, please call the roll.

969
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:42,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears?

970

1061
01:22:51,442 --> 01:22:54,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave or Roberta, would you like to speak on this or?

1062
01:22:54,422 --> 01:22:58,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Hang on.

1063
01:22:59,784 --> 01:23:00,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Is he still present?

1064
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:05,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear me or was I muted?

1065
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear you now.

1066
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:17,145
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I would like to invite the Medford Historical Society, John Anderson, to speak, if he's still on the line here.

1067
01:23:17,585 --> 01:23:19,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he HP.

1068
01:23:22,228 --> 01:23:22,528
[SPEAKER_13]: John?

1069
01:23:23,488 --> 01:23:23,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1070
01:23:24,389 --> 01:23:25,570
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, John Anderson.

1071
01:23:27,811 --> 01:23:28,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

1072
01:23:30,528 --> 01:23:41,174
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, I feel a little embarrassed making this request in this time and the dire situation and your efforts to deal with this.

1073
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:46,658
[SPEAKER_07]: But our work goes on and we believe in our mission.

1074
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:55,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to mention that one of the things we've been able to do, a lot of our members are retired people.

1075
01:23:56,277 --> 01:24:19,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And have been going crazy being housebound and we've managed to come up with some projects to keep them busy We deliver boxes of materials to them for them to inventory So that we can then We can then Properly file them away and make them available to the public Which is what we use this room for when the public comes and visits visits us

1076
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:30,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we'd like to do now is upgrade the lighting there and also the electrical work, which there's been no electrical work done there really.

1077
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:35,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd be happy to entertain any questions.

1078
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:49,665
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may just add a little bit of context, this application was presented to the Community Preservation Committee as a small grant application, which is why you're receiving it at an odd time.

1079
01:24:49,725 --> 01:25:06,232
[SPEAKER_08]: We receive small grant applications in the amount of $5,000 or less with matching funds of up to an additional $5,000 that on a rolling basis throughout the year,

1080
01:25:07,663 --> 01:25:16,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So this gives an opportunity for applicants with smaller projects to be able to access community preservation funds.

1081
01:25:17,747 --> 01:25:18,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1082
01:25:19,468 --> 01:25:20,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello.

1083
01:25:21,129 --> 01:25:22,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1084
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:32,253
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who's been into that building, I think that we'll all agree that this upgrade is sorely needed.

1085
01:25:33,648 --> 01:25:40,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't speak for John, but I don't think what I see in there, this is probably the original electricity from when the building was built.

1086
01:25:40,953 --> 01:25:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correct, John?

1087
01:25:43,014 --> 01:25:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's quite that ancient, but it certainly goes back decades.

1088
01:25:47,337 --> 01:25:49,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a well-worth project.

1089
01:25:49,699 --> 01:26:02,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I could, while we're on this historical thing, Roberta, I'd like to commend you for the work that was done on the wall on Grove Street.

1090
01:26:03,611 --> 01:26:04,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out phenomenal.

1091
01:26:05,192 --> 01:26:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's good to see that the money was well spent.

1092
01:26:09,494 --> 01:26:14,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I support this project wholeheartedly and motion for approval.

1093
01:26:14,356 --> 01:26:16,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1094
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:21,659
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, we have a few questions.

1095
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

1096
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:26,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1097
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:28,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I want to thank John and Roberta for coming out tonight.

1098
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:32,789
[SPEAKER_12]: And John, to your point, I think this work is still so important.

1099
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:33,549
[SPEAKER_12]: It goes on.

1100
01:26:34,029 --> 01:26:38,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think unfortunately, in times like this, cultural and art programs are usually the first to go.

1101
01:26:39,011 --> 01:26:45,272
[SPEAKER_12]: And so often history, personal history, city history is shared at these very meetings.

1102
01:26:46,213 --> 01:26:55,275
[SPEAKER_12]: So I agree with Vice President Caraviello that it's definitely a noble cause to do the upgrades we need to make sure we're preserving this history and making it accessible to the community.

1103
01:26:55,816 --> 01:26:59,117
[SPEAKER_12]: and particularly the elderly community that so enjoys it, as you mentioned.

1104
01:26:59,157 --> 01:27:00,757
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do support this.

1105
01:27:02,398 --> 01:27:03,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1106
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:04,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

1107
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:08,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight?

1108
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:19,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really horrible to people, but if you

1109
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:23,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're having a problem with Councilor Knight's connection.

1110
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:25,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1111
01:27:26,803 --> 01:27:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, are you there?

1112
01:27:28,204 --> 01:27:28,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1113
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:30,867

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank Councilor Morell, Councilor Caraviello.

1117
01:27:52,338 --> 01:27:55,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta, again, thank you for all your work.

1118
01:27:55,141 --> 01:27:57,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is what we're talking about as a community.

1119
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:11,416
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter the tough times we have and what we're going through, this is why we push so hard for the Community Preservation Act and why we made sure that helping Roberta

1120
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:15,888
[SPEAKER_09]: push for this program to be voted in and so we can look at these projects.

1121
01:28:15,928 --> 01:28:23,974
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think anybody should be feeling bad when they volunteer their time to make sure that our history is preserved.

1122
01:28:24,034 --> 01:28:29,257
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that I fully support this initiative.

1123
01:28:29,377 --> 01:28:32,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you again for all your hard work for everybody involved.

1124
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:33,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1125
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:35,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilman Scarpelli.

1126
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:36,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilman Marcus.

1127
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1128
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:42,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be remiss not to thank John Anderson.

1129
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:51,247
[SPEAKER_11]: He's done yeoman's work, Mr. President, from archiving to making sure that that building has not given way over there.

1130
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:57,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's many valuable archived items in that building, which saves our history.

1131
01:28:58,611 --> 01:29:04,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to ask John if air conditioning is in the future for that building.

1132
01:29:05,595 --> 01:29:09,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have a project ongoing to put in central air.

1133
01:29:11,317 --> 01:29:11,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Great news.

1134
01:29:11,938 --> 01:29:13,298
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you going to fund it, John?

1135
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:20,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have a major grant from the CPA that funds the bulk of it.

1136
01:29:21,101 --> 01:29:21,561
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

1137
01:29:21,701 --> 01:29:23,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And when's that going to take place, John?

1138
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:26,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's taking place right now.

1139
01:29:26,839 --> 01:29:32,521
[SPEAKER_07]: The project was held up for quite some time because we're also converting to gas at the same time.

1140
01:29:33,442 --> 01:29:39,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And no sooner did we get the project approved than the national grid work stoppage began.

1141
01:29:40,284 --> 01:29:47,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And once that was over, then there was the disaster up in Lawrence, which sucked all the resources up there to remediate there.

1142
01:29:48,087 --> 01:29:51,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So we didn't actually get the gas in until sometime in February.

1143
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,884
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know that those are old people.

1144
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:00,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, John, you do tremendous work and your group does tremendous work.

1145
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:01,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1146
01:30:01,388 --> 01:30:03,130
[SPEAKER_11]: The residents are appreciative, believe me.

1147
01:30:04,511 --> 01:30:05,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1148
01:30:05,652 --> 01:30:06,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Caraviello.

1149
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:19,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, just a little memo.

1150
01:30:20,732 --> 01:30:22,652
[SPEAKER_05]: History is everything, and everything is history.

1151
01:30:23,352 --> 01:30:24,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I thank John for his work.

1152
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:27,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1153
01:30:28,034 --> 01:30:28,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Bears.

1154
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:37,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get my word in edgewise and just say that I've been bulking up on my Medford history during this pandemic, so anything we can do to help.

1155
01:30:37,956 --> 01:30:38,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1156
01:30:41,317 --> 01:30:44,818
[SPEAKER_13]: John, thank you very much for your hard work and your dedication, continuous dedication.

1157
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:45,878
[SPEAKER_13]: We really appreciate it.

1158
01:30:46,596 --> 01:30:48,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Roberta, thank you for your hard work as well.

1159
01:30:49,019 --> 01:30:54,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions that have come in through email, Clerk Hurtubise, or are there any questions from the public?

1160
01:30:55,546 --> 01:30:57,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this topic.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1222
01:34:16,749 --> 01:34:17,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:18,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco.

1225
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:19,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1226
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:22,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1227
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:27,104
[SPEAKER_00]: President, if I could just make a brief announcement.

1228
01:34:29,005 --> 01:34:35,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was driving down Main Street just this afternoon, as a matter of fact.

1229
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I also drove down Main Street on Friday.

1230
01:34:38,793 --> 01:34:50,081
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go past Bob's Food Store and you look to the house immediately to the right-hand side of it, it's reminiscent of a Tony Lucci sidewalk sale.

1231
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:57,615
[SPEAKER_00]: is furniture all over the place, a bed, a mattress, a couch, so on and so forth.

1232
01:34:58,215 --> 01:35:02,578
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the calendar, Mr. President, Friday was the first of the month.

1233
01:35:03,859 --> 01:35:09,143
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would lead me to believe that there might have been a little bit of a tenant move out that occurred at that address.

1234
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:16,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took the liberty of reaching out to Mr. Bavuso after hearing from

1235
01:35:16,885 --> 01:35:24,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Some neighborhood residents expressed some concern relative to it being a trip hazard and a safety hazard, and he will be out there tomorrow.

1236
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:32,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted those individuals that have expressed concern to understand that there is some follow-up that's going to occur tomorrow.

1237
01:35:33,078 --> 01:35:40,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residents of South Medford should no longer have to take a look at that disgraceful, blatant trash that's on the street.

1238
01:35:41,784 --> 01:35:58,710
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've expressed to Mr. Bufuso, if in fact it comes down to a circumstance where the city has to move it or there has to be a clean it or lean it situation, that I as one council would certainly support whatever measure that we can take to help appropriate funds to make that necessary.

1239
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:09,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, Mr. President, code enforcement officer will be out there tomorrow working on rectifying the situation for neighbors of Billings Avenue.

1240
01:36:11,503 --> 01:36:12,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1241
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions from the council?

1242
01:36:16,387 --> 01:36:17,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Any comments?

1243
01:36:17,928 --> 01:36:18,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1244
01:36:19,369 --> 01:36:21,771
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, is there a motion to adjourn?

1245
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn, Mr. President.

1246
01:36:25,073 --> 01:36:25,573

[SPEAKER_05]: Records.

1249
01:36:28,656 --> 01:36:29,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

1250
01:36:29,236 --> 01:36:30,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Griggs, you had a question.

1251
01:36:30,677 --> 01:36:31,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, actually, you know what?

1252
01:36:31,378 --> 01:36:32,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Griggs, hang on.

1253
01:36:33,059 --> 01:36:36,661
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's see, we got the records.

1254
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,402
[SPEAKER_13]: The records of the meeting of April 28th were passed to Councilor Marks.

1255
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1256
01:36:44,304 --> 01:36:46,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I reviewed the records, found them to be in order and move approval.

1257
01:36:48,146 --> 01:36:49,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1258
01:36:49,767 --> 01:36:52,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve the records by Councilor Marks.

1259
01:36:53,329 --> 01:36:53,729

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears, please call the roll.

1261
01:37:01,654 --> 01:37:02,334

[SPEAKER_04]: Affirmative.

1263
01:37:06,057 --> 01:37:07,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Kaviello.

1264
01:37:07,478 --> 01:37:07,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
