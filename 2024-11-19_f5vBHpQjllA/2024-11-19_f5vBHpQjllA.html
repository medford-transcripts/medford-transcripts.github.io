    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=24.102s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=24.642s">Seven</a>  present. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=25.942s">All</a>  seven members are present. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=27.042s">At</a>  this time I'd ask everyone to please rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=33.112s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=54.385s">Okay,</a>  pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 orders suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law Chapter 38, Section 18 and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting in the Medford City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=77.075s">specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=92.221s">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=99.96s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=111.223s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=135.054s">motions</a>  orders and resolutions to zero dash 328 offer by console and I be a result that the method city council be provided with the monthly progress reports from the city administration on the status of all draft ordinances requested by the council console tonight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=152.389s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=153.99s">I</a>  think this is a rather self explanatory ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=157.413s">Here</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=159.91s">two</a>  thirds of the way through the second quarter of the calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=165.214s">Within</a>  the first five or six meetings that the city council assembled we had requested draft ordinances related to a number of issues that are <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=175.948s">impacting</a>  our community, issues that we need to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=179.929s">And</a>  the council initiated as prerogative to look at these by way of ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=185.231s">And</a>  we had a discussion about whether or not the council would have the right and ability to hire its own attorney to work on this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=194.395s">And</a>  here we are, some almost five, almost six months later, Mr. President, and we still haven't gotten one draft ordinance back. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=201.517s">So,</a>  I bring this resolution forward asking that we get monthly progress reports from the administration as to the status of the requested draft ordinances that the council seeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=213.144s">And</a>  I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this measure.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=216.186s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=217.927s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=219.888s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=222.93s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, did you have a question or were you just seconding the resolution?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=225.571s">I</a>  second the amendment, the motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=227.843s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=228.423s">Any</a>  other questions from the public or clerk or to be is do we receive any emails.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=235.665s">We</a>  have no email on this topic.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=238.606s">Council</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=240.567s">Mr.</a>  President, I do think it's important that we also get a copy of the contract that was signed with KP Laura I believe we requested that a number of occasions and we still have not received that yet to determine what the scope of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=252.67s">So</a>  moving forward we know what resources are available to us.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=257.007s">Councilor</a>  Knight, you broke up on me a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=258.649s">Are</a>  you offering that as an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=260.53s">I</a>  am, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=261.612s">It's</a>  a resolution that's been offered a number of times in the past and has gone unanswered.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=267.758s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=268.879s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=277.547s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=280.19s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=281.61s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=281.79s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=282.131s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=283.232s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=283.552s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=284.553s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=285.274s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=285.494s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=285.654s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=286.135s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=304.003s">We</a>  have resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the mayor meet with the council president to develop a plan to safely hold pre-budget and budget hearings in a non-virtual setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=317.391s">Council</a>  on the night.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=320.588s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=323.41s">Although</a>  technology is wonderful, it's not so wonderful sometimes when we're trying to conduct the efficient operation of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=331.616s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I think that we're at a point right now where we understand COVID-19 and the coronavirus to ensure that we're protected and meet in a non-virtual setting to address the very important issue of the city's finances in the upcoming budget for the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=350.465s">So</a>  I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=353.448s">Although</a>  virtual meetings are great, I don't think that they have the same.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=357.071s">I</a>  think we lost Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=368.112s">We</a>  had number two, Vice President Caraviello, you wanted to speak on this if you could.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=372.035s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=372.756s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=374.277s">I</a>  had made a suggestion to you I think some time back on a setting that we could probably do. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=380.763s">We</a>  could probably use the little theater at the high school and place the Councilors on the stage six feet apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=388.77s">the</a>  whoever department head would be down on the floor and whoever's representing the administration could be down on the floor and the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=397.873s">And</a>  that would make 10 people which would be allowed by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=401.734s">And</a>  again, like I said, this is probably the most important budget that the city's faced in the last 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=410.516s">And</a>  I think as we all know, just being on these meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=417.443s">with</a>  simple stuff is difficult, nevermind things as difficult as a budget that really should be done in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=425.086s">So</a>  I offered that as a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=428.467s">I</a>  said the little theater is plenty big enough to put everybody on stage and keep it within the 10 people as required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=438.23s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=441.031s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=442.544s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I think my question just got addressed I was just trying to identify whether there was idea of any in person public participation but this is solely to clarify for the council and then any representatives, relative to their specific budgets that would be presented, correct.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=460.478s">Council</a>  night.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=463.741s">Ultimately,</a>  the way I envisioned it is that we can all be in a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=468.466s">conducting</a>  the business of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=469.847s">And</a>  if individual residents have questions or concerns, I do believe based upon your leadership, we've been able to enable some video conferencing in certain areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=479.131s">And</a>  I think that could transcend over to the little theater or to other aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=483.393s">Our</a>  community media center is very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=485.394s">Patrick</a>  Gordon's done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=487.415s">He's</a>  an award-winning producer that we have over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=489.536s">So</a>  I'm sure that if we put our heads together, we'll be able to come up with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=493.392s">But</a>  if we look at the resolution, the resolution is to ask the President and the Mayor to meet and discuss ways that we can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=499.618s">So</a>  I think we should have everything on the table, Mr. President, and come up with something that works for all.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=504.062s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=505.123s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=506.844s">Councilor</a>  Morell, did you have any further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=509.186s">Did</a>  that answer your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=510.748s">Yep,</a>  that covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=511.428s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=511.788s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=514.291s">Any</a>  other questions from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=517.69s">So</a>  I will be more than happy to talk with the mayor to see if that's something that we can do, see if it's feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=525.333s">So</a>  I can reach out to her to discuss that and we can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=530.375s">Are</a>  there any other questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=534.617s">Any</a>  other questions from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=539.639s">Clerk</a>  Cardavis, any emails regarding this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=545.141s">No</a>  emails on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=547.263s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=555.146s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=556.967s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=563.61s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=565.01s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=566.311s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=599.525s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=601.986s">When</a>  I had put this on there, there were some issues over there, and I had talked to the chief of staff and the mayor about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=609.708s">And</a>  I'm glad that the mayor did put out a robo call over the weekend addressing what was going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=617.671s">For</a>  those of you who don't know, our cemetery is nice as it is, but I don't think it was meant to be a playground for people to go there and play. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=628.297s">Children</a>  were running over the graves and running, riding their bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=631.878s">And</a>  the day before someone is buried, they usually dig the hole and put plywood over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=638.5s">And</a>  the kids were jumping on the wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=639.961s">And</a>  I'd hate to see somebody, a child, get hurt over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=643.702s">And</a>  also due to the fact, there's a lot of cars driving, heavy equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=649.424s">And</a>  some of the people that are over there, maybe their driving skills have been a little bit diminished over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=657.431s">You</a>  know, a young kid rides out on his bike and someone may not see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=661.975s">And</a>  I said, I'd hate to see someone get hurt over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=665.477s">And</a>  I'm glad the mayor took the steps to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=671.042s">And</a>  over the weekend, there wasn't many people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=674.484s">So</a>  I thank her for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=676.746s">And</a>  like I say, the problem has hopefully been eliminated.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=683.371s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=686.783s">Mr.</a>  President, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=689.385s">I</a>  live, I can see that gate to the cemetery from my front stairs, and the amount of volume of people that are going through there is tremendous right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=699.471s">And</a>  when you <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=702.873s">see</a>  the faces, they're not familiar faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=704.754s">We</a>  have a lot of out-of-state license plates parking along, out-of-city license, out-of-city stickers, out-of-city people parking along Placeland Road, utilizing the cemetery for open space because the parks and their communities have been closed down too. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=717.764s">You</a>  know, we utilize it quite frequently for passive recreation purposes, but it's getting to the point now where I've had discussions with operators of heavy equipment that work in the DPW that have said that they're being approached <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=732.635s">by</a>  people saying, can you not drive the bulldozer down this street? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=735.937s">Cause</a>  I want my kid to ride the bike down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=738.498s">You</a>  know, they have a job to do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=740.319s">So</a>  I too echo councilor Caraviello's sentiment statements and I support his resolution wholeheartedly and second it.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=849.646s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=850.509s">I</a>  promise to keep my remarks G rated. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=854.948s">So</a>  yes, the city was able to purchase 10,000 masks, of which 5,000 will be distributed at a drive-through this Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=863.452s">Between</a>  12 and two, it's available to all Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=866.694s">We're</a>  packaging up in Ziploc bags with three masks each, and we'll distribute as many as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=873.197s">Supplies,</a>  of course, are limited, but we'll be handing them out until we're out. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=878.1s">We'll</a>  also be able to, we were also, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=881.121s">We</a>  have a gifted number of plants from Encore Boston Harbor, about 1,000 different plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=885.184s">So</a>  we'll be distributing those as well ahead of Mother's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=887.786s">So</a>  we do have volunteers who are going to be working there down at Hormel Stadium between 12 and 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=893.79s">We're</a>  excited to be able to provide the resource as well as the benefit of the flowers to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=898.853s">But</a>  again, supplies are limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=900.314s">So</a>  it's a first come, first served basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=903.676s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=904.477s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=906.418s">Thanks,</a>  Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=907.199s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=910.513s">Is</a>  this going to be the first of hopefully many or is this just as far as we've gotten in the planning right now?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=916.275s">We</a>  hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=916.955s">Yeah,</a>  as we all know, stuff like this is very hard to come by, but we're doing the best we can to try to track it down for the protection of first responders, as well as the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=928.879s">These</a>  are non-surgical masks, these are just face coverings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=931.86s">so</a>  they would not be appropriate in a medical setting or a first responder setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=936.581s">So</a>  these are designed to comply with the standing Medford order that's been in place for about three and a half weeks, as well as the governor's order, which echoes our order starting tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=947.223s">So</a>  the 5,000 of which will be distributed at the drive-through, the other 5,000 will be available for senior citizens at the senior center and to other vulnerable populations to deliver, as well as DPW and some other public employees.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=962.236s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=976.529s">Yeah,</a>  so they're not the washable fabric ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=978.671s">They're</a>  the disposable kind of medical paper ones that are suitable for everyday face coverings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=986.837s">So</a>  they're a little better than the fabric ones in terms of face coverings, but they don't reach the N95 or the medical grade.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=995.264s">And</a>  will information be provided as far as, I guess, the recommended number of uses of this type of mask?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1003.09s">Yeah,</a>  some guidance will be included within each packet by the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1007.105s">appropriate</a>  amount of time to wear them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1013.148s">How</a>  many times you can wear them and the appropriate amount of use.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1230.254s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Light.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1231.994s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1233.335s">I've</a>  gotten to know Mike over the years, and I'll tell you, he's just someone you like to be around. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1238.517s">He's</a>  a soft-spoken guy, a gentleman, and I really just want to congratulate him on his 32 years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1246.198s">and</a>  wish him all the best as he pursues his golden years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1250.641s">I</a>  think it's important to point out that right around the same time that Lieutenant Endicott retired with 32 years of service, he also turned 65 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1261.408s">So</a>  Mr. President, that'll tell you that half of this gentleman's life was spent providing service and public safety to the city of Medford and its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1272.316s">So</a>  that's something that's certainly commendable, and I wish him all the best moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1277.063s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1278.124s">And</a>  if I may add, I didn't meet Michael until I was actually gone out to the city council, but Lieutenant Endicott is a great person, very committed to the community and like to thank him for his continuous commitment to the city of Medford and to the highest service. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1299.556s">So</a>  we thank him for his many years of service to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1304.079s">So</a>  thank you, Lieutenant Endicott. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1306.158s">and</a>  congratulations on your retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1309.94s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1314.303s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1503.768s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1506.31s">I</a>  thank Councilor Bears for bringing this measure forward and him bringing up the Courtyard nursing home and the circumstances surrounding that raised further concern and, you know, with everything that's going on in the community and all the discussions and talks and rumors about what's going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1527.468s">I</a>  think it's important that we really take a long, hard look at the circumstances and situation that's been surrounding the courtyard nursing home. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1535.974s">You</a>  know, from what I understand, I think the Holyoke Soldier's Home has the highest rate of infection for nursing homes in the state, and the courtyard isn't too far behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1548.081s">It's,</a>  you know, my understanding that various federal and state entities have reached out <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1554.792s">some</a>  help and some planning to prevent the further spread of COVID and were turned away. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1561.437s">Rumors,</a>  I don't know if there's any truth to it, but we had the chief of staff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1564.599s">Maybe</a>  he can, you know, explain to us a little bit about what circumstances had happened, when and where, who knew what, when and what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1572.705s">The</a>  latest I heard was that the Army National Guard had offered its services to help with the circumstances at the courtyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1582.152s">And</a>  then the, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1583.911s">volunteerism</a>  was refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1586.112s">Um,</a>  and I think that, you know, we really need to take a long hard look at it, but first and foremost, um, you know, I'm not one that usually chases rumors down and we have the cheapest staff this evening with us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1596.254s">So</a>  hopefully you can put it into that, uh, you know, rumor mill discussion that's been going on around the community, because if that is factual, then it's very concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1604.996s">Um,</a>  so with that being said, Mr. President, I do raise the question, um, you know, what's, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1610.05s">what</a>  circumstances are going on at the courtyard that the city has been involved in, and what steps have been taken to help them address the issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1620.538s">And</a>  was any state or federal body extending help that was refused by the administration of the city during this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1629.305s">Those</a>  are the questions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1630.726s">Maybe</a>  Dave can help us out with this a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1641.96s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1643.223s">And</a>  again, thank you, Councilor Bears, for highlighting this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1647.771s">And</a>  this is something that we've been focused on since the... <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1651.184s">opening</a>  days of the pandemic, especially in our most vulnerable locations, the long-term care facilities, the nursing homes, of which Medford has three. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1660.332s">From</a>  the first case that we learned of at Courtyard, we mobilized immediately to try to advocate for them and get additional resources from the state level, both from the Department of Public Health, as well as the National Guard, to get them testing, to get them staffing help, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1676.405s">to</a>  get them whatever resources they may need in order to combat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1680.411s">The</a>  unfortunate reality is that this is, these are our most vulnerable populations that are all living in one place in the serious nature of the virus, in the contagious nature of the virus itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1692.548s">it</a>  will spread in a place like this like wildfire. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1695.77s">So</a>  getting them PPE, getting them testing, getting them staffing as appropriate was an immediate concern of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1702.814s">I</a>  know the mayor has been in constant contact with Secretary Sutter's office, the command center, the National Guard, Tom Mangan from MEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1711.738s">the</a>  Lieutenant Governor calling anybody and anybody in order to get resources there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1716.08s">I</a>  don't have any direct knowledge that Courtyard either turned down the circumstances of which the National Guard was there, and they turned away services, the nature of that, the circumstances of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1726.925s">I</a>  probably refer the question to Genesis and to Courtyard for the circumstances of that, as well as DPH, because I don't wanna talk out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1735.129s">I</a>  wasn't there, I didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1737.61s">So</a>  what I can say is that the city has taken <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1740.908s">every</a>  step it could possibly take to advocate for these residents, for these patients to get resources to these facilities in order to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1750.491s">The</a>  National Guard has been to Medford no fewer than six or seven times to do testing, multiple rounds of testing, testing patients, testing staff, testing administrators, whatever we can do in order to do that, we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1764.815s">So</a>  I'm confident in the city's <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1768.102s">confident</a>  in the city's response to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1771.283s">If</a>  there was more we could have done, we would have certainly done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1774.805s">But</a>  connecting the resources to those that could provide it, the DPHs and the National Guards of the world is exactly what we should have done and exactly what we did.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1784.769s">Mr.</a>  President, I thank Mr. Rodriguez for that breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1789.551s">I'd</a>  like to propose a B paper requesting that the administration provide us with a timeline of events and a breakdown of those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1797.279s">relative</a>  to what services and assistances were offered and which ones were accepted and rendered. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1805.204s">And</a>  I'd offer that in the form of a B paper, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1828.122s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1828.983s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, having a loved one right now in one of those facilities, I can speak firsthand about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1836.11s">I</a>  mean, these facilities are at their best on a good day, somewhat marginal. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1844.396s">Um,</a>  i've noticed the difference Um where my dad and my dad's at glenridge where the situation is only slightly better there than it is up at uh courtyard and that's also owned by genesis and i've talked to many people uh at at glenridge since genesis has brought has taken them over along with the courtyard and uh, i'm i'm gonna fall genesis a little bit on this, uh, because <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1873.058s">Staffing</a>  has gone down, and the level of care has gone down since Genesis has taken these facilities over. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1880.144s">And</a>  let's say, I know the mayor has done everything she's could. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1884.087s">I</a>  mean, there's only so much that the administration can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1887.33s">These</a>  are private facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1888.611s">And</a>  again, people that are in these facilities, a lot of them are sick, and they're frail. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1897.542s">it's</a>  very hard to take someone that has Alzheimer's or dementia and ask them to stay in their room. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1902.106s">So,</a>  you know, every day they're herded into this common area where they eat and convene. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1906.951s">So,</a>  I say it just festers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1909.133s">You</a>  know, they say there's just really no way that they can control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1913.717s">And</a>  again, I say, you know, my father's tested positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1918.161s">Fortunately,</a>  he's, you know, he's not showing any signs, but, you know, these facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1925.018s">I</a>  think after this is done, they're all going to need a major wake up call going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1933.644s">Because</a>  like I said, even on a good day, they're somewhat questionable or marginal. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1939.409s">So</a>  again, and I know the administration has done everything that they possibly can do to get help to them.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1946.674s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1950.817s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1952.484s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1953.565s">I</a>  want to thank council beers for bringing this up, uh, this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1958.188s">I</a>  also want to concur with council tonight that it's very important that the council receive a timeline of events, uh, through over the past eight weeks on, uh, what has occurred within the courtyard in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1971.618s">I</a>  also heard some troubling comments by a representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1975.073s">from</a>  courtyard, Mr. President, as early as today regarding what took place at the courtyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1982.677s">And</a>  it was stated, well, these particular clients are all over the age of 80. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1988.379s">And</a>  I think that's a pretty troubling comment to make, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1992.802s">I</a>  realize the nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, but that comment, I think, Mr. President, speaks volume on how maybe the situation was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2004.751s">Um,</a>  so I appreciate what Councilor Knight offered, and I want to concur with the timeline.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2011.919s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2012.92s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2014.481s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2015.362s">Again,</a>  thank you, Councilor Bears for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2018.305s">It</a>  is a time that we need to, as a community, reflect and really, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2023.85s">you</a>  know, pay homage to those people that have lost their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2027.311s">But</a>  I think that with what Councilor Knight brought up, if I could ask the Chief of Staff, Mr. Rodriguez, I'm so excited these masks are going out, but it also raises a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2041.334s">Are</a>  we hitting, are we reaching our most vulnerable population? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2045.515s">I</a>  mean, I know it's nice that we're doing our home out in this pickup of flowers, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2048.776s">But</a>  have we set some aside that are going directly to the senior centers, that are going directly to housing, that are going to the population that probably won't get to the homeless sites, pick them up? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2060.961s">Have</a>  we done that, have thought of that yet?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2062.861s">Of</a>  course, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2063.502s">5,000</a>  will be handed out through the drive-thru. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2066.103s">5,000</a>  are being held back for seniors and vulnerable population as well as public employees.</p>
