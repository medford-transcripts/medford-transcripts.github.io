[SPEAKER_06]: I will be acting as chair tonight.

4
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:11,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

5
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:13,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Aveda?

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:15,479

[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Caldera present.

14
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,631
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we have five members present.

15
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:31,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe all other members are confirmed absent.

16
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:33,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can get started.

17
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:35,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, can you please kick us off?

18
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:46,063
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first item on the agenda is 85 Elm Street case number A-2024-25.

19
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue from January 2nd.

20
00:00:51,007 --> 00:01:07,640
[SPEAKER_00]: 2025, applicant and owner 8385 Elm Street LLC to demolish and convert a legal non-conforming motor vehicle repair station to a three-unit townhouse-style residential building in a single-family, two-zoning district, requiring a variance of frontage, lot width, and usable open space per the City of Medford's ongoing as Chapter 94 Table D, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:18,429
[SPEAKER_00]: A variance as to parking pursuant to Chapter 94, 6.1.3, a variance as to use pursuant to Chapter 94, 11.42, or alternatively, a special permit to change a non-conforming use to set forth in Chapter 94, 5.21.

22
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,489
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you, Dennis.

23
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I see we have Attorney Desmond for the applicant.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the board received a letter requesting a continuance.

25
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:31,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Desmond, anything you'd like to share before we vote on that?

26
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:32,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

27
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:38,758
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, we continue this matter for financial evidences to the cost of hardship.

28
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:45,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was supposed to get together with Dr. Anthony Bover and the contractor who he had retained in order to do that.

29
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:50,064
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a fire on Hell Street on January 8th that displaced

30
00:01:50,624 --> 00:02:00,892
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of his tenants, and he has been dealing with that through the month of January, both with his contractor and himself, to get those tenants relocated and then get them back in the building.

31
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:05,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So he hasn't had an opportunity to sit down with me, nor has his contractor.

32
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm asking for continuance to the February meeting.

33
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,422
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you.

34
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:18,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, in light of those unfortunate circumstances, that certainly seems reasonable to me.

35
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Members of the board, anything we should discuss before we vote on continuation?

36
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:29,403
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

37
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:34,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to the next regular meeting of the Metro Zoning Board of Appeals.

38
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

39
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:38,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

40
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:39,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

41
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:40,526
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

42
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a roll call.

43
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:42,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris?

44
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:44,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

45
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:45,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

46
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:45,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

47
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:47,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary?

48
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:47,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

49
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Yvette?

50
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

51
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:52,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, yes.

52
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:53,473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

53
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:54,994
[SPEAKER_06]: This matter is continued.

54
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope everything works out and we will see you next month.

55
00:02:58,656 --> 00:02:58,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

56
00:02:58,856 --> 00:02:59,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrific.

57
00:02:59,116 --> 00:02:59,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

58
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:00,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.

59
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:01,017
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

60
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:03,038
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

61
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:04,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, what do we have next?

62
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:22,652
[SPEAKER_00]: 171 Arlington Street, case number A-2025-01, applicant and owner Alexander Wong-Berman and Lauren Mayo, to install an additional 171 Arlington Street within the side yard setback extending existing side yard setback nonconformity, which is not allowed per the City of Metro-Doran's Chapter 94 Table B Table of Dimensional Requirements.

63
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:25,693
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

64
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:29,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a representative for the applicant on this matter?

65
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

66
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the call.

67
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:34,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second.

68
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:38,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I confirmed that they got the notice.

69
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:38,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to them.

70
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just see if maybe something has gone on.

71
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my emails.

72
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds great.

73
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis.

74
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,079
[SPEAKER_00]: just give me a minute.

75
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:41,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at their number and give them a call to see if maybe something happens.

76
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:41,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

77
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:42,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

78
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:43,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

79
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:43,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

80
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we're going to take a five minute recess.

81
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:53,069
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll we'll check back in five minutes.

82
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:05,097
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, I mean, we're not, we still have another few minutes to go, but I will just sort of napkin.

83
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,158
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an ill child, so they will be on shortly.

84
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:13,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

85
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:13,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Dennis.

86
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, it is 646.

87
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:23,309
[SPEAKER_06]: We are back from our five minute recess.

88
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give members of the board a moment to pop back on camera.

89
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:33,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It also looks like the applicant is in the process of connecting.

90
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:38,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just give them a moment and then we can resume.

91
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:12,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It says they're connecting to audio, so I'm guessing they're having some input issues.

92
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:17,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst case, we can let them call in.

93
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's give it another minute.

94
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,019
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

95
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, this is Mike.

96
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm chairing this meeting.

97
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:48,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I see an Alex Wong Berman in the chat.

98
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that is the applicant.

99
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, correct.

100
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

101
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:55,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

102
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:56,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can hear you.

103
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dennis filled us in on the details.

104
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:03,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad you are now here.

105
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:07,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And the floor is yours.

106
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:08,813
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hearing your case.

107
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:11,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, absolutely.

108
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:19,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are applying for the special permit to extend an existing nonconforming structure.

109
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:33,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So our house is nonconforming on the, if you're facing the building on the right hand side, and that the setback is less than the 7.5 feet required by the city of Medford.

110
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:41,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd like to build an addition onto the house to accommodate our growing family.

111
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:48,625
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife is due in April with our second and only a two-bedroom place with a one-and-a-half bath.

112
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:55,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd like to add on an additional bedroom, add in some additional space for the children to grow and play in.

113
00:07:56,683 --> 00:08:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And to do that, we'd like to extend the structure straight back into the backyard, which would continue that nonconforming setback on that side of the house.

114
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,732
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not going to make any of the setbacks any worse than they already are.

115
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:14,333
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

116
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:14,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

117
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:22,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think you already said this, but I'm just going to doubly confirm for the board.

118
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So with this extension,

119
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:29,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So the side yard is already in violation.

120
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're just extending that without making it worse.

121
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:38,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the total extension doesn't create any new nonconformity.

122
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:50,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only nonconformity that's being extended is the one side yard, no new nonconformity being created, and no nonconformity being made worse.

123
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

124
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,000
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

125
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:54,601
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:05,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, I know the board has this file, but just in case there's anyone watching on Medford Community Media, could you maybe throw up the plan so the board can see?

128
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:07,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it up now?

129
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:08,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

130
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:08,983
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.

131
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:13,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're looking at the plot plan with update PDF file.

132
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:26,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, my error was running along the existing side yard setback that is nonconforming and I'm extending down to where the proposed addition will be where it will extend the existing nonconformity.

133
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

134
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Dennis.

135
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:39,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So just for general awareness, in cases where a

136
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:45,599
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an extension proposed to an existing nonconformity.

137
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't create any new nonconformities.

138
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,522
[SPEAKER_06]: The standard is a special permit.

139
00:09:52,602 --> 00:10:05,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the board finds no substantial detriment to the neighborhood, that would be the criterion to allow this to go forward.

140
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Having said that, I will

141
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,236
[SPEAKER_06]: open it up to the board for questions for the applicant.

142
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:25,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I saw Chris unmute first.

143
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Chris.

144
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

145
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Through you to the applicant, is there an abutter to the side that's

146
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:46,709
[SPEAKER_02]: for which the permit is being applied for, the short side?

147
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:52,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an embudder next door that you've spoken with?

148
00:10:52,331 --> 00:11:03,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any documentation of their desires in this regard?

149
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have spoken to them.

150
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: We're friendly with them on that side.

151
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:14,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have no issues with the extension there.

152
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,541
[SPEAKER_04]: There is another neighbor on that side a little further down.

153
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:25,904
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they don't, to my knowledge, live in the state of Massachusetts.

154
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And their tenants are renters.

155
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:32,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have not yet been able to get in touch with them.

156
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:40,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a parking lot for the tenants to park on the other side of our fence.

157
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:42,218
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Lauren, by the way.

158
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:43,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the wife.

159
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,100
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a parking lot on the other side of the fence.

160
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So we wouldn't be.

161
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Up against their house, essentially, with the extension.

162
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a parking lot to buffer that.

163
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:04,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not right up against the fence.

164
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,236
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll go to Andre next.

165
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

166
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:22,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that was basically my question was about the abutter at 165 Arlington.

167
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:31,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have anything in writing from them or just verbal?

168
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:36,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's verbal so far, but I can check my text messages.

169
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,617
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be something there, but we would,

170
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,122
[SPEAKER_04]: easily be able to obtain something if that was helpful.

171
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you're looking at the plot plan for some reason.

172
00:12:45,605 --> 00:13:00,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Our technology isn't cooperating today, but it's really just the very corner of their property that it would extend along because the existing structure already goes through all but I think the last maybe three or four feet.

173
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:05,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Alongside the property line, so just be extending that last.

174
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:13,632
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 or 4 feet in the very corner again, there's also a buffer zone between their house and that side yard.

175
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:14,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

176
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:15,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

177
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:18,239
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was looking at the Google Street View and everything.

178
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:29,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that gives me more confidence because it is such a small side setback that there's a large yard on that side.

179
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:40,104
[SPEAKER_03]: As you said, the rear tenant, you're not coming up against a structure there as well.

180
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:42,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really their parking area.

181
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:45,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was really all I had.

182
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

183
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:51,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions from the board?

184
00:13:56,744 --> 00:14:00,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, we're going to open it up to public comment.

185
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:10,171
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a member of the public and you'd like to comment on this matter, you may do so now, but please either raise your hand on Zoom

186
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:20,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn on your camera, raise your hand, type something in the chat, or you can email Dennis D. McDougal at medford-ma.gov.

187
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:39,124
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I do not see any members of the public

188
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:41,938
[SPEAKER_06]: who would like to speak on this matter.

189
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:47,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

190
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:50,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

191
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

192
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:52,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

193
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:53,965
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

194
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,106
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take a roll call.

195
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:55,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

196
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:57,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

197
00:14:58,388 --> 00:14:58,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary?

198
00:14:58,768 --> 00:14:59,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

199
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:00,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

200
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

201
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris?

202
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

203
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:03,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?

204
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:04,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

205
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:05,292
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

206
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,552
[SPEAKER_06]: We are now deliberating.

207
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:07,373
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, folks?

208
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:23,784
[SPEAKER_08]: We are very excited to embark on our, you know, extension of the house and to be continuing members of the Medford community.

209
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:26,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So allow us to continue to be residents here with our family.

210
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So very thankful and excited about this opportunity.

211
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,593
[SPEAKER_08]: We decided that Medford, that this home would be our forever home.

212
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:40,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially with the

213
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:48,965
[SPEAKER_08]: new taxes related in the city of Medford to put more money towards schools.

214
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:56,091
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're very much looking forward to continuing to build our family here and many memories.

215
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

216
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll open it up to thoughts from members of the board in deliberation.

217
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre, please go ahead.

218
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any significant detriment here.

219
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:38,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, any concern would be because of the abutters, but because of the layout of the properties and the abutters, I think that there's really very little cause for concern and it's great to be able to stabilize a family and have long-term roots here in Medford.

220
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:42,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Andre.

221
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:43,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from members of the board?

222
00:16:50,129 --> 00:17:00,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I tend to agree with Andre, so I don't believe that there's significant detriment in terms of granting this.

223
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:02,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mary.

224
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:03,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris?

225
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am also in agreement that doesn't seem to be any

226
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:10,179
[SPEAKER_02]: detriment.

227
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:34,233
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I am curious about how, as a board, we seek out the immediate abutters written documentation of approval or of disapproval for such things.

228
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we're making this decision here.

229
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,251
[SPEAKER_02]: ad hoc, and I'm a little bit uncomfortable with that.

230
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:44,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.

231
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:46,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, if I can just sort of jump in.

232
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:58,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is sort of just, so everyone within, you know, a butter is still butter, so two houses in every direction, all surrounding the house, get a notification with my contact info and a session meeting.

233
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:00,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's really, I mean,

234
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:10,260
[SPEAKER_00]: If the applicant can get letters of support from neighbors, that's great, but it's not a requirement and sometimes it's hard to do.

235
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,801
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually in this instance, the owner has been notified.

236
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:25,505
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, sometimes the absence of... I've always found that

237
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:35,553
[SPEAKER_00]: in my 10 plus years of doing this, that if a neighbor really doesn't want this to happen, they will contact me, if that makes sense.

238
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been aware, they've gotten the notification.

239
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:39,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the notifications went out.

240
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:48,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I send out these notifications, I also send a notification to myself, just so it goes through the system, so I know it's actually not lost in the ether.

241
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:54,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And then speaking to both, I think Alex mentioned that a couple of the neighbors mentioned they had gotten the notices.

242
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,561
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in that instance.

243
00:18:57,161 --> 00:19:00,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying, I believe him and his word.

244
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:08,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wondering sometimes we do get it and it sways the board, you know, one way or the other.

245
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:19,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually in the affirmative, but it seems to be, you know, sometimes we get them and sometimes we don't.

246
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So just bring it.

247
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:30,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to add, so Chris, like Dennis mentioned, getting it in writing is not a requirement.

248
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of up to the applicant.

249
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: They can optionally choose to try to do that.

250
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:47,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what we need to do as a board, so it's not just ad hoc or arbitrary, is to weigh the evidence available.

251
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:51,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And in cases where we feel that

252
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:59,414
[SPEAKER_06]: The decision would be really contingent on a particular piece of information.

253
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:04,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the cases where a member of the board might suggest and seek

254
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:11,810
[SPEAKER_06]: permission from the applicant to continue the matter while they gather that evidence.

255
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not required to do so.

256
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:20,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is kind of this trade-off where it does have implications in terms of timeline.

257
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:34,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And so sometimes, since it's not required, if it seems like a project that's not really going to rattle any cages, the board might just choose to infer what

258
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:37,923
[SPEAKER_06]: what it would have said or take the applicant at their word.

259
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:53,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would recommend if there's a member of the board whose vote might really hinge on a particular piece of information that they should just make that clear and we can discuss with the applicant continuation or things of that nature.

260
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I do bring this up since the setback is so

261
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,650
[SPEAKER_02]: so narrow there.

262
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very narrow situation.

263
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:30,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So for whatever reason, if the abutter did not receive notice or if the person somehow, and I'm not implying that's the case in this particular case, but just in this or whatever future case that there's a misrepresentation of some feelings on one side or the other, et cetera, that it's not in writing.

264
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's, that's what I was wondering about.

265
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure.

266
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:37,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

267
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, we don't set a precedent in what we do here.

268
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:49,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's important just philosophically that the board be consistent in how it approaches things, but we do.

269
00:21:50,455 --> 00:21:52,496
[SPEAKER_06]: get a good deal of discretion.

270
00:21:52,896 --> 00:22:11,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can kind of subjectively assess individually, is this a project that's risky in terms of maybe a neighbor has an opinion and just didn't put it all together and make it on the call or put something in writing?

271
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:17,726
[SPEAKER_06]: We're able to handle those cases differently than a case where

272
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:24,598
[SPEAKER_06]: John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His): You know the the proposed changes is pretty John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His): straightforward.

273
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:31,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but that's for every member of the board to decide not trying to John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His): sway you one way or the other.

274
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:33,266
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just want to reassure you that

275
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:47,641
[SPEAKER_06]: if the board were to take a certain action in this case, and then some hypothetical future case where there was like a really extreme scenario, you came up and there was no letter and the applicant said, oh, yeah, the neighbor's fine.

276
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:54,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That wouldn't box us in and require us to handle that case the same way.

277
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:56,568
[SPEAKER_06]: The facts of every case are different.

278
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

279
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:03,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Mike.

280
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,171
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

281
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board.

282
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,363
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm not seeing any.

283
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:23,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just add, I tend to agree with the other members that the extension seems relatively straightforward.

284
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:31,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is exactly the sort of case why this special permit process exists in the lesser standards.

285
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:39,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not needing to justify variances in cases where it's just kind of logically extending a structure without making anything worse.

286
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And so having said that, Chair awaits a motion.

287
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:58,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Notions would either be with respect to the special permit, or if there's an ask to continue, that would be the other motion.

288
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So do I hear a motion from the board?

289
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:05,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

290
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:09,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the special permit for 171 Arlington Street.

291
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:12,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a second?

292
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:15,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

293
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,675
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

294
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:21,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to go ahead and take a roll call vote.

295
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:23,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary?

296
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

297
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris?

298
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:26,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

299
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:27,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

300
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:29,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

301
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:30,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

302
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:31,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

303
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:32,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?

304
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:33,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

305
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:34,487
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

306
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,789
[SPEAKER_06]: So the special permit is approved.

307
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:38,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dennis, could you just

308
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:42,264
[SPEAKER_06]: go through some of the details with the applicant about what to expect next?

309
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:42,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

310
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:45,886
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alex and Lauren, I'm going to be writing up the decision.

311
00:24:45,906 --> 00:24:49,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, in this case, it's a similar one to other ones we've done.

312
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a kind of a boilerplate I can use.

313
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to get on that in the next week or so.

314
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that's done, then it'll get sent off to our legal counsel for just vetting.

315
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that is finished, it comes back to me.

316
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I send it off for signatures.

317
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:12,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Once signatures are in place, then it will be filed in the city clerk's office.

318
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:15,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a lot of ands here.

319
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:18,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period.

320
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:27,450
[SPEAKER_00]: At the conclusion of that 20 days appeals period, you can come in, talk to the clerk's office, get a letter from them, and then go to the building department and get your building permit.

321
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

322
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:37,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, just how many days is that from today?

323
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:39,714
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

324
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:43,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know my anticipation is to try to get the decision done in the next week or so.

325
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:49,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's fairly straightforward 1 and then, but then once that then it goes off to legal and I don't.

326
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:53,620
[SPEAKER_00]: The person who was doing it is no longer doing it.

327
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a new person doing it.

328
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:58,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of knew the old person's schedule and the turnaround on them.

329
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not sure with the new person.

330
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:04,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a matter of probably a week or so after that.

331
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:09,032
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let's look at, say, the end of

332
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:20,377
[SPEAKER_00]: February, early March, so I'd say by the time 20 days from that is done, middle of March, end of March, I'd say, more than likely, so.

333
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:27,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you appreciate that and understand that just an estimate pending the turnaround time legal review.

334
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then I know also you all have to come before the concom at some point anyway.

335
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:35,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you sort of want to, but now that you've got the approval here, we can sort of go in that route.

336
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:37,365
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they talked to me about both.

337
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:44,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's, it's, I found it's better to do zoning 1st, then concom than the other way because zoning things can change sometimes.

338
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:46,971
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then we'll get them through that process.

339
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:51,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they can get pretty much all of them done and by around the same time.

340
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:52,274
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can get get cracking.

341
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:54,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

342
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:55,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

343
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:56,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And one last thing to add.

344
00:26:56,996 --> 00:27:05,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so yes, what Dennis shared is just an estimate, but there is a statutory limit to how long we can take to get the decision.

345
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:14,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, you're kind of covered in a worst case scenario, but in this case, Dennis is committing to do it faster because this is a relatively straightforward one.

346
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:19,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, so yeah, I think as long as he gets a quick response from the

347
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: lawyers reviewing i think it will be relatively well it will be along the lines of what you just shared thank you great um thank you have a good night all right the next item on the agenda is administrative updates do we have any administrative updates dennis i think the only one which is what i sort of mentioned earlier you know uh

348
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:56,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you prior is that, you know, our, I can hear you say it on here, just, and also just to say thanks that our, Jenny Thompson was our chair, had to step down due to some work, he just stepped down.

349
00:27:56,945 --> 00:28:01,646
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to go into his specifics, but, you know, I just wanted to say publicly, thanks.

350
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:12,129
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on the commission for over four years now, I think, and, you know, through two 40B projects, and he has put a lot of time and effort into this commission, and I thank him for everything he's done for us.

351
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just wanted to say that publicly.

352
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:18,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I echo those sentiments, Dennis.

353
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:21,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie has done a great job in his time on the board.

354
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be a shame to not have him on the board anymore, but we wish him the best.

355
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:40,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as I understand it, Dennis, we'll just have an agenda item for our next meeting to officially elect our next chair, which is

356
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,758
[SPEAKER_06]: almost the same time.

357
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:49,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's the meeting where really, I think we should typically collect the new chair anyway.

358
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're probably right, since most people's terms are up in March, so that sort of fits in.

359
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:56,868
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so I'll put that out there, and then just to give you all a heads up, so we have a

360
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:04,785
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a smart sheets thing, which, you know, people submit into the city, uh, their interest in boards and commissions.

361
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:06,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually it's just one of the community media.

362
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:09,188
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go on to the mayor's office.

363
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:16,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if anyone's interested, you can submit your information and, you know, it gets reviewed and it'll get reviewed by myself initially.

364
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:19,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll forward it off to the, this office's director.

365
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:24,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we come to a conclusion, then we'll hopefully try to get someone on fairly quickly.

366
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:27,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be back up to a seven person, uh,

367
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:29,195
[SPEAKER_00]: board by the time of the next meeting.

368
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:31,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds great.

369
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:32,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Andre.

370
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:34,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a question for Dennis.

371
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, could you just recirculate the terms of all the board members?

372
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:42,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can do that.

373
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have that.

374
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:46,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mayor's office has that, so I probably should have it.

375
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Our clerk might have it, but I'll check with Jackie.

376
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:52,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it got circulated at one point, but- Probably.

377
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:54,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt that it did.

378
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:57,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's online.

379
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be on the city's website anyway.

380
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:00,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

381
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,710
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can, I can, I can run it over to all of us as well.

382
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sort of grab that.

383
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:07,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

384
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:07,676
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

385
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:07,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

386
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:10,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

387
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any meeting minutes, too?

388
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:14,773
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, but I have good news.

389
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:25,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know AI is terrible for creating art, but apparently it's kind of, I did a test one yesterday for the ComCom, and it's actually not bad at least helping get meeting minutes started.

390
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:32,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically, it still involves a lot of going through it, but it's way less time than, because basically it's

391
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,212
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so far, it's been all right.

392
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it about six months ago and it was...

393
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:43,738
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't good.

394
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:56,761
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one of our other people with staff and commission said that it's improved leaps and bounds, which is frightening, but the fact that it has is good for my sanity in terms of getting meeting minutes done.

395
00:30:56,801 --> 00:31:04,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sort of running through that and it's basically, it creates just an entire summary and then you can go through the summary and then you have to

396
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,545
[SPEAKER_00]: tweak it and add things in and it mishears names, it mishears places.

397
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:27,451
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to, you still have to read through it, but it does save some of the heavy lifting in terms of transcribing, which has always been my biggest problem, you know, problem with this is just, you know, because you kind of basically are listening to the meanings, looking at my notes and going back and forth and it takes a very long time.

398
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:28,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this will,

399
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:35,611
[SPEAKER_00]: clear up a lot, so hopefully by the time the next meeting, I'll have a number of meeting minutes for you all to your approval.

400
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:37,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

401
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:39,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the update, Dennis.

402
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,515
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I think that brings us to the end of our agenda.

403
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:44,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

404
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:47,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion.

405
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

406
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,181
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

407
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:52,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris?

408
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:53,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

409
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:55,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

410
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:55,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

411
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:56,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary?

412
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:57,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

413
00:31:57,964 --> 00:31:58,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

414
00:31:59,645 --> 00:31:59,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

415
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:01,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, aye?

416
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:03,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We are now adjourned.

417
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:04,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, everybody.

418
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night.
