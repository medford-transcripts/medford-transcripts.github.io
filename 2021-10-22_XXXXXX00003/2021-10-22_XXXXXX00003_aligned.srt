00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:07,437
The following interview is with Zach Bares.

2
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:12,858
Information for the intro was taken from Zach's campaign website, which will be linked to in the show notes.

3
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:19,480
Zach Bares is a lifelong resident of the Fulton Heights neighborhood in Medford and a graduate of the Medford Public Schools.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
Zach is in his first term as a city councilor and is running for re-election.

5
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:32,462
During his first term, Zach is proud to have proposed 95 resolutions, 87 of which have passed or are still being worked on in committee.

6
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:40,305
Zach has also worked to grow the movement of racial and social justice in Medford, pushing for racism to be declared a public health crisis.

7
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:52,990
Zach continues to be a voice behind this declaration, pushing for transformative change to address systemic racism and create welcoming public schools and city government on principles of justice and equality.

8
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:57,965
Hi, Zach.

9
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,546
Thanks so much for joining me today.

10
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:03,588
I know we're less than a week away from the election, so I really appreciate you making the time to talk with me.

11
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:04,489
Absolutely.

12
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:17,856
And so, like, along with talking about city council and your reelection, I've been asking everybody about, like, kind of their favorite spot to eat in Medford, or if they have, like, a go-to, like, snack or drink that they would choose from a local place.

13
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:19,537
Totally.

14
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:24,679
I mean, I think favorite spot to eat is tough, because there's so many good ones.

15
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:40,973
go-to snack slash drink is a raspberry lime Rickey at Colleen's, which I think is a long-term, since I was a kid, something that I just always liked.

16
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:50,818
And it's nice after a long budget meeting at City Hall on a Saturday, go down to Colleen's and get a raspberry lime Rickey.

17
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:51,739
So I love that.

18
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,880
And I love Colleen's.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,981
It's just got such a great vibe.

20
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,991
Yeah, I think I've had ice cream there before.

21
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,132
But yeah, it looks like a fun place to go into.

22
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:02,914
Yeah, it's kind of like a diner-y feel.

23
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:06,937
But it's just such a community hub and has been for a long time.

24
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:09,639
And I'm just glad that it's still kicking.

25
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:10,579
Yeah, I know.

26
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,243
And I was posting on Facebook about the podcast and seeing if folks had different businesses they wanted to talk about.

27
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,184
Colleagues came up a lot.

28
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,026
So hopefully we'll get to talk to them on the podcast at some point.

29
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,126
That would be awesome.

30
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:22,407
Cool.

31
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:29,029
So we're going to talk a little bit about your race for re-election for city council.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,012
But if we could start out just kind of talking about your path to local politics in Redford, what's leading you here.

33
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:47,321
Yeah, I mean, it really, when I decided to run, it was a pretty last minute decision, actually, which is not normal for, I think, most people.

34
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:54,804
But I didn't really necessarily see myself running for office for a long time.

35
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:59,887
I've always liked politics and thought it's incredibly important to be involved.

36
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:04,348
But being elected and the work that that takes,

37
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,216
I didn't really think it would happen so soon.

38
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:17,888
And right before, you know, the summer before the 2019 election, I kind of looked around and

39
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:29,991
For me, a big issue is cost of housing in Medford and what that means for people who have, you know, I grew up here, I'd love to stay here, I love it here, or people who want to move in.

40
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:35,454
And I kind of looked around and didn't necessarily see

41
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:42,863
you know, people that I thought were going to represent me and push that issue forward.

42
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:57,925
So I had worked on mayoral campaigns in the city, been involved in issues, and decided that if anyone could do it, starting at the end of July, maybe I could do it.

43
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:04,267
So it was a short on-ramp, but, you know, it worked out.

44
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,207
It was an exciting campaign.

45
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:18,207
And I've been glad that I made the decision because I think no one could have expected a pandemic and everything that has come with that, especially around housing.

46
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:22,748
And I'm glad to have been able to be on the council at this time.

47
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:23,488
Yeah.

48
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,209
And you're signing up to try to do it again.

49
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:26,910
Yes.

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,470
That says something, right?

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,110
Yeah.

52
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,192
I mean, we have a lot of work to do, so I would like to, I'd like to get to work even more.

53
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:37,073
We've done quite a bit, but.

54
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,747
There's so much we can do and so many things that I think are really no brainers that, you know, with the right counsel, we could get done quickly.

55
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:46,387
Yeah.

56
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:47,048
Yeah.

57
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:51,852
So it sounds like you're speaking to kind of like priorities you might have for change like to be continued to work on.

58
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:52,533
Yeah.

59
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,554
So what are those things?

60
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:54,474
What does that look like for you?

61
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:55,235
Yeah.

62
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,039
I mean, I think so many around housing, passing an affordable housing trust,

63
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:11,009
working on our zoning recodification, which we've been working on, but linking that into a comprehensive plan for the city, which we're finally on the path to having.

64
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:24,035
long-term planning and really understanding our needs and assessing them and making sure that we're meeting them are things that we haven't done a great job of for a long time as a city.

65
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,857
And I think a lot of people see the effects.

66
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,899
It's streets and sidewalks in trouble.

67
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:32,921
It's school buildings that need to be replaced.

68
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,383
It's fire headquarters that needs to be replaced.

69
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:45,430
That's not even talking about the day-to-day needing more people for code enforcement and needing more people for DPW.

70
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,914
And all the other offices, I think, in City Hall could make a good argument for a few more people as well.

71
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:56,598
So having that level of investment and making sure it's tied into a plan that

72
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,621
residents in the community are involved in creating and see as a vision for the future.

73
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:05,602
I think we still have time.

74
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:15,665
But we've all seen what a lack of planning means when things are changing, when property values are going up so much and development is happening.

75
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,625
But it's not happening based on our vision.

76
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:22,227
It's just happening piecemeal and based on what big developers want.

77
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:39,693
I think there's a huge opportunity and I'm really hopeful that I'll be able to get reelected and see some of those issues through to a, not necessarily to a solution, but at least to the beginning of a solution.

78
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:40,213
Yeah.

79
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:42,775
Could you explain the Affordable Housing Trust?

80
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,627
Sure, yeah.

81
00:06:46,568 --> 00:07:01,597
The state allows cities to create essentially a trust fund where money can be put into it from different sources, like linkage fees, which are fees that are paid by big developers on big developments.

82
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:06,620
Or Community Preservation Act has a set aside for affordable housing.

83
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,681
So you can kind of combine all of those sources.

84
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:12,004
We know how expensive it is to build things and to have housing.

85
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:23,512
pull all of those sources together and actually have the capital to do some construction or partnerships around building more affordable housing.

86
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:25,433
That's helpful to know.

87
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:29,074
I've heard some of these terms kind of like brought up in meetings and debates and things.

88
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:30,515
That's helpful to have some explanation.

89
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:30,855
Thank you.

90
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:31,635
Absolutely.

91
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:50,264
And like if this feels kind of related, I think we hear about like, like you're mentioning zoning and, you know, in some of the, the like kind of conversations I've heard about talks about like changes to policing policies, like how, how does that like relate to sort of how you see equity or maybe creating a Medford that's more equitable?

92
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:51,204
Yeah.

93
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:53,205
I mean, I think definitely.

94
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:06,042
kind of a few different paths to go down there, making sure that if you are planning, you're including voices, especially voices that have been historically excluded by governments.

95
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:09,202
The last time we updated our zoning was in the 1960s.

96
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:14,664
A lot of communities updated their zoning in the 1960s to be exclusionary.

97
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:20,645
So taking a look not just at what we have, but why do we have what we have,

98
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:28,189
and making sure that we are trying to repair harms that have been caused over a long time is kind of one piece of it.

99
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,213
And I think, you know, around policing, having civilian oversight and review,

100
00:08:35,878 --> 00:08:52,937
focusing on How are we not just you know, I think we focus a lot on anecdote and kind of the idea of what security might mean and not so much on safety and the outcomes of what it means for everyone to be safe, so

101
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:13,444
Who can, if someone's in crisis, who's the best person to respond to that so that the responder is safe, so that the person who's in crisis is safe, and is coming to a resolution where you're not getting into a vicious cycle, where you have a mental health crisis, but then you end up in the criminal legal system, and then

102
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,745
That is only going to make your mental health worse.

103
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:21,528
And I think you can make a human argument for it.

104
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:23,649
You can make a financial argument for it.

105
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,691
You can make a lot of different arguments for it.

106
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:43,281
But at the end of the day, it's about making sure that people are treated with dignity and that what we do as a government helps make things better and doesn't make things worse as a society, as a community, and for individual people.

107
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:44,662
Yeah.

108
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:46,663
I appreciate that thoughtful response.

109
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:53,368
My background is in social work, and that sounds like a lot of the elements that we consider in treating people like people.

110
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,371
And it's nice to hear that from a government perspective, too.

111
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:56,891
Yeah.

112
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:03,616
I mean, I think that's one of the big failings of government at all levels.

113
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,738
It's not human scale.

114
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:06,959
It's not human centered.

115
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,260
And it's not about, you know.

116
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:13,010
Sometimes it's just not about making things better.

117
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,572
And I think that that's why people can be so cynical about government.

118
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:22,555
Because at the end of the day, it's a tool to make things better and solve problems that we can't solve by ourselves.

119
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,637
And when it's not doing that or doing the opposite,

120
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,279
I can see why people are disaffected by that.

121
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,320
Sure, sure.

122
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:39,904
And so in kind of preparing for this interview and reading through your website, it sounds like there's been a lot of resolutions that you've proposed.

123
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:47,067
And so I'm wondering if there's any work that you're doing already on the council that you'd like to amplify or talk about how folks might be able to get involved.

124
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:48,067
Yeah.

125
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:54,530
I mean, I think definitely the zoning work that we've been doing, it's really important for people to get involved in.

126
00:10:56,674 --> 00:11:04,078
public hearings, and we've had 10, 12 public meetings already, but that was when we were designing the whole thing.

127
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,619
So I think now we're presenting.

128
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,190
an updated document.

129
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:33,008
And this is how I consider this whole process is we're trying to take the structure and the framework of what we have and make it more understandable and readable and modern so that then when we have our comprehensive plan and when we have discussions around equity, we can go into it and know exactly where we need to go, what definitions do we need to look at, which sections do we need to look at.

130
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,629
But I think that feedback.

131
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:47,242
is still valuable even before that, as we pass this element of just getting us to a modern and readable zoning ordinance.

132
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:48,923
And really, I think

133
00:11:54,442 --> 00:12:05,630
Right now, a lot of the work that we're doing has been kind of, you know, slowed down a little bit because of the election, because of the pandemic.

134
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:14,977
And I'm really hoping that next January we're going to be hitting the ground running and there'll probably be something for everyone in that bundle of stuff that we want to get done.

135
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:28,658
Yeah, no, and I think, so it sounds like hearing from people is helpful and like, it's something that I've appreciated about folks I've reached out to, right, is like the response and, you know, talking about Medford being like a city, but like rather accessible too.

136
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:33,581
And definitely appreciate that about having worked with you and stuff in the past.

137
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:39,246
But so for you, like, what is, what can you talk about kind of like what you appreciate about Medford and like the Medford community?

138
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:45,855
And I think that question, the thing I appreciate the most is the Medford community.

139
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:53,825
Not to be derivative, but I think most of the time

140
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,423
were, I think almost all the time, were better than what it looks like on Facebook, which is good.

141
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:08,388
And even if people disagree, and sure, there's always going to be disagreements and differences of opinion.

142
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:14,932
People tend to still be kind to each other and want to talk.

143
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:19,335
And I think that one thing that's really always keeps me

144
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:33,587
positive and hopeful is having in-person conversations, going around and knocking on doors or talking to someone on the phone, someone you'd probably never talk to otherwise, but knowing that they

145
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,074
are willing to have a discussion.

146
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:47,303
And honestly, most of the time that you share a lot of values and that what you want to see in Medford is similar enough that you could probably get to some sort of agreement.

147
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:51,367
And beyond that, I think it's just a fun place to be.

148
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,009
It could be more fun, and there's a lot we can do.

149
00:13:54,229 --> 00:14:03,216
But kind people getting together, going to a high school football game, or a Mystic River celebration, or

150
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:08,538
you know, West Medford Open Studios or Clippership Day.

151
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:19,182
I mean, you could go down, up and down the list and, you know, it's just good to see people and see people coming together and building connections and becoming friends.

152
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:29,205
And I think we do a decent job of that right now and something we need to certainly not lose sight of and even enhance even more.

153
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:39,073
And I think it's been nice this year with a little bit less pandemic since the vaccinations have come out.

154
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:48,182
Having a little bit more of that, hopefully next year, especially the year after, we can really get back to the full schedule.

155
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,683
Yeah, I've been enjoying those events, too.

156
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:57,466
And I think sometimes, since having kids, I think it feels a little bit easier to engage in the community.

157
00:14:57,506 --> 00:15:06,030
But I've also noticed lots of opportunities for people without kids, and having the theater now downtown, and all the great acts that were coming in before the pandemic.

158
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:07,331
Really fun.

159
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:08,812
Awesome.

160
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:15,755
So this question is about something about you that you could share that might surprise us.

161
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:28,021
I think, I mean, sometimes when people are, you know, their impression of me is from the internet, then they meet me, then they're just surprised immediately.

162
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,286
Because I'm not, you know, steaming out of my ears.

163
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,231
Horns on my head.

164
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:52,679
But no, I think for me, something people probably just don't know, or some people do, I was a multi-instrumentalist at Medford High School and sang in chorus at Medford High and the Handel and Haydn Society Youth Program for

165
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:59,561
little more than 10 years, sang at Carnegie Hall when I was 14 or 13.

166
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:04,003
So that's something I think people don't know.

167
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:11,067
I still sing in the car and in the shower, but it's not the path I took professionally.

168
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:20,912
I think that might surprise people to know that that's an inclination that I have and definitely spent a lot of time on when I was younger.

169
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:21,893
That's cool.

170
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:25,395
Well, had I known, I would have adapted the podcast for them.

171
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:28,357
Well, that would have been embarrassing.

172
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,958
And that's why it's a surprise.

173
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:32,619
That's really cool, though, yeah.

174
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,341
No, thank you for sharing that.

175
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:41,025
And so what advice would you have or have you received that you would want to pass on to other people?

176
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:42,035
Sure.

177
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,657
I mean, that's a big question.

178
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:53,543
And honestly, it's funny, because I think my two big pools of advice that I would want to bring out are kind of in contrast to each other.

179
00:16:55,645 --> 00:17:05,231
One that I've always found really important and has kind of driven me is, and I learned this from my grandparents, my grandpa, and my dad, and my mom.

180
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:13,544
And actually, one of my favorite teachers was Andy Milne, who's running for school committee.

181
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:20,672
And he taught me a good lesson in this one too, which is just stand up for what you believe in and stand your ground.

182
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:26,980
And I think that's really, really important when you're talking about big issues.

183
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:34,534
and things that are above moral values, and helping people, and the idea of building a just community and a just world.

184
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:37,117
So that's one side of it.

185
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:38,859
And the other side of it is kind of

186
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:50,264
passed down, especially from my grandma, which is try to suffer fools gladly, and also to turn the other cheek.

187
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:54,088
And both of those are kind of biblical references, which basically, if someone's coming in and

188
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:11,527
really just saying stuff that wants to make you mad, that is so infuriatingly inaccurate that you just want to lose it.

189
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:13,549
Try to smile through it.

190
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:15,712
Because you're never going to.

191
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:20,834
build a bridge or build a connection with someone if you just get mad and then call them stupid.

192
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:22,395
That's never a good idea.

193
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:24,276
And certainly, it's happened to me.

194
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:24,976
People have said that.

195
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,517
It's come in my direction when people disagree with me.

196
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:36,561
And I think that's one of the things that's kind of one area where we could use some improvement across the board.

197
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:39,342
And then turning the other cheek is a pretty obvious one.

198
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,963
If someone comes at you with,

199
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:45,947
some sort of attack or insult, tell them, send another one.

200
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:53,252
And I think it's kind of both sides of standing up for what you believe in.

201
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,955
Sometimes you can't engage with the other side of it the way you want to.

202
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:09,083
But trying to balance that and stand up for what you believe in without turning to anger and frustration, because that usually won't

203
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:11,307
It doesn't make you happy.

204
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,508
It doesn't make anyone else happy.

205
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:18,310
And it probably doesn't lead to a productive answer to whatever you're mad about.

206
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,711
Yeah, it feels like a common struggle for the times.

207
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:21,231
Yeah.

208
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:27,253
That bit about calling someone stupid, my five-year-old could use that advice, too.

209
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:28,373
Yeah.

210
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:29,293
Great.

211
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:34,255
Well, is there anything that I haven't asked you about that you think voters should know or that you'd want them to know?

212
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:36,756
Just that, you know.

213
00:19:38,197 --> 00:20:00,994
Regardless of any of the spin and the social media back and forth, I definitely view my role as serving everybody in the city, helping anyone who reaches out for help, and listening to anyone who comes with a reasonable perspective around any of the issues that we work on.

214
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:26,809
having conversation and maybe a little debate, but realizing that we're coming from a similar place and that we want to see the same community and city can help all of us avoid some of the less than pretty discussions and disagreements and screaming matches occasionally that we've seen.

215
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:32,319
If you're listening to this and don't agree with me, give me a call.

216
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,681
Yeah, great.

217
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:40,746
We've had some interactions about you being really helpful for me with stuff that was going on for us, and I appreciate that.

218
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,427
So I can attest to that being a helpful resource.

219
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:44,969
Awesome.

220
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,610
Well, thank you so much, and I wish you luck in the election.

221
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:49,152
Thank you so much, Danielle.

222
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:49,572
Thanks, Zach.
