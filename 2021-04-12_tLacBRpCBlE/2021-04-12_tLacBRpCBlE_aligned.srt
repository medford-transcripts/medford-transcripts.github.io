00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:33,143
Six present, one absent.

36
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:34,444
Member McLaughlin?

37
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,345
I don't see you, so Member McLaughlin?

38
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:39,888
Hearing and seeing none, six present, one absent.

39
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,004

40
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:58,572
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

44
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,045
The Medford School Committee

45
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,867
reconvene in public session following the executive session.

46
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,770
Is there a motion to enter executive session?

47
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:46,232
Second.

48
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,154
Moved by Kretz.

49
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,035
Member Graham?

50
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:50,856
Yes.

51
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:52,497
Member Kretz?

52
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:53,298
Yes.

53
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,639
Member McStone?

54
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:02,826
Sorry, I just called Melanie on her phone, on her house phone, so she's coming.

55
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:03,867
She thought it was six.

56
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:04,888
So yes, yes.

57
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:07,952
Member Rousseau?

58
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:09,093
Yes.

59
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:10,773
Member Randa Klug?

60
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:12,174
Yes.

61
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:15,535
And myself, yes.

62
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,296
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

63
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:21,717
We will head into executive session and Melanie can join us when she gets there.

64
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,318
We'll mark the time she arrives.

65
02:12:44,663 --> 02:12:46,304
Thank you for your patience, everybody.

66
02:12:48,844 --> 02:12:50,945
We ran a little bit over an executive session.

67
02:12:52,926 --> 02:13:00,788
Before we start our agenda, I just want to state that, again, during public participation,

68
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:08,422
or anytime a member of the public would like to speak, just please give your name and address for the record.

69
02:13:09,442 --> 02:13:29,949
Also, we're gonna stick by the rules that were set forth in the last full meeting, which are if you plan on, if you insult, swear, use inappropriate language or a different name for anybody in the Zoom session, you will be muted and not be allowed to speak for the rest of the meeting.

70
02:13:30,049 --> 02:13:31,930
So I just wanna make that clear before every meeting.

71
02:13:33,070 --> 02:13:39,012
Up next, we have number three, approval of minutes, March 22nd, 2021, school committee meeting.

72
02:13:39,032 --> 02:13:41,393
Is there a motion for approval?

73
02:13:41,413 --> 02:13:42,774
Motion to approve.

74
02:13:43,534 --> 02:13:45,335
I remember Graham seconded by?

75
02:13:45,355 --> 02:13:48,016
Second.

76
02:13:48,576 --> 02:13:49,917
Member Roussel, roll call.

77
02:14:00,341 --> 02:14:01,341
Can you not unmute?

78
02:14:04,335 --> 02:14:05,796
Yeah, now I can.

79
02:14:06,236 --> 02:14:10,178
I also can't rename so Peter if you could, Dr. Cushman, if you could do that, that'd be great.

80
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:17,762
Member Kretz, Member Graham, I'm sorry.

81
02:14:18,643 --> 02:14:18,863
Yes.

82
02:14:20,284 --> 02:14:21,264
Member McLaughlin, yes.

83
02:14:21,324 --> 02:14:22,165
Member McStone.

84
02:14:32,290 --> 02:14:32,650
Yes.

85
02:14:33,371 --> 02:14:34,512
Audio weird for you guys?

86
02:14:35,012 --> 02:14:36,553
I'm getting feedback on my audio.

87
02:14:36,573 --> 02:14:37,474
Are you guys getting that?

88
02:14:37,494 --> 02:14:40,977
I think it was just remembering the stones now.

89
02:14:41,397 --> 02:14:42,058
Should be OK.

90
02:14:42,258 --> 02:14:43,098
Yes.

91
02:14:43,839 --> 02:14:44,219
OK.

92
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:45,840
Member Rousseau.

93
02:14:46,541 --> 02:14:46,761
Yes.

94
02:14:48,082 --> 02:14:48,883
Member Van de Kloot.

95
02:14:50,224 --> 02:14:50,884
Yes.

96
02:14:55,968 --> 02:14:56,749
Marilyn O'Kern.

97
02:14:57,763 --> 02:15:00,005
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

98
02:15:00,045 --> 02:15:00,845
Minutes are approved.

99
02:15:01,085 --> 02:15:04,328
Number four, approval of bills, transfer of funds and approval of payrolls.

100
02:15:04,948 --> 02:15:05,829
Motion to approve.

101
02:15:06,589 --> 02:15:08,411
Member McLaughlin, seconded by.

102
02:15:09,511 --> 02:15:09,832
Second.

103
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:11,613
Member Kratz, roll call.

104
02:15:12,694 --> 02:15:13,334
Member Graham.

105
02:15:13,814 --> 02:15:14,054
Yes.

106
02:15:14,955 --> 02:15:15,556
Member Kratz.

107
02:15:16,096 --> 02:15:16,336
Yes.

108
02:15:17,117 --> 02:15:18,177
Member McLaughlin, yes.

109
02:15:18,217 --> 02:15:18,598
Member Stone.

110
02:15:18,638 --> 02:15:18,718
Yes.

111
02:15:18,738 --> 02:15:21,700
Member McLaughlin, yes.

112
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:24,422
I'm hearing the feedback too, no.

113
02:15:27,408 --> 02:15:27,668
Yes.

114
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,391
Member Rousseau.

115
02:15:31,171 --> 02:15:31,391
Yes.

116
02:15:32,713 --> 02:15:33,533
Member Van de Kloot.

117
02:15:33,834 --> 02:15:34,094
Yes.

118
02:15:35,755 --> 02:15:36,456
Mayor Long-O'Connor.

119
02:15:37,337 --> 02:15:39,739
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

120
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,283
Bills and funds, payrolls has been approved.

121
02:15:45,223 --> 02:15:49,347
If we can just all mute our microphones unless we're speaking, I think that will help.

122
02:15:50,942 --> 02:15:54,044
Number five, report of secretary, if there is one.

123
02:15:55,645 --> 02:15:58,147
Mayor, there are two letters that we received.

124
02:15:58,547 --> 02:16:04,971
One is regarding the mathematics curriculum, which makes sense to read just prior to Ms.

125
02:16:05,011 --> 02:16:06,532
Khan's presentation this evening.

126
02:16:07,032 --> 02:16:11,995
And the other one is regards to the afterschool program, and it makes sense to read that.

127
02:16:12,676 --> 02:16:19,360
The parents specifically asked to read that at the outset of the presentation, as they had questions incorporated in it.

128
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:23,182
So if I could hold those two to them, that makes the most sense.

129
02:16:24,303 --> 02:16:29,787
Yeah, the secretary said there's nothing, so that's... Are you talking about public participation?

130
02:16:30,948 --> 02:16:33,891
Oh, sorry, I was doing an undersecretary's report.

131
02:16:34,491 --> 02:16:35,712
You were the secretary member.

132
02:16:36,833 --> 02:16:39,415
I was like, what's going on here?

133
02:16:40,858 --> 02:16:42,179
Oh, sorry about that, Melanie.

134
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:45,682
We'll just let you get over with it.

135
02:16:46,602 --> 02:16:53,367
Okay, so just stop me and we'll get those public participation reports out whenever you feel comfortable, Member Van de Kloot.

136
02:16:53,447 --> 02:16:55,008
So there's no report of secretary.

137
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:56,990
We're going to go to reports of committee.

138
02:16:57,210 --> 02:16:59,732
The first one up is actually you as Member Van de Kloot.

139
02:16:59,772 --> 02:17:03,755
You're the chair of the Curriculum Subcommittee, and the meeting was held on March 10th,

140
02:17:04,565 --> 02:17:24,552
2021.

141
02:17:05,585 --> 02:17:24,552
So on March 10, 2021, we had a Curriculum Subcommittee meeting that was to be attended by myself, Member Graham, Member McStone, the Superintendent, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and Dr. Chiesa gave a PowerPoint presentation.

142
02:17:24,972 --> 02:17:35,057
Now, if you recall, at our last school committee meeting, I asked for this to be held because the PowerPoint presentation was not incorporated into the minutes, and now it is incorporated into the minutes.

143
02:17:36,338 --> 02:17:47,924
At the meeting, the first thing we reviewed was state expectations, and then we looked at Medford Public Schools, the district curriculum, professional development, and resources.

144
02:17:48,846 --> 02:17:53,758
equity in English language arts and goals and next steps.

145
02:17:56,197 --> 02:18:03,424
We talked about the early literacy screeners and, again, the district professional development.

146
02:18:04,044 --> 02:18:07,648
There was quite a list that was given and provided.

147
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:17,457
The Hill for Literacy, Crafting Minds, Dr. Nadine Gabb, Lexia training, Lexia Core 5 training, et cetera.

148
02:18:19,165 --> 02:18:22,566
We also talked about the Medford Early Literacy Screener.

149
02:18:23,247 --> 02:18:26,968
The Alexia Rapid is given at the Brooks, McGlynn, and Roberts.

150
02:18:27,629 --> 02:18:32,270
And the NWEA Map Growth is given at the Columbus.

151
02:18:33,351 --> 02:18:43,135
There was, of course, some concern about evidence-based instruction and discussion about journeys not being evidence-based.

152
02:18:44,056 --> 02:18:45,957
and the bringing in of ECRI.

153
02:18:46,717 --> 02:18:55,264
Some parents had concerns that it is not complete enough and are not supportive and evidence-based.

154
02:18:56,144 --> 02:18:59,787
There was also a question by member Graham

155
02:19:00,267 --> 02:19:05,329
who spoke to the fact that there had been a request for a handwriting curriculum.

156
02:19:06,409 --> 02:19:10,330
That did not go forward last year.

157
02:19:10,350 --> 02:19:16,513
I'm not quite sure whether it was only because of COVID or also because of funding.

158
02:19:17,433 --> 02:19:20,154
So that's something that's still on the docket.

159
02:19:24,384 --> 02:19:52,563
There was discussion about the curriculum being more reflective of different cultivating additional programs to support the science of reading, including, but not limited to, ECRI, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, Lexia Learning, and NEWS-ELA.

160
02:19:56,489 --> 02:20:09,655
There was also, Dr. Chiesa provided for us a list of price points for various different supports and how much they cost the district.

161
02:20:13,177 --> 02:20:15,938
The one other thing I just wanted to mention, oh, was,

162
02:20:17,647 --> 02:20:29,288
Equity in ELA, there's been the addition of numerous novels and informational texts by diverse authors, creating an inclusive classroom, inclusion and pacing guides,

163
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:42,835
and also an edition of News ELA, Exploring Identity and Culture, Mirrors and Windows Collection, A Mile in Our Shoes Collection, and Black Students Matter Collection.

164
02:20:44,076 --> 02:20:50,181
There is another curriculum meeting this Wednesday at four o'clock, and we hope that you can join us.

165
02:20:51,862 --> 02:20:52,663
Member McLaughlin?

166
02:20:55,553 --> 02:20:56,013
Thank you.

167
02:20:56,194 --> 02:20:59,456
Thank you for the information member.

168
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:17,292
I wanted to ask, so I know that you talked a little bit about the equity in ELA and some of those variants about inclusion and other materials, and I don't know if this is a topic for the subcommittee or whether it should be a report or what have you, but I'm curious about

169
02:21:18,597 --> 02:21:26,603
An update on a disability curriculum and an update on the anti-racism curriculum, both of which have been discussions for this year.

170
02:21:26,643 --> 02:21:31,346
So I don't know if that's going to be happening later in the year or if that's been a topic.

171
02:21:32,408 --> 02:21:35,771
You know, the problem is we're covering so much in the meeting as it is.

172
02:21:36,112 --> 02:21:47,242
I think that while we touched on, you know, resources being included, we haven't had specific, more in-depth conversations.

173
02:21:48,243 --> 02:21:50,285
We have another meeting this Wednesday.

174
02:21:50,325 --> 02:21:51,947
It's covering two subject areas.

175
02:21:53,688 --> 02:21:57,911
you know, we're gonna have to go back and I know we had a follow up.

176
02:21:58,211 --> 02:22:07,917
I wasn't thinking it was in the curriculum, Melanie, about the special education resources, but we certainly could do it.

177
02:22:07,977 --> 02:22:11,139
Why don't we talk and we'll figure out how to go forward on that.

178
02:22:11,950 --> 02:22:12,730
Thank you, that'd be great.

179
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:23,175
And I would ask that for all of the curriculum, whether there are supplements for EL and special education.

180
02:22:23,616 --> 02:22:31,940
So I know that for journeys, and Dr. Chiesa and I have spoken about this in the past, that for journeys there are supplements for special education and for

181
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,600
English learners.

182
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:39,402
And when we were in school, you know, in elementary school, we were unaware of that until about third grade.

183
02:22:39,442 --> 02:22:48,124
And so, you know, I want to make sure that there are supplements for special education and EL and that families and teachers are aware that there are supplements.

184
02:22:48,164 --> 02:22:58,467
So if we could, you know, ask that as well in the context of the curriculum, or again, whether this committee thinks that there should be a presentation, I'm open to either, but I'd like to know

185
02:22:59,505 --> 02:23:14,654
What those are and then I would also like to add that this Wednesday at 6 o'clock the Special Education Parent Advisory Council is having a two hour session with a general educator and a special educator where they're addressing differentiated curriculum.

186
02:23:15,134 --> 02:23:26,641
So how we're taking grade level curriculum and approach in in helping differentiate it for students who have different levels of learning abilities so.

187
02:23:27,505 --> 02:23:39,116
that will be happening this Wednesday, but I'd also like to know, again, an application to these various curricula that we're talking about, how that is differentiated or in which way we're considering those things.

188
02:23:39,176 --> 02:23:40,477
So I'm not sure.

189
02:23:40,497 --> 02:23:46,183
I guess I'd defer to my colleagues in asking, should that be curriculum subcommittee?

190
02:23:46,243 --> 02:23:49,346
Should that be an individual separate report?

191
02:23:49,366 --> 02:23:50,667
I'm wondering what folks think.

192
02:23:58,997 --> 02:24:04,283
Yeah, member Van de Kloet, I believe you just said your agenda for next week is a little different.

193
02:24:04,323 --> 02:24:13,094
So we can look for an update from the admin when they have availability to do that before the end of the session, which is the end of June.

194
02:24:16,337 --> 02:24:16,718
Thank you.

195
02:24:17,607 --> 02:24:19,128
So roll call on mayor.

196
02:24:19,648 --> 02:24:21,288
Yes, member Graham.

197
02:24:21,748 --> 02:24:33,652
I would also say that the question about availability of supplements is something that is intended to be part of the catalog that is supposed to be coming out of all of this work.

198
02:24:34,352 --> 02:24:37,694
So that it's clear what is available and what is not.

199
02:24:37,874 --> 02:24:44,416
So that to me, in my mind is definitely part of this work and the catalog that

200
02:24:46,436 --> 02:24:48,277
we are working towards creating.

201
02:24:51,098 --> 02:24:52,219
Member McLaughlin.

202
02:24:53,059 --> 02:24:53,339
Thank you.

203
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:54,199
That's very helpful.

204
02:24:54,279 --> 02:24:57,661
I'm wondering, is that something that is expected for the end of this year?

205
02:24:57,681 --> 02:25:05,824
And I guess my concern is I don't want to find out after the fact that a certain curriculum has been chosen and it doesn't have a special education supplement or it doesn't have any L.A.

206
02:25:05,864 --> 02:25:06,804
supplement or what have you.

207
02:25:06,844 --> 02:25:09,045
So I'm just wondering what that process will be.

208
02:25:10,646 --> 02:25:11,446
I don't know.

209
02:25:11,646 --> 02:25:12,026
I think Dr.

210
02:25:15,998 --> 02:25:19,200
But at this point, no curriculum has been chosen.

211
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:27,063
I don't see Dr. Chiesa on.

212
02:25:27,643 --> 02:25:31,785
Yes.

213
02:25:31,945 --> 02:25:37,888
I think we have to hold that question right now, and we'll do a follow up on that.

214
02:25:37,988 --> 02:25:39,669
Oh, there's Dr. Marisa.

215
02:25:39,709 --> 02:25:39,869
Yes.

216
02:25:42,205 --> 02:25:44,746
No curriculum has been chosen at this point in time.

217
02:25:45,526 --> 02:26:07,592
And in regards to the working groups that are going to be working on the math department, teachers will be piloting two, including parents, two to potentially three different curricula in order to make a decision.

218
02:26:07,732 --> 02:26:10,073
So while they go through the process of

219
02:26:11,438 --> 02:26:18,382
screening and piloting curriculum as they go forward, it will be a fully inclusive process.

220
02:26:19,243 --> 02:26:33,292
But that is something that was said at one of our first curriculum subcommittee meetings to make sure that we're being inclusive of both English learners and students with disabilities, our special needs students.

221
02:26:34,052 --> 02:26:36,774
And to member McLaughlin's question,

222
02:26:38,466 --> 02:26:45,909
We had an asterisk for June as a possible follow-up meeting on disability awareness.

223
02:26:45,929 --> 02:26:56,634
So this Wednesday, it'll be world language and science, and then health and phys ed will be coming up.

224
02:26:57,355 --> 02:27:06,479
And then we're gonna go back to disability awareness, a follow-up on where we were from the presentation that happened at the start of the school year.

225
02:27:09,473 --> 02:27:10,514
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

226
02:27:11,654 --> 02:27:12,715
Thank you, Superintendent.

227
02:27:12,755 --> 02:27:13,275
That's helpful.

228
02:27:14,035 --> 02:27:26,802
And also, I just remember McStone and I had put forward a motion some time back for an anti-racism curriculum, and I'm wondering if the task force is working on that or how that's going.

229
02:27:34,686 --> 02:27:37,528
Can you repeat that question, please, Member McLaughlin?

230
02:27:40,343 --> 02:27:52,748
Yes, some time ago this year, Member McStone and I put forward a motion for an anti-racism curriculum, anti-white supremacy, anti-racism curriculum.

231
02:27:52,848 --> 02:28:01,191
And I was assuming that the Anti-Racism Task Force was addressing that, but I guess I'm wondering if that's the case now or where that's at.

232
02:28:02,885 --> 02:28:22,887
So with the anti-racism curriculum under humanities right now, Dr. Chiesa is looking with her team, they are looking at supplemental pieces, including in particular, which was said earlier, the Nuzella curriculum, which is infusing greater amounts of

233
02:28:24,689 --> 02:28:31,074
articles and literature about cultural proficiency, anti-racism, anti-bias work.

234
02:28:31,575 --> 02:28:35,498
So it is being added or folded into the curriculum.

235
02:28:36,419 --> 02:28:43,325
They are working, I know that the directors are working in collaboration with their lead teachers and their teams.

236
02:28:43,945 --> 02:28:46,607
So that is some of the work that is taking place

237
02:28:48,048 --> 02:28:48,608
right now.

238
02:28:49,609 --> 02:29:07,256
We definitely will be able to get a presentation to the school committee in the near future on all of the professional development and where curriculum shifts or intentional shifts are taking place with our curriculum.

239
02:29:10,797 --> 02:29:11,057
Thank you.

240
02:29:12,118 --> 02:29:15,499
Motion for approval of number one made by

241
02:29:16,669 --> 02:29:18,250
Member Graham.

242
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:20,090
Seconded by member.

243
02:29:22,551 --> 02:29:24,671
I didn't know, I'm not sure what the motion is, sorry.

244
02:29:25,331 --> 02:29:28,272
Just to accept the minutes from the curriculum subcommittee meeting.

245
02:29:29,733 --> 02:29:30,073
Second.

246
02:29:31,133 --> 02:29:32,293

02:30:19,549 --> 02:30:19,930
Thank you.

307
02:30:20,890 --> 02:30:35,224
On page seven, the bottom paragraph where I am speaking, the sentence is, there's a member trying to get attention and I don't know the name.

308
02:30:36,185 --> 02:30:38,227
I believe I said a member of the public.

309
02:30:38,307 --> 02:30:40,329
I certainly know the names of all the members of the committee.

310
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:42,812
That could just be changed to say member of the public.

311
02:30:48,389 --> 02:30:49,910
Motion for approval as amended.

312
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:51,592

on March 22nd, 2021.

333
02:31:20,381 --> 02:31:24,702
That was regarding the capital improvement plan for the school side.

334
02:31:24,722 --> 02:31:26,703
We had a very productive meeting.

335
02:31:28,123 --> 02:31:29,563

I'm sorry.

341
02:31:38,226 --> 02:31:38,646
Oh, sorry.

342
02:31:39,506 --> 02:31:42,527
I did have a couple of small amendments.

343
02:31:46,855 --> 02:31:52,678
Could we just update the, there's a couple of places that says $816, it's just missing the K, because it's 816,000 unpaid.

344
02:31:52,738 --> 02:31:55,159
And also there's 155, which is 155K.

345
02:31:55,179 --> 02:31:58,301
And then on page two, let me just bring this up to a large enough spot, sorry.

346
02:32:16,137 --> 02:32:31,715
On page three, there are several instances where Member McLaughlin's name has been inserted as part of what looks like an autofill when somebody was typing.

347
02:32:34,285 --> 02:32:40,906
It's clearly the word committee or community has been auto filled with member McLaughlin's names.

348
02:32:41,046 --> 02:32:41,966
Those can be removed.

349
02:32:42,667 --> 02:32:45,667
And I can send my screenshots to Ms.

350
02:32:45,747 --> 02:32:47,747
Weitz for those clarifications.

351
02:32:48,728 --> 02:32:54,228
And then there's also a, this one doesn't have page numbers, so forgive me.

352
02:32:54,349 --> 02:33:01,770
It says, Mr. Murphy says internally through Mr. MCL, I'm assuming that's Mr. McLaughlin, if that could be updated.

353
02:33:05,373 --> 02:33:07,795
Other than that, that was my only question, comments.

354
02:33:11,557 --> 02:33:22,544
Motion for approval as amended by member Rousseau, you move an approval as amended, seconded by member Van de Kloot, roll call.

355
02:33:27,328 --> 02:33:28,348
Member Graham.

356
02:33:28,929 --> 02:33:29,149
Yes.

357
02:33:30,650 --> 02:33:31,290
Member Kratz.

358
02:33:31,991 --> 02:33:32,171
Yes.

359
02:33:33,281 --> 02:33:34,221
Member McLaughlin, yes.

360
02:33:34,261 --> 02:33:34,981
Member McStone?

361
02:33:35,202 --> 02:33:35,482
Yes.

362
02:33:36,442 --> 02:33:37,142
Member Rousseau?

363
02:33:37,782 --> 02:33:38,022
Yes.

364
02:33:38,923 --> 02:33:39,763
Member Van de Kloet?

365
02:33:40,363 --> 02:33:40,583
Yes.

366
02:33:41,443 --> 02:33:42,183
Mayor Longo-Kern?

367
02:33:42,524 --> 02:33:42,784
Yes.

368
02:33:42,804 --> 02:33:44,304
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

369
02:33:44,364 --> 02:33:45,164
Minutes are approved.

370
02:33:45,624 --> 02:33:49,605
Number four, rules policy and equity subcommittee meeting, March 24th, 2021.

371
02:33:51,106 --> 02:33:54,967
Member Rousseau, this proposed policy on face coverings.

372
02:33:56,327 --> 02:33:56,987
Thank you, Mayor.

373
02:33:57,688 --> 02:34:02,489
One second, I just gotta bring up the right minutes.

374
02:34:05,853 --> 02:34:06,393
Okay, thank you.

375
02:34:06,413 --> 02:34:12,418
So on March 24th, the Rose Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting met to discuss two items on our agenda.

376
02:34:13,839 --> 02:34:17,901
One, we had a pretty in-depth conversation about the role of the student representatives.

377
02:34:18,902 --> 02:34:20,563
More work is forthcoming on that.

378
02:34:20,984 --> 02:34:24,526
So I won't get into too much detail on that this evening.

379
02:34:24,606 --> 02:34:27,048
I did want to thank our student representatives, David May,

380
02:34:27,818 --> 02:34:41,985
and Colin Bailey for a very open and honest conversation and for their dedication to improving how this legislatively mandated role is currently integrated into our school system and into our deliberations in this committee.

381
02:34:43,766 --> 02:34:56,692
While it is clear we have not been in compliance with chapter 71, section 38M of the laws, I'm confident that work will begin shortly to get Medford Public Schools into compliance on that.

382
02:34:57,485 --> 02:34:59,326
We will have another meeting on this at another time.

383
02:35:00,207 --> 02:35:01,167
We did pass.

384
02:35:02,268 --> 02:35:17,137
We also discussed the need to adopt policy EBCFA face coverings and voted unanimously to send this to the full committee with a recommendation to approve the face coverings policy was sent to us from the NASC, our association.

385
02:35:18,195 --> 02:35:24,737
and we did not approve the one in the summer, we just didn't get to it, but they have now sent us a new one.

386
02:35:24,757 --> 02:35:39,601
I do have a note that Member McLaughlin was going to work with the Director of People's Services to come up with a statement to insert somewhere related to IEPs, and if she has not had a chance to do that yet, we can certainly amend that at a later date.

387
02:35:42,122 --> 02:35:43,522
Yes, thank you, Member Russo.

388
02:35:45,878 --> 02:35:46,498
questions on the policy?

389
02:35:46,518 --> 02:35:48,240
Are there any questions on the policy?

390
02:35:53,163 --> 02:35:54,144
Motion to approve the minutes.

391
02:35:57,546 --> 02:35:59,067
With the may I make a

392
02:36:08,135 --> 02:36:15,699
wording for the Director of Pupil Services and I need to review for the individuals with disabilities.

393
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:27,306
So I would say a motion to approve pending additional language from Director of Pupil Services regarding students with disabilities.

394
02:36:29,347 --> 02:36:29,627
Mayor.

395
02:36:30,127 --> 02:36:32,889
Would it be wise to table it with that

396
02:36:33,698 --> 02:36:40,140
language in its entirety and put it on the 26th agenda for April.

397
02:36:40,921 --> 02:36:41,681
Motion to table?

398
02:36:42,721 --> 02:36:45,382
I was asking to approve the minutes.

399
02:36:49,684 --> 02:36:50,504
Not the policy.

400
02:36:50,564 --> 02:36:51,865
Oh, not the policy, right.

401
02:36:51,945 --> 02:36:52,745
Sorry.

402
02:36:52,845 --> 02:36:54,246
Second motion to approve the minutes.

403
02:36:55,566 --> 02:36:56,067
Roll call.

404
02:36:58,007 --> 02:36:59,068
Member Graham?

405
02:36:59,548 --> 02:36:59,768
Yes.

406
02:37:00,748 --> 02:37:01,449
Member Kretz?

407
02:37:01,869 --> 02:37:02,069
Yes.

408
02:37:02,953 --> 02:37:03,994
Member McLaughlin, yes.

409
02:37:05,054 --> 02:37:05,714
Member McStone.

410
02:37:05,975 --> 02:37:06,235
Yes.

411
02:37:08,156 --> 02:37:08,896
Member Russo.

412
02:37:09,316 --> 02:37:09,616
Yes.

413
02:37:10,557 --> 02:37:11,397
Member Van de Kloot.

414
02:37:11,718 --> 02:37:11,978
Yes.

415
02:37:12,438 --> 02:37:13,178
Mayor Long-O'Karn.

416
02:37:13,819 --> 02:37:14,099
Yes.

417
02:37:14,679 --> 02:37:17,120
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative to approve the minutes.

418
02:37:18,221 --> 02:37:18,441
Mayor.

419
02:37:18,461 --> 02:37:20,802
Number five, yeah, Member Russo.

420
02:37:21,943 --> 02:37:29,847
We did, I know that there's a motion to table the policy to the next meeting, and it's not something we can discuss, so I,

421
02:37:30,783 --> 02:37:33,864
Guess I'll have to wait for the vote on that before I can comment.

422
02:37:35,304 --> 02:37:38,244
Okay, motion to table the policy till the April 26 meeting.

423
02:37:38,724 --> 02:37:40,725
Motion to table.

424
02:37:40,785 --> 02:37:45,606
Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

425
02:37:47,266 --> 02:37:47,526
Second.

426
02:37:48,546 --> 02:37:49,026
Roll call.

427
02:37:49,566 --> 02:37:50,206
Member Graham.

428
02:37:50,726 --> 02:37:51,007
No.

429
02:37:52,287 --> 02:37:52,967
Member Kretz.

430
02:37:53,607 --> 02:37:53,847
Yes.

431
02:37:54,747 --> 02:37:55,767
Member McLaughlin, yes.

432
02:37:55,807 --> 02:37:56,507
Member McStone.

433
02:37:56,808 --> 02:37:57,068
Yes.

434
02:37:57,948 --> 02:37:58,608
Member Rousseau.

435
02:37:59,248 --> 02:37:59,348
No.

436
02:38:00,581 --> 02:38:01,441
Member Van de Kloot.

437
02:38:02,521 --> 02:38:02,781
Yes.

438
02:38:03,722 --> 02:38:04,462
Mayor Long-O'Connor.

439
02:38:05,082 --> 02:38:05,322
Yes.

440
02:38:05,382 --> 02:38:07,182
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

441
02:38:07,342 --> 02:38:11,363
The policy is tabled to our next meeting, which is April 26th.

442
02:38:12,283 --> 02:38:12,583
Mayor.

443
02:38:13,224 --> 02:38:14,044
Member Rousseau.

444
02:38:14,944 --> 02:38:18,865
I see Nurse Ray is on, and I just want to be clear.

445
02:38:19,045 --> 02:38:25,006
Medford Public Schools has no policy on face coverings at this time, which means

446
02:38:26,779 --> 02:38:28,060
Well, it means what it means.

447
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:29,200
There is no policy.

448
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:33,843
There is no consideration of what happens if people refuse to use a mask.

449
02:38:34,723 --> 02:38:35,444
And it's tabled.

450
02:38:35,484 --> 02:38:36,384
We cannot talk about it.

451
02:38:36,424 --> 02:38:37,145
We just tabled it.

452
02:38:37,165 --> 02:38:38,405
I'm just asking.

453
02:38:38,465 --> 02:38:48,991
It's important that we clarify, though, that the superintendent has issued a directive that all students and personnel wear masks.

454
02:38:49,491 --> 02:38:52,993
There's also guidance and regulations from DESE.

455
02:38:54,225 --> 02:38:57,446
I don't want anyone leaving with the impression that this is voluntary right now.

456
02:38:58,087 --> 02:39:01,808
The school committee can choose to adopt the policy that would supersede that directive.

457
02:39:02,348 --> 02:39:05,690
We'd ask that it be consistent with the directive as it's consistent with public health.

458
02:39:06,190 --> 02:39:09,591
But wearing a mask is not voluntary in the Medford Public Schools.

459
02:39:11,752 --> 02:39:19,435
Again, the committee can adopt a policy that supersedes that, either consistent or inconsistent with that, and will adhere to the policy.

460
02:39:19,875 --> 02:39:23,277
But in the absence of a policy, the superintendent has the authority

461
02:39:24,051 --> 02:39:28,332
issue directives necessary to adhere to public health guidelines.

462
02:39:28,412 --> 02:39:38,595
And so the superintendent's directive stands and it is the expectation that all personnel and all students and anyone visiting is wearing a mask.

463
02:39:41,416 --> 02:39:41,756
Thank you.

464
02:39:43,497 --> 02:39:48,138
Five, committee of the whole meeting, strategic plan round table, session one, which was April 5th, 2021.

465
02:39:48,218 --> 02:39:48,538
That was

466
02:39:51,867 --> 02:39:57,912
had a good turnout of 50 to 60 residents, administrators, and committee members.

467
02:39:58,613 --> 02:40:04,118
And we discussed a number of questions that relate to the mission statement of the school department.

468
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:07,741
Is there a roll call vote for those minutes?

469
02:40:10,784 --> 02:40:11,544
Motion to approve.

470
02:40:12,145 --> 02:40:13,786
Second.

471
02:40:14,087 --> 02:40:15,027
Seconded by member Graham.

472
02:40:15,068 --> 02:40:15,508
Roll call.

473
02:40:35,581 --> 02:40:36,081
Roll call.

474
02:40:38,283 --> 02:40:40,064
Oh, Member McLaughlin, you're muted.

475
02:40:40,084 --> 02:40:40,804
Sorry.

476
02:40:40,924 --> 02:40:41,544
Member Graham?

477
02:40:42,045 --> 02:40:44,226
Yes.

478
02:40:44,366 --> 02:40:45,086
Member Kretz?

479
02:40:45,567 --> 02:40:45,807
Yes.

480
02:40:46,627 --> 02:40:47,728
Member McLaughlin, yes.

481
02:40:48,608 --> 02:40:49,329
Member McStone?

482
02:40:49,849 --> 02:40:50,109
Yes.

483
02:40:50,909 --> 02:40:51,630
Member Rousseau?

484
02:40:52,250 --> 02:40:52,450
Yes.

485
02:40:53,331 --> 02:40:54,131
Member Van de Kloop?

486
02:40:54,531 --> 02:40:54,772
Yes.

487
02:40:55,532 --> 02:40:56,272
Mayor Logo Kern?

488
02:40:57,253 --> 02:40:57,493
Yes.

489
02:40:57,513 --> 02:40:58,934
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

490
02:40:58,954 --> 02:40:59,934
The minutes are approved.

491
02:41:00,155 --> 02:41:00,675
And number six,

492
02:41:01,323 --> 02:41:05,624
Committee of the Whole meeting strategic plan roundtable session two, April 6th, 2021.

493
02:41:06,205 --> 02:41:06,905
Member Van de Kloot.

494
02:41:06,945 --> 02:41:12,247
Yes, this was a follow-up, a second night of discussion from the strategic plan.

495
02:41:12,967 --> 02:41:17,989
Again, we divided it up into elementary, middle, high school and special education.

496
02:41:18,049 --> 02:41:22,150
Unfortunately on this night, there were no special education parents and no high school.

497
02:41:22,210 --> 02:41:25,611
So we went down to the younger levels.

498
02:41:26,051 --> 02:41:31,193
I think that one, a couple of comments that I just, one member said they thought

499
02:41:31,666 --> 02:41:34,228
that it was passive rather than active.

500
02:41:34,368 --> 02:41:35,589
And I thought that was important.

501
02:41:36,529 --> 02:41:39,571
There was some discussion of what's the difference between a mission and a vision.

502
02:41:40,452 --> 02:41:53,621
And since one of the parents suggested that perhaps as a part of this or the totality, we liked the idea of a short memorable.

503
02:41:54,742 --> 02:41:59,445
And one parent suggested preparing our students to change the world for the better.

504
02:41:59,919 --> 02:42:02,022
And I thought that was kind of a neat vision statement.

505
02:42:02,862 --> 02:42:16,178
There was a question of how would we have follow-up and how would that we know parents wanted to make sure that they were part of the follow-up as this was, as we spent more time on this.

506
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:18,481
That's it.

507
02:42:21,283 --> 02:42:23,304
motion for approval of those minutes by Mayor.

508
02:42:24,025 --> 02:42:24,986
Actually, I have my hand up.

509
02:42:25,506 --> 02:42:25,786
Oh, yes.

510
02:42:25,826 --> 02:42:26,547
Member McLaughlin.

511
02:42:26,947 --> 02:42:27,347
Thank you.

512
02:42:28,108 --> 02:42:37,294
I just also wanted to mention that we had commentary from families who felt like that they had not really been aware of the of the roundtables.

513
02:42:37,434 --> 02:42:50,303
And, um, I know that that had come out on the Friday, um, mailing from the superintendent, but there was some family feedback that they felt like there could have been more engagement around.

514
02:42:50,783 --> 02:42:52,043
how parents were being reached.

515
02:42:52,124 --> 02:43:02,827
And then we had also asked for some demographic information about who is actually attending these round tables, whether there is diversity represented at the table and in what way.

516
02:43:02,867 --> 02:43:09,450
I know that there was great coverage for translation and really appreciate that from the district.

517
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:17,273
But I know that a lot of the translators were sitting in empty rooms and I just wanna make sure that we're collecting that data so that we're

518
02:43:18,259 --> 02:43:27,625
able to inform as we're talking about the strategic plan, who is not at the table and how we can work to get them there.

519
02:43:27,685 --> 02:43:28,066
Thank you.

520
02:43:30,167 --> 02:43:30,547
Thank you.

521
02:43:40,534 --> 02:43:43,876
Motion for approval by member motion to approve.

522
02:43:44,336 --> 02:43:45,297
Correct seconded by

523
02:43:49,567 --> 02:43:49,847
Second.

524
02:43:50,487 --> 02:43:52,428
Member Graham, roll call.

525
02:43:53,689 --> 02:43:54,289
Member Graham?

526
02:43:54,769 --> 02:43:54,989
Yes.

527
02:43:55,869 --> 02:43:56,470
Member Kretz?

528
02:43:56,910 --> 02:43:57,150
Yes.

529
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:59,211
Member McLaughlin, yes.

530
02:43:59,311 --> 02:44:00,071
Member Stone?

531
02:44:00,311 --> 02:44:00,571
Yes.

532
02:44:02,352 --> 02:44:03,112
Member Rousseau?

533
02:44:03,592 --> 02:44:03,793
Yes.

534
02:44:04,833 --> 02:44:05,693
Member Van de Kloot?

535
02:44:05,953 --> 02:44:06,193
Yes.

536
02:44:07,174 --> 02:44:07,914
Mayor Longo-Kern?

537
02:44:08,354 --> 02:44:08,554
Yes.

538
02:44:08,915 --> 02:44:10,315
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

539
02:44:10,655 --> 02:44:11,536
Minutes are approved.

540
02:44:11,896 --> 02:44:15,797
Number seven, rules, policy and equity subcommittee meeting, April 7th, 2021.

541
02:44:15,857 --> 02:44:16,317
Member Rousseau?

542
02:44:18,119 --> 02:44:25,581
This is on the proposed changes to school committee meeting agendas, policy on staff conduct and policy on harassment.

543
02:44:26,822 --> 02:44:27,582
Thank you, Mayor.

544
02:44:28,402 --> 02:44:33,064
So yeah, so we met last week and discussed those four items.

545
02:44:34,224 --> 02:44:41,707
We, let's see, we voted unanimously to send these to the full committee for recommend these changes.

546
02:44:42,567 --> 02:44:45,408
The first are related to agendas.

547
02:44:46,487 --> 02:44:51,791
So the motion that we approved was to append the student representative.

548
02:44:52,351 --> 02:44:57,075
Motion is to append the student representatives to the attendance roll call.

549
02:44:57,735 --> 02:45:07,682
However, the attendance or absence of the student representative will not be included in the announcement of the number present or absent at the meeting to prevent confusion, such as if they were.

550
02:45:08,588 --> 02:45:11,709
Six members present, one absent, plus a student representative.

551
02:45:11,749 --> 02:45:16,770
If you said seven present and one absent, it's not clear like, wait, are there seven members present?

552
02:45:16,850 --> 02:45:22,951
So the language is in the minutes.

553
02:45:24,852 --> 02:45:31,674
And I won't read my very long explanation of that unless there is anybody who wants to discuss this in detail.

554
02:45:34,474 --> 02:45:35,354
Motion to approve.

555
02:45:36,195 --> 02:45:37,735
Motion to approve by member,

556
02:45:38,734 --> 02:45:40,795
seconded by.

557
02:45:40,815 --> 02:45:47,860
McLaughlin seconded by actually, the motion is to approve the motion for the meeting agenda portion.

558
02:45:49,381 --> 02:45:50,041
Regarding that.

559
02:45:50,221 --> 02:45:51,702
Okay, just clarifying.

560
02:45:52,543 --> 02:45:54,664
Um Yes.

561
02:45:55,185 --> 02:45:55,505
Thank you.

562
02:45:57,466 --> 02:45:57,706
Second.

563
02:45:58,687 --> 02:45:59,027
I remember

564
02:46:09,075 --> 02:46:09,835
Member Rousseau?

565
02:46:10,496 --> 02:46:10,676
Yes.

566
02:46:11,616 --> 02:46:12,457
Member Van de Kloet?

567
02:46:12,877 --> 02:46:13,157
Yes.

568
02:46:13,938 --> 02:46:14,718
Mayor Long-Kern?

569
02:46:15,258 --> 02:46:15,518
Yes.

570
02:46:15,558 --> 02:46:17,059
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

571
02:46:17,580 --> 02:46:18,380
Motion is approved.

572
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:20,081
Thank you.

573
02:46:20,241 --> 02:46:34,388
Number two, we moved to move the approval of minutes of regular school committee meetings, as well as the warrants, bills, et cetera, to the end of the agenda prior to the condolences.

574
02:46:35,069 --> 02:46:37,090
And we voted unanimously to make this change.

575
02:46:38,541 --> 02:46:39,361
Motion to approve.

576
02:46:41,622 --> 02:46:42,222
Seconded by.

577
02:46:42,242 --> 02:46:43,542
Second.

578
02:46:45,523 --> 02:46:45,943
Roll call.

579
02:46:47,303 --> 02:46:47,903
Member Graham.

580
02:46:48,664 --> 02:46:48,884
Yes.

581
02:46:50,044 --> 02:46:50,704
Member Kretz.

582
02:46:51,304 --> 02:46:51,544
Yes.

583
02:46:52,405 --> 02:46:53,345
Member McLaughlin, yes.

584
02:46:53,385 --> 02:46:54,125
Member McStone.

585
02:46:54,405 --> 02:46:54,665
Yes.

586
02:46:55,885 --> 02:46:56,626
Member Rousseau.

587
02:46:57,306 --> 02:46:57,506
Yes.

588
02:46:58,346 --> 02:46:59,166
Member Van de Kloop.

589
02:46:59,526 --> 02:46:59,786
Yes.

590
02:47:00,487 --> 02:47:01,187
Mayor Longo-Khan.

591
02:47:01,527 --> 02:47:01,727
Yes.

592
02:47:01,787 --> 02:47:03,207
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

593
02:47:03,667 --> 02:47:04,428
Motion is approved.

594
02:47:05,168 --> 02:47:05,588
Thank you.

595
02:47:06,279 --> 02:47:11,001
The next one is actually related to those minutes and warrants and bills.

596
02:47:11,801 --> 02:47:20,984
And we made a motion to change the approval of those items to be what's called a consent agenda, which means there will be a single vote.

597
02:47:21,744 --> 02:47:27,085
Members are free to request that those be split if you actually want to have a conversation about them.

598
02:47:27,606 --> 02:47:35,108
Consent agendas are common, are used in many, many communities to speed things up for items that are not typically

599
02:47:36,674 --> 02:47:38,756
That typically have no conversation at all.

600
02:47:39,657 --> 02:48:00,476
So the way it would work is that the mayor would, there would be a consent agenda, and she would, it would just list the items, and she would simply say their emotion to approve the consent agenda, and presumably everybody would be okay with it, and then she would move on so there would only be one vote on those items.

601
02:48:01,313 --> 02:48:06,515
and any member is free, of course, to request that they be split up for individual votes and conversations.

602
02:48:08,175 --> 02:48:08,975
Member McLaughlin.

603
02:48:10,536 --> 02:48:18,678
Yeah, I just, I was gonna help with the clarification of that, but I think Member Russo did a good job, so I, nevermind, thank you.

604
02:48:18,698 --> 02:48:20,319
I have a motion to approve.

605
02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:21,619
Second.

606
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:26,521
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

607
02:48:27,941 --> 02:48:28,621
Roll call.

608
02:48:29,622 --> 02:48:30,122
Member Graham.

609
02:48:31,031 --> 02:48:31,251
Yes.

610
02:48:31,992 --> 02:48:32,572
Member Kretz.

611
02:48:33,132 --> 02:48:33,352
Yes.

612
02:48:34,253 --> 02:48:35,053
Member McLaughlin.

613
02:48:35,073 --> 02:48:35,273
Yes.

614
02:48:35,313 --> 02:48:36,054
Member McStone.

615
02:48:36,354 --> 02:48:36,654
Yes.

616
02:48:37,514 --> 02:48:38,255
Member Rousseau.

617
02:48:38,995 --> 02:48:39,195
Yes.

618
02:48:40,176 --> 02:48:41,036
Member Van de Kloet.

619
02:48:41,236 --> 02:48:41,477
Yes.

620
02:48:42,417 --> 02:48:43,137
Mayor Longo Kern.

621
02:48:43,818 --> 02:48:44,078
Yes.

622
02:48:44,418 --> 02:48:45,779
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

623
02:48:46,459 --> 02:48:47,160
Paper passes.

624
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:48,400
Thank you.

625
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:51,482
And number four, although there are still the two policy

626
02:48:51,983 --> 02:49:01,186
Number four is that we moved to remove the report of the secretary to be immediately prior to public participation item on the agenda.

627
02:49:01,347 --> 02:49:07,729
And amusingly that we had that little thing earlier where member Van Der Kloet thought she was the secretary still.

628
02:49:08,409 --> 02:49:16,232
And that's exactly part of it is that the report of the secretary is typically the emails that have come in.

629
02:49:16,372 --> 02:49:17,973
So it makes more sense there.

630
02:49:18,913 --> 02:49:19,853
So that was the motion.

631
02:49:21,828 --> 02:49:27,109
Mayor Russo, sorry.

632
02:49:28,830 --> 02:49:37,492
So in truth, the night that I was there, I was also, I guess, confused because the truth of the matter is that it is the vice chair who's reading those.

633
02:49:37,512 --> 02:49:39,472
So that's not accurate.

634
02:49:39,712 --> 02:49:43,673
The big question is, so we have to take that piece out of it.

635
02:49:44,433 --> 02:49:59,555
is whether the secretary believes, and we can ask our current secretary, whether she wants to be put on in the position of every meeting being asked if there's a separate report from the secretary, or whether that is just something a holdover from a prior time.

636
02:50:00,075 --> 02:50:08,281
Now, I do know earlier when member Kretz held the position, she approached it in a very certain way, which was great.

637
02:50:09,201 --> 02:50:14,485
But the different folks have different feelings about it.

638
02:50:14,565 --> 02:50:19,849
So the reason, I just wondered what you thought.

639
02:50:20,849 --> 02:50:21,850
Member McLaughlin.

640
02:50:23,311 --> 02:50:23,651
Thank you.

641
02:50:25,412 --> 02:50:45,643
I think that there should be some, and this is a conversation that we've had before and I'm sure the rules policy and equity subcommittee of which I'm part will address this at some point, hopefully before the end of the year, where we need to do some orientation for new school committee members so the other piece of it is that it's never really been clear to me what the report of the Secretary is.

642
02:50:47,164 --> 02:51:06,480
And so generally you hear me say no, there's no report of this unless somebody has a question typically what I've seen is if someone has a question about the, the bills and they want to ask a question of the Secretary maybe just, you know, in that context, but that to me seems like it would be under bills and I think this is really timely because I was not at the RP meeting when you guys were discussing this but

643
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:09,783
Tonight I was thinking to myself, why do we keep doing this?

644
02:51:10,423 --> 02:51:13,926
Why do we keep asking for a report of the Secretary and there's no report of the Secretary?

645
02:51:15,148 --> 02:51:18,210
But maybe you guys have some history I don't know about.

646
02:51:18,290 --> 02:51:20,212
So please feel free to share.

647
02:51:21,433 --> 02:51:22,754
Member Kratz, then Member Rousseau.

648
02:51:23,851 --> 02:51:24,091
Yes.

649
02:51:24,572 --> 02:51:30,777
So when I was the secretary, there wasn't really any direction about what to report to the secretary.

650
02:51:31,397 --> 02:51:34,580
And I was asked each meeting is a report from the secretary.

651
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:37,882
And I just felt that I had to do a report.

652
02:51:38,363 --> 02:51:48,171
So I would, when I was doing the bills, I would just take a few select bills that were interesting, educational, supporting our students.

653
02:51:48,311 --> 02:51:49,612
And I would just share

654
02:51:50,152 --> 02:51:55,193
a brief synopsis of a couple of the bills that, you know, were interesting.

655
02:51:55,673 --> 02:51:59,714
Sometimes it was, you know, a piece of equipment that I wasn't familiar with.

656
02:51:59,974 --> 02:52:04,695
And I would find out the information about the equipment, but there was no instructions.

657
02:52:04,955 --> 02:52:11,476
I just, because I was asked at every meeting, I just felt that I had to, I had to report out something.

658
02:52:12,416 --> 02:52:14,877
But it was never done ever before.

659
02:52:15,457 --> 02:52:19,878
And, you know, I would, I would be okay with it being removed.

660
02:52:20,278 --> 02:52:28,763
from the agenda because, you know, it's just something that it hasn't been done.

661
02:52:28,803 --> 02:52:37,368
And I mean, it was really just picking and choosing some bills that were interesting to me and I would share it out with the committee.

662
02:52:38,949 --> 02:52:39,770
Member McLaughlin.

663
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:40,570
Oh, sorry.

664
02:52:40,990 --> 02:52:42,711
I think member Russo then member McLaughlin.

665
02:52:43,272 --> 02:52:44,252
Yes, thank you.

666
02:52:45,933 --> 02:52:49,075
I would motion to table this item

667
02:52:49,767 --> 02:53:05,590
and just to table this, because I think that the right question is whether we should really be having one at all, which we can bring up in the rules, policy and equity subcommittee meeting as we're continuing to work on the agenda itself, so.

668
02:53:06,090 --> 02:53:10,011
Motion to table, seconded by member McLaughlin, undebatable roll call.

669
02:53:11,892 --> 02:53:12,572
Member Graham.

670
02:53:13,112 --> 02:53:13,312
Yes.

671
02:53:14,740 --> 02:53:15,840
Sorry, let me get my sheet.

672
02:53:16,281 --> 02:53:18,921
Member Kretz?

673
02:53:19,462 --> 02:53:19,682
Yes.

674
02:53:21,182 --> 02:53:22,383
Member McLaughlin, yes.

675
02:53:22,643 --> 02:53:24,183
Member Stone?

676
02:53:24,483 --> 02:53:24,743
Yes.

677
02:53:25,504 --> 02:53:26,264
Member Rousseau?

678
02:53:26,744 --> 02:53:26,964
Yes.

679
02:53:27,764 --> 02:53:28,605
Member Van de Kloot?

680
02:53:28,985 --> 02:53:29,325
Yes.

681
02:53:29,945 --> 02:53:30,625
Mayor Longo Kern?

682
02:53:31,506 --> 02:53:31,806
Yes.

683
02:53:31,926 --> 02:53:33,766
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

684
02:53:34,187 --> 02:53:35,007
Motion is tabled.

685
02:53:36,707 --> 02:53:37,948
All right, thank you all.

686
02:53:38,088 --> 02:53:43,810
So the next item is the policy on harassment, which our attorney had

687
02:53:44,690 --> 02:53:50,331
He has sent us a number of policies that we either didn't have or were outdated, needed to be updated.

688
02:53:50,951 --> 02:53:54,652
So the policy ACAB on harassment, which is in our packets.

689
02:53:55,972 --> 02:54:00,513
I don't know if there, we motioned unanimously to approve this as written.

690
02:54:00,533 --> 02:54:01,974
So if there's any questions.

691
02:54:01,994 --> 02:54:06,254
I have a question.

692
02:54:06,714 --> 02:54:07,475
Member McLaughlin.

693
02:54:08,135 --> 02:54:14,156
Can you not, the public that I don't believe has the packets or access to the packets, can somebody read the motion?

694
02:54:16,861 --> 02:54:18,442
Do you mean read the?

695
02:54:18,522 --> 02:54:20,663
Yes, I do.

696
02:54:21,483 --> 02:54:24,425
Read the policy, please.

697
02:54:26,926 --> 02:54:27,767
Sure, one second.

698
02:54:29,428 --> 02:54:32,329
The public does have it from, I believe.

699
02:54:34,511 --> 02:54:35,111
Is it long?

700
02:54:35,491 --> 02:54:36,311
How long was it again?

701
02:54:37,572 --> 02:54:42,735
It is, yeah, it's six pages long.

702
02:54:45,817 --> 02:54:49,200
Okay, I would say, can you summarize the policy for the public, please?

703
02:54:51,762 --> 02:54:54,664
I'm not sure I can summarize it.

704
02:54:56,485 --> 02:54:59,928
It's full of lots of legalese and there's no extra stuff in there.

705
02:55:00,829 --> 02:55:04,451
I mean, I sort of look at this as every single sentence is very important.

706
02:55:05,112 --> 02:55:06,073
That's why it's in here.

707
02:55:11,390 --> 02:55:13,931
I mean, the policy, yeah, I can read the first paragraph.

708
02:55:13,992 --> 02:55:16,873
I think that might give you a good sense of what it is.

709
02:55:16,993 --> 02:55:24,418
It's a harassment of students by other students, employees, vendors, and other third parties will not be tolerated at the Medford Public Schools.

710
02:55:24,498 --> 02:55:35,564
The alleged harassment must involve conduct that occurred within the school's own program or activity, such as whether the harassment occurred at a location or under circumstances where the school owned

711
02:55:36,686 --> 02:56:03,336
where the school-owned or substantially controlled the premises, exercise oversight, supervision, or discipline over the location or participants, or funded, sponsored, promoted, or endorsed the event where the alleged harassment occurred against a person in the United States, the policies in effect while students are on school grounds, school district property, or property within the jurisdiction of the school district, school buses attending or engaging in school-sponsored

712
02:56:04,102 --> 02:56:04,602
activities.

713
02:56:05,363 --> 02:56:16,550
It is backed up by Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, and by one, two, three, four different Massachusetts general laws.

714
02:56:18,952 --> 02:56:21,273
It's a very, excuse me, sorry.

715
02:56:21,654 --> 02:56:23,074
It's a very substantial policy.

716
02:56:23,675 --> 02:56:27,778
And I do not believe we actually had this on file at all.

717
02:56:27,838 --> 02:56:31,360
This was sent to our, by our attorney as like urgently.

718
02:56:31,837 --> 02:56:32,958
get this done.

719
02:56:34,039 --> 02:56:38,082
Motion to approve, and we're going to post this on the website, obviously.

720
02:56:39,382 --> 02:56:40,143
Motion to approve.

721
02:56:41,764 --> 02:56:45,447
Motion for approval, seconded by member Bendicourt.

722
02:56:45,507 --> 02:56:45,967
Roll call.

723
02:56:47,729 --> 02:56:48,409
Member Graham.

724
02:56:51,131 --> 02:56:51,411
Yes.

725
02:56:53,253 --> 02:56:53,853
Member Kretz.

726
02:56:54,273 --> 02:56:54,493
Yes.

727
02:56:56,015 --> 02:56:57,175
Member McLaughlin, yes.

728
02:56:57,496 --> 02:56:58,256
Member McStone.

729
02:56:58,596 --> 02:56:58,837
Yes.

730
02:56:59,957 --> 02:57:00,558
Member Rousseau.

731
02:57:01,702 --> 02:57:01,942
Yes.

732
02:57:02,683 --> 02:57:05,065
Member Kratz, I mean, sorry, Member Vandekloot.

733
02:57:05,525 --> 02:57:05,765
Yes.

734
02:57:07,307 --> 02:57:08,227
Mayor Longo Karn.

735
02:57:08,888 --> 02:57:10,669
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

736
02:57:11,490 --> 02:57:12,951
Policy on harassment is approved.

737
02:57:13,231 --> 02:57:15,633
Next up, we have community participation.

738
02:57:15,653 --> 02:57:15,833
Mayor?

739
02:57:16,594 --> 02:57:16,754
Yep.

740
02:57:17,034 --> 02:57:17,815
Mayor?

741
02:57:17,835 --> 02:57:19,516
Sorry, there was one more, the staff conduct one.

742
02:57:20,497 --> 02:57:21,638
I know, this goes on all night.

743
02:57:21,958 --> 02:57:22,999
This is the last policy.

744
02:57:25,501 --> 02:57:28,824
So this was staff policy GBEB,

745
02:57:30,923 --> 02:57:33,844
This is a longstanding policy of our association.

746
02:57:34,244 --> 02:57:37,405
Medford had never adopted it, but it was recommended by our attorney.

747
02:57:39,306 --> 02:57:48,929
And it's a remarkably brief policy, just requiring that staff familiarizes themselves with state laws and regulations.

748
02:57:49,789 --> 02:57:54,591
Really, there's nothing new in here other than the fact that it is an official policy.

749
02:57:56,302 --> 02:57:57,043
Any questions?

750
02:57:57,343 --> 02:58:04,008
Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

751
02:58:04,068 --> 02:58:04,468
Roll call.

752
02:58:05,789 --> 02:58:06,389
Member Graham?

753
02:58:07,350 --> 02:58:07,590
Yes.

754
02:58:08,411 --> 02:58:09,011
Member Kretz?

755
02:58:09,432 --> 02:58:09,632
Yes.

756
02:58:10,392 --> 02:58:11,333
Member McLaughlin, yes.

757
02:58:11,393 --> 02:58:12,154
Member McStone?

758
02:58:12,454 --> 02:58:12,714
Yes.

759
02:58:13,435 --> 02:58:14,195
Member Rousseau?

760
02:58:14,876 --> 02:58:15,076
Yes.

761
02:58:15,876 --> 02:58:16,697
Member Van de Kloot?

762
02:58:17,137 --> 02:58:17,358
Yes.

763
02:58:18,038 --> 02:58:18,779
Mayor Longo Kern?

764
02:58:19,099 --> 02:58:19,299
Yes.

765
02:58:19,339 --> 02:58:20,680
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

766
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:21,921
Policy is approved.

767
02:58:22,702 --> 02:58:24,442
Number seven, community participation.

768
02:58:24,542 --> 02:58:32,724
Public participation emails, questions, or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

769
02:58:33,784 --> 02:58:35,625
Those submitting must include the following information.

770
02:58:35,665 --> 02:58:38,625
Your first and last name, your Medford street address, your question or comment.

771
02:58:39,525 --> 02:58:49,127
Member Van de Kloet, you said there's only- There's two, and one is in relation to the math curriculum, and the other is relation to the afterschool program.

772
02:58:49,187 --> 02:58:52,108
So I thought I might read them at the beginning of each of those sections.

773
02:58:52,608 --> 02:58:53,008
I agree.

774
02:58:53,168 --> 02:58:54,009
Perfect, thank you.

775
02:58:55,150 --> 02:59:01,455
Number eight, acceptance of the proposed extension of the superintendent's contract by the Medford School Committee.

776
02:59:04,938 --> 02:59:05,759
Motion to approve.

777
02:59:06,439 --> 02:59:10,022
Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

778
02:59:10,342 --> 02:59:11,103
Member Van de Kloet?

779
02:59:11,483 --> 02:59:12,724
No, I was going to second.

780
02:59:12,824 --> 02:59:13,265
Roll call.

781
02:59:14,946 --> 02:59:17,388
Member Graham?

782
02:59:18,069 --> 02:59:18,269
Yes.

783
02:59:19,550 --> 02:59:20,130
Member Kretz?

784
02:59:20,751 --> 02:59:20,911
Yes.

785
02:59:22,420 --> 02:59:23,501
Member McLaughlin, yes.

786
02:59:23,521 --> 02:59:24,761
Member McStone, yes.

787
02:59:26,402 --> 02:59:28,103
Member Rousseau, yes.

788
02:59:29,064 --> 02:59:30,464
Member Van de Kloot, yes.

789
02:59:32,085 --> 02:59:33,646
Mayor Lengelkern, yes.

790
02:59:33,726 --> 02:59:35,267
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

791
02:59:35,427 --> 02:59:37,728
Congratulations, Madam Superintendent.

792
02:59:38,709 --> 02:59:38,929
Mayor.

793
02:59:39,709 --> 02:59:40,450
Member Rousseau.

794
02:59:41,430 --> 02:59:41,870
Thank you.

795
02:59:42,971 --> 02:59:44,672
I'm just really happy that we can

796
02:59:45,427 --> 02:59:54,073
feel confident we're going to have our wonderful superintendent for, I believe, honestly, I forgot some of the details of the contract, even though we just did them, four more years.

797
02:59:54,693 --> 03:00:01,978
And I'm looking forward to what those four years will look like, especially after this year.

798
03:00:03,859 --> 03:00:07,001
It's definitely gonna be a brighter future, right?

799
03:00:08,082 --> 03:00:08,482
Thank you.

800
03:00:08,502 --> 03:00:10,363
Hopefully, yeah.

801
03:00:10,463 --> 03:00:11,464
Member McLaughlin.

802
03:00:12,994 --> 03:00:13,394
Thank you.

803
03:00:13,414 --> 03:00:22,143
I just wanted to second member Russo sentiments and thank the superintendent and we're fortunate to have you.

804
03:00:22,183 --> 03:00:23,264
This has been a hell of a year.

805
03:00:23,324 --> 03:00:28,549
It's been really good to know you and I look forward to continuing to work together.

806
03:00:28,590 --> 03:00:28,950
Thank you.

807
03:00:31,593 --> 03:00:39,057
I just want to say thank you to the school committee, and I look forward to serving Medford Mustangs, Mustang Nation.

808
03:00:39,497 --> 03:00:42,639
And next year will be a better year for all of us.

809
03:00:43,639 --> 03:00:45,800
And I look forward to working with everyone.

810
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,541
Thank you for the opportunity.

811
03:00:48,361 --> 03:00:49,482
Congratulations again.

812
03:00:51,423 --> 03:00:56,526
Number nine, we actually have your update, Madam Superintendent.

813
03:00:56,766 --> 03:00:59,247
Superintendent's updates and comments, number one.

814
03:01:12,715 --> 03:01:13,456
Well, good evening.

815
03:01:15,837 --> 03:01:20,561
My remarks today, there's some breaking news.

816
03:01:22,162 --> 03:01:33,651
In Knoxville, the Knoxville Police Department in Tennessee said that multiple agencies are at the scene of a shooting at Austin East Magnet High School.

817
03:01:34,752 --> 03:01:37,534
One person died and the shooter is in custody.

818
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:43,461
Before I begin, I'd like to bring your attention to the following.

819
03:01:45,302 --> 03:01:57,607
Last night, an African-American male, Dante Wright, was killed by police in Minnesota yesterday, less than 10 miles away from where Mr. George Floyd was killed.

820
03:01:59,208 --> 03:02:00,549
A curfew of 5 p.m.

821
03:02:00,569 --> 03:02:06,031
was put in place by the mayor of Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis.

822
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:11,364
Additionally, I would like to read a statement from the Minnesota twins.

823
03:02:12,765 --> 03:02:17,410
Out of respect for the tragic events that occurred yesterday in Brooklyn Center.

824
03:02:18,415 --> 03:02:33,861
and following the additional details in this evolving situation, the Minnesota Twins have decided it is in the best interest of our fans, staff, players, and community to not play today's game against the Red Sox.

825
03:02:34,861 --> 03:02:39,563
While we don't know what exactly happened, an investigation is ongoing.

826
03:02:40,243 --> 03:02:44,625
We send prayers to Mr. Wright's family and all involved.

827
03:02:46,279 --> 03:03:00,269
While discussing these events, I also must state how grateful I am that the Medford Human Rights Commission led another community conversation on the uncomfortable, yet extremely important need for racial equity.

828
03:03:00,289 --> 03:03:12,337
I'd like to thank Mayor Lungo Kern, Chief Jack Buckley, and Mary Ann O'Connor of the Board of Health, who realized the importance of addressing these issues of race in our community.

829
03:03:13,498 --> 03:03:21,103
Additionally, there were over 140 members of the community who actively participated in last Wednesday night's discussion.

830
03:03:22,304 --> 03:03:33,212
Special thanks to Mr. Neil Osborne for organizing these ongoing community conversations as we work together to improve the quality of life for all in our community.

831
03:03:35,133 --> 03:03:39,516
I'd like to say this quote to share with you a quote from Jackie Robinson.

832
03:03:41,660 --> 03:03:44,901
I'm not concerned with you liking or disliking me.

833
03:03:46,021 --> 03:03:49,162
All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.

834
03:03:50,503 --> 03:03:59,686
So as we think about the things that are continuing to happen across the country, let's remember that we should treat one another as human beings.

835
03:04:02,666 --> 03:04:12,333
So just transitioning, I would like to say today was the first week of four-day instruction for our students in grades six through 12.

836
03:04:14,895 --> 03:04:28,164
Following April vacation on Monday, April 26th, we will return to five days of instruction for our students in grades six through 12 as we continue to increase normality in our schools.

837
03:04:29,145 --> 03:04:29,745
Last week,

838
03:04:31,475 --> 03:04:39,401
or this past week that just happened, we began five-day instruction for all elementary schools K through five.

839
03:04:39,762 --> 03:04:45,546
So they are now on their second week of five days of instruction at the K through five level.

840
03:04:47,768 --> 03:04:55,795
I would also like to take a moment to just thank Congresswoman Catherine Clark for choosing to visit the McGlynn School Complex last Thursday.

841
03:04:57,671 --> 03:05:01,953
She wanted to see the testing and the students in the classrooms.

842
03:05:02,873 --> 03:05:07,596
Both the mayor and myself thanked her for the assistance of the Federal CARES Act monies.

843
03:05:08,736 --> 03:05:21,602
The Congresswoman spoke to us about the importance of passing the American Rescue Plan, another COVID-19 relief package that could see Medford receive an additional $5 million.

844
03:05:22,663 --> 03:05:25,704
She explained that the funding is intended to help schools

845
03:05:26,312 --> 03:05:40,058
with HVAC improvements, technology and PPE, as well as helping students to make up for lost learning time, potentially in the form of summer school or afterschool programs.

846
03:05:40,919 --> 03:05:47,982
She was very impressed with the students COVID testing themselves and loved interacting with our elementary students.

847
03:05:48,842 --> 03:05:54,585
A special thank you again to Congresswoman Catherine Clark for coming to Medford Public Schools.

848
03:05:56,562 --> 03:06:05,285
I also want to thank the members of the community who participated in our roundtable discussions last week around the Medford Public Schools strategic plan.

849
03:06:06,465 --> 03:06:13,308
Additionally, I would like to thank members of the cabinet and department heads who actively participated in these important conversations.

850
03:06:14,268 --> 03:06:20,210
Please know that we will utilize the feedback as we continue to move forward on the district's plan.

851
03:06:22,492 --> 03:06:29,333
I'd like to say that this evening begins Ramadan for our Muslim families, friends, and neighbors.

852
03:06:30,614 --> 03:06:42,576
Ramadan continues until May 12th and is considered the most sacred month for the whole Muslim Umar, which means community.

853
03:06:44,737 --> 03:06:47,417
During Ramadan, you ask for forgiveness.

854
03:06:48,618 --> 03:06:50,478
You exercise self-control.

855
03:06:51,956 --> 03:06:59,738
You try to experience the life of the have-not, experiencing what the have-nots experience all the time.

856
03:07:00,758 --> 03:07:04,919
It teaches empathy, putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

857
03:07:06,359 --> 03:07:13,400
For example, if you thought of a have-not, it could be someone who's homeless temporarily.

858
03:07:15,081 --> 03:07:21,222
It is my hope that during this holy season, happiness and joy will fill your homes.

859
03:07:22,455 --> 03:07:33,399
Ramadan Kareem, which is said in the Middle East, or Ramadan Mubarak, which is said in Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Pakistan.

860
03:07:34,579 --> 03:07:38,381
What that means is enjoy the blessings of this holy month.

861
03:07:41,002 --> 03:07:41,582
Last week,

862
03:07:42,759 --> 03:07:59,384
Medford resident Lauren Stern, who works for iRobot, visited Mrs. Lasky's remote fourth grade class at the McGlynn Elementary School as part of a computer class lesson about robotics and algorithms.

863
03:08:02,045 --> 03:08:02,265
Ms.

864
03:08:02,285 --> 03:08:09,608
Stern presented fun examples, particularly on ways Roomba reacts or performs in action.

865
03:08:10,853 --> 03:08:17,115
During the interactive presentation, students asked questions and engaged in dialogues about robots.

866
03:08:18,636 --> 03:08:19,936
Special thanks to Ms.

867
03:08:19,976 --> 03:08:22,417
Lasky and computer teacher, Ms.

868
03:08:22,517 --> 03:08:24,838
Elias, who organized the presentation.

869
03:08:26,939 --> 03:08:38,283
I also would like to take this moment to extend our sincere thanks to the following organizations who have graciously made donations to the Medford Public Schools.

870
03:08:39,918 --> 03:08:49,743
Rich Raymond and Sean Mangan of Armstrong Ambulance for donating stop the bleed kits for the La Conte ice skating rink facility.

871
03:08:50,823 --> 03:08:57,206
We appreciate their consistent support and helping to keep our athletes healthy and safe.

872
03:08:58,532 --> 03:09:02,616
We'd like to thank Katie Marino of Skin Therapy in Station Landing.

873
03:09:03,076 --> 03:09:09,602
She donated seven skin therapy facial kits to a teacher in each of the Medford public schools.

874
03:09:10,382 --> 03:09:13,745
Additionally, Katie sent a special kit to Ms.

875
03:09:13,785 --> 03:09:19,910
Malloy and took time to stock many of our micro pantries with non-perishable items.

876
03:09:20,751 --> 03:09:28,716
Lastly, Skin Therapy raised $275, which they donated to the Mustang senior class.

877
03:09:29,856 --> 03:09:38,081
Katie is a mom to Derek, a student at Medford High School, and to Mark and James, students at the Roberts Elementary School.

878
03:09:38,622 --> 03:09:39,662
Thank you very much, Ms.

879
03:09:39,702 --> 03:09:40,163
Marino.

880
03:09:41,283 --> 03:09:49,308
We'd also like to thank Wegmans, who donated over 200 bottles of hand sanitizer for all of our students.

881
03:09:51,474 --> 03:10:02,924
And we'd like to thank Tufts University who donated office furniture for teachers and staff who needed an extra desk, file cabinet, storage closet, or bookcase.

882
03:10:04,205 --> 03:10:12,873
All of these groups have been so kind to remember the Medford Public Schools staff and students, and we appreciate their generosity.

883
03:10:14,634 --> 03:10:18,518
There are a few important dates that I wanna highlight coming up this week.

884
03:10:20,916 --> 03:10:25,000
This Thursday on April 15th, from three to 4 p.m.

885
03:10:25,860 --> 03:10:29,203
via Zoom, the middle school lottery drawing will be held.

886
03:10:30,725 --> 03:10:35,469
Parents and guardians and caregivers, you are invited to call in for the drawing.

887
03:10:36,450 --> 03:10:44,177
All results will be posted on our website and blog, and it will be available within a few hours of the drawing.

888
03:10:45,454 --> 03:10:53,094
Letters confirming each student's middle school assignment will be sent to all grade five students by April 22nd.

889
03:10:55,300 --> 03:11:06,104
If you have not received or if you've replaced your child's unique identification number, please reach out to Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli and she will be able to assist you.

890
03:11:06,664 --> 03:11:11,406
Her email is briccidelli, B-R-I-C-C-I-A-R-D-E-L-L-I at medford.k12.ma.us.

891
03:11:21,703 --> 03:11:32,656
This Friday, April 16, is the deadline to submit applications to participate in the advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School.

892
03:11:33,377 --> 03:11:36,641
So please send in your applications.

893
03:11:36,741 --> 03:11:38,423
We don't want you to miss the deadline.

894
03:11:41,306 --> 03:11:41,807
Next week.

895
03:11:42,380 --> 03:11:46,523
is April vacation week from April 19th through the 23rd.

896
03:11:46,964 --> 03:11:49,626
So there will be no instruction during that time.

897
03:11:50,507 --> 03:11:59,534
For those of you who might be traveling, please, please, please pay attention to the COVID guidelines around travel.

898
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:15,152
Nurse Toni Rae will also mention this in her presentation later, but please keep in mind COVID safety travel is incredibly important when we're talking about return to school instructions.

899
03:12:17,554 --> 03:12:21,678
Please note that the last day of school for this school year 2021 will be Friday, June 18th.

900
03:12:26,107 --> 03:12:33,011
And lastly, I would like to take a moment to remember an important anniversary that is coming up this Thursday.

901
03:12:34,331 --> 03:12:49,139
Back in 2013, on Patriots Day, April 15th, the sunny spring day brought with it the usual, the ride of Paul Revere, the Red Sox playing at Fenway Park, and the running of the Boston Marathon.

902
03:12:50,462 --> 03:12:55,845
but the day quickly turned dark as the marathon became the site of terrorist bombings.

903
03:12:57,306 --> 03:13:03,069
One of our own Medford Mustangs, Crystal Campbell, was lost on that horrible day.

904
03:13:04,270 --> 03:13:16,698
This Thursday, it is my hope that you will take a moment and remember those both lost and injured on one Boston day with reflection, prayer, and unity.

905
03:13:17,638 --> 03:13:18,959
Thank you, and have a good evening.

906
03:13:23,078 --> 03:13:24,359
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

907
03:13:26,262 --> 03:13:32,829
Number two, we have COVID-19 public health update and Metro Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update.

908
03:13:33,209 --> 03:13:34,831
Nurse supervisor, Tony Ray.

909
03:13:34,851 --> 03:13:39,396
I don't think Marion is on and Mr. David Murphy.

910
03:13:41,018 --> 03:13:41,178
Ms.

911
03:13:41,218 --> 03:13:42,520
Ray and Mr. Murphy.

912
03:13:51,045 --> 03:13:52,026
Thank you.

913
03:13:52,066 --> 03:13:53,027
Good evening, everyone.

914
03:13:53,887 --> 03:13:56,489
I will start with Medford city data.

915
03:13:57,290 --> 03:14:08,377
The city of Medford remains in the yellow zone with an average daily incidence rate of 25.9 positive cases and a 1.38% positivity.

916
03:14:09,018 --> 03:14:12,881
This is little change from the data presented at our last school committee meeting.

917
03:14:14,842 --> 03:14:16,183
Medford public school data.

918
03:14:18,387 --> 03:14:28,172
Last week, school nurses completed over 3,800 tests and identified four positive pools and four positive cases.

919
03:14:29,513 --> 03:14:32,014
Our in-school transmission rates remain low.

920
03:14:32,595 --> 03:14:38,538
However, community cases and household transmission of pediatric COVID illness are increasing.

921
03:14:41,499 --> 03:14:45,121
There is some promising information coming from the CDC and the Mass.

922
03:14:45,141 --> 03:14:46,302
Department of Public Health.

923
03:14:47,510 --> 03:14:52,753
More Massachusetts residents are being vaccinated each week, including our teaching staff.

924
03:14:54,454 --> 03:15:04,339
And starting on April 9th, eligibility for vaccinations open to all people within the state age 16 years and older.

925
03:15:06,600 --> 03:15:11,442
However, there remains concern about the current uptick in COVID cases in Massachusetts.

926
03:15:12,363 --> 03:15:16,285
The number of positive cases among younger populations is increasing.

927
03:15:17,055 --> 03:15:22,678
We're seeing more cases between the 15 to 40 year olds who have not been vaccinated.

928
03:15:23,838 --> 03:15:29,621
The UK variant is quickly becoming a dominant strain of COVID-19 in Massachusetts.

929
03:15:30,882 --> 03:15:41,187
This strain seems to spread more easily and more quickly than other variants and has potential to make populations more ill.

930
03:15:42,908 --> 03:15:48,986
The UK variant is thought to be responsible for the increasing number of positive cases in children.

931
03:15:50,417 --> 03:15:53,038
So this is not the time to let down your guard.

932
03:15:54,018 --> 03:16:14,862
We ask that you continue to wear your face mask, practice rigorous hand hygiene, maintain six foot physical distancing whenever possible, stay home when you feel sick, that is especially important, or if somebody in your household has tested positive, and limit the gatherings with people outside of your household.

933
03:16:16,704 --> 03:16:35,145
As April vacation approaches, I'm reminding parents and staff to follow the travel advisory issued by Governor Baker, meaning that all visitors entering Massachusetts, including returning residents, are advised to quarantine for 10 days upon their arrival into the state.

934
03:16:36,788 --> 03:17:00,685
Students and staff may return to school sooner than 10 days if they receive a negative COVID-19 test administered not more than three days prior to their arrival in Massachusetts, or if they receive a negative COVID test after arrival in Massachusetts, as long as they quarantine until they receive their negative test result.

935
03:17:02,179 --> 03:17:25,774
And lastly, travelers who are fully vaccinated, meaning they've had at least, they've had their two doses of Moderna or Pfizer COVID vaccines, or they've received a single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, more than 14 days prior to arrival to Massachusetts, and they do not have symptoms, they do not have to quarantine.

936
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:32,303
I'd like to echo Dr. Edward Vincent's message in our communication on Friday, April 9th.

937
03:17:32,844 --> 03:17:38,228
Following the state guidance will continue to help keep our school community safe and in school.

938
03:17:39,068 --> 03:17:39,529
Thank you.

939
03:17:41,710 --> 03:17:41,950
Mayor.

940
03:17:44,292 --> 03:17:44,953
Member Roussell.

941
03:17:45,973 --> 03:17:46,314
Thank you.

942
03:17:48,805 --> 03:17:52,027
Listening to that, I realized I have a question I hadn't even thought of.

943
03:17:52,267 --> 03:18:08,435
So when students, and this is really only elementary level, when students' families, when students travel over April vacation with their families, they are part of the not full remote cohorts.

944
03:18:09,136 --> 03:18:13,018
I don't know if we've decided to just collapse the cohorts and call them, they're in-person students.

945
03:18:15,299 --> 03:18:16,339
Do we have a new name for that?

946
03:18:16,379 --> 03:18:16,660
I don't know.

947
03:18:17,722 --> 03:18:18,422
This will suffice.

948
03:18:18,462 --> 03:18:27,566
We have from a school brains perspective, we have done that just to make sure the fields are clear, but the practical implication is just that it's students who are coming in.

949
03:18:28,746 --> 03:18:29,086
Thank you.

950
03:18:29,206 --> 03:18:38,350
So for students that are coming in whose family, and again, this is really only an issue for elementary, their families have chosen to travel outside of the state.

951
03:18:38,710 --> 03:18:43,792
When they return on the 26th, where will those students

952
03:18:44,566 --> 03:18:46,066
Who would those students' teachers be?

953
03:18:46,907 --> 03:18:48,847
They're not allowed to come back to school, right?

954
03:18:50,408 --> 03:19:04,432
They need to receive a negative COVID test either three days prior to returning to Massachusetts or upon return to Massachusetts, but you must quarantine until you get your test results.

955
03:19:05,313 --> 03:19:24,721
So if you enter the state, let's say on Saturday the 24th, you would be able to get a COVID test on Sunday the 25th at one of the stop the spread sites and hopefully get your results sometime on Monday to enter back in on Tuesday.

956
03:19:25,121 --> 03:19:34,805
Yeah, I think that Mr. Sun, there's not an option to remote in at the elementary level because the classes that are remote are not the classes that these students are enrolled in.

957
03:19:35,266 --> 03:19:49,231
And so if a student is prohibited from going to school because the family traveled and they weren't able to obtain the test, and therefore, in order to comply with the state protocols, they would have to stay home from school.

958
03:19:50,631 --> 03:20:05,076
We won't, frankly, have the capacity to police that in the sense that we'll know exactly who traveled and who didn't, but it is our expectation that families will keep children home if coming to school would violate that

959
03:20:05,749 --> 03:20:07,811
those state protocols that the governor has issued.

960
03:20:08,392 --> 03:20:09,493
But there's not an option.

961
03:20:09,633 --> 03:20:16,719
We're not gonna simulcast the class because people violated the state, the protocols.

962
03:20:17,460 --> 03:20:20,463
Or we would be violating the protocols if they were committed.

963
03:20:22,144 --> 03:20:30,812
And since this is the week before school vacation week, will we be blasting communications to parents

964
03:20:31,716 --> 03:20:39,199
about what the expectations are, are we just relying on hoping that they remember, or frankly, the state's guidance have changed many times.

965
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:42,421
Until I was listening to Ms.

966
03:20:42,461 --> 03:20:56,267
Ray, I actually had not realized like, wait, if we go away, there's a set of steps to, I just worry about people who in good faith go away and come back and,

967
03:20:57,242 --> 03:20:59,323
don't realize that they've violated things.

968
03:20:59,483 --> 03:21:16,894
And I know we can't police it, but we also don't wanna shut down a whole building on the week after school vacation, the week after we returned, because there were three or four kids that come back and give it to, these new variants are so much more contagious.

969
03:21:16,974 --> 03:21:26,140
So I wanna make sure that everybody knows, and this isn't the place for that, because most people aren't here on this meeting, that everybody knows, especially

970
03:21:26,705 --> 03:21:38,473
the elementary kids, because the options just don't exist, that if they go away, that they must have a test, and that's their expectation, even if we can't enforce it.

971
03:21:40,034 --> 03:21:41,755
I think we will definitely communicate that.

972
03:21:41,875 --> 03:21:55,505
I will say, while there has been variability in what the specifics of the protocols, I think that the restrictions that have been imposed on all residents of the Commonwealth, we've all sort of been familiarized with them over the course of the last year.

973
03:21:56,226 --> 03:22:13,560
And with every school holiday or vacation, be it when we came back to school in the fall or attempted to and phased in over the Thanksgiving holiday, the holidays over the holiday break in December, February vacation, this is a constant refrain.

974
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:18,203
And so I think you're right that we have to reiterate and reaffirm and emphasize that.

975
03:22:18,583 --> 03:22:24,408
But I don't think anyone should be taken by surprise that there are steps that are necessary to travel at this point.

976
03:22:24,937 --> 03:22:31,002
And I think that the only other thing I would say is we will be testing on that first Monday.

977
03:22:31,022 --> 03:22:45,673
My hope is that people don't come in if they've traveled and haven't received their test, but families should feel confident and comfortable knowing that on the very first day back, we're gonna test every student or virtually every student that comes in.

978
03:22:46,233 --> 03:22:52,218
And hopefully that will prevent the type of domino effect that you're suggesting could be possible.

979
03:22:53,818 --> 03:23:03,687
The other thing, Member Russo, is in Dr. Edward Vincent's communication on Friday the 9th, this was also mentioned as a reminder in that communication.

980
03:23:05,209 --> 03:23:12,235
The school nurses are putting it on their virtual classrooms, so we are trying to get out the information as quickly as we can.

981
03:23:12,435 --> 03:23:12,655
Yes.

982
03:23:13,376 --> 03:23:13,956
Thank you so much.

983
03:23:14,657 --> 03:23:15,498
Member McLaughlin?

984
03:23:17,790 --> 03:23:18,191
Thank you.

985
03:23:18,531 --> 03:23:22,536
Yeah, I guess I would also just put out in terms of getting the information out.

986
03:23:23,657 --> 03:23:35,372
I appreciate the superintendent's weekly correspondence but I'm not sure that everybody reads all of it and so I think I don't know it might be worth at some point asking families

987
03:23:35,900 --> 03:23:38,162
what the most effective mode of communication is.

988
03:23:38,202 --> 03:23:43,206
And I know in the past when that question has been asked, we've been told all of the above.

989
03:23:43,266 --> 03:23:49,952
So, you know, social media, robocall, you know, the superintendent's notices, the classroom.

990
03:23:49,972 --> 03:23:53,195
So I would, you know, say all of the above if possible.

991
03:23:53,315 --> 03:23:55,938
And then backing it up a little bit, I'm wondering if there's any data

992
03:23:57,383 --> 03:24:13,567
on the numbers for the student, for the remote population and our in-person students now that things are starting to, I know that we're not there for the high school yet, but I'm assuming that for elementary and middle, there must be some data there.

993
03:24:13,587 --> 03:24:26,631
Data with respect to- How many remote, how many in-person for each of our- In terms of how many students are enrolled to come into the in-person delivery?

994
03:24:27,759 --> 03:24:29,821
We do have that data.

995
03:24:29,981 --> 03:24:46,110
I think that there are one-off situations in which families are asking to essentially do an internal transfer from remote to in-person, but the numbers are relatively consistent with where they've been, where it should be about 60 to 65% of our students in-person.

996
03:24:47,471 --> 03:24:49,752
Across all of our schools, it's 60 to 65% in-person?

997
03:24:49,832 --> 03:24:51,473
I think the number is 62%, but there's

998
03:24:54,650 --> 03:25:00,276
There's some fluidity in that, but I'm pretty sure 62% was the last number that I saw.

999
03:25:00,296 --> 03:25:00,896
Okay, thank you.

1000
03:25:02,898 --> 03:25:03,279
Thank you.

1001
03:25:03,299 --> 03:25:09,866
Number three, we have report on middle school math curriculum, math director Faiza Khan, Ms.

1002
03:25:09,886 --> 03:25:10,206
Khan.

1003
03:25:11,647 --> 03:25:11,908
Mayor?

1004
03:25:12,769 --> 03:25:13,830
Yes, member Van de Kloet.

1005
03:25:14,570 --> 03:25:18,652
I'm so I do have a letter from the public regarding the math curriculum.

1006
03:25:18,752 --> 03:25:27,315
I don't know whether I would actually ask Pfizer, whether I should read it at the beginning or at the end of her presentation.

1007
03:25:29,357 --> 03:25:31,438
Thank you for the opportunity.

1008
03:25:32,639 --> 03:25:35,541
I actually received a copy of that letter.

1009
03:25:35,601 --> 03:25:36,161
Thank you.

1010
03:25:36,481 --> 03:25:45,086
And it seems like most of the questions are answered in my report, with the exception of maybe one.

1011
03:25:45,687 --> 03:25:52,411
So I would love to get a lead on which way would you like me to go ahead with it?

1012
03:25:52,891 --> 03:25:54,172
I think just because we've...

1013
03:25:55,072 --> 03:26:01,533
the person submitted it appropriately, we should read it very quickly, and then hopefully you'll hit the points.

1014
03:26:02,474 --> 03:26:02,754
Okay?

1015
03:26:03,034 --> 03:26:03,674
That'd be perfect.

1016
03:26:04,074 --> 03:26:05,014
Thank you, Member Van de Kloet.

1017
03:26:05,114 --> 03:26:05,754
Thank you, Ms.

1018
03:26:05,854 --> 03:26:06,034
Kahn.

1019
03:26:06,194 --> 03:26:08,675
Dear members of the school committee, I have some questions for Ms.

1020
03:26:08,715 --> 03:26:12,616
Kahn about the report on the math curriculum and would appreciate if this letter was read then.

1021
03:26:13,336 --> 03:26:20,637
One, have the programs that the elementary schools can possibly pilot been narrowed yet, or is that part of what the committee is going to decide?

1022
03:26:21,097 --> 03:26:23,418
What are the programs that are still in consideration?

1023
03:26:23,778 --> 03:26:23,918
Two,

1024
03:26:24,650 --> 03:26:28,153
What is the plan for the current middle schoolers for the 21-22 school year?

1025
03:26:28,473 --> 03:26:30,975
Will the seventh or eighth graders have an accelerated class?

1026
03:26:31,435 --> 03:26:35,418
Or are we planning on definitely choosing one of the high school acceleration options?

1027
03:26:36,278 --> 03:26:45,665
Three, if the advanced pathways chosen that begins, if the advanced pathways chosen that begins in ninth grade, figure four.

1028
03:26:49,028 --> 03:26:52,230
A, how are the enhanced classes different from the regular classes?

1029
03:26:52,784 --> 03:26:57,887
How much from pre-calculus needs to be pushed into these enhanced classes for students to be ready for calculus?

1030
03:26:58,447 --> 03:27:01,589
Could these topics be covered in the regular classes for all students?

1031
03:27:02,069 --> 03:27:08,653
B, what are the pathways for late bloomers in math to get into the advanced pathway and for students who decide to switch out?

1032
03:27:09,333 --> 03:27:21,840
C, could there be another option where all students take algebra, geometry, algebra two, and then senior year when students have a better idea of what they want to do after graduation, they split into an enhanced calculus or take one of the other math options?

1033
03:27:23,804 --> 03:27:31,610
This is very focused on the advanced students, but what are we going to do to close the achievement gap, especially from the events of the last year?

1034
03:27:31,750 --> 03:27:38,155
How can we close the gap without relying heavily on summer school, excessive afterschool tutoring, excessive homework, or keeping students back?

1035
03:27:38,495 --> 03:27:38,876
Thank you.

1036
03:27:39,236 --> 03:27:42,619
Submitted by Michelle Chiccolo, 28 Douglas Road.

1037
03:27:44,620 --> 03:27:45,081
Thank you, Ms.

1038
03:27:45,161 --> 03:27:45,701
Van de Kloot.

1039
03:27:47,423 --> 03:27:47,603
Ms.

1040
03:27:47,623 --> 03:27:47,863
Khan.

1041
03:27:48,735 --> 03:27:49,275
Thank you.

1042
03:27:50,276 --> 03:28:03,164
I will, I had prepared a slide deck, but I believe it's best if I read directly from my report because members of the school committee have a copy of my report.

1043
03:28:03,604 --> 03:28:05,645
I'm not too sure if the public does.

1044
03:28:05,785 --> 03:28:15,451
So the first thing I wanted to mention is that the report actually, the title is Mathematics K-12 Update.

1045
03:28:17,172 --> 03:28:24,880
And the intention was to give our community an update on the state of mathematics in Medford public schools.

1046
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:37,932
So just a minor correction with the label in the actual agenda, but the report is on K through 12 mathematics.

1047
03:28:39,654 --> 03:28:44,478
The report starts out with an update on elementary schools.

1048
03:28:45,739 --> 03:28:54,886
So the subscription to Medford Public Schools Elementary Mathematics Program, currently we are using Envisions, Envisions 2015 version.

1049
03:28:55,506 --> 03:28:57,648
It expired in June of 2020.

1050
03:28:59,069 --> 03:29:13,622
In October 2019, the Medford Public Schools Mathematics Department formed the Elementary Mathematics Program Review and Implementation Committee with representation from all Medford elementary schools and teacher groups.

1051
03:29:14,202 --> 03:29:19,067
The purpose of this committee is to assess a variety of math programs

1052
03:29:19,667 --> 03:29:29,814
We will connect research studies concerning mathematical pedagogy while keeping the district's mission and Medford community at the center of our decision-making process.

1053
03:29:30,474 --> 03:29:49,046
The committee recognizes that the standards detailed in the 2017 Massachusetts Mathematics Curriculum Frameworks balance conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and applications of the content, and the committee's goal is to choose a final program that will be closely tied

1054
03:29:49,567 --> 03:29:52,250
if not fully tied to these frameworks.

1055
03:29:52,791 --> 03:30:03,587
We are aware that DESE recognizes mathematics as a language for describing and understanding the physical world and the change in mathematics teaching and learning pedagogy.

1056
03:30:04,771 --> 03:30:08,632
The value in mathematics instruction and learning has shifted.

1057
03:30:09,232 --> 03:30:32,138
As a result of this shift, mathematics teaching and learning in MPS must emphasize on learning and not performing, mistakes are valuable, questions are important, depth is more important than speed and is achieved through interesting and engaging mathematical problems that encourage connections, conversations and modeling.

1058
03:30:33,058 --> 03:30:41,924
As a result of the ongoing global pandemic, the committee's work was paused in March 2020 and will resume in April 2021.

1059
03:30:42,965 --> 03:30:50,070
The next steps in the committee's work will be may invite parents and community stakeholders to participate.

1060
03:30:50,670 --> 03:30:53,373
June, parents selected from the applicants.

1061
03:30:53,973 --> 03:31:03,182
Summer 2021, select up to three programs using the established analysis rubric to pilot in all schools at various grade levels.

1062
03:31:04,504 --> 03:31:08,688
Fiscal year 22, pilot and evaluate efficacy of the programs.

1063
03:31:09,148 --> 03:31:12,551
April 2022, recommend program for adoption.

1064
03:31:14,163 --> 03:31:32,445
A few questions that I would like to answer from the elementary mathematics program committee's perspective is that we did start out initially by choosing seven programs and out of a long list.

1065
03:31:33,046 --> 03:31:35,768
Those seven programs were basically chosen by me.

1066
03:31:36,568 --> 03:31:51,276
I went to ed reports and I saw what are the top programs, which ones are the ones that are very closely tied with the frameworks and are getting top rankings, just like we did in the mathematics programs.

1067
03:31:51,796 --> 03:31:59,080
Out of those seven programs, we are inviting the publishers to give us presentations and the committee members will be choosing

1068
03:31:59,820 --> 03:32:00,981
up to three programs.

1069
03:32:01,341 --> 03:32:09,307
These three programs that the teachers in the committee will choose will be piloted at all schools.

1070
03:32:10,808 --> 03:32:14,510
It could be that we choose two programs instead of three.

1071
03:32:14,931 --> 03:32:19,374
However, the intent is to pilot in all

1072
03:32:20,394 --> 03:32:24,576
in all four elementary schools at different grade levels.

1073
03:32:26,077 --> 03:32:30,199
It was important for us that we keep the community at the center of it.

1074
03:32:30,279 --> 03:32:34,682
So parents will be invited to be part of the process.

1075
03:32:35,402 --> 03:32:47,388
We just wanted to be sure that after listening to the presentations from the publishers, that we have narrowed it down to three and hence the timeline reflects that.

1076
03:32:49,369 --> 03:32:49,970
A parent, Ms.

1077
03:32:50,010 --> 03:33:05,783
Moncada, also had emailed me and she asked me if, you know, it'll be at, if the teachers have chosen to be part of the committee, have they volunteered it or was there another process?

1078
03:33:06,063 --> 03:33:07,544
And yes, it was by choice.

1079
03:33:08,445 --> 03:33:16,312
And we are lucky enough that teachers at every school and different grade levels have volunteered to be part of the committee.

1080
03:33:16,852 --> 03:33:23,938
The seven programs that were again initially chosen and we have yet to narrow them down to two or three.

1081
03:33:25,239 --> 03:33:29,222
One of them is a ready is ready I ready, you might have heard about it.

1082
03:33:30,964 --> 03:33:38,470
And basically all these seven programs are the top programs right now bridges investigations three by Turk.

1083
03:33:40,551 --> 03:33:58,432
Math Expressions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Illustrative Mathematics, which is our middle school program, Envisions 2020, which is a newer version of Envisions 2020, and the last one is Into Math, also by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

1084
03:33:59,691 --> 03:34:03,373
So this is the list of seven programs that we started out with.

1085
03:34:03,953 --> 03:34:05,874
The committee was looking at these.

1086
03:34:05,934 --> 03:34:08,756
We had attended, I believe, one presentation.

1087
03:34:09,116 --> 03:34:14,018
So we have yet to go through many presentations and then choose three.

1088
03:34:14,979 --> 03:34:17,500
The rubric was agreed upon by the teachers.

1089
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:19,821
And we do have a rubric in place.

1090
03:34:20,982 --> 03:34:23,363
And we'll be happy to share it with the parents.

1091
03:34:24,425 --> 03:34:30,507
with any parent who asks for it, and definitely with the parents who are part of the committee.

1092
03:34:31,728 --> 03:34:48,394
With that, I'll now give an update on the middle school and high school, and then I'll answer the questions that pertain to those, the middle and high school, and then any questions that were not covered by me, I'll be happy to answer those.

1093
03:34:49,074 --> 03:34:49,255
So,

1094
03:34:50,715 --> 03:34:59,845
For middle school and high school, Medford middle schools are using the adopted illustrative mathematics program in standard grades six through eight.

1095
03:35:00,826 --> 03:35:05,731
While challenging, teachers have used this rigorous program in the school year 2020-2021.

1096
03:35:08,614 --> 03:35:11,555
in their classrooms to the best extent possible.

1097
03:35:11,955 --> 03:35:19,518
The eighth grade algebra classes in school year 2020-2021 are using the Big Ideas mathematics programs.

1098
03:35:20,139 --> 03:35:31,323
The department did not offer accelerated mathematics to students in seventh grade this school year 2020-2021 due to the pandemic-induced learning gaps.

1099
03:35:31,983 --> 03:35:38,173
The mathematics department will reinstate the accelerated middle school program for fiscal year 22.

1100
03:35:38,754 --> 03:35:43,521
The curriculum modification for this accelerated group will be in line with the

1101
03:35:44,482 --> 03:35:51,629
Desi pathway recommendations for standards in 2017 Massachusetts math frameworks.

1102
03:35:52,269 --> 03:35:58,515
Our previous middle school acceleration is not a recommended pathway in the 2017 frameworks.

1103
03:35:59,336 --> 03:36:05,361
The mathematics standards for grades six through eight are coherent, rigorous, and non-redundant.

1104
03:36:06,623 --> 03:36:08,825
thus making these challenging.

1105
03:36:09,366 --> 03:36:24,122
For those students ready to move at a more accelerated pace, one option is to compress the standards for any three consecutive grades and or courses into an accelerated two-year pathway at the middle school level.

1106
03:36:25,957 --> 03:36:51,577
And I'm happy to show my presentation in which we can see the slide where we are taking, as per Desi's recommendations, we are taking grade eight, grade seven, grade eight standards and teaching half of them in seventh grade in the accelerated path and the other half with algebra one in students' eighth grade experience.

1107
03:36:52,836 --> 03:36:55,639
I'll be happy to show that figure to you shortly.

1108
03:36:55,659 --> 03:36:58,922
That will be figure two as Ms.

1109
03:36:59,622 --> 03:37:02,945
Ciccolo's email mentions figure four.

1110
03:37:04,547 --> 03:37:15,756
And the Medford Public Schools Mathematics Department recognizes that presenting a variety of course-taking pathways encourages students to persist in their mathematical studies.

1111
03:37:16,277 --> 03:37:17,958
The department has formed

1112
03:37:18,919 --> 03:37:36,021
in MPS 6th through 12th grade equitable math pathways and program review committee with the philosophy of exploring pathways and programs that will help all students in Medford public schools and Medford high school achieve their full mathematics potential.

1113
03:37:37,042 --> 03:37:54,123
Using the NCTM, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, access and equity in mathematics principles as the guiding pillars, the committee members will assess the program's pathways and offerings in Medford public schools, grades six through 12.

1114
03:37:55,657 --> 03:38:04,700
So I'll be, I'll show you figure three and figure four, which was mentioned in the email very shortly.

1115
03:38:06,261 --> 03:38:11,663
And one of them is already being offered, figure three in Medford Public Schools.

1116
03:38:12,463 --> 03:38:15,445
The committee will be giving its,

1117
03:38:17,996 --> 03:38:20,337
due consideration to figure four.

1118
03:38:21,257 --> 03:38:22,878
So the email comes right in time.

1119
03:38:23,479 --> 03:38:35,606
The sixth through 12 grades equitable math pathways and program review committee will review the ways to effectively and cohesively deploy the illustrative mathematics program for all middle school students.

1120
03:38:36,246 --> 03:38:45,892
This committee will review the focus, clarity, rigor and alignment between our middle and high school programs with the goal of preparing students for advanced mathematics.

1121
03:38:46,552 --> 03:38:58,599
The Medford High School Mathematics Program, which includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II, through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as its publishers, will expire in June 2020.

1122
03:38:58,979 --> 03:39:06,403
The committee will, the timeline is April 2021, will be recruiting secondary teachers.

1123
03:39:06,463 --> 03:39:07,964
That process has started.

1124
03:39:08,484 --> 03:39:10,285
It'll include a general education.

1125
03:39:12,290 --> 03:39:15,574
our EL teachers and our special education teachers.

1126
03:39:16,775 --> 03:39:23,403
May and June 2021, we will start work to establish a rubric and the pedagogy review.

1127
03:39:24,324 --> 03:39:32,373
For 2021, we'll finalize program review rubric and review aforementioned DESE pathways, which is figure four.

1128
03:39:33,113 --> 03:39:34,975
and in addition to figure three.

1129
03:39:35,556 --> 03:39:40,300
December 2021, call for parents and community stakeholders to participate.

1130
03:39:40,941 --> 03:39:44,505
Winter 2022, parents selected from the applicants.

1131
03:39:44,945 --> 03:39:50,971
Spring 2022, select up to three programs using the established analysis rubric to pilot.

1132
03:39:51,892 --> 03:39:54,714
FY23, pilot and evaluate efficacy.

1133
03:39:55,415 --> 03:40:02,517
of the programs and April 2023 recommend programs for adoption.

1134
03:40:03,817 --> 03:40:14,600
So with that, let me bring up the email so that I'm happy to, so that I can cover that.

1135
03:40:15,501 --> 03:40:16,181
So Ms.

1136
03:40:16,441 --> 03:40:23,723
Ciccolo's question three is if the advanced pathways is chosen that begins in ninth grade,

1137
03:40:24,363 --> 03:40:25,224
figure four.

1138
03:40:26,945 --> 03:40:29,586
Let me pull that up.

1139
03:40:29,947 --> 03:40:35,750
Dr. Cushing, do I have screen sharing?

1140
03:40:35,770 --> 03:40:36,330
Yes, I do.

1141
03:40:41,654 --> 03:40:42,034
Fiza?

1142
03:40:42,734 --> 03:40:44,816
Yes, Paulette?

1143
03:40:44,836 --> 03:40:44,996
Ms.

1144
03:40:45,016 --> 03:40:53,301
Khan, will you be able to post your entire presentation perhaps on the school website so that people can see it?

1145
03:40:54,067 --> 03:40:55,207
Yes, I surely can.

1146
03:40:55,287 --> 03:40:56,648
Okay, that would be great.

1147
03:40:57,188 --> 03:40:59,169
Absolutely, I'll do that.

1148
03:40:59,789 --> 03:41:11,113
So actually, this is where I will start and I will share the report with you and we'll be able to see the figures.

1149
03:41:18,143 --> 03:41:22,745
So this is the electronic version of the report.

1150
03:41:23,205 --> 03:41:27,187
And this figure is right out of the DESI frameworks.

1151
03:41:27,848 --> 03:41:32,350
As you can see, the acceleration decision point is at the end of sixth grade.

1152
03:41:34,671 --> 03:41:39,353
But the way we have restructured is now in line with this figure, too.

1153
03:41:40,434 --> 03:41:46,556
We will be taking part of eighth grade standards and compressing them with our seventh grade.

1154
03:41:49,572 --> 03:41:53,016
you know, the rest of the part of it will go with the algebra one.

1155
03:41:53,036 --> 03:41:55,298
This is the accelerated path.

1156
03:41:58,602 --> 03:42:00,664
And that was figure two.

1157
03:42:00,825 --> 03:42:07,152
I'm going to scroll down so that we can also see the acceleration at the high school level, if possible.

1158
03:42:12,953 --> 03:42:25,602
So figure three and figure four, as you can see now, is basically acceleration at our high school level.

1159
03:42:25,642 --> 03:42:33,808
So students, for some reason, if they are not ready to take the accelerated path in middle school,

1160
03:42:34,388 --> 03:42:37,350
they do get a chance at the high school.

1161
03:42:37,430 --> 03:42:42,854
Currently, we are going about it using figure three.

1162
03:42:43,754 --> 03:42:49,298
And just one point to note is that the new frameworks that came out in 2017

1163
03:42:51,399 --> 03:42:54,660
These recommendations came with the 2017 frameworks.

1164
03:42:55,701 --> 03:43:08,425
The previous way that we were accelerating in middle school by teaching two years worth of standards in one were a better fit for the 2011 frameworks, which were not that deep.

1165
03:43:08,725 --> 03:43:16,208
Once they were revised, the new recommendation was to split the eighth grade into seventh grade and algebra one.

1166
03:43:17,188 --> 03:43:18,830
And now this is the high school level.

1167
03:43:20,131 --> 03:43:32,742
The way we are currently doing it at MHS, MVTHS is by taking, by making sure students have solid foundations by taking Algebra 1.

1168
03:43:33,302 --> 03:43:40,068
And then we are doubling up in the sophomore years when we are having Geometry and Algebra 2

1169
03:43:41,209 --> 03:43:42,410
as to math courses.

1170
03:43:42,450 --> 03:43:53,778
This is the recommended pathway, just because we need, you know, in-depth knowledge of Algebra 1 in order to do Geometry and Algebra 2.

1171
03:43:54,238 --> 03:43:58,962
Geometry, as was taught in 2011 frameworks, was mostly numbers.

1172
03:43:59,542 --> 03:43:59,782
Now,

1173
03:44:01,383 --> 03:44:05,246
In the new frameworks, it has algebra embedded in it.

1174
03:44:05,346 --> 03:44:14,574
So it's very important that the students get a solid foundation of algebra one, and then they can apply it in geometry and algebra two.

1175
03:44:14,894 --> 03:44:18,157
Then we can see that they go to pre-calculus and to calculus.

1176
03:44:18,317 --> 03:44:19,558
I'm still on figure three.

1177
03:44:21,734 --> 03:44:25,717
Figure four is the enhanced pathway in high school.

1178
03:44:26,417 --> 03:44:31,481
So this is another way that our students can get to calculus.

1179
03:44:31,961 --> 03:44:36,444
And as we can see, there is no acceleration happening in middle school.

1180
03:44:36,904 --> 03:44:43,669
However, the courses are Enhanced Algebra I, Enhanced Geometry and Enhanced Algebra II.

1181
03:44:44,389 --> 03:44:48,973
So to answer the question of pre-calculus, this is the way to go.

1182
03:44:49,294 --> 03:44:52,417
There will be no pre-calculus as a standalone course.

1183
03:44:54,058 --> 03:45:06,089
The standards from it will be basically spread through Algebra 1 geometry and a lot of it in Algebra 2 so that students can reach calculus.

1184
03:45:06,149 --> 03:45:10,593
So our Equitable Math Pathways Committee will definitely explore this option.

1185
03:45:11,413 --> 03:45:37,804
um because um all of our students um um sometimes it's it's it's difficult to uh study math in a very structured algebra one geometry algebra two way um a lot of another name for this enhanced algebra one enhanced geometry and enhanced algebra two is integrated algebra one integrated geometry and integrated algebra two so um

1186
03:45:38,764 --> 03:45:41,006
We don't have that option right now.

1187
03:45:41,646 --> 03:45:45,069
We would love to explore it and implement it if possible.

1188
03:45:45,129 --> 03:46:06,644
So this will be one of the parts that our six through 12 committee will explore and see where we land with this, if it's feasible and what part of our student community will be interested in that particular pathway.

1189
03:46:08,406 --> 03:46:11,268
And let me see if there are any other questions.

1190
03:46:13,129 --> 03:46:21,295
So the last question is, I hope I'm not skipping any question, but if I do, please feel free to ask that.

1191
03:46:21,456 --> 03:46:30,642
But the last question is, this is very focused on the advanced students, but what are we doing to close the achievement gap, especially from the events of the last year?

1192
03:46:31,583 --> 03:46:39,990
How can we close the gap without relying heavily on summer school, excessive after-school tutoring, excessive homework, or keeping students back?

1193
03:46:41,928 --> 03:46:52,857
This is a very important question, and I believe something that will really shape our teaching and learning next year.

1194
03:46:53,958 --> 03:47:03,685
We know that a lot of this school year was gone with our students learning remotely, and it really took a long time

1195
03:47:04,586 --> 03:47:07,508
social and emotional toll on them.

1196
03:47:09,089 --> 03:47:20,936
I would prefer that students do not rely heavily on, that we don't rely heavily on summer school, excessive after school tutoring, excessive homework, or keeping students back.

1197
03:47:22,336 --> 03:47:26,478
just because none of them is actually fair to them.

1198
03:47:27,718 --> 03:47:34,801
And it's very important that we keep equity at it and also the social and emotional health of our students.

1199
03:47:34,841 --> 03:47:39,783
So we will explore and we are in the middle of exploring.

1200
03:47:39,803 --> 03:47:45,225
I am constantly listening to what NCTM is suggesting.

1201
03:47:46,566 --> 03:47:49,947
One of the suggestions has been as it was from last year,

1202
03:47:50,547 --> 03:48:08,341
that we do not spend excessive time on reviewing at the beginning of the year, that gaps be filled as we find out through our quick formative assessments and just do a one-day review on a particular topic.

1203
03:48:08,381 --> 03:48:12,143
But then again, this is something that we are still exploring.

1204
03:48:12,844 --> 03:48:14,065
But it's good to know.

1205
03:48:14,165 --> 03:48:16,747
It's in the back of our mind, I think,

1206
03:48:17,406 --> 03:48:23,258
all the entire educator community is right now concentrating on this particular question.

1207
03:48:27,414 --> 03:48:47,925
So if I don't have an exact answer, but we are working on finding ways so that our students' mental health is not compromised and that we give them enough time to be outdoors whenever we return to normalcy.

1208
03:48:48,785 --> 03:48:53,628
We'll keep exploring, we'll keep looking, and we'll keep working with our students.

1209
03:48:58,183 --> 03:48:59,404
So any questions?

1210
03:49:10,728 --> 03:49:11,048
Hello?

1211
03:49:12,329 --> 03:49:13,649
Mayor Paul has his hand up.

1212
03:49:14,770 --> 03:49:16,170
Oh, sorry, I couldn't see him.

1213
03:49:16,751 --> 03:49:17,451
Member Rousseau.

1214
03:49:18,271 --> 03:49:18,811
Thank you.

1215
03:49:18,871 --> 03:49:21,272
Thank you for the presentation, as always.

1216
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:25,821
an awful lot of questions that I had.

1217
03:49:27,041 --> 03:49:29,542
But of course, the presentation can't be three hours long.

1218
03:49:29,602 --> 03:49:33,944
So I did find some questions I still have.

1219
03:49:34,044 --> 03:49:44,748
When the rules, policy and equity subcommittee met two, three weeks ago, there was a brief conversation about who is in our

1220
03:49:45,798 --> 03:49:50,339
honors and AP math and other courses as well.

1221
03:49:51,860 --> 03:50:09,265
And I was just wondering about, you know, the accelerated math and whether or not, so there's this whole concept of tracking, which all the educators here know very well, and it's also not,

1222
03:50:10,855 --> 03:50:18,721
you know, for as positive as it can be, it is not a very good, it's not a force for equity for sure.

1223
03:50:20,143 --> 03:50:30,691
And I'm just wondering if the accelerated math course is really a, just a tracking with a different name.

1224
03:50:35,415 --> 03:50:36,176
That's one question.

1225
03:50:36,976 --> 03:50:37,616
Okay, great.

1226
03:50:37,817 --> 03:50:38,937
Thank you, Mr. Russo.

1227
03:50:39,578 --> 03:50:48,042
So one thing we must admit is that it definitely serves a certain population.

1228
03:50:49,283 --> 03:51:03,231
Now, it's important to review the process and it's important to have proper structures in place so that that helps us place the right students in

1229
03:51:04,712 --> 03:51:08,316
the particular class and the accelerated class.

1230
03:51:09,177 --> 03:51:27,275
We also have in the past, and I believe we should continue to honor parents wishes who know their student the best and mentioned that they would like their students to be in the accelerated

1231
03:51:29,435 --> 03:51:30,036
pathway.

1232
03:51:31,516 --> 03:51:37,797
We always have honored them, even though we have given our advice and we have given our recommendation.

1233
03:51:38,298 --> 03:51:43,559
So the accelerated pathway is not for everybody.

1234
03:51:44,439 --> 03:51:45,759
Desi has mentioned that.

1235
03:51:46,039 --> 03:51:48,520
I have seen that from my own personal experience.

1236
03:51:49,520 --> 03:51:53,641
So I cannot say that all students will be able to do it.

1237
03:51:53,881 --> 03:51:57,042
I was not able to do it when I was their age in middle school.

1238
03:51:57,102 --> 03:51:57,222
So

1239
03:51:58,062 --> 03:52:14,937
And I believe that sometimes it plays with students' confidence if we place them in an incorrect class, whether it's a student who needed to be in the accelerated pathway and we just put them in a standard class.

1240
03:52:15,037 --> 03:52:22,924
And if it was a student who should be in standard class, they want to take their time maturing and learning mathematics.

1241
03:52:23,004 --> 03:52:25,326
And here we have put them in accelerated pathway.

1242
03:52:25,826 --> 03:52:33,369
So we will continue to advise and suggest and recommend to the best of our ability using the data points that we have.

1243
03:52:34,470 --> 03:52:52,257
We do ask parents, we always will honor their wishes, but I believe that there needs to be a level of trust where parents take the recommendations of the teachers and really

1244
03:52:52,857 --> 03:53:00,620
I would say sometimes that if they give their students the due time, the students will get to calculus if that is the case.

1245
03:53:02,101 --> 03:53:14,266
We also know that whenever there's a lot that's being taught in the accelerated pathway, even with this modification, there will be a lot being taught.

1246
03:53:14,946 --> 03:53:16,627
A year and a half worth of,

1247
03:53:17,728 --> 03:53:23,875
Standards in mathematics is is no easy feat for the educator and for the students.

1248
03:53:24,456 --> 03:53:32,006
So we need to be very careful with that decision as educators, teachers will be careful as

1249
03:53:33,828 --> 03:53:53,824
as somebody who finally gives an okay or advises, I need to be looking at all data points in and especially for this coming year and I believe parents just need to be very sure that that's what students want as well and that it's not them

1250
03:53:55,885 --> 03:54:00,250
you know, making a decision for the student without knowing their student very well.

1251
03:54:00,430 --> 03:54:03,154
I hope that answers the question, Mr. Russo.

1252
03:54:03,314 --> 03:54:05,196
And if not, I can go in more depth.

1253
03:54:06,057 --> 03:54:06,498
It does.

1254
03:54:06,998 --> 03:54:12,685
It leads me to my second question, which I think will be my last question, because you've answered so many of my other ones already.

1255
03:54:14,731 --> 03:54:32,205
So, um, you know, I believe this committee has asked, and I don't lose track of which year was and whether it was even Dr Edward Vincent for demographics on students that are in accelerated math.

1256
03:54:32,995 --> 03:54:58,876
and as well as honors and AP courses across the district, the students, you know, when we, at that subcommittee meeting a few weeks ago, the students, and these are students that are there now, we're not talking about people who remember when they went to Medford High, we're talking about people who are literally still there, are very clear that the demographics, if you go to these courses, you do not see what you think of when you think of Medford.

1257
03:55:00,337 --> 03:55:00,497
And,

1258
03:55:02,095 --> 03:55:13,481
I listening to your you know the the advice that is given about whether students are appropriate for the particular course or not, I certainly think that's important.

1259
03:55:14,822 --> 03:55:22,126
You know, but I also recognize that there's a human quality to that that I mean the evidence is quite clear when.

1260
03:55:24,995 --> 03:55:26,496
And, you know, it's not about intent.

1261
03:55:27,196 --> 03:55:31,697
So I never want anybody to think that, but teachers are people too.

1262
03:55:32,237 --> 03:55:51,623
And, you know, the exact same set of characteristics presented in two different students, whether it's, you know, whether it's race or, you know, socioeconomics or disability or a number of other factors, the same,

1263
03:55:52,776 --> 03:56:07,524
qualifying characteristics of a student for accelerated coursework doesn't end up with the same results when people of good intent look at them and decide which ones should be moved up.

1264
03:56:09,285 --> 03:56:14,708
And, you know, I know that I talked about, you know, this issue around girls in math, which is obviously a very

1265
03:56:15,842 --> 03:56:19,144
specific and very important issue and I know important to you as well.

1266
03:56:20,165 --> 03:56:40,637
But I do, I just want to know that there's an active open conversation going on about how you are selecting students or recommending students for accelerated coursework and trying to purposefully work against the realities of being a human.

1267
03:56:42,318 --> 03:56:42,418
And

1268
03:56:44,889 --> 03:56:50,654
And I just want to hear you say that you are, or that you think there's more work to do there.

1269
03:56:51,375 --> 03:56:56,579
Yes, there is no doubt about it, that there is much work to be done there.

1270
03:56:57,660 --> 03:57:02,724
Because I'm very well aware of the fact that we all have

1271
03:57:03,852 --> 03:57:10,133
our own biases and that's a big factor in the decisions that we make.

1272
03:57:11,993 --> 03:57:31,197
The first step I would say is that all of us, the educators in the committee and educators in general, is that we really reflect upon our biases and we look at the structures in place.

1273
03:57:32,677 --> 03:57:35,098
And it's no, again, it's no easy task.

1274
03:57:35,398 --> 03:57:42,819
I am hoping that with this committee, that will be the overarching umbrella.

1275
03:57:42,939 --> 03:57:50,601
And that's why we wanted to be sure that the name reflects the mission is equitable.

1276
03:57:50,961 --> 03:57:54,462
We would like it to be as equitable as possible.

1277
03:57:54,922 --> 03:57:58,803
We will review what we can do in the best of our capability.

1278
03:57:59,563 --> 03:58:09,311
Um, and, um, and, and we have been having these conversations, um, you know, Dr. Vincent and I, and, and Dr. Kuching and, and Ms.

1279
03:58:09,331 --> 03:58:09,811
Gallucci.

1280
03:58:10,472 --> 03:58:16,076
Um, we, we would like to do our level best, but you know, it's a work in progress.

1281
03:58:16,397 --> 03:58:23,562
Um, I just want the, the members of the committee to know that I'm very well aware of, of these.

1282
03:58:24,783 --> 03:58:34,391
I was trained in Boston public schools, and that was a very tough thing for me to come to reality that even I can have biases, but I did.

1283
03:58:34,551 --> 03:58:44,019
So I believe that the first step in the right direction is that the committee members review what is in the back of our mind.

1284
03:58:44,039 --> 03:58:45,200
Is that what we

1285
03:58:52,105 --> 03:58:53,947
we would want to pass along?

1286
03:58:54,147 --> 03:58:55,908
Are we serving our community well?

1287
03:58:56,028 --> 03:58:58,310
Are we serving all of our students well?

1288
03:58:58,390 --> 03:59:02,513
So, you know, sometimes it's actually many times it's unconscious.

1289
03:59:02,713 --> 03:59:15,923
We are not aware of it, but I think the reflective practitioner piece will be very helpful in this particular regard, as it is in all regards, but all the more, this is where the work needs to be done in middle school and high school.

1290
03:59:16,764 --> 03:59:17,004
Thank you.

1291
03:59:17,344 --> 03:59:17,605
Mayor.

1292
03:59:20,328 --> 03:59:21,049
Member van der Kolk?

1293
03:59:21,409 --> 03:59:24,291
Yes, I wanted to, we received another letter.

1294
03:59:24,311 --> 03:59:25,232
Yes.

1295
03:59:25,272 --> 03:59:31,496
It says, dear members of the school committee and Mayor Lungo Kern, I am watching the school committee meeting on the public access station.

1296
03:59:32,317 --> 03:59:33,938
I am watching the math presentation.

1297
03:59:34,018 --> 03:59:40,462
The question that has not been answered is what about this year's seventh grade students who were not given the option to accelerate?

1298
03:59:40,903 --> 03:59:48,228
I thought they would be given the option in eighth grade, but based on this presentation, it does not sound as though any option is being offered that will address them.

1299
03:59:48,641 --> 03:59:50,983
I would appreciate if someone would ask this question.

1300
03:59:51,243 --> 03:59:56,986
Sincerely, Juliet Gainsborough, parent of a seventh grader and a 10th grader, 115 Alston Street.

1301
03:59:58,928 --> 03:59:59,468
Thank you.

1302
04:00:00,048 --> 04:00:20,913
So the seventh graders this year, and I apologize, it's not in the presentation, but the seventh graders that were not given an opportunity last year at the end of sixth grade will be given an opportunity to choose the Algebra I option at the end of this year, which is in June.

1303
04:00:20,953 --> 04:00:22,894
So I hope that answers that question.

1304
04:00:23,854 --> 04:00:24,214
Thank you.

1305
04:00:24,714 --> 04:00:24,994
No problem.

1306
04:00:28,560 --> 04:00:36,824
The letters will be going home, letting the parents know of the sixth graders and of the seventh graders.

1307
04:00:37,784 --> 04:00:44,767
We will be having placement tests at both levels, and we'll make our recommendations based on many factors.

1308
04:00:44,847 --> 04:00:46,768
Placement test is just one of them.

1309
04:00:54,491 --> 04:00:56,672
Thank you so much for the presentation, Ms.

1310
04:00:56,692 --> 04:00:56,912
Khan.

1311
04:00:59,280 --> 04:01:02,021
Number four, we have before and after school programming.

1312
04:01:02,901 --> 04:01:03,161
Ms.

1313
04:01:03,441 --> 04:01:07,782
Megan Fidler-Carey, Dr. Edward Vincent, and Mr. Murphy.

1314
04:01:08,662 --> 04:01:16,224
Mayor, I received a letter which specifically asked me to read it at the outset, if I could, on this topic.

1315
04:01:18,265 --> 04:01:18,665
Please do.

1316
04:01:18,725 --> 04:01:19,005
Thank you.

1317
04:01:19,958 --> 04:01:35,665
Dear school committee members, I, Teresa Fernald from 13 Whittier Road, Medford, am submitting this request and a question on behalf of almost 40 families who have joined together in support of the expansion and further development of accessible, equitable, and inclusive afterschool care in Medford, Mass.

1318
04:01:36,425 --> 04:01:47,830
We request that I be granted five minutes instead of three during the afterschool topic, agenda 9.4, and that the below questions be read aloud during the meeting prior to our five minutes for this agenda item.

1319
04:01:48,763 --> 04:01:52,064
Medford parents for better after and before school care.

1320
04:01:52,744 --> 04:02:01,405
We have built a network of approximately 40 families who are ready, willing, and eager to be part of identifying and executing solutions related to the afterschool crisis in Medford.

1321
04:02:02,085 --> 04:02:13,847
To build the MPS school committee mission round tables to build off of, I'm sorry, held April 5 and 6, we know the current mission statement is changing and we support this change.

1322
04:02:14,247 --> 04:02:17,008
However, we would like to ask the following as it relates to the mission,

1323
04:02:17,526 --> 04:02:20,829
calling for MPS to be a partnership of school, family, and community.

1324
04:02:21,750 --> 04:02:28,075
What is the best way for parents to get involved in brainstorming and execution of solutions for the city's afterschool crisis?

1325
04:02:28,816 --> 04:02:40,086
Beyond attending a school committee meeting, how do we start a conversation towards solving the afterschool crisis that builds toward a true partnership between parents, school, and city leadership, in addition to the larger community?

1326
04:02:42,148 --> 04:02:45,572
Thank you, Parents Working for a Better MPS Committee.

1327
04:02:46,272 --> 04:03:00,466
And there's Andrea Quinn and Emily Parada, Christina Roberts, Dallas Scott and Haskell Kent, Daniel Blackwell, Deirdre Hausler, Emily Jameson and Dennis Anderson, Nicole Dillon, Teresa Pernald and Vanessa Forsner.

1328
04:03:01,607 --> 04:03:01,947
Thank you.

1329
04:03:04,109 --> 04:03:05,070
Thank you, Member Van de Kloot.

1330
04:03:08,102 --> 04:03:10,568
Dr. Edward Vincent, Mr. Murphy, and Ms.

1331
04:03:10,689 --> 04:03:11,832
Megan Fidler Carey.

1332
04:03:14,081 --> 04:03:42,450
I want to just say, as this presentation takes place, I just want to thank everyone who worked on it, contributing, and we hope that many of the questions that were being asked and questions that were shared during last week's roundtable sessions, that the community will see that Medford Public Schools is making a specific

1333
04:03:44,050 --> 04:03:52,475
and a specific targeted approach to looking at our before and after school programming.

1334
04:03:52,695 --> 04:04:07,842
I thank Megan Fidler Carey, who's our director of that program, for being with us tonight, and Mr. Dave Murphy, who will be guiding us through a very comprehensive slide deck.

1335
04:04:08,122 --> 04:04:08,482
Thank you.

1336
04:04:10,203 --> 04:04:11,624
Thank you, Dr. Robinson.

1337
04:04:12,952 --> 04:04:18,716
I'm going to share a presentation now that Ms.

1338
04:04:18,756 --> 04:04:22,037
Fidler, Carrie, and I will be walking through.

1339
04:04:22,058 --> 04:04:26,220
We're doing so on behalf of Ms.

1340
04:04:26,260 --> 04:04:32,564
Galussi, who I'm sure is defying both the superintendent's and director's orders by watching tonight's meeting.

1341
04:04:33,404 --> 04:04:40,028
But obviously, her leadership and oversight of the program is critically important, and we're happy to

1342
04:04:40,680 --> 04:04:43,162
to be speaking on her behalf as well.

1343
04:04:43,663 --> 04:04:53,632
So in tonight's presentation, there will essentially be three parts of what we'll be discussing and answering questions about.

1344
04:04:54,313 --> 04:05:05,283
The first is an annual consideration that the district has to take up each year with regard to the establishment of tuition fees.

1345
04:05:05,995 --> 04:05:23,406
The before and after school program is intended to be a self-sustaining program, meaning the fees that are assessed and the revenue that is generated is then put into a revolving account that supports the delivery of the service that the district offers.

1346
04:05:24,387 --> 04:05:31,871
The second piece, as the superintendent alluded to, is in response to some of the concerns and concerns

1347
04:05:33,864 --> 04:05:38,247
questions that have been raised in recent weeks related to the structure of the program.

1348
04:05:38,867 --> 04:05:52,817
And we'll be informing the committee and the community of our intention to expand the seats in the program, but also talking about some of the logistical and financial implications of that.

1349
04:05:53,757 --> 04:06:00,922
And then finally, the third piece that we'll talk a little bit about are the additional considerations that

1350
04:06:01,379 --> 04:06:25,312
reflected perhaps of the offer that was made in the public comment immediately preceding this presentation, that the community and the school committee will need to take up, we would recommend taking up in the coming months and potentially beyond that, because there are some significant strategic and structural decisions that have been made related to the decision to offer this service.

1351
04:06:25,712 --> 04:06:30,275
They are not necessarily the decisions that other communities have made

1352
04:06:30,869 --> 04:06:44,794
And ultimately, I do think it is the school committee that has to render a decision as to if to invest and if so, how to invest in providing particularly afterschool care.

1353
04:06:44,814 --> 04:06:46,475
And we'll talk a little bit about the distinction.

1354
04:06:46,495 --> 04:06:50,997
This is the department that Megan leads is before and afterschool care.

1355
04:06:51,777 --> 04:06:54,438
And those two services are obviously related to each other.

1356
04:06:55,178 --> 04:07:00,160
We'll be providing background and context on the overall before and afterschool program,

1357
04:07:00,698 --> 04:07:11,686
But the recommendations, and we'll get to this in a moment, with regard to some changes, are specific to the after-school component.

1358
04:07:11,726 --> 04:07:13,667
There are a few reasons for that.

1359
04:07:14,088 --> 04:07:21,993
Some of them are related to coming out of the pandemic and this being a year which we're not doing before-school programming, we haven't to date.

1360
04:07:22,113 --> 04:07:25,816
And then some of them have absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic.

1361
04:07:27,278 --> 04:07:30,640
There's just, there's a different set of implications for those two aspects.

1362
04:07:30,660 --> 04:07:44,508
So I'm going to turn it over to Megan now to talk a little bit about the context and the background of the of the programming that she is facilitating, and her staff is facilitating.

1363
04:07:44,528 --> 04:07:54,994
And I will say that, as is the case with almost everything we present to the school committee, you are hearing from members of the leadership team and the managers who are responsible for it.

1364
04:07:55,795 --> 04:07:55,935
But

1365
04:07:56,846 --> 04:07:59,328
And again, this is really true for every single thing we talked about here.

1366
04:07:59,768 --> 04:08:19,003
There are dozens and sometimes hundreds of people who actually do this work and they work extremely hard and they are responsible for making sure that the district as an organization is able to provide the service and the services that we do to the community.

1367
04:08:19,063 --> 04:08:24,127
And so while oftentimes before the governing body, we're talking about the sort of big picture and the vision,

1368
04:08:24,594 --> 04:08:26,814
this strategy, what we can do to improve.

1369
04:08:27,455 --> 04:08:48,419
I don't want to lose sight of the fact that there are staff in the dozens that make sure that the children of Medford whose families are using the service have a safe place to go and are able to receive care on a daily basis.

1370
04:08:48,499 --> 04:08:50,799
And so we certainly extend our gratitude to them.

1371
04:08:51,189 --> 04:09:06,719
So again, because I don't think we should dive into a conversation about some potential changes before talking about where the program is right now, even though I know many people watching this may already be familiar with this, we wanna provide some background and context to the department.

1372
04:09:06,759 --> 04:09:07,759
So Ms.

1373
04:09:07,799 --> 04:09:18,646
Fidley-Curry, do you wanna take it from there and you can let me know when you're ready to advance the slides and then I'll come back and talk a little bit about some of the changes that we are recommending and or planning to take.

1374
04:09:20,231 --> 04:09:21,352
Sure, thanks Dave.

1375
04:09:22,212 --> 04:09:26,555
And thank you so much for mentioning the importance of the staff and honoring them.

1376
04:09:26,575 --> 04:09:33,619
I know some of our afterschool staff are on this call right now, which I was really excited, but not surprised to see because that's how dedicated they are.

1377
04:09:35,320 --> 04:09:39,403
They are very, very much working hard to make this program as excellent as it is.

1378
04:09:39,603 --> 04:09:46,807
So I'm actually, and this is what I always do in interviews when I meet with people, I'm actually gonna say as much as I can about what are on these slides,

1379
04:09:47,240 --> 04:09:54,704
Assuming that not everybody knows that much about the program, that way I don't leave anything out that I think is important that I wanna make sure everybody knows.

1380
04:09:54,764 --> 04:09:59,747
And I know that certainly there are some new to the district families on this Zoom.

1381
04:09:59,847 --> 04:10:03,089
So it bears going through the history of it.

1382
04:10:04,130 --> 04:10:11,854
So we provide afterschool care from dismissal until six o'clock, five days a week at all four of the elementary schools.

1383
04:10:12,945 --> 04:10:24,714
The before school programming, as many of you know, was suspended this year because we just couldn't guarantee the safety and cleaning protocols that we needed to feel comfortable and to keep everybody safe.

1384
04:10:25,374 --> 04:10:27,476
But we are planning to run it next year.

1385
04:10:27,596 --> 04:10:28,316
So that's good.

1386
04:10:28,417 --> 04:10:30,898
We've got it in motion.

1387
04:10:30,998 --> 04:10:35,322
We're making sure that staff are coming back and staffing up for that.

1388
04:10:36,803 --> 04:10:39,985
Before school programming and after school program have increased.

1389
04:10:40,545 --> 04:10:51,972
over the last several years, we, by hook or by crook, steadily figure out how to chip away at any wait lists and meet demand as we can safely in the program.

1390
04:10:52,072 --> 04:10:57,635
So we're glad to have been able to see an increase in both of those programs over the last several years.

1391
04:11:01,515 --> 04:11:11,379
Forgive me for those of you who've heard this a million times, but for those who haven't, I am part of a group of people called the Network of Extended Day Directors.

1392
04:11:11,559 --> 04:11:16,641
So those are other people in my same position that have district run afterschool programs in Massachusetts.

1393
04:11:17,101 --> 04:11:29,166
And we, not this year, but typically we meet monthly to go over best practices, shared challenges, to bounce ideas off of each other, to figure out, you know, what, how to,

1394
04:11:30,075 --> 04:11:32,516
if anybody's come up with great ideas for problem solving.

1395
04:11:32,756 --> 04:11:42,300
And it's a fantastic and phenomenal resource for me and for each other to find out, you know, who else is running into any problems.

1396
04:11:42,720 --> 04:11:49,683
So based on their best practices, that's where we determine a lot of our kind of things that we take for granted now.

1397
04:11:49,723 --> 04:11:52,604
But for example, that last bullet on there is the ratio.

1398
04:11:52,644 --> 04:11:58,346
We keep a 10 to one ratio, 10 students to one staff member for all of our sites.

1399
04:11:59,436 --> 04:12:01,697
Okay, Debbie did go the next slide.

1400
04:12:03,899 --> 04:12:18,627
All right, we strive for accessibility, number one, we wanna make sure that as many families as need this have access to this and access come in, meaning know about it, know it exists, can afford it and can get to it.

1401
04:12:18,827 --> 04:12:24,651
And I know that that's challenging for some, so,

1402
04:12:27,125 --> 04:12:31,007
So we've kept the rates in line with what other districts are doing.

1403
04:12:31,067 --> 04:12:39,312
We tried to keep it really accessible, thinking about affordability and looking at other programs around Medford and across the state too.

1404
04:12:39,692 --> 04:12:46,376
So currently that looks like what you see on the screen, we for ease in economics and

1405
04:12:47,229 --> 04:12:53,113
accounting, we keep it to 10 monthly payments, 10 of the same monthly payments.

1406
04:12:53,253 --> 04:13:01,278
So we pick figure out a day rate and multiply that by 180, which is how many school days there are, and then divide that number into 10 equal payments.

1407
04:13:01,678 --> 04:13:04,700
That's easier for accounting on both, both ledgers.

1408
04:13:05,581 --> 04:13:09,063
So you'll notice that the before school programming is 140 a month for five days,

1409
04:13:11,385 --> 04:13:18,408
and the afterschool programming is 432.50 a month for five days a week, which averages out to about $24 a day.

1410
04:13:18,428 --> 04:13:40,039
When we've spoken to other districts, which I do frequently, both through NEDS and closer to Medford districts that maybe aren't in NEDS, some of the things that we find out about how they address challenges are they have caps where they just, they don't grow, or some of them have said that this,

1411
04:13:40,660 --> 04:13:44,581
Programming is a lot of work and so that they outsource it.

1412
04:13:44,821 --> 04:13:46,541
So it's not a district run program.

1413
04:13:47,742 --> 04:13:50,602
I believe district run is better for students.

1414
04:13:50,702 --> 04:13:51,822
It's better for staff.

1415
04:13:52,603 --> 04:13:57,024
There's continuity of information from the school day to the afterschool.

1416
04:13:57,904 --> 04:14:07,966
As Medford Public Schools staff members, the afterschool staff and I have, we can be in the building as staff members.

1417
04:14:08,445 --> 04:14:30,714
and speak to the nurses and speak to the daytime teachers and find out kind of what's the pulse of the day, you know, are there students and did something happen during the day that we should know about in the afterschool that we can carry into it, that a private provider coming in and just kind of operating on the premises wouldn't be able to ask those questions because of confidentiality rules.

1418
04:14:30,794 --> 04:14:33,435
So I think that it's better for students in that way.

1419
04:14:37,920 --> 04:14:39,062
Hold on, I'm reading this last.

1420
04:14:39,102 --> 04:14:40,383
I don't want to leave any bullets out.

1421
04:14:41,405 --> 04:14:43,528
Oh, about the fees that are comparable, right?

1422
04:14:43,668 --> 04:14:46,512
So yeah, so we'll go into the next one.

1423
04:14:49,609 --> 04:14:56,773
So the organizational structure of the program is the assistant superintendent for elementary education, Suzanne Galussi, oversees all of these.

1424
04:14:56,934 --> 04:14:58,074
This is under her purview.

1425
04:14:58,494 --> 04:15:01,176
And then I manage the before and after school programs.

1426
04:15:01,216 --> 04:15:05,018
But then at each site, there's what's called a superintendent, I mean, a site coordinator.

1427
04:15:05,378 --> 04:15:08,740
And I like to pitch that as the principal of that after school program.

1428
04:15:09,061 --> 04:15:16,365
They're the person that is looking over all of the logistics, logistics to making sure that the staff knows where everything is and what they need.

1429
04:15:16,806 --> 04:15:19,932
I'm checking in with parents, making sure all the attendance is organized.

1430
04:15:20,753 --> 04:15:23,438
And so I'm sort of there to support them and oversee.

1431
04:15:23,955 --> 04:15:28,196
the sort of vision of policy and make sure they have everything they need.

1432
04:15:28,617 --> 04:15:34,118
And then the next in line at the Brooks, our biggest program, we have what's called a senior group leader.

1433
04:15:34,519 --> 04:15:48,563
And we realized we needed that because we had so many staff at that program that we needed somebody to train up our brand new staff, because we were having to get new people on board so fast that the site coordinator couldn't do it all by herself.

1434
04:15:48,623 --> 04:15:52,745
So we have this senior group leader who helps to mentor and train up staff.

1435
04:15:53,245 --> 04:15:55,167
And then the group leaders are sort of like teachers.

1436
04:15:55,267 --> 04:15:56,668
They come up with the activities.

1437
04:15:57,328 --> 04:16:04,093
The after school day is divided into four parts, homework, snack, physical activity time, and enrichment time.

1438
04:16:04,574 --> 04:16:06,935
And the group leader comes up with that enrichment time.

1439
04:16:07,256 --> 04:16:16,262
So getting to know the students in front of them, they decide what their interests are, their personal interests are, and how they can translate that to helping out with the kids.

1440
04:16:16,923 --> 04:16:21,666
And then we have assistant group leaders, and then also our very valuable high school aides.

1441
04:16:24,052 --> 04:16:37,740
And all of those people that I mentioned besides me and our, oh, and we have our administrative assistant who's in the office with me too, who's sort of making sure that all of the finance and all of the nuts and bolts is operating and that nothing falls apart.

1442
04:16:37,800 --> 04:16:42,943
She's there to make sure we have everything we need and that the tuition and payments are all paid.

1443
04:16:44,424 --> 04:16:47,746
All of the staff at the schools are paid through the revolving account.

1444
04:16:49,982 --> 04:16:52,443
I did have one other thing that I wanted to just quick include.

1445
04:16:53,723 --> 04:17:02,125
So this year especially, but every year in general, I think it's important to note that we don't pitch ourselves as an academic program.

1446
04:17:02,165 --> 04:17:04,686
It's not an academic after-school program.

1447
04:17:04,726 --> 04:17:07,226
When I first started out, I sort of wanted it to be.

1448
04:17:07,826 --> 04:17:10,627
I said, let's infuse academics and learning in everything we do.

1449
04:17:11,167 --> 04:17:16,070
But we realized that so many of our students just need social emotional support.

1450
04:17:16,110 --> 04:17:20,513
They need social emotional skill building and they need to kind of blow off steam.

1451
04:17:20,533 --> 04:17:22,034
They've been in school all day.

1452
04:17:22,414 --> 04:17:28,578
So besides homework and homework help and tutoring, we really don't heavily focus on academics.

1453
04:17:28,678 --> 04:17:29,058
This isn't

1454
04:17:29,420 --> 04:17:33,684
I don't pitch this to say to parents like sign up and you're going to get a better grade on the SATs.

1455
04:17:34,025 --> 04:17:43,774
It's not about that it's sign up and we're going to teach your kid how to be a better buddy and a better neighbor and you know an advocate for themselves and an upstander those sorts of things.

1456
04:17:44,115 --> 04:17:46,337
So we've really tried to focus on social emotional

1457
04:17:48,155 --> 04:17:57,739
and open circle and we're carrying in the social emotional learning and language from the school day into the afterschool program so that the kids have the consistency of those practices.

1458
04:17:58,239 --> 04:17:59,620
And that's where our focus lies.

1459
04:17:59,800 --> 04:18:01,941
And I'm really proud of the work that we've done.

1460
04:18:03,721 --> 04:18:06,803
And your team should be as well.

1461
04:18:07,223 --> 04:18:16,687
So we're going to move forward now and to focus on some of the recommendations or attempts that we have with regard to the modifications of the program.

1462
04:18:17,494 --> 04:18:24,917
hopefully also walk through the rationale behind each of those potential changes.

1463
04:18:25,397 --> 04:18:31,619
And so just to sort of finish up in terms of background and context, this is a sizable program.

1464
04:18:32,439 --> 04:18:40,602
There are hundreds of students and students across four elementary schools who receive this after school care and before school care as well.

1465
04:18:41,223 --> 04:18:42,363
The personnel costs

1466
04:18:43,474 --> 04:18:51,760
are in the vicinity of $500,000, depending on the size of the program, that has an impact on the size of the staff.

1467
04:18:52,060 --> 04:18:59,865
But as is the case with almost everything in Medford and every public school system, when you break down the budget, most of it is going to be in personnel costs.

1468
04:19:00,245 --> 04:19:06,069
There aren't a lot of, there are some supplies and we've made sure that we have the appropriate amount of play equipment.

1469
04:19:06,129 --> 04:19:07,971
And obviously we need snacks.

1470
04:19:08,091 --> 04:19:11,593
We don't want to not have snacks at the end of a long school day.

1471
04:19:12,437 --> 04:19:22,522
But the vast majority of the funding goes toward paying the staff responsible for keeping students safe and providing the type of programming that Ms.

1472
04:19:22,562 --> 04:19:24,503
Fidelicari was referencing.

1473
04:19:25,544 --> 04:19:28,305
So that's how the budget is currently broken down.

1474
04:19:29,426 --> 04:19:37,970
There is a modest grant that the program receives, and the revenue is typically in excess of a million dollars.

1475
04:19:38,010 --> 04:19:40,852
If we look back over the course of the last five years,

1476
04:19:41,208 --> 04:19:43,708
there's been some fluctuation in terms of the size of the program.

1477
04:19:44,509 --> 04:19:54,150
But we can usually, if the program is at capacity, which it has been for the last several years, and as Mr. Pillicari referenced, it has grown steadily.

1478
04:19:55,050 --> 04:20:03,772
And so we would project about 1.2 million based on, just to be clear, there's a little variability here, okay?

1479
04:20:04,032 --> 04:20:10,733
Because you have some students who will be enrolled in the program for the entire school year, and some that will not be enrolled for the entire school year.

1480
04:20:11,012 --> 04:20:21,280
You have some students who will be there received before school care three days a week, and some that will have five days a week, and some variability in terms of the total number of days students are in after school as well.

1481
04:20:21,580 --> 04:20:29,987
So in order, in terms of making this projection, this is based on what we, on average, would receive.

1482
04:20:30,067 --> 04:20:34,850
As we referenced, the current tuition is $43.25 for after school for the year.

1483
04:20:40,122 --> 04:20:43,985
that doesn't mean we generate $4,300 per student.

1484
04:20:44,085 --> 04:20:47,548
So we would usually use an average of somewhere between 33 and 3,700.

1485
04:20:47,748 --> 04:20:54,473
You factor in revenue generated by the before school program, which is much less than the after school program.

1486
04:20:54,814 --> 04:20:57,636
And this is about, it's been pretty steady.

1487
04:20:57,736 --> 04:21:01,979
It's gone up a little bit, but this is about what we would expect.

1488
04:21:02,039 --> 04:21:09,185
And the difference in terms of the 200,000 that's referenced on this slide is that would be, assuming we move forward,

1489
04:21:09,622 --> 04:21:11,842
with our intent to expand.

1490
04:21:12,282 --> 04:21:38,167
And just so there's, we're clear in terms of what the administration is presenting to you tonight and what we are intending to do, we are going to be asking the school committee to, I'm maybe a little ahead of myself, so I apologize, but we're gonna be asking the committee to, for a modest increase in the tuition in order to ensure that we have the budgetary capacity to do some of these other things.

1491
04:21:38,687 --> 04:21:41,990
And we'll get into sort of how these five challenges are connected to each other.

1492
04:21:43,050 --> 04:21:51,116
We have generally grown the program in terms of the total number of students enrolled based on our spatial capacity, frankly.

1493
04:21:51,537 --> 04:21:59,323
And so we would like to continue to expand the program to make sure we provide the service that is being requested.

1494
04:22:00,063 --> 04:22:07,629
But there are some other inherent challenges that it's clear to us we will need to make in order for us to be able to make that expansion

1495
04:22:07,925 --> 04:22:11,906
And I would also just say that in order for the program to continue to be successful, and Ms.

1496
04:22:11,926 --> 04:22:24,571
Fidelicari can expand upon that when we do questions, but hopefully we'll make clear sort of why it is we're taking the actions that we are, or asking you to take the action with regard to the tuition.

1497
04:22:24,991 --> 04:22:31,153
So the five challenges that we'll address over the next five slides are, one, we wanna make sure that we maintain affordability.

1498
04:22:31,513 --> 04:22:31,633
Ms.

1499
04:22:31,653 --> 04:22:36,115
Fidelicari spoke about the importance we place on access to this programming.

1500
04:22:37,024 --> 04:22:47,368
We have a challenge, both with regard to the operationalizing of the current program and our desire for an expansion, because of staff turnover.

1501
04:22:48,029 --> 04:22:53,811
And for that reason, we'll also be asking for a wage increase for the staff.

1502
04:22:54,311 --> 04:23:05,676
The rationale being, if we're able to stabilize the staffing, we can more responsibly expand the number of seats and ensure equitable access to Medford Public School students whose families

1503
04:23:05,972 --> 04:23:08,012
would like to avail themselves of the service.

1504
04:23:08,853 --> 04:23:11,513
There is a spatial component to this, that's number four here.

1505
04:23:11,993 --> 04:23:24,536
And we have identified a strategy that we've worked with our elementary principals and our technology department to make sure that we're prepared to identify that space and move forward as necessary.

1506
04:23:24,996 --> 04:23:35,198
And then we are also facing the challenge, and this is sort of one that's sort of hovering over this, is that there has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of revenue being generated this year because there are significantly fewer students

1507
04:23:35,608 --> 04:23:36,489
enrolled in the program.

1508
04:23:36,929 --> 04:23:42,093
Now, based on the registrations, it would appear as though our enrollment is going to be back up.

1509
04:23:42,153 --> 04:23:44,415
And that will be a good thing with regard to the revenue.

1510
04:23:44,795 --> 04:23:55,804
But there is a need to maintain a robust balance in the revolving account because of potential unanticipated staffing challenges that we might have to face.

1511
04:23:55,824 --> 04:24:00,587
And that is frankly part of making sure that we maintain equitable access to the program.

1512
04:24:01,048 --> 04:24:05,151
So with regard to the request to the school committee to raise the tuition,

1513
04:24:06,378 --> 04:24:09,760
It's my impression that this is not something the committee has voted on in the past.

1514
04:24:09,900 --> 04:24:15,903
Typically, this type of fee being assessed to members of the community would be voted on by the school committee.

1515
04:24:15,923 --> 04:24:20,245
And so we're asking you to approve our proposed increase to $25 per day.

1516
04:24:21,425 --> 04:24:28,048
This is, again, it's maintaining the approximately 3% increase that the program has seen in the past.

1517
04:24:28,088 --> 04:24:34,871
So it's not unusual or departing in any way from what the district has previously done, but we would ask that you

1518
04:24:35,318 --> 04:24:36,978
endorse that tuition increase.

1519
04:24:39,359 --> 04:24:45,020
The second piece that we're doing again is to raise the wages right now vary to some degree.

1520
04:24:45,961 --> 04:25:02,425
There are individuals in these positions and their wages, what they have in common is that they're all modest, but they range anywhere from $14 to from the assistant group leader to senior group leader who has

1521
04:25:03,118 --> 04:25:07,421
Megan said are sort of the people occupying the sort of teacher type roles.

1522
04:25:08,322 --> 04:25:18,890
Those wages range and there's different levels of responsibility and we've established proposed wage increases commensurate with those responsibilities.

1523
04:25:18,950 --> 04:25:32,321
But in order to try to stem the tide of staffing turnover, which leads to instability within the program, we are looking to increase these wages according to the table that is before you.

1524
04:25:32,948 --> 04:25:37,312
And again, this is not affecting the operating budget.

1525
04:25:37,332 --> 04:25:42,756
This is the revolving account, which is dependent upon the revenue generated from the fees.

1526
04:25:42,836 --> 04:25:50,402
So the total budgetary impact of these wage increases on an annual basis is estimated to be about $120,000 or $125,000.

1527
04:25:51,744 --> 04:25:58,129
Based on the stability of the revolving account over the years, we're confident that that's a cost that can be absorbed.

1528
04:25:58,569 --> 04:26:01,792
And these wages have been generated in part by

1529
04:26:02,315 --> 04:26:06,538
our research in terms of other districts that we've done.

1530
04:26:06,558 --> 04:26:15,123
And we think that this would put us in a position where we'd be paying a comparable wage, but a competitive one, and hopefully be able to stabilize that staffing situation.

1531
04:26:16,664 --> 04:26:18,726
The third piece is with regard to the expansion.

1532
04:26:19,446 --> 04:26:22,008
This is based on really two factors.

1533
04:26:22,888 --> 04:26:29,753
One with regard to the identification of space, which has been the previous up until this point has been sort of a limiting factor.

1534
04:26:30,373 --> 04:26:56,638
We'll talk about that in a minute, but as we've identified space that can be used, and we know that there is this demand in the community, we feel a 60-seat expansion, which will put us back over the number that was enrolled at the last time we were at full capacity, which was during the 19-20 school year, prior to the shutdown, and then a slight increase, which is consistent with

1535
04:26:57,082 --> 04:27:01,304
the trajectory of the increases over the years in terms of enrollment.

1536
04:27:01,324 --> 04:27:14,051
So we feel as though we can, this number is based on, as I said, the space that's identified, but also what we think we can, with the wage increases, expect in terms of the stabilization of staff.

1537
04:27:14,731 --> 04:27:17,252
We're looking at the number, the amount of turnover we typically have.

1538
04:27:18,173 --> 04:27:20,974
We're hopeful that based on the wage increases, that will stabilize.

1539
04:27:21,294 --> 04:27:26,557
We think we can add the probably seven to 10 staff members that would be necessary in order to

1540
04:27:27,557 --> 04:27:36,122
maintain the ratio that, as we said earlier, the industry considers to be a best practice.

1541
04:27:37,182 --> 04:27:47,928
In terms of the utilization of space, and again, this is not a surprise to our elementary principals, we have computer labs that were built into each school.

1542
04:27:48,088 --> 04:27:56,312
There are three in three of the elementary schools and two in one of the schools for reasons I'm not frankly totally sure why.

1543
04:27:57,276 --> 04:28:08,420
But we're in the process of refurbishing the tech labs that are used specific to the technology classes when the elementary school students have their technology special.

1544
04:28:08,780 --> 04:28:15,542
There are other computer labs that are referred to as the open computer labs and they're used on occasion.

1545
04:28:16,303 --> 04:28:26,066
But frankly, the technology there is increasingly in those labs is increasingly obsolete because we're moving to a one-to-one ratio with regard to Chromebooks.

1546
04:28:27,083 --> 04:28:32,145
and therefore they're not in each school terribly well utilized at the moment.

1547
04:28:32,205 --> 04:28:54,895
I'm sure each principal who is always thinking creatively is using them for something and that there's good work happening there, but this doesn't exclude the principals from using those rooms during the school day, but it is a way of avoiding having to take, utilize classes for afterschool programming that is, that are typical traditional classrooms.

1548
04:28:55,295 --> 04:28:55,935
As it says here,

1549
04:28:56,397 --> 04:29:02,080
If the program were to expand, it very well might be the case that some classrooms would be utilized.

1550
04:29:02,720 --> 04:29:12,424
And that's something that we would communicate ahead of time to teachers and make sure that we discussed with them and their representatives the impact of that potential change.

1551
04:29:12,484 --> 04:29:22,568
But right now, based on what we're intending to do in terms of the seat expansion, the use of these sort of unassigned open computer labs would be sufficient.

1552
04:29:22,608 --> 04:29:25,850
And that would put us in a position to expand by 60 seats.

1553
04:29:26,928 --> 04:29:28,929
Just to be clear, this is an important factor.

1554
04:29:29,009 --> 04:29:31,830
We can't expand the program if we don't know where the students are going to be.

1555
04:29:32,310 --> 04:29:37,931
But the use of the elementary school classrooms besides the tech labs is not a limiting factor.

1556
04:29:38,211 --> 04:29:44,293
We're not not expanding because of the classrooms that we would have to occupy through this programming.

1557
04:29:44,733 --> 04:29:49,115
It's just that we think right now the responsible expansion is by 60 seats.

1558
04:29:49,515 --> 04:29:52,196
And so we're not going to take over more classrooms than we need to.

1559
04:29:52,536 --> 04:29:56,337
And at the moment, the need would be satisfied

1560
04:29:56,983 --> 04:29:59,864
through the use of the open tech labs.

1561
04:30:01,284 --> 04:30:10,908
So again, with regard to the revenue, it is down, but we do have a healthy balance of approximately $800,000 in the revolving account that's there.

1562
04:30:12,228 --> 04:30:22,352
This coupled with the wage increase would allow us to stabilize the staffing and expand the seats.

1563
04:30:22,872 --> 04:30:25,733
But I referenced that account balance

1564
04:30:26,598 --> 04:30:33,022
with the very important caveat that the nature of this programming requires us to maintain a healthy balance.

1565
04:30:33,122 --> 04:30:36,044
And so we're not in a position to spend that down any further.

1566
04:30:36,364 --> 04:30:42,548
But again, we wouldn't recommend it anyway because we're trying to expand the program at a responsible rate and pace.

1567
04:30:44,570 --> 04:30:54,256
And so I said the third part of the presentation that we'll touch upon here are what are the considerations and the questions that the committee and the district need to

1568
04:30:54,877 --> 04:30:56,678
uh, be mindful of going forward.

1569
04:30:57,178 --> 04:31:06,562
And, um, as I, as I said, I think that I know there's been some offers made by members of the community to collaborate that over collaborate over these, these issues and questions.

1570
04:31:06,602 --> 04:31:17,486
And it's something that the administration has always, uh, uh, certainly, uh, receptive to, and we're eager to, um, work with both the committee and members of the community as we determine what the best direction forward is.

1571
04:31:18,026 --> 04:31:23,128
Um, that being said, there is a one question that this committee, I think does have to just be cognizant of.

1572
04:31:23,568 --> 04:31:29,109
because it's a question that all school committees do, is whether to continue offering this service.

1573
04:31:30,010 --> 04:31:32,670
We think there's a very significant benefit to that.

1574
04:31:33,330 --> 04:31:38,212
We think if done at a responsible rate, we can expand and offer the service.

1575
04:31:39,572 --> 04:31:42,633
But that doesn't mean that we can just expand indefinitely.

1576
04:31:43,213 --> 04:31:51,455
And I think that when we talk about sort of the concepts of a wait list and public education, that

1577
04:31:52,031 --> 04:31:55,112
That's a combination that doesn't really sit terribly well together.

1578
04:31:55,272 --> 04:32:01,533
And I think all of us who work in public education know that, that if we're offering a service, the idea is to not have to wait around for it.

1579
04:32:01,873 --> 04:32:10,294
And I think that's true whether we're talking about after-school programming or an AP class that students wanna get into, or an intramural sport that middle school students wanna play.

1580
04:32:10,654 --> 04:32:15,355
If we're offering it, access should be a critical part of it.

1581
04:32:15,775 --> 04:32:20,176
But at the same time, if we can't offer something responsibly and equitably,

1582
04:32:21,037 --> 04:32:27,439
then we have to, as an organization, I think, strategize around whether it is the right investment.

1583
04:32:28,239 --> 04:32:30,880
So you're not hearing a recommendation that we don't continue the program.

1584
04:32:31,280 --> 04:32:32,580
That's certainly not the case.

1585
04:32:33,321 --> 04:32:41,163
But I do think we have to be cognizant of the fact that it is a strategic decision that the organization through the school committee makes.

1586
04:32:41,663 --> 04:32:47,105
And then from that point, we have to administer the program in the most responsible way possible.

1587
04:32:49,022 --> 04:32:57,948
an immediate or disproportionate expansion, I don't think would satisfy that responsibility, which is why we crafted the strategy that we have.

1588
04:32:59,789 --> 04:33:00,410
I think Ms.

1589
04:33:00,430 --> 04:33:04,912
Whitley-Curry talked a little bit about sort of the evolution in her own thinking with regard to the type of programming.

1590
04:33:05,913 --> 04:33:08,035
This isn't something that we have a recommendation on tonight.

1591
04:33:08,055 --> 04:33:13,578
It's not one that I anticipate we'll be making in the next several weeks or even before the 21-22 school year.

1592
04:33:14,038 --> 04:33:17,181
But I do think that every single program and service that we offer,

1593
04:33:18,187 --> 04:33:25,929
has to take into account the significant disruption in the instructional experience to students going through this pandemic.

1594
04:33:26,089 --> 04:33:33,751
And there's some strategizing and prioritizing and conversations that should take place in that context.

1595
04:33:34,851 --> 04:33:44,434
Something that I know, or it's been told, has been discussed at the school committee level in the past is whether to implement a graduated income-based tuition system.

1596
04:33:45,501 --> 04:33:50,303
That is something, frankly, that we discussed in the formulation of these recommendations.

1597
04:33:50,763 --> 04:33:59,288
It's not something that we think we have the capacity to implement right now, which is why it's not a part of that, but there is certainly room for a conversation there.

1598
04:34:00,448 --> 04:34:15,095
And then finally, with regard to the, go back to the spatial issue, there will be some potential strategic decisions that have to be made in the future if we are to continue to expand as to whether to continue utilizing in-house space

1599
04:34:15,545 --> 04:34:22,751
or potentially partner with other organizations, which will in turn raise the costs of the program.

1600
04:34:23,311 --> 04:34:27,094
And as I mentioned in the beginning, the vast majority of it now is personnel.

1601
04:34:28,335 --> 04:34:42,947
It's not to say that we couldn't theoretically expend some resources, but it may be the case in order to maintain that healthy balance and make sure that we're able to provide equitable access if necessary, it may be the case that we would have to consider some type of

1602
04:34:44,390 --> 04:34:53,092
raising of the tuition fees in order to be able to withstand the potential use of other facilities.

1603
04:34:53,473 --> 04:35:05,316
So those are sort of five nuggets of information that I think is the sort of common thread there is that we will be revisiting these issues in the future.

1604
04:35:05,856 --> 04:35:09,277
There'll be some strategic decisions that have to be made to that effect.

1605
04:35:09,357 --> 04:35:09,837
And I think

1606
04:35:10,773 --> 04:35:12,394
That's not this side, one last thing.

1607
04:35:12,434 --> 04:35:14,416
So this is just sort of walking through it again.

1608
04:35:14,736 --> 04:35:18,399
The point of this is just to demonstrate that all of these things are connected.

1609
04:35:18,479 --> 04:35:22,742
The first box, we decide whether to have after-school programming.

1610
04:35:22,842 --> 04:35:24,583
That's a decision for the school committee right now.

1611
04:35:24,623 --> 04:35:26,705
The organization has decided, yes, we will.

1612
04:35:27,105 --> 04:35:30,027
Second, we decide to expand.

1613
04:35:30,388 --> 04:35:38,694
That is reflective, again, of the sort of internal conflict, or inherent conflict, rather, between having a public education

1614
04:35:39,450 --> 04:35:42,791
something that an element of the school system that is inaccessible.

1615
04:35:43,951 --> 04:35:50,093
So to address that we have to identify space and we have to stabilize staffing.

1616
04:35:50,133 --> 04:36:04,537
So where our recommendations are we're going to intend to use the computer labs and we're going to intend to increase the seats and the way to do that we think responsibly would be to stabilize the staffing which is why we are asking for the

1617
04:36:06,271 --> 04:36:09,152
the wage increase to members of the staff.

1618
04:36:09,273 --> 04:36:12,594
So I appreciate you carrying us out on all that.

1619
04:36:12,714 --> 04:36:23,920
I know this is a multifaceted presentation, and I certainly hope that no one will be shy about asking questions, even if they think the information might have been tucked away somewhere.

1620
04:36:24,260 --> 04:36:29,562
We're happy to revisit any or all of the pieces of information that we've submitted tonight.

1621
04:36:30,043 --> 04:36:30,363
Thank you.

1622
04:36:30,383 --> 04:36:33,965
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1623
04:36:34,085 --> 04:36:34,625
Member Russo.

1624
04:36:39,108 --> 04:36:39,548
Thank you.

1625
04:36:40,168 --> 04:36:42,589
I appreciate that we got this presentation ahead of time.

1626
04:36:42,609 --> 04:36:45,549
I don't think I could have digested it all right now.

1627
04:36:47,009 --> 04:36:51,990
I first would like to acknowledge that our director still needs to actually have a title of director.

1628
04:36:52,210 --> 04:36:54,871
Everybody wants to refer to her as the director and she should be the director.

1629
04:36:55,791 --> 04:36:58,952
So I look forward to that being corrected, hopefully in this budget.

1630
04:36:59,692 --> 04:37:06,133
I think one thing that's missing here is the impact of

1631
04:37:07,162 --> 04:37:09,463
failure to meet this need.

1632
04:37:10,244 --> 04:37:16,147
Our tuition, our charter school tuition this year is $8.7 million.

1633
04:37:16,747 --> 04:37:28,593
And the frequency with which I hear parents, well, I mean, they don't end up in our school system, but you see it on Facebook, you see it in the parent group.

1634
04:37:28,833 --> 04:37:32,775
And they're like, well, I went there because I could get guaranteed after school.

1635
04:37:33,730 --> 04:37:41,179
And, and I understand the dynamics of not having unions in the charter schools, and they can do things we really can't do.

1636
04:37:42,160 --> 04:37:47,766
But one of the things they also do is is take up a many, many millions of dollars a year.

1637
04:37:48,567 --> 04:37:51,250
And I think that

1638
04:37:51,808 --> 04:38:03,875
You know, the word affordability is a reference to the families, but I think we also need to acknowledge there's an affordability to the district to not having every single person who wants to use this program have a seat.

1639
04:38:05,736 --> 04:38:13,200
It's $13,000 a year for 13 years that we send money out of the district.

1640
04:38:13,961 --> 04:38:19,224
And it's always these kindergarten parents who are like, first kids can't get a seat.

1641
04:38:19,684 --> 04:38:21,345
They have two or three or four kids.

1642
04:38:22,348 --> 04:38:28,853
And once the first kid goes off to the charter school, they don't, kid number two, they're not putting into the lottery.

1643
04:38:29,694 --> 04:38:36,480
So instead of it being 144 or whatever the number is, thousands of dollars, it's times the number of kids they have.

1644
04:38:36,680 --> 04:38:42,124
We are talking about literally flushing vast sums of money down the toilet every year.

1645
04:38:42,905 --> 04:38:49,590
And I think that worrying about whether it's $29 an hour or $35, I mean,

1646
04:38:52,598 --> 04:39:01,486
The number, the amount of money we're losing to this dwarfs the entire budget of the whole program.

1647
04:39:02,086 --> 04:39:09,933
So I think that that, and I know that's like, it's like imaginary money that we don't have and it isn't like we can't, we don't have a ledger.

1648
04:39:11,114 --> 04:39:17,059
And I understand like it's harder to talk about because it is sort of like the money that's not in front of us.

1649
04:39:18,180 --> 04:39:20,002
It's not in our budget and it's not gonna be.

1650
04:39:22,062 --> 04:39:29,144
I think of this very much like we're looking here and the problem is just so much bigger.

1651
04:39:30,404 --> 04:39:35,466
So that sort of was a really important point that I don't see in the presentation.

1652
04:39:35,586 --> 04:39:37,926
I also don't know how it would fit.

1653
04:39:38,146 --> 04:39:39,327
So I'm not criticizing.

1654
04:39:40,407 --> 04:39:45,768
I would just add, I am 100% opposed to privatization of any sort.

1655
04:39:45,788 --> 04:39:48,069
The word privatization in public education

1656
04:39:48,835 --> 04:39:54,698
those two things being discussed at the same time feels almost like as a very strange thing.

1657
04:39:54,718 --> 04:40:00,640
It's very much similar to the whole point that Mr. Murphy made about talking about wait lists and public education.

1658
04:40:00,680 --> 04:40:08,064
They don't go together for a reason and privatization and public education in my mind don't belong together either.

1659
04:40:08,084 --> 04:40:16,788
I would couch that slightly and that if you told me we could privatize this

1660
04:40:17,402 --> 04:40:24,069
all the employees would be paid at wages that we agreed to, and they all got health insurance and retirement benefits and a private company.

1661
04:40:24,409 --> 04:40:26,291
But that's not what happens when you privatize.

1662
04:40:27,152 --> 04:40:31,617
Everybody gets the least imaginable amount of money possible to make the business work.

1663
04:40:31,637 --> 04:40:35,901
If we're able to maintain that level of control, but I understand the point.

1664
04:40:36,582 --> 04:40:36,802
Yeah.

1665
04:40:37,162 --> 04:40:37,763
So, um,

1666
04:40:38,901 --> 04:40:43,703
I don't wanna be the only one to speak, but I just wanna quickly ask a couple more questions.

1667
04:40:45,244 --> 04:40:47,645
We have a few words that we actually don't define in here.

1668
04:40:47,705 --> 04:40:53,387
And again, it's a presentation, it's not a paper.

1669
04:40:54,047 --> 04:40:56,208
Affordability isn't defined.

1670
04:40:56,789 --> 04:41:07,533
And I think it's important to acknowledge that the goal of affordability is really about affordability for people who are resource constrained.

1671
04:41:08,390 --> 04:41:14,952
We are not talking about affordability for people with $250,000 in household income.

1672
04:41:15,852 --> 04:41:31,577
When I looked at the survey results for the superintendent search, just not related to this, the number one responding in their income category, and obviously this was not a scientific sampling of Medford,

1673
04:41:36,600 --> 04:41:44,122
But of the people that responded to the demographics, the most common answer to their household income was over $250,000.

1674
04:41:44,382 --> 04:41:48,143
We are not living in the middle ages.

1675
04:41:48,203 --> 04:41:56,105
There are lots of people in Medford who would think that these numbers that we're talking about, those aren't affordable, they're laughable.

1676
04:41:56,865 --> 04:41:58,906
They're kind of like, that's it?

1677
04:41:58,966 --> 04:41:59,786
Well, sure, whatever.

1678
04:41:59,806 --> 04:42:02,927
Like they don't go and look in their budget to see if they can afford it.

1679
04:42:03,398 --> 04:42:07,941
They look at these numbers and they're like, Jesus, why would anybody not take this service?

1680
04:42:08,982 --> 04:42:23,973
So I think we have to nail down a bit on what we mean by affordability, because by focusing on just the fact that we wanna keep it affordable for those that are resource constrained, we're missing a huge opportunity, frankly.

1681
04:42:24,393 --> 04:42:25,414
That's how I view this.

1682
04:42:25,514 --> 04:42:31,378
And I recognize that we don't have the systems in place this year to start doing things around, you know,

1683
04:42:31,828 --> 04:42:34,109
a sliding scale or income base.

1684
04:42:34,309 --> 04:42:39,092
And those technical requirements are not something you can snap your fingers and accomplish.

1685
04:42:40,512 --> 04:42:47,136
But when I heard the, well, I heard $540 a month, although I realized it's not that number.

1686
04:42:47,796 --> 04:42:49,877
I thought, well, is that a week?

1687
04:42:50,077 --> 04:42:50,818
I thought it was a week.

1688
04:42:53,099 --> 04:42:56,641
And I mean, has anybody here hired a nanny?

1689
04:42:57,961 --> 04:42:58,561
I haven't.

1690
04:43:00,747 --> 04:43:04,089
If you tell me you can get a nanny for $540 a week, I'd be surprised.

1691
04:43:04,889 --> 04:43:19,717
So, you know, I think we have to, we're not valuing the convenience of in-place transfer for your child from their classroom to their afterschool program.

1692
04:43:20,137 --> 04:43:21,458
We're not valuing that.

1693
04:43:21,478 --> 04:43:25,500
We're comparing it to a kid that would have to be picked up and transferred to GraceWorks

1694
04:43:26,325 --> 04:43:32,868
or six acres or wherever, like those are not comparable, no matter if they were doing exactly the same programming, they are not comparable.

1695
04:43:33,689 --> 04:43:43,733
And where are we adding the value and figure out how much this is worth around the fact that your kid just goes either from the second floor to the first floor, or maybe even they're in the same classroom.

1696
04:43:45,074 --> 04:43:47,055
There's a huge value there.

1697
04:43:47,315 --> 04:43:55,159
And I'm not saying we check the rates up for everybody, but for people that have the resources, these numbers make absolutely no sense.

1698
04:43:56,173 --> 04:43:56,913
that we're charging.

1699
04:43:57,193 --> 04:44:02,816
And I am not a fan of 3% increases in the future.

1700
04:44:03,336 --> 04:44:11,040
I certainly will vote for that tonight, but that, you know, and maybe we get to a whole new structure and then we go 3% going forward.

1701
04:44:11,460 --> 04:44:21,745
But like, once we switch or can get to an income-based, I do not expect you to get, like a presentation says we're gonna charge them 10% more, like that's,

1702
04:44:22,127 --> 04:44:26,770
that's not thinking outside the box or valuing the service that is being provided, in my opinion.

1703
04:44:29,732 --> 04:44:35,015
The staff turnover, I think that was well covered, is a major issue.

1704
04:44:35,035 --> 04:44:41,179
And I was super happy when I saw the slide with the increases in the wages.

1705
04:44:41,199 --> 04:44:48,903
It was much bigger than I anticipated, honestly, and that made me feel very confident that we're working towards really dealing with this.

1706
04:44:52,728 --> 04:45:07,493
There is a word equitable accesses in here two or three times, and I'm just wishing we had a definition and maybe there is one, but we do need to define that because there is no, it's not like math.

1707
04:45:07,613 --> 04:45:08,593
There is no answer.

1708
04:45:08,773 --> 04:45:14,075
It's a value judgment that we as a community make to decide what equitable means.

1709
04:45:14,735 --> 04:45:21,238
And I expect that that changes year to year, you know, as Medford changes and as the committee changes,

1710
04:45:23,873 --> 04:45:29,075
And then that was all I had for the moment.

1711
04:45:29,516 --> 04:45:30,436
I appreciate this.

1712
04:45:30,456 --> 04:45:31,817
This is, I think, excellent.

1713
04:45:31,997 --> 04:45:35,258
And when we get through lots of questions, I'd be happy to make some motions.

1714
04:45:35,859 --> 04:45:36,159
Thank you.

1715
04:45:37,272 --> 04:45:38,313
Thank you.

1716
04:45:39,454 --> 04:45:40,635
Yes, thank you, Mayor.

1717
04:45:41,516 --> 04:45:50,663
So the thing is, first I want to thank Megan and Fiddler Carey and David Murphy and Suzanne Galussi and everybody else who's worked on this.

1718
04:45:51,463 --> 04:45:56,427
And certainly there are a lot of positive changes in this.

1719
04:45:57,408 --> 04:45:57,848
It looks

1720
04:46:00,010 --> 04:46:06,760
You know, the increased wages hopefully will help in securing people who want to work in the afterschool.

1721
04:46:07,161 --> 04:46:14,251
It's always been a difficult position to hire because it's for a limited amount of time in sort of an awkward part of the day.

1722
04:46:15,513 --> 04:46:25,425
I will tell you that I've visited the afterschool on numerous occasions, and I've just been so thrilled with the staff members and their dedication to the kids.

1723
04:46:26,306 --> 04:46:33,374
They clearly take their responsibilities very highly, and I've heard such wonderful feedback.

1724
04:46:34,748 --> 04:46:46,361
Having said all the positives, the only thing is if I'm looking at this and it was from the first slide with the numbers, we're adding projected 60 spaces, but we've got 144 on the wait list.

1725
04:46:47,161 --> 04:46:52,868
That means if I understood this correctly, there were still 84 families who are being disenfranchised.

1726
04:46:53,408 --> 04:46:55,391
And so then the question comes back and saying,

1727
04:46:56,492 --> 04:46:58,593
Okay, great, fantastic.

1728
04:46:58,753 --> 04:47:03,076
I understand you're trying to be realistic in your projections.

1729
04:47:03,276 --> 04:47:08,560
I understand there are some issues about space, although Mr. Murphy said it was not space alone.

1730
04:47:09,000 --> 04:47:14,843
Probably the hiring, I would guess, is one of the most difficult things altogether.

1731
04:47:16,024 --> 04:47:21,748
But how are we going to accommodate the other families who are not accommodated in this?

1732
04:47:22,548 --> 04:47:24,231
And what, what else can we do.

1733
04:47:24,251 --> 04:47:30,420
I wondered and I realized, I absolutely get that there's a whole nother oversight needed.

1734
04:47:31,542 --> 04:47:37,551
We've parents have mentioned that they wanted to be cooperative players I've remembered the days of preschools.

1735
04:47:38,072 --> 04:47:48,520
where there were cooperative preschools and parents volunteered maybe to work on a Monday and Wednesday, and then their kids went and other parents took over in other days.

1736
04:47:48,660 --> 04:47:54,744
And again, I fully appreciate that's a whole nother level of organization.

1737
04:47:55,385 --> 04:47:57,707
But if hiring is the issue,

1738
04:47:58,594 --> 04:48:12,385
And if we're looking still at this gap of 84 families, and I don't know if it's spread throughout the district in particular, that seems to me that's the next challenge and what are we gonna do about that?

1739
04:48:13,066 --> 04:48:21,393
But again, I say this almost kind of like torn, because I wanna tell you, I very much appreciate the work that's been done and the steps that are positive moving forward.

1740
04:48:21,413 --> 04:48:26,337
Mayor, if I could just briefly respond to both Mr. So and Ms.

1741
04:48:26,397 --> 04:48:26,897
Vander Kloot.

1742
04:48:28,227 --> 04:48:34,490
I, the first thing I think everyone should know is that it's not uncommon, particularly in Ms.

1743
04:48:34,530 --> 04:48:40,332
Fidler-Kerr, correct me if I misstate anything here, but it's not uncommon to have a wait list at this point.

1744
04:48:40,812 --> 04:48:52,317
And there, the likelihood is many people on the wait list will ultimately, I don't want to get into the quantity, quantifying it, but there will be people on the wait list who in all likelihood

1745
04:48:52,775 --> 04:49:00,720
I'll end up with a C. And so if it's 84 right now, it should be fewer than 84 by the time September comes around.

1746
04:49:01,320 --> 04:49:03,482
So that, that being said, Ms.

1747
04:49:03,502 --> 04:49:17,350
Vanden Heuvel used the word disenfranchisement, and I think it is necessary to know that this is not a core service of the district.

1748
04:49:17,810 --> 04:49:20,452
Now, that being said, okay,

1749
04:49:21,375 --> 04:49:24,176
the district has decided to have an afterschool program.

1750
04:49:24,716 --> 04:49:33,358
And I think we all agree on the inherent conflict and problem with having a service that's offered that we can't afford to everyone.

1751
04:49:33,878 --> 04:49:48,721
But that is why, as we consulted with other districts, some districts ultimately did decide to privatize the service because they couldn't identify the capacity internally

1752
04:49:49,134 --> 04:49:51,956
to be able to provide the service to everyone who asked for it.

1753
04:49:52,456 --> 04:50:17,850
And so, that is like the sort of conundrum that we find ourselves in, that we make the strategic decision to do this because we wanna provide as much service as we can, but we have to be honest about our capacity to offer the service in the way we do our core mission, which we have a moral and legal obligation to provide

1754
04:50:18,888 --> 04:50:19,609
to everyone.

1755
04:50:19,709 --> 04:50:21,849
And so there is a distinction there.

1756
04:50:22,530 --> 04:50:30,933
And I just wanna say because to the point that Mr. Russell made with regard to the wages, the wage increases, that is like everything.

1757
04:50:30,973 --> 04:50:37,616
And I wouldn't necessarily say that the things that we put in here are undefined because they're based in part in comparisons we did to other districts.

1758
04:50:38,076 --> 04:50:46,760
So the definition I would say is generally by trying to be comparable, both with regard to tuition fees in terms of access and affordability,

1759
04:50:47,207 --> 04:50:48,788
and with regard to wages.

1760
04:50:49,128 --> 04:51:00,494
At the same time, and there's some variability with regard to the scope of the increase, depending on the position, because there's some variability with regard to our ability to retain people.

1761
04:51:00,634 --> 04:51:04,336
And so that is sort of what's driving this.

1762
04:51:04,416 --> 04:51:09,538
And I do have to mention, as we approach budget season, that again, this is a self-sustained program.

1763
04:51:09,859 --> 04:51:14,601
And so these increases are based on the fact that there are heightened fees being generated

1764
04:51:15,011 --> 04:51:17,213
and a revolving account to which these are charged.

1765
04:51:17,613 --> 04:51:25,978
So this is not, this classification of employees really can't be compared to any other group of employees.

1766
04:51:26,879 --> 04:51:29,681
And I appreciate the time to offer those explanatory notes.

1767
04:51:32,183 --> 04:51:34,284
Member Graham, then Member McLaughlin.

1768
04:51:41,769 --> 04:51:42,930
So if we,

1769
04:51:44,711 --> 04:52:05,417
move forward with it via the hopes to expand to these 60 seats and you find that you have qualified applicants in excess of what you need to expand the program, I'm making an assumption that you would expand the program beyond the 60 seats.

1770
04:52:05,517 --> 04:52:06,757
Is that true?

1771
04:52:08,898 --> 04:52:29,733
I can go back and see if I got the word incorrect, but it's an approximate expansion of 60 seats, because while I do think we should come before you on an annual basis to ask for the tuition increases, I wouldn't say that the administration should come before the school committee to ask about the number of seats, because that would be like showing up to ask, you know, how many kids do you want us to put in this class?

1772
04:52:30,154 --> 04:52:32,555
We provide the service that we can.

1773
04:52:32,756 --> 04:52:35,898
So that's an approximation, definitely, but I would say that

1774
04:52:36,341 --> 04:52:50,323
I don't think, it's based on one, the spatial factor, which I don't think we're going to immediately like have a new wing of a building or clear out like classrooms.

1775
04:52:50,383 --> 04:52:54,384
I mean, there's, that doesn't mean we couldn't theoretically use some classrooms.

1776
04:52:54,444 --> 04:52:58,765
I mean, we could expand that, but there's two other factors.

1777
04:52:59,345 --> 04:53:04,666
One, there are additional challenges that are created the more students that are in a building.

1778
04:53:04,996 --> 04:53:07,698
There's administrative challenges that become posed.

1779
04:53:07,938 --> 04:53:09,379
There are safety and security challenges.

1780
04:53:09,639 --> 04:53:11,020
There are health services challenges.

1781
04:53:11,460 --> 04:53:18,745
All of those things have to be taken into account, which is one of the limiting factors and why we wouldn't want to quadruple in size overnight.

1782
04:53:20,686 --> 04:53:21,386
That's a factor.

1783
04:53:22,147 --> 04:53:34,475
The other factor is, theoretically, if we were to grow and not have space in one place, we might have to look at some options that currently are not on the table based on the current budgeting.

1784
04:53:35,215 --> 04:53:42,317
you could see a world in which this expands in a way that fourth and fifth graders are transported to a central location.

1785
04:53:42,717 --> 04:53:50,058
Well, maybe we could do that logistically, but that might change the nature of the service such that there might not be the same level of demand.

1786
04:53:50,518 --> 04:53:54,439
And so that's something that we'd want to think long and hard about before we were to take that up.

1787
04:53:54,779 --> 04:54:01,981
The final limiting factor is that we know we have staffing challenges now at our current size, we think

1788
04:54:02,512 --> 04:54:05,173
that increasing the wages is going to stabilize that.

1789
04:54:05,513 --> 04:54:07,954
And we think we're going to be able to hire the necessary staff.

1790
04:54:08,734 --> 04:54:09,914
We could be wrong about that.

1791
04:54:10,495 --> 04:54:24,759
And if we're going to be wrong, we'd rather be 20 students overenrolled and find out that we have a staffing emergency than to be 80 students overenrolled and have a staffing emergency, which is another big component of why we would want to grow gradually.

1792
04:54:26,289 --> 04:54:27,670
Yeah, and I get that.

1793
04:54:27,810 --> 04:54:46,783
I certainly don't think we can be in a position where we overcommit and cannot deliver in a big substantive way, because I think at that point, you would have no choice but to shut down big swaths of the program, which would not be what anybody is looking for.

1794
04:54:47,063 --> 04:54:53,708
But I will say that this committee has been told unequivocally by past administrators that space is not an issue

1795
04:54:54,168 --> 04:55:05,559
that constrains us and at the time I didn't particularly believe it although I think the message was it's a it's a constraint that we can overcome with enough lead time.

1796
04:55:06,140 --> 04:55:13,567
So I guess what I would ask of all of you is if if the hiring becomes the

1797
04:55:14,855 --> 04:55:37,255
If our changes to the wage structures are such that staffing is no longer like the long tent in the pole, and you need something from this committee to allow a more rapid expansion than you're planning on, that you would come back to us and make sure that we prioritize

1798
04:55:37,855 --> 04:55:41,198
taking action on that as as fast as we possibly can.

1799
04:55:42,219 --> 04:55:45,742
Because I do think there are a lot of families, you know, there are families on the wait list.

1800
04:55:46,723 --> 04:55:53,810
We're not even talking about the families who don't try to get on the list because they didn't even know they were supposed to be on a list.

1801
04:55:53,850 --> 04:55:58,954
Like we, you know, I think even if we found a seat for every single person on the wait list, we're sort of

1802
04:55:59,959 --> 04:56:13,401
We're only solving the part of the problem that's sort of loud and in our face, but we're not necessarily, I don't think we can say that we have solved the entire problem of afterschool care amongst elementary schools.

1803
04:56:14,221 --> 04:56:16,122
I do think there has to be some evolution here.

1804
04:56:16,742 --> 04:56:17,962
Yeah.

1805
04:56:18,302 --> 04:56:24,923
No question there are people that are not, we don't know about, either don't know about it or aren't bothering to advocate.

1806
04:56:24,943 --> 04:56:27,064
So there's no question it's a much bigger issue.

1807
04:56:27,464 --> 04:56:28,864
And that's one of the issues here is that

1808
04:56:29,334 --> 04:56:33,579
As we solve some of it is that we will have more problems challenges being generated.

1809
04:56:33,879 --> 04:56:36,883
It doesn't mean we don't want to address them, but we have to address them responsibly.

1810
04:56:37,864 --> 04:56:39,165
Yeah, completely agreed.

1811
04:56:39,265 --> 04:56:50,338
So, um, I, I would like to make a motion that we adopt the recommendations provided to us that provide wage increases for the afterschool program.

1812
04:56:51,547 --> 04:56:58,710
staff and the recommended rate increase for tuition for the after school program.

1813
04:56:59,530 --> 04:57:03,252
Seconded by many.

1814
04:57:05,593 --> 04:57:06,553
Member McLaughlin.

1815
04:57:08,843 --> 04:57:09,323
Thank you.

1816
04:57:09,343 --> 04:57:24,458
Um, I'd like to hear from some from some parents before voting on the motion if we could because I'd like to hear perspectives and I'm going to forego my place in line right now so I can hear from a number of folks and then I'll circle back around.

1817
04:57:24,558 --> 04:57:24,898
Thank you.

1818
04:57:35,373 --> 04:58:04,831
I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can I can

1819
04:58:05,645 --> 04:58:13,814
We prepared a brief statement from our Medford parents for better before and after school.

1820
04:58:13,874 --> 04:58:23,765
And we recognize that during the meeting, as you've been talking, you know, we should qualify what better means and that means more accessible, accessible after school care.

1821
04:58:26,077 --> 04:58:29,039
We appreciate Megan's report tonight at the meeting.

1822
04:58:30,400 --> 04:58:43,448
However, the report and the recommendations that she and David went through, they do not provide relief for the families that are excluded from the program, as member Van Der Poot mentioned, the disenfranchised families.

1823
04:58:44,048 --> 04:58:48,051
So before afterschool care is more accessible afterschool care.

1824
04:58:48,831 --> 04:58:52,854
And we appreciate the context David is saying tonight about the programming not being,

1825
04:58:53,822 --> 04:59:01,524
I don't wanna misinterpret your words, but not being part of a core service, but this is a fundamental issue for our community.

1826
04:59:02,764 --> 04:59:14,666
As Paul mentioned before, families having to choose to leave and not participate in public school by sheer need is really important.

1827
04:59:14,766 --> 04:59:19,287
So I just wanna provide some context related to my email.

1828
04:59:20,387 --> 04:59:22,308
I registered my oldest child of three

1829
04:59:23,353 --> 04:59:33,625
So in that kind of situation that Paul mentioned, for kindergarten, a few short weeks ago, my husband and I worked full time, both of us, like many families in our organizing group.

1830
04:59:33,985 --> 04:59:35,887
And we entered that after school lottery.

1831
04:59:36,808 --> 04:59:43,856
And many families in my child's pre-K received a similar email being added to a wait list.

1832
04:59:44,637 --> 04:59:53,522
And our understanding is not what you mentioned, David, you know, describing how the waitlist works very briefly after finding out, you know, even in this.

1833
04:59:53,922 --> 04:59:56,064
So we're already thrust in a stressful situation.

1834
04:59:56,144 --> 04:59:59,305
We don't, we're not in, we don't have a spot in the program.

1835
05:00:00,106 --> 05:00:04,468
Our understanding is that very few new kindergarten students are accepted any given year.

1836
05:00:05,349 --> 05:00:07,390
So those would be disenfranchised families.

1837
05:00:07,810 --> 05:00:14,919
And then there are the significant number that's mentioned on the waitlist, even though that number will go down if the spots are added.

1838
05:00:14,939 --> 05:00:22,689
The reality is if you don't get that spot during your kindergarten year, it's very small chance that you ever get off that waitlist.

1839
05:00:24,065 --> 05:00:31,010
Most of us when we reached out about our position, those families who have rising kindergartners, we were told that we were at the bottom.

1840
05:00:31,311 --> 05:00:32,091
Many of us were.

1841
05:00:33,032 --> 05:00:39,216
There are very few other local afterschool options in Medford, particularly for kindergartners through third grade.

1842
05:00:39,256 --> 05:00:41,298
This is a community issue, not just

1843
05:00:42,112 --> 05:00:42,972
a school issue.

1844
05:00:43,513 --> 05:00:59,139
So we have a brainstorming group, we did a lot of knowledge gathering in March and just a few short weeks, we've gathered insights by talking to Megan, by talking to school members like Jenny and Paul, we gathered insights from talking to Marie at Metro Family Network to get that wider community context.

1845
05:00:59,499 --> 05:01:05,682
And we have grown a network of families, nine of us who are organizing and 30 other families who are interested and

1846
05:01:07,202 --> 05:01:13,944
and at various levels wanting to at least stay informed, if not participate in that brainstorming.

1847
05:01:14,024 --> 05:01:21,807
So just building off of that vision, mission and vision that most, a lot of us in the organizing group attended last week.

1848
05:01:21,847 --> 05:01:32,231
And we appreciated that outreach by the school and the committee to participate in that conversation as it relates to making Medford a strong, vibrant community.

1849
05:01:33,240 --> 05:01:36,103
that's inclusive for all working family situations.

1850
05:01:37,184 --> 05:01:45,633
Our blue sky goal is that every family in Medford who needs a spot in the after and before school program should get one, particularly after school.

1851
05:01:46,454 --> 05:01:52,321
And so we must strive for a future reality where zero families are forced out of the public school system altogether.

1852
05:01:53,322 --> 05:01:54,203
Choosing those private

1853
05:01:54,643 --> 05:01:55,865
private or charter school.

1854
05:01:56,907 --> 05:02:02,114
And they're worse yet, there are families that don't have the means to find out, to find private care.

1855
05:02:02,455 --> 05:02:04,818
So we have to address this in an equitable way.

1856
05:02:06,568 --> 05:02:10,889
equitable does not mean equal also in terms of the affordability question.

1857
05:02:10,949 --> 05:02:18,190
So to my email point before I'll wrap up, we have this network of families to build on that mission and vision.

1858
05:02:18,210 --> 05:02:22,511
We are ready, willing, and eager to participate in a partnership.

1859
05:02:23,251 --> 05:02:28,152
As someone already mentioned, I think, David, this could require a set of solution.

1860
05:02:28,572 --> 05:02:35,433
And we're at the table asking how to be part of that conversation, how to be part of that brainstorming, how to be part of executing.

1861
05:02:35,971 --> 05:02:36,732
solutions to.

1862
05:02:36,872 --> 05:02:38,994
So, you know, maybe not today.

1863
05:02:39,014 --> 05:02:40,035
You have an answer.

1864
05:02:40,115 --> 05:02:47,843
But how do we have those conversations and, you know, come to the table with you to make this a community solution set?

1865
05:02:48,023 --> 05:02:48,424
Thank you.

1866
05:02:50,826 --> 05:02:52,168
Thank you very much, Teresa.

1867
05:02:52,788 --> 05:02:53,189
Vanessa.

1868
05:02:58,752 --> 05:03:20,190
Hi, my name is Vanessa Farsner of 17 Barbara Lane, and I want to also thank you for the presentation for sharing that information with us I really appreciate it I'm sure it took a lot of time and effort, as it has, you know, appreciate the time and effort of all the other

1869
05:03:20,750 --> 05:03:26,034
people that I've been lucky to work with on this and try to move things forward.

1870
05:03:26,134 --> 05:03:35,662
Things that I want to bring up again and make sure that I feel like the after school, the people working on the after school program are really

1871
05:03:36,182 --> 05:03:41,326
hearing is that this isn't just about us getting a spot.

1872
05:03:41,806 --> 05:03:44,368
This is about equity in our community.

1873
05:03:44,768 --> 05:03:55,716
And I'm very disappointed to see that there is just a statement that working on a sliding scale fee right now is basically, it seems like too complicated.

1874
05:03:56,277 --> 05:03:59,559
This is essential for us to meet the need.

1875
05:03:59,739 --> 05:04:04,243
I unfortunately during this meeting had some trouble pulling up my numbers.

1876
05:04:04,903 --> 05:04:19,332
But I ran the numbers on the free and reduced free schools across our community, and three of the schools are closer to 40% free and reduced lunch, and then the Brooke School is at about 13% free and reduced lunch.

1877
05:04:19,932 --> 05:04:28,483
Yet, I have been told time and time again that the wait list for the afterschool program is significantly higher at the Brooks School than any other school.

1878
05:04:29,024 --> 05:04:36,733
To me, that draws a clear line conclusion that it means it's not affordable for parents at these other schools.

1879
05:04:37,828 --> 05:04:43,933
So to say, again, that we're meeting the need by filling 60 seats is just absurd to me.

1880
05:04:43,993 --> 05:04:46,776
We're not coming close.

1881
05:04:46,816 --> 05:04:57,985
There are so many families who just don't even see the fee that you have as something that they can put their money towards that they're not even looking at this as an option.

1882
05:04:58,065 --> 05:05:03,150
So how many latchkey kids are out there because we're not offering an affordable program?

1883
05:05:03,790 --> 05:05:16,600
And I 100% agree with Paul, where you have so many families out there who would pay the $650 plus that families in Arlington and families of Winchester are paying.

1884
05:05:17,080 --> 05:05:24,286
Nobody is questioning, nobody in our group, I feel, is questioning the quality of what the students are receiving once they're in the program.

1885
05:05:24,746 --> 05:05:32,155
we're questioning the accessibility of this program to students across Medford, not just in the Brooke School.

1886
05:05:32,316 --> 05:05:37,462
And so I feel like it is essential for a sliding scale fee to be developed and be focused on.

1887
05:05:38,023 --> 05:05:43,690
I also think that this issue of space, I haven't once heard anyone talk about

1888
05:05:44,210 --> 05:05:45,971
other locations being used?

1889
05:05:46,071 --> 05:05:52,194
Why can't the buses drop off kids at the high school and have a program run out of the high school or one of the middle schools?

1890
05:05:52,274 --> 05:05:59,657
And if there's a reason, then let us be a part of that conversation so that we can understand what the reasons are and see if there are barriers.

1891
05:05:59,737 --> 05:06:07,701
The idea that the staffing is the issue, clearly private organizations have found ways to fill the staffing.

1892
05:06:08,141 --> 05:06:12,305
I think you've taken a great step by suggesting an increase.

1893
05:06:12,785 --> 05:06:22,914
I agree with Paul and I'm so happy to hear you suggest that those pay increases should happen, but ask some to pay more so that you can have even greater pay increases.

1894
05:06:23,014 --> 05:06:28,799
What you stated for the pay increases will not meet minimum wage come January 23rd.

1895
05:06:31,320 --> 05:06:33,661
I'm sorry, January of 2023.

1896
05:06:33,701 --> 05:06:41,283
Massachusetts minimum wage is increasing to $15 an hour as of January 1st, 2023.

1897
05:06:41,744 --> 05:06:47,265
So you need to think not about just today, but about how those wages need to increase over time.

1898
05:06:47,786 --> 05:06:52,727
And I really think that you're missing a huge opportunity in the ability to charge others more.

1899
05:06:52,787 --> 05:06:55,328
I'm sure I'm running out of time, so I only have two more points.

1900
05:06:55,988 --> 05:06:59,729
One, it continues to frustrate me that there's a four-day week option.

1901
05:07:00,209 --> 05:07:06,611
I think a three-day week and a two-day week mean that there's a student in that spot every day of the week.

1902
05:07:07,191 --> 05:07:14,512
And this four-day of a week just seems like a discount and not something that is getting into position at one time.

1903
05:07:14,993 --> 05:07:19,314
So three days, two days, five days, why do we have a four-day week option?

1904
05:07:19,414 --> 05:07:22,654
I would really like to hear an answer to that at some point.

1905
05:07:23,154 --> 05:07:24,975
And lastly, really,

1906
05:07:26,436 --> 05:07:29,198
transparency, more transparency going forward.

1907
05:07:29,598 --> 05:07:39,687
I understand if you're not comfortable saying this is exactly your spot, but a communication, understanding how many spots there are in each grade, I think is something that we need.

1908
05:07:40,127 --> 05:07:43,189
And we need to hear from you guys on where we can sit at this table.

1909
05:07:43,250 --> 05:07:44,991
This whole presentation was put together.

1910
05:07:45,071 --> 05:07:49,575
And while again, I appreciate it, I feel like why weren't we asked any questions before?

1911
05:07:49,655 --> 05:07:51,016
Why wasn't a survey put out?

1912
05:07:51,056 --> 05:07:53,278
Why aren't you asking what the actual need is?

1913
05:07:53,818 --> 05:08:00,929
And please, please do not continue to say comments like, I'm sorry, Mr. Murphy, I've appreciated so many things that you have said.

1914
05:08:01,991 --> 05:08:08,981
But when you said that so many spots do get filled, I am someone who's been on the wait list for over a year.

1915
05:08:09,882 --> 05:08:10,722
over a year.

1916
05:08:11,022 --> 05:08:18,745
So please do not say statements that makes people feel like they might get a spot as it is today.

1917
05:08:19,165 --> 05:08:24,688
But I do thank you guys for looking at options and hope that you make us a part of the conversation in the future.

1918
05:08:25,088 --> 05:08:27,569
And please don't forget that Andre did have his hand up.

1919
05:08:27,729 --> 05:08:29,049
Okay, so he has it up again.

1920
05:08:29,149 --> 05:08:29,589
Thank you.

1921
05:08:32,170 --> 05:08:33,751
Thank you, Andre.

1922
05:08:33,771 --> 05:08:37,032
Name and address for the record.

1923
05:08:37,052 --> 05:08:37,092
To

1924
05:08:40,518 --> 05:08:42,699
try to limit it to two to three minutes, that would be great.

1925
05:08:43,739 --> 05:08:45,280
We have a couple more pages.

1926
05:08:48,121 --> 05:08:49,261
Name and address for the record.

1927
05:08:53,183 --> 05:08:53,963
Yeah, can you hear me now?

1928
05:08:54,744 --> 05:08:55,944
Yeah.

1929
05:08:56,164 --> 05:09:00,986
So my name is Andre Quenna and address is 19 Johnson Ave in Medford.

1930
05:09:01,006 --> 05:09:04,147
So I'll keep it brief because the

1931
05:09:06,606 --> 05:09:11,068
you know, I think a lot of our points are similar since we've been discussing a lot of this as a group.

1932
05:09:12,048 --> 05:09:25,313
The one thing that I'll add is, and to Paul's point and to Vanessa's point, you know, I see it a little bit differently in that, you know, we again are a family that, you know, we have a child going into first grade because

1933
05:09:26,112 --> 05:09:33,815
We weren't able to find an afterschool option last year when our son was going into first grade, so he's in private school this year.

1934
05:09:33,835 --> 05:09:43,278
And next year, we're really hopeful that we can figure out a way to have him in public school, but that's gonna come at a cost.

1935
05:09:43,298 --> 05:09:55,403
You know, what we're looking at, so we've looked at other options, Grace Works, they've told us they're bringing in maybe two to three additional spots next year that aren't filled by existing

1936
05:09:56,249 --> 05:10:00,392
students within their program or siblings of students in their program.

1937
05:10:00,412 --> 05:10:02,233
So we're on that list.

1938
05:10:02,273 --> 05:10:04,195
We're not hopeful that that's going to be an option.

1939
05:10:05,137 --> 05:10:13,062
We believe right now that our only option is to hire an individual caregiver for our son if we're going to go to private, to public school.

1940
05:10:13,563 --> 05:10:20,707
That's going to come at a cost of $10,400 to cover that cost for him to receive care.

1941
05:10:21,248 --> 05:10:23,389
And that's $10,400 that we're paying.

1942
05:10:23,449 --> 05:10:29,293
And you're talking about, you know, should we or shouldn't we have variable rates based on income?

1943
05:10:29,673 --> 05:10:30,794
That already exists.

1944
05:10:31,407 --> 05:10:42,193
like we're going to pay twice as much for care for our son next year, and that's twice as much that's going to go, it's going to be lost from this after school program.

1945
05:10:42,653 --> 05:10:51,939
We could be paying more into this program and not only having a spot for our son in this program, but potentially offsetting the cost for a family that can't afford it.

1946
05:10:53,279 --> 05:10:57,782
So like we shouldn't be considering is there or isn't there a graduated program?

1947
05:10:58,062 --> 05:10:59,663
There already exists, it already

1948
05:11:00,276 --> 05:11:09,923
is there, it's just you're not taking advantage of it and you're not using it to increase access to the program and increase equity to the program.

1949
05:11:10,003 --> 05:11:10,983
That's the only point I'll make.

1950
05:11:11,244 --> 05:11:11,564
Thank you.

1951
05:11:12,544 --> 05:11:13,245
Thank you, Andre.

1952
05:11:13,945 --> 05:11:14,726
Member McLaughlin.

1953
05:11:17,228 --> 05:11:17,728
Thank you, Mayor.

1954
05:11:18,828 --> 05:11:35,795
I want to thank the parents that were here tonight it was really good to hear from all of you it's really encouraging to see you all coming together, asking for to first eat the table, and to be a part of the community, and I think that you deserve that and I think we have to figure out a way to make that happen.

1955
05:11:37,696 --> 05:11:47,118
And I want to get back to what another colleague was saying, several folks were saying about some of the definitions of the items that folks are talking about.

1956
05:11:47,178 --> 05:11:53,800
Clearly, you all have put quite a bit of work into your organizing and your discussion around this.

1957
05:11:53,820 --> 05:11:59,921
So I'm sure you've had a lot of discussion around a kitchen table or Zoom or what have you around these issues.

1958
05:12:00,941 --> 05:12:03,062
And equitable access is a huge part.

1959
05:12:03,242 --> 05:12:07,163
As I hear you talking about this, I'm really, really encouraged to hear people talking about

1960
05:12:07,663 --> 05:12:09,625
offsetting costs and sliding fee scales.

1961
05:12:09,645 --> 05:12:18,532
And I know we had, you know, a colleague talk about hundreds of thousands of dollars that some people make, but and there are people, you know, in our community that don't.

1962
05:12:18,792 --> 05:12:22,715
And so how we're figuring that out is really critical and equitable access for all.

1963
05:12:23,656 --> 05:12:35,705
I think I know that Megan has been really great about ensuring that students with disabilities are included in the program, that there's that there's a statement right on the application that families know

1964
05:12:36,492 --> 05:12:45,862
that the program is accessible and that there's hiring of staff that should be trained to work with students of all abilities, students of all languages, and that those factors are being considered as well.

1965
05:12:45,922 --> 05:12:57,754
So I am encouraged by the community rallying around this and the participation, and I would love to take a vote on member Graham's motion around the wage.

1966
05:12:59,664 --> 05:13:10,789
a motion and I would also like to ask what the next steps forward could be in terms of sliding fee skills because there are very much families who can't.

1967
05:13:11,309 --> 05:13:26,776
I know that access around building access and room is obviously one issue, but also the sliding fee skill is another really big issue and I want to know what training is going to be available for staff or students with disabilities as well in our individual learners.

1968
05:13:27,737 --> 05:13:27,937
So.

1969
05:13:30,147 --> 05:13:32,408
So that's a second on the motion.

1970
05:13:34,770 --> 05:13:35,390
Roll call.

1971
05:13:41,373 --> 05:13:41,994
Member Graham.

1972
05:13:42,594 --> 05:13:42,854
Yes.

1973
05:13:45,176 --> 05:13:45,776
Member Kretz.

1974
05:13:46,416 --> 05:13:46,676
Yes.

1975
05:13:49,078 --> 05:13:50,319
Member McLaughlin, yes.

1976
05:13:52,700 --> 05:13:53,460
Member McStone.

1977
05:13:53,861 --> 05:13:54,141
Yes.

1978
05:13:55,241 --> 05:13:56,002
Member Rousseau.

1979
05:13:57,263 --> 05:13:57,483
Yes.

1980
05:13:58,743 --> 05:13:59,584
Member Van de Kloot.

1981
05:13:59,979 --> 05:14:00,179
Yes.

1982
05:14:01,420 --> 05:14:02,221
Mayor Long-O'Connor.

1983
05:14:03,002 --> 05:14:04,783
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1984
05:14:04,843 --> 05:14:06,024
The motion is approved.

1985
05:14:08,246 --> 05:14:10,568
And I would like to make a motion, Mayor, if I might.

1986
05:14:11,228 --> 05:14:11,429
Yes.

1987
05:14:12,089 --> 05:14:22,758
I'd like to make a motion that there's a meeting that can be held with the parents that have supported this process and the administration and school committee members if they're interested.

1988
05:14:23,339 --> 05:14:27,963
that we could put something on the books for that maybe within the next month.

1989
05:14:28,003 --> 05:14:40,272
So I make a motion that we schedule a meeting to meet with the parents of the Medford parents for better after school and before school care and that within the next month or month and a half.

1990
05:14:40,292 --> 05:14:46,597
So April 12th, May 12th, by the end of the day.

1991
05:14:49,480 --> 05:14:52,262
Motion for approval by member McLaughlin seconded by

1992
05:14:54,327 --> 05:14:55,328
member Van de Kloet role.

1993
05:14:55,528 --> 05:14:56,828
I actually have a question on it.

1994
05:14:57,248 --> 05:14:57,429
Yep.

1995
05:14:57,829 --> 05:14:58,469
Remember Van de Kloet?

1996
05:14:59,029 --> 05:14:59,269
Yeah.

1997
05:14:59,310 --> 05:15:10,695
So I just have to raise my concern because I've looked at the schedule just to try and get more meetings in with our budget meetings and what we're expecting of our staff.

1998
05:15:10,835 --> 05:15:14,077
I mean, maybe we have to ask, um,

1999
05:15:14,940 --> 05:15:17,442
Megan to spearhead this sort of meeting.

2000
05:15:19,143 --> 05:15:31,172
I just have to express concern that, you know, I think we had 22 meetings last month and I wanna be as responsive to the parents as possible.

2001
05:15:31,352 --> 05:15:38,237
I wanna have maybe, you know, is there a way of working committee but a formal school committee meeting to meet with all the parents?

2002
05:15:38,817 --> 05:15:41,439
It just doesn't seem like the most effective way.

2003
05:15:44,311 --> 05:15:45,951
HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on Disability, Inc.:

2004
05:15:45,951 --> 05:15:46,091
: Maybe.

2005
05:15:46,111 --> 05:15:48,112
So you want to amend it that miss look Harry has a listening session.

2006
05:15:48,132 --> 05:15:50,273
HAB-Michael Leccese, Moderator, Select Committee on Disability, Inc.:

2007
05:15:50,273 --> 05:15:54,954
: I think, I think if the committee would like the administration to meet with the community members who have voiced his concerns.

2008
05:15:54,994 --> 05:15:56,794
HAB-Michael Leccese, Moderator, Select Committee on Disability, Inc.:

2009
05:15:56,794 --> 05:16:03,016
: And certainly, by all means, take a vote of if you would like to, but it's certainly something that that we will do.

2010
05:16:03,716 --> 05:16:10,198
I will echo Miss van includes concerns with regard to the 22 evening meetings convene in the month of March that

2011
05:16:10,736 --> 05:16:19,878
I think it might make more sense, particularly when you've now adopted it via a unanimous vote, essentially a plan for the 21-22 school year.

2012
05:16:20,338 --> 05:16:20,918
I don't know.

2013
05:16:21,658 --> 05:16:26,239
Certainly, we can meet with whoever needs to meet with us in the next month.

2014
05:16:26,279 --> 05:16:27,139
That won't be a problem.

2015
05:16:27,179 --> 05:16:40,162
But I'm not sure that directing a staff member to this type of meeting in a highly prescribed timeline is going to

2016
05:16:40,818 --> 05:16:45,901
really have a major consequence in terms of the eventual structural changes.

2017
05:16:46,081 --> 05:16:52,925
I think that there's a lot of meetings that have to take place and a lot of conversations and we'll make sure the appropriate staff is present at them.

2018
05:16:53,885 --> 05:17:00,209
But I'm not sure, I'm not sure that I understand a formal school committee meeting about this in the next month.

2019
05:17:00,269 --> 05:17:09,554
I just, I'm not sure what we would have on the agenda for that when there's a lot of back, like sort of research that has to be done to make sure that we can actually have like informed

2020
05:17:09,890 --> 05:17:14,312
conversations about where we're going to go from here.

2021
05:17:14,752 --> 05:17:17,353
Yeah, I didn't ask for a school committee meeting on this.

2022
05:17:18,033 --> 05:17:27,416
So for clarification, I am fine with a, you know, a working group task force group, but what have we, whatever, you know, sort of is, is most workable for folks.

2023
05:17:27,496 --> 05:17:29,417
What I want is that the

2024
05:17:30,093 --> 05:17:39,101
conversations and the data and the information that the parent group is collecting is shared with administration and is ultimately shared with school committee so that we can see what their recommendations are.

2025
05:17:39,161 --> 05:17:43,585
So we heard from tonight what the administration's recommendations are.

2026
05:17:43,605 --> 05:17:48,168
I am looking for family and community engagement for this family group.

2027
05:17:48,269 --> 05:17:52,792
So whether that's a work group or, you know, whatever you want to call it, it doesn't matter to me.

2028
05:17:52,872 --> 05:17:53,993
I'm happy to be involved in it.

2029
05:17:54,033 --> 05:17:55,014
I'd like to be involved in it.

2030
05:17:55,495 --> 05:17:58,097
And I'd like it to happen, you know, by the end of May.

2031
05:18:00,045 --> 05:18:05,268
for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member... Can I just ask a question?

2032
05:18:05,308 --> 05:18:06,789
Member Graham.

2033
05:18:07,469 --> 05:18:17,475
So I guess I certainly would like to see that meeting happen, but I don't think it's reasonable for it to happen before the end of May.

2034
05:18:17,495 --> 05:18:19,896
And specifically,

2035
05:18:21,057 --> 05:18:28,720
there is a tremendous amount of rebuilding work that has to happen in order to put the staff in place to even enact the the votes that we just took.

2036
05:18:29,821 --> 05:18:31,061
It is also budget season.

2037
05:18:31,341 --> 05:18:47,087
I haven't heard what our budget numbers are so I have to imagine that will be like a broad scale massive scramble because it is the end we are approaching the middle of April at this point and we haven't you know we we haven't as a committee discussed the budget at all.

2038
05:18:47,628 --> 05:18:47,808
So

2039
05:18:49,509 --> 05:19:10,968
I just I would like to make sure that the administration can make good on the directive the policy directives that we just provided around pay increases and more importantly the hiring that we think it will enable because we need to know sooner rather than later if that doesn't work.

2040
05:19:11,668 --> 05:19:12,970
So we need

2041
05:19:13,650 --> 05:19:22,314
There to be some prioritization of these activities so that we don't find ourselves heading into September without answers to this question.

2042
05:19:22,334 --> 05:19:29,018
And I think we need to give the administration the space to actually act on the policy directives that we've just issued so.

2043
05:19:29,678 --> 05:19:33,302
I'm completely on board with having a listening session.

2044
05:19:33,322 --> 05:19:37,187
I think Miss Fiddler-Carrie is perfectly capable of doing that.

2045
05:19:37,407 --> 05:19:48,100
I understand it here in Medford that there is a strong feeling that if you want something done, you must talk to the superintendent and the superintendent alone to get something done.

2046
05:19:48,740 --> 05:19:59,247
And I do look forward to a day where that is not the general feeling about how things get done in Medford, because I think the staff is much, much, much more capable than that.

2047
05:19:59,848 --> 05:20:09,854
But in the meantime, if we are insistent that that happens, I think we need to give the administration the space to make sure that this meeting occurs.

2048
05:20:11,015 --> 05:20:18,578
perhaps before the start of the next school year so that they can actually do the work we've just asked them to do.

2049
05:20:19,799 --> 05:20:27,742
I anticipate more than one meeting between now and the beginning of the school year on this topic with a variety of stakeholders including members of the community.

2050
05:20:27,762 --> 05:20:37,126
So I don't want anyone to think that we're going to have check a box by sitting down at the table having a conversation and say well you know good thing we we talked to those people that the school committee told us to.

2051
05:20:37,146 --> 05:20:40,627
I mean there are a lot of stakeholders and constituents that have a lot at stake

2052
05:20:41,135 --> 05:20:43,036
in these strategic decisions that have to be made.

2053
05:20:43,616 --> 05:20:45,477
And I think I appreciate Ms.

2054
05:20:45,497 --> 05:20:47,998
Graham, that more plausible timeline.

2055
05:20:48,439 --> 05:21:01,185
And I think that we will be able to engage with them on an authentic basis to have the conversations so that we can, the administration can continue to keep the committee informed as to what are the implications to some of these decisions.

2056
05:21:01,505 --> 05:21:05,707
And ultimately the school committee has to decide what you feel is best for the community.

2057
05:21:05,747 --> 05:21:07,408
But I anticipate we'll be,

2058
05:21:07,946 --> 05:21:11,868
there'll be a robust engagement on this in the coming months.

2059
05:21:14,870 --> 05:21:15,191
Mayor.

2060
05:21:15,711 --> 05:21:17,192
Member Graham.

2061
05:21:17,312 --> 05:21:33,402
Can I also suggest that before we wrap in the month of June, that we get an update on this activity so that we know if we're well positioned to head into September or if we have additional problems we need to solve.

2062
05:21:34,912 --> 05:21:35,632
Member Van de Kloot?

2063
05:21:36,193 --> 05:21:38,314
Yeah, I was actually going to suggest the same thing.

2064
05:21:38,334 --> 05:21:47,898
I think, Mike, my initial concern is we need to make sure that we're giving our administrative people space to do the budget.

2065
05:21:48,878 --> 05:21:52,380
But this clearly needs to be in the mix.

2066
05:21:53,681 --> 05:22:01,144
The one thing about this topic is we've got to, this isn't one where there's opposition or we're at loggerheads.

2067
05:22:01,484 --> 05:22:02,865
We all want the same thing.

2068
05:22:03,585 --> 05:22:04,785
We want this to happen.

2069
05:22:04,925 --> 05:22:11,007
Everyone here, I have no doubt, wants this to happen in a positive way for our families.

2070
05:22:13,188 --> 05:22:15,388
Yeah, that's definitely obvious.

2071
05:22:16,049 --> 05:22:18,709
Thankfully, we've been able to add the 60 spots.

2072
05:22:18,769 --> 05:22:21,390
The admin worked very hard over the last week or two.

2073
05:22:21,410 --> 05:22:27,772
And I know they want to continue to add those spots, but let's get people hired and figure out a plan moving forward.

2074
05:22:28,332 --> 05:22:30,873
And I'm sure we'll add as many as we can, depending on the space.

2075
05:22:31,705 --> 05:22:35,428
and personnel and how it plays out over the next few months.

2076
05:22:37,089 --> 05:22:40,432
Member McLaughlin, and then let's move on.

2077
05:22:40,752 --> 05:22:46,196
We have another few pages to go and I know everybody's a bit tired, go ahead.

2078
05:22:48,458 --> 05:22:56,044
So I would like some idea of what the process is gonna be for getting feedback from the families.

2079
05:22:58,105 --> 05:22:59,546
So I made a motion that we

2080
05:23:00,697 --> 05:23:06,679
have some process by which we're getting feedback from the families for the before school and after school program.

2081
05:23:07,579 --> 05:23:12,640
And I appreciate that we all have a lot to do in the next couple of months with budgets.

2082
05:23:12,700 --> 05:23:20,342
And I also appreciate that families are putting a lot of thought into this and clearly I know that the rest of my colleagues do as well.

2083
05:23:20,402 --> 05:23:22,363
And so whether it's end of May or in June,

2084
05:23:22,843 --> 05:23:31,190
not really, you know, I want to make sure that we're getting data from families, that we're understanding what it is their experience is.

2085
05:23:31,310 --> 05:23:32,831
I know we've heard from some of them tonight.

2086
05:23:32,951 --> 05:23:39,397
We haven't certainly heard from all of them and, you know, what this will look like, whether it's with, you know, Megan.

2087
05:23:39,697 --> 05:23:42,959
And I don't, I never said that the superintendent had to be at this either.

2088
05:23:43,020 --> 05:23:45,782
I think the superintendent certainly will get feedback from her staff and

2089
05:23:46,202 --> 05:24:14,130
you know we can come back around but we've had round tables we've had discussions this is clearly an ongoing issue and I think that this is something that we need to have a discussion over that's not at 10 30 at night um you know in bits and pieces so I'd like to move the motion forward I'm sorry what I just what what is no we're just waiting for a second and I don't know if I don't know if there is one is there so

2090
05:24:17,168 --> 05:24:17,428
Mayor?

2091
05:24:17,848 --> 05:24:18,808
Yes, Member Vendaclute.

2092
05:24:19,129 --> 05:24:25,050
I fully support that we want to make sure that we are talking to parents and engaging with parents.

2093
05:24:27,711 --> 05:24:37,353
Whether we need a formalized process right now, I'm just trying to say, you know, I think we have a pretty good idea of what the issues are.

2094
05:24:38,434 --> 05:24:46,716
Personally, we've got a very active, engaged group of parents who have, you know, clearly been able to make their voices heard and their

2095
05:24:47,296 --> 05:24:48,236
express their concerns.

2096
05:24:49,437 --> 05:24:59,180
You know, there's nothing, Melanie, you're sure we can vote on your thing, but I don't want to formalize process and say we're going to have this survey and that survey and whatever.

2097
05:24:59,261 --> 05:25:04,923
I don't know exactly what it is that you want, that we're not

2098
05:25:07,017 --> 05:25:08,839
I'm responding to short.

2099
05:25:09,099 --> 05:25:11,120
We can't trust our staff to do.

2100
05:25:11,140 --> 05:25:14,303
I trust our staff is going to talk to these people.

2101
05:25:14,864 --> 05:25:15,664
I have no doubt.

2102
05:25:15,784 --> 05:25:21,149
I don't think that it's a matter of trust through the chair to member Van de Kloot.

2103
05:25:21,209 --> 05:25:25,973
I think it's a matter of structure and putting things in place so that it actually happens.

2104
05:25:26,033 --> 05:25:32,278
And what I heard from families tonight is that, you know, they were wondering why they weren't, you know,

2105
05:25:32,974 --> 05:25:37,019
incorporated into the presentation tonight they were wondering why they didn't have feedback on that tonight.

2106
05:25:37,719 --> 05:25:44,667
And I think that we hear this a lot from families and then we hear that they are going to be spoken with or you know this will happen.

2107
05:25:45,088 --> 05:25:46,549
And what I'm looking for is something.

2108
05:25:47,551 --> 05:25:58,015
a little bit more concrete that families know that there's actually going to be a session where more families can come at a reasonable time and share their concerns and those concerns can be documented.

2109
05:25:58,035 --> 05:26:07,519
We could collect data on them and we can have that to inform our decisions moving forward, not just with relation to pay, but to all of the other issues that we heard tonight.

2110
05:26:09,400 --> 05:26:16,603
Or we could just put a motion on the floor that this is a great, great first step and we're gonna continue the conversation

2111
05:26:17,794 --> 05:26:25,997
internally and externally with parents to try to do all we can to create as many spots as possible before the next school year.

2112
05:26:26,077 --> 05:26:28,978
I mean, that's what the admin has been trying to do.

2113
05:26:29,078 --> 05:26:38,121
And within the last two weeks, they've created 60 spots and I have faith that they're gonna do everything they can to create as many as they can.

2114
05:26:38,141 --> 05:26:41,962
As we responsibly can, I guess would be the one to qualify.

2115
05:26:42,122 --> 05:26:43,683
Responsibly, safely, yes.

2116
05:26:45,075 --> 05:26:47,796
And there are, there's a lot of complexity to that.

2117
05:26:47,816 --> 05:26:51,697
I would say, and I think this is known, and I appreciate Ms.

2118
05:26:51,797 --> 05:26:52,758
McLaughlin's and Ms.

2119
05:26:52,798 --> 05:27:03,621
Banneker's comments about the having trust that the administration will do this, but we are engaged with families on a variety of matters on a daily and sometimes hourly basis.

2120
05:27:04,081 --> 05:27:07,543
I think that's a critical component of our job as district leaders.

2121
05:27:07,903 --> 05:27:14,825
And certainly at the building level, principals are communicating with and engaging with families all day,

2122
05:27:15,341 --> 05:27:27,805
every day to make sure that we're being responsive to the needs of the community and making sure that we are putting the needs and priorities of the community in the context of what is best for students, which is ultimately what we're charged with doing.

2123
05:27:28,185 --> 05:27:31,787
And so I think that this will be an instance in which we will continue that engagement.

2124
05:27:32,147 --> 05:27:33,607
We will continue that communication.

2125
05:27:33,967 --> 05:27:44,591
We will certainly update the school committee prior to the conclusion of the school year as to where those conversations stand and any challenges that we're potentially encountering.

2126
05:27:45,068 --> 05:27:56,335
But frankly, that would be the case whether this presentation was made tonight and whether the advocacy that was exhibited was exhibited.

2127
05:27:56,675 --> 05:28:04,641
We as an administration have a responsibility to keep an open door and to keep that engagement happening on a continuous basis.

2128
05:28:05,061 --> 05:28:08,843
And that will be the case for parents who have voiced concerns.

2129
05:28:09,384 --> 05:28:13,466
And also it will be the case for parents and family members who haven't voiced concerns.

2130
05:28:13,826 --> 05:28:14,707
And for whatever reason,

2131
05:28:15,197 --> 05:28:19,038
aren't positioned to be able to advocate on behalf of their children.

2132
05:28:19,178 --> 05:28:31,261
Our obligation is to engage with those families as well, to hear their concerns, to try to be responsive, but always to put the needs of students first in terms of our strategic decision-making and recommendations to this committee.

2133
05:28:31,301 --> 05:28:37,122
So I fully expect that that will happen in the remaining months of this school year, over the summer, throughout the next school year.

2134
05:28:37,522 --> 05:28:40,823
And for as long as we are charged with

2135
05:28:42,988 --> 05:28:44,489
of serving this community.

2136
05:28:44,509 --> 05:28:45,769
That's just part of the job.

2137
05:28:45,829 --> 05:28:48,890
There's nothing terribly unusual about this, frankly.

2138
05:28:49,150 --> 05:28:50,191
Point of privilege, Mayor.

2139
05:28:50,631 --> 05:28:51,391
Just keep going.

2140
05:28:52,391 --> 05:28:53,432
Point of privilege, Mayor.

2141
05:28:54,372 --> 05:29:01,774
So I understand this, but what we're hearing is that we're hearing from some folks who are saying, we do family engagement all the time.

2142
05:29:02,134 --> 05:29:03,415
We've been doing family engagement.

2143
05:29:03,435 --> 05:29:04,655
Our family engagement is great.

2144
05:29:04,995 --> 05:29:05,636
Our door is open.

2145
05:29:05,656 --> 05:29:09,977
And then we're hearing from other folks who are saying, you're not including us, and we want to be part of the conversation.

2146
05:29:10,317 --> 05:29:31,461
And the motion that I've asked to put forward is that before the end of the school year, I'm willing to make it so that it's not May, but the motion that I've asked to put forward is that before the end of the school year, we have a listening session with families about the before and after school program so that we can collect data from families about what their needs are above and beyond this school committee meeting.

2147
05:29:31,601 --> 05:29:33,542
That is what I'm asking for in my motion.

2148
05:29:34,462 --> 05:29:34,862
Thank you.

2149
05:29:34,882 --> 05:29:36,582
And I'd like to move the question, please.

2150
05:29:36,983 --> 05:29:37,343
Thank you.

2151
05:29:40,311 --> 05:29:41,011
is on the floor.

2152
05:29:50,316 --> 05:29:52,357
There is no second of the motion.

2153
05:29:52,757 --> 05:29:53,737
I'm sorry, Melanie.

2154
05:29:55,038 --> 05:29:55,378
Mayor?

2155
05:29:56,139 --> 05:29:57,159
Member Graham?

2156
05:29:59,080 --> 05:30:05,143
Through the chair to Member McLaughlin, I just want you to know that this was the primary substance of

2157
05:30:05,935 --> 05:30:13,758
the conversation in the strategic planning roundtables for two nights in a row at the elementary school level, which is the group that I led.

2158
05:30:13,898 --> 05:30:18,120
So we actually did talk very extensively.

2159
05:30:19,320 --> 05:30:19,500
Ms.

2160
05:30:19,520 --> 05:30:20,321
Galussi was there.

2161
05:30:21,461 --> 05:30:25,084
both nights, I believe the superintendent was in and out as she was with all the groups.

2162
05:30:25,144 --> 05:30:38,352
So I do want to make sure that you know, because we couldn't all be in all of those groups, that that was happening in our subgroup amongst a bunch of other dialogue.

2163
05:30:38,572 --> 05:30:43,915
So we have done some of that work already.

2164
05:30:45,961 --> 05:30:51,243
But I would definitely encourage the superintendent and Ms.

2165
05:30:51,263 --> 05:31:08,330
Fidler-Carey and Mr. Murphy to reach out to some of these parents and engage with them further because they may, you know, they just may have perspective that helps solve problems a different way than in school administrators are thinking about.

2166
05:31:09,490 --> 05:31:17,434
I don't know, maybe half of them want to spend two days a week working in the afterschool program and they create staffing for us that we just don't know about yet.

2167
05:31:17,514 --> 05:31:22,277
So I do want you all to do that.

2168
05:31:22,837 --> 05:31:29,400
I just think the logistics of a big meeting may not be the most effective way to do that.

2169
05:31:29,460 --> 05:31:35,584
So I do want to defer to the superintendent and her team about the most effective way for them to collect this feedback.

2170
05:31:36,384 --> 05:31:38,245
We'll absolutely have those meetings and report back.

2171
05:31:39,858 --> 05:31:40,198
Thank you.

2172
05:31:40,218 --> 05:31:44,602
If there's no further questions we have.

2173
05:31:45,683 --> 05:31:50,767
May I just like to ask, through the chair, I'd like to say thank you to member Graham for that information.

2174
05:31:51,187 --> 05:31:54,690
And this is when it would be helpful to have data from the feedback session.

2175
05:31:54,770 --> 05:32:05,039
So I'm assuming that we were gonna be getting data from the round table session so that we understand what the feedback was at the elementary level, because we weren't all able to be in the different sessions.

2176
05:32:05,079 --> 05:32:06,740
So that would be very helpful.

2177
05:32:07,000 --> 05:32:07,400
Thank you.

2178
05:32:07,420 --> 05:32:09,202
Okay, thank you.

2179
05:32:11,437 --> 05:32:18,380
Yeah, it was referenced in the minutes that we received tonight.

2180
05:32:19,401 --> 05:32:23,142
And I was in the elementary meeting on the second night.

2181
05:32:23,282 --> 05:32:25,763
So I did hear the parents extensively.

2182
05:32:26,064 --> 05:32:28,645
And I realized that you weren't able to be there.

2183
05:32:29,265 --> 05:32:32,907
So that may be why we've got a slightly different perspective than you.

2184
05:32:37,449 --> 05:32:37,509
OK.

2185
05:32:38,653 --> 05:32:38,973
Thank you.

2186
05:32:39,013 --> 05:32:40,855
Thank you for the parents that are on and that spoke.

2187
05:32:40,955 --> 05:32:41,335
We hear you.

2188
05:32:41,455 --> 05:32:42,015
We hear you.

2189
05:32:42,035 --> 05:32:45,217
I thank the administration for doing this work and continuing the work.

2190
05:32:46,538 --> 05:32:48,620
Next up, we have old business.

2191
05:32:48,900 --> 05:32:51,162
Go to the order offered by member McLaughlin.

2192
05:32:53,683 --> 05:33:02,229
I'm going to table that and ask that we include that as part of the agenda for the next meeting so that it's not old business, but it's rather part of the agenda.

2193
05:33:02,249 --> 05:33:03,070
That's what the motion is.

2194
05:33:03,090 --> 05:33:05,992
It's supposed to be a monthly aspect of our agenda.

2195
05:33:06,112 --> 05:33:06,472
Thank you.

2196
05:33:07,138 --> 05:33:12,980
Motion to table by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Rousseau.

2197
05:33:13,040 --> 05:33:13,641
Roll call.

2198
05:33:20,583 --> 05:33:21,304
Member Graham?

2199
05:33:21,784 --> 05:33:22,064
Yes.

2200
05:33:23,545 --> 05:33:24,165
Member Kretz?

2201
05:33:24,545 --> 05:33:24,785
Yes.

2202
05:33:26,866 --> 05:33:27,926
Member McLaughlin, yes.

2203
05:33:28,026 --> 05:33:28,767
Member McStone?

2204
05:33:29,007 --> 05:33:29,347
Yes.

2205
05:33:31,448 --> 05:33:32,868
Member Rousseau?

2206
05:33:33,949 --> 05:33:34,189
Yes.

2207
05:33:35,069 --> 05:33:35,910
Member Van de Kloot?

2208
05:33:36,570 --> 05:33:36,770
Yes.

2209
05:33:37,598 --> 05:33:38,359
Mayor Longo-Karn.

2210
05:33:40,380 --> 05:33:42,241
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2211
05:33:43,242 --> 05:33:46,664
Motion to table has been approved.

2212
05:33:47,365 --> 05:33:49,186
Number 11, communications.

2213
05:33:49,726 --> 05:33:50,827
I don't believe we have any.

2214
05:33:51,708 --> 05:33:53,829
We've handled five and a half hours of communication.

2215
05:33:55,470 --> 05:33:57,492
Number 12, new business.

2216
05:33:57,512 --> 05:34:03,195
Do you wanna do this tonight or you wanna move it to the next agenda?

2217
05:34:03,215 --> 05:34:06,938
Can we do the first one tonight?

2218
05:34:08,307 --> 05:34:09,508
for the first one tonight, okay.

2219
05:34:11,349 --> 05:34:15,933
Resolution in support of expedited COVID-19 vaccinations for students.

2220
05:34:18,355 --> 05:34:29,103
Whereas of April 12th, 2021, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over 30.4 million individuals in the United States and resulted in more than 551,638 deaths across the country and 17,185 in Massachusetts.

2221
05:34:35,172 --> 05:34:48,120
Whereas our strong public education system, which is essential to the individual and community well-being of our society, is facing unprecedented challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of clear national, state, and local directional resources.

2222
05:34:48,721 --> 05:34:58,507
These challenges include, but are not limited to, the academic and social emotional toll on students, as well as the need to rapidly pivot to distance learning, clean and equip

2223
05:34:59,238 --> 05:35:21,658
school facilities to adapt to new health protocols and social distancing, assess and address the risks to teachers, staff, and students, whereas vaccines have proven to be the most effective strategy to reduce and eliminate the spread of infectious disease and are an important and necessary tool for eradicating disease and vaccines are anticipated to be approved for use for some school-aged children in the coming weeks.

2224
05:35:24,923 --> 05:35:34,325
Whereas the current Commonwealth vaccine distribution system created access issues for eligible residents that could create greater access disparities among school-aged children.

2225
05:35:34,345 --> 05:35:53,708
And whereas the Medford Public Schools is committed to the health and safety of its students and staff, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee, number one, calls on the state legislature, the governor, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, create a vaccine rollout plan for school-aged children that puts the distribution in the hands of local officials and eliminates

2226
05:35:54,248 --> 05:35:57,870
accessibility barriers to students and their families.

2227
05:35:58,050 --> 05:36:06,275
Number two, calls on the Massachusetts Association of School Committees to publicly advocate for local control of vaccine distribution for school-age children.

2228
05:36:07,196 --> 05:36:21,765
And three, directs the district superintendent to transmit official copies of this resolution to the following, the commissioner of DESE, the governor of Massachusetts, Senator Warren, Senator Markey, Congresswoman Clark,

2229
05:36:22,375 --> 05:36:29,899
Senator Jalen, Representative Donato, Garbaly, and Barber, and the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

2230
05:36:31,460 --> 05:36:33,841
Offered by Member Graham and Member Rousseau.

2231
05:36:34,102 --> 05:36:36,283
Is there a motion on the floor with a second?

2232
05:36:39,705 --> 05:36:40,565
Motion to approve.

2233
05:36:41,606 --> 05:36:43,907
I move to approve.

2234
05:36:44,107 --> 05:36:45,808
Seconded by Member Rousseau.

2235
05:36:47,009 --> 05:36:47,389
Roll call.

2236
05:36:51,998 --> 05:36:52,658

Yes.

2238
05:36:54,459 --> 05:36:55,039

Yes.

2250
05:37:06,581 --> 05:37:08,142
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2251
05:37:08,182 --> 05:37:09,262
The motion is approved.

2252
05:37:09,282 --> 05:37:14,603

2256
05:37:23,705 --> 05:37:23,965
Mayor.

Member Rousseau.

2258
05:37:26,287 --> 05:37:29,129
Is this a table to a date specific or just table?

2259
05:37:30,109 --> 05:37:30,950
For the next agenda.

2260
05:37:31,771 --> 05:37:32,131
Thank you.

2261

Yes.

2264

2265
05:37:39,536 --> 05:37:39,776
Yes.

Yes.

2268

Member

2269
