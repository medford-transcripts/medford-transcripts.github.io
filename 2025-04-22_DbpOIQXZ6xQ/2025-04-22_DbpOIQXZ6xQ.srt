1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:04,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Justin Tseng, and I'm proud to serve as your city councilor in the city I've always called home.

2
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:08,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the son of immigrants who came to Medford chasing the American dream.

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:16,256
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents stretched every dollar and raised me paycheck to paycheck, but it was our public schools, our neighbors, and this community that gave us everything.

4
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:19,957
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past four years, I've worked to give back and to pay it forward.

5
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:24,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as national politicians gamble with our economy and threaten our neighbors,

6
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford needs steady hands and bold leadership.

7
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:30,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll always stand up for you because Medford stood up for me.

8
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:34,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the past four years, we haven't just made progress, we've made history.

9
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:41,230
[SPEAKER_00]: While some leaders are busy banning books and turning neighbors against each other, we're building a city that welcomes everyone and works for all of us.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,073
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made record investments in our schools and passed laws to protect our neighbors and our freedoms.

11
00:00:46,753 --> 00:01:00,541
[SPEAKER_00]: While politicians in Washington and on Beacon Hill continue to cater to big money interests and leave us priced out and left behind, we're passing once-in-a-lifetime reforms to make housing more affordable, spur local business growth, and lead the fight against climate change right here at home.

12
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is rocky enough.

13
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is to smooth the path.

14
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,154
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fixing roads and sidewalks that haven't been touched in decades.

15
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:13,820
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought back bus routes that families rely on because getting to work, school, or the doctor shouldn't depend on owning a car.

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're making City Hall more transparent and accessible so residents have a seat at the table.

17
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when national leaders fail us, Medford steps up.

18
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:28,791
[SPEAKER_00]: We prove that by leading with heart, with vision, and with the courage to do what's right, we can achieve results for all of us.

19
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,493
[SPEAKER_00]: But the job's not done yet.

20
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:35,438
[SPEAKER_00]: More than ever, we need leaders who know this community, and who show up and listen day in and day out.

21
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm running for re-election.

22
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:41,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep building a Medford that works for you, me, and our neighbors down the street.

23
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving Medford forward together.
