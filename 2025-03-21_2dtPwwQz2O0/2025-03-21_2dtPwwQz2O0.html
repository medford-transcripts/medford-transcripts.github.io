    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=52.669s">Please</a>  join the Medford City Council and all rise for a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=60.675s">in</a>  Paris this past weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=76.759s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor CAVIOLLO. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=82.061s">The</a>  Committee of the Whole, if I can just report on the Committee of the Whole meeting held this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=91.347s">at</a>  six o'clock in the council office, uh, to address the issues, uh, regarding the Shepard Brooks estate, an update on, uh, the goings on on the property and a, um, uh, consideration of, uh, some of the issues surrounding the request for the loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=114.311s">Uh,</a>  the, uh, committee has asked that the paper remain in paper and in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=120.609s">However,</a>  they have asked for three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=125.452s">One,</a>  a report from the budget director's office for expenditures from the city of Medford on the Shepard Brooks estate for the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=135.279s">Two,</a>  that the fire chief report to the city council in writing on an outline of the parameters <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=146.612s">and</a>  requirements he has for upgrades of the road to the Sheppard Brooks Estate, and also a cost estimate from the city engineer on that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=161.497s">And</a>  then three, that the director of public health, Karen Rose, report to the council on what restrictions or requirements might be to mitigate the present <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=176.163s">uh,</a>  sewage system up on the property and also to report back to us on, uh, requirements and restrictions, uh, on, uh, the property, uh, because of the presence of lead paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=193.015s">Did</a>  I get that all councils? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=194.816s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=197.298s">Uh,</a>  madam vice president.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=198.699s">Thank</a>  you, president Delaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=199.6s">So</a>  if we could have a paper waiting for, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=202.357s">our</a>  new mayor, just to ask the intentions of the Brooks Estates moving forward, some sort of master plan, obviously, in the scheme of the rest of the capital improvements we need to make, just so we know what to invest in, how to invest in it, and how we're going to move forward.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=218.2s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=218.66s">I</a>  should have had that on the notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=219.821s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=220.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=221.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=222.281s">So,</a>  motions, orders, and resolutions, <a href="../resolutions/15-749.pdf"><font color="green">15-749</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=225.042s">Motion</a>  for suspension of the rules, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=230.203s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=231.883s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=233.784s">The</a>  reason I asked to suspend the rules, Mr. President, is to take the tabled papers from last week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=237.446s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to take the tabled papers from last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=242.589s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=243.569s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=244.29s">Whoa,</a>  whoa, whoa. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=245.831s">What</a>  papers?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=247.091s">The</a>  papers that you- Can we take them one at a time, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=249.252s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=249.793s">I'd</a>  like to move first, Mr. President, with the DPW loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=253.615s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=254.015s">Mr.</a>  President, may I, on that motion?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=256.496s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=257.816s">Last</a>  week, the motion was laid on the table because we did not receive anything as it related to what we were spending $300,000 on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=264.418s">I</a>  believe the council's request was to have a paper in our hands as we view it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=268.639s">We</a>  did not receive anything this past week till today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=270.739s">So</a>  I'm going to move that that paper lay on the table until we get a written explanation of what the $300,000 is needed for, for the department of public works.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=279.681s">Before</a>  we entertain that motion, we're going to entertain the motion to take the papers <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=284.455s">off</a>  the table for consideration.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=285.696s">I'm</a>  going to take them one at a time and move to separate papers, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=292.121s">On</a>  the motion of Council and Knight to take loan order 15-737 for the DPW facility project off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=303.751s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=305.472s">I</a>  move the motion that the paper lay on the table until we get what the council asked for last week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=311.718s">We're</a>  going to take it off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=314.8s">The</a>  chair is in doubt whether to take the matter off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=320.923s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=321.263s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll to take the matter off the table.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=324.345s">Mr.</a>  President, to be perfectly clear, it's kind of clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=328.308s">The</a>  council voted last week to lay it on the table pursuant to council rules until we get an explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=332.91s">We</a>  have not received anything in writing as we asked for.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=335.692s">So</a>  I think I think on the roll on whether to take it off the table or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=339.894s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[hFAk--zIv7g_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=341.736s">Councilor</a>  Camuso, Councilor Cabrera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=344.278s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=345.378s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=346.079s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=346.959s">Vice-President</a>  Monk-O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=353.143s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=354.624s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=355.485s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=356.125s">Councilor</a>  Pantano. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=356.786s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=358.206s">President</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=359.407s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=359.828s">With</a>  a vote of five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent, the paper is before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=365.411s">The</a>  paper was already tabled for the purpose of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=369.213s">We</a>  had the vehicle of information before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=371.982s">So</a>  now the paper is before us on that motion, Mr. President, on that motion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=375.663s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=376.684s">I</a>  mean, how do you explain to anyone who's watching or sitting out here when you ask for information, you lay it on the table for specific purpose and you still haven't got your purpose resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=386.867s">How</a>  can you even entertain it going further?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=388.528s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=391.829s">Councilor</a>  Knight, a review of the minutes from last week's meeting would not indicate that the council requested anything other than enacting rule number 20 to motion to table it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=399.117s">I</a>  believe, Mr. President, to be quite candid, if you go back and review the tape, the council is quite clear, and nobody objected to getting the information to be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=406.323s">And</a>  besides, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=407.885s">It's</a>  a $300,000 item. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=410.427s">It's</a>  a $300,000 item that you're asking this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=413.269s">It's</a>  quite obvious if this council is going to continue to go on, starting in January, nothing's going to change around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=418.074s">You</a>  people are going to have no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=419.775s">You're</a>  just going to take someone who comes to the podium and makes a presentation without any discussion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=424.741s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=427.342s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken, Mr. President, Ann Baker was before the council representing the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=433.566s">And</a>  this body asked, where is the paperwork behind each and every one of the three loan audits? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=439.309s">And</a>  she had nothing to provide us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=441.29s">And</a>  that was what I remember why the issue was tabled until we got some information back to the council on why do we want to borrow money that the taxpayers are going to have to spend? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=453.176s">I</a>  think that's a logical request. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=455.873s">to</a>  ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=457.054s">So</a>  I have yet to receive anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=458.455s">I</a>  don't know if my other colleagues have.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=462.097s">Point</a>  of information, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=464.919s">I,</a>  too, agree with Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=466.279s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=467.82s">But</a>  at the same time, we have somebody here who could educate us on the two loan orders that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=473.043s">If</a>  we need to table it further to request more information, I will be happy to put that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=478.807s">But</a>  while she's here, I'd like to hear what has to be said.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=483.529s">Quite</a>  reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=485.304s">So</a>  the paper is before us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=488.766s">The</a>  paper is before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=489.526s">Why</a>  don't we invite Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=490.266s">Miller</a>  up to explain to us this loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=493.568s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=500.891s">That's</a>  a question for the solicitor, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=502.392s">No,</a>  no, it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=503.552s">Please,</a>  don't try to twist the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=505.173s">We</a>  have two separate people making a presentation on the same paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=509.175s">And</a>  again, with all due respect to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=512.256s">Miller,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=515.75s">Where's</a>  the information that the council asked for? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=517.911s">You</a>  have three members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=519.531s">I</a>  can't answer for anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=520.932s">Three</a>  members have spoken up waiting for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=524.333s">So</a>  I just think this is the tempo is being set for what's going to happen here in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=530.474s">Nothing</a>  is going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=531.815s">Nothing.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=534.516s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=534.736s">Miller,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=539.697s">Louise</a>  Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=540.437s">I</a>  live in Needham, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=546.068s">We</a>  have before us the matter for the City Yard, 15-734, loan order for the DPW facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=557.095s">Could</a>  you present to us what this is about and why it's before us today?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=562.819s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=570.041s">Oh,</a>  my apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=570.982s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=572.043s">Were</a>  you forwarded the request that information be forwarded to this council ahead of time?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=576.906s">I</a>  did not receive that request.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=581.73s">Unbelievable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=582.691s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=583.752s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=585.193s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=585.393s">Miller,</a>  if you would continue.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=587.455s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=587.695s">So</a>  there were two phases to the DPW construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=590.877s">The</a>  first phase was the remediation of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=594.46s">There</a>  had been contaminated soil on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=596.322s">And</a>  the second phase was the building of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=600.622s">When</a>  we had put the budget together for the two phases of the project, we had budgeted $500,000 for the remediation and redevelopment of the site, and we had budgeted $12,394,000 for the building of the new DPW building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=612.124s">The</a>  remediation and redevelopment actually cost $975,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=628.388s">which</a>  was $475,000 over what we had budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=633.449s">When</a>  the bids came in for the DPW building, they were favorable, and including all change orders, the total cost of the building was $12,214,000, which leaves us with a deficit of approximately $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=644.812s">That's</a>  where the $300,000 came from.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=658.422s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=660.202s">I</a>  was just wondering if I can ask, has all the furniture arrived within the DPW that was audited?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=666.764s">I</a>  believe all the furniture that was ordered has arrived. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=669.064s">We're</a>  still ordering a few shelves here and there, but I believe everything else has arrived.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=674.005s">So</a>  everything that was on audit has been received?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=676.806s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=677.646s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=679.526s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=681.347s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=684.11s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=685.391s">Can</a>  you tell us where the $300,000 is owed to? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=688.374s">Is</a>  it a certain contractor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=689.715s">Is</a>  it multiple contractors?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=691.596s">No,</a>  it's just a single contractor, GNR Construction Company, and we're in the process of closing out the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=697.461s">We're</a>  finishing up certain warranty issues, and this would be, you know, close out all payments.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=704.227s">And</a>  through the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=706.34s">We</a>  have millions of dollars in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=708.702s">Has</a>  that been thought of to use free cash rather than go out to bond on something that we've already bonded quite enough on?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=716.089s">That's</a>  actually the mayor's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=718.011s">And</a>  the mayor has chosen to go out to bond for the $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=721.674s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=729.622s">You</a>  all set, Madam Vice President? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=731.023s">For</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=731.563s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=731.903s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=732.303s">This</a>  concerns on that yard right now that there's leaks in the roof and the air conditioning and the heating system is not consistently working correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=738.986s">Where</a>  is the city's position on that and the contractor?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=741.407s">Um,</a>  actually we're still working with the contractor and all the subcontractors to get the final issues resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=748.23s">So</a>  the contractor has come back out and looked at the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=751.551s">I</a>  don't understand exactly what the construction is, but apparently it's not unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=756.122s">during</a>  the first few months for this to occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=758.423s">So</a>  they've come back out and they're fixing leaks in the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=762.525s">And</a>  the controls are being adjusted for the heat and the air conditioning.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=770.409s">This</a>  building isn't even a year old. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=772.77s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=773.47s">And</a>  it already has leaks in the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=775.291s">It's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=777.152s">More</a>  importantly, most importantly, if there's problems that still exist, why would you want to be paying this company off until their problems are fixed?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=785.758s">We</a>  haven't paid them off yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=787.68s">We're</a>  withholding money at this point, but we're going to, at some point, need to pay the contractor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=793.785s">How</a>  much are you holding back?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=795.346s">We're</a>  holding back approximately $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=797.167s">How</a>  much? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=798.608s">Well,</a>  that's just $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=802.492s">Yes,</a>  that is correct.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=803.412s">So</a>  what do you need the money for now, then? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=804.693s">Why</a>  don't you wait until they do what they're supposed to do?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=807.175s">We</a>  do anticipate that everything will be taken care of in the next couple of weeks.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=812.757s">A</a>  good business approach would be to make sure that the job is done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=816.738s">Why</a>  would you want to pay them before the job is finished?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=819.139s">We're</a>  not paying them before the job is finished, but under the law, once they give us their final invoice and we accept the building finally, we only have 14 days to pay them, the contractor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=830.663s">But</a>  how can you say within 14 days if you still have the leak and you have air conditioning and heating system problems?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=836.185s">We're</a>  not going to pay them until we're satisfied, but we do need <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=840.75s">the</a>  funds in place so that we are able to pay them?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=845.191s">Well,</a>  I'm going to concur with my colleague, Councilor Langel-Curran. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=847.752s">I</a>  would not bond another thing in this city and put the city into any further debt when you're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=854.694s">You</a>  spent almost, not you, the city has spent almost $14.5 million to build that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=860.716s">It</a>  isn't even a year old and it's already leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=863.417s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=864.317s">You</a>  try to tell us that to the common person on the street <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=866.751s">and</a>  they're going to tell you there's something wrong with how the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=868.672s">Look</a>  at that ceiling over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=869.773s">It's</a>  going over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=871.414s">Two</a>  years you got holes in the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=874.016s">And</a>  you came in here and I believe you indicated it's going to cost the city in excess of a million dollars to do the roof and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=880.12s">Where's</a>  that money going to come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=882.101s">Hope</a>  you're not going to bond for that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=883.702s">You</a>  know, the problem around here is that this administration has gotten away with it for way too long with not bringing the council in on issues such as this that have an extreme effect upon this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=896.245s">An</a>  extreme effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=898.886s">More</a>  importantly, it's the lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=901.447s">You</a>  just sat there and rattled off numbers that I couldn't keep up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=904.309s">You</a>  had the numbers there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=905.289s">We</a>  didn't even get a piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=906.53s">I'm</a>  going to move to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=907.39s">Lay</a>  on the table, Mr. President, until further notice, until we get further information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=911.352s">Motion</a>  to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=914.613s">Hold</a>  up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=915.253s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=916.834s">If</a>  you want to ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=919.235s">Motion</a>  has been withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=921.176s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=953.917s">director</a>  or commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=955.678s">He</a>  is supposed to be reporting issues that are reported to him by the men and women who are in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=965.365s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=966.666s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=968.027s">Is</a>  there a designated person?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=976.695s">DPW</a>  commission is just going to go off of what's reported to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=979.836s">I</a>  think my concern stems from the warranty that had to do with the fire station repairs and the lack of foresight and ability to go after the warranty with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=993.358s">So</a>  with regards to, is there a designated person that's going to go through that building inch by inch to make sure that everything was done correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1001.359s">So</a>  in a half year, year, two years, we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1006.037s">that</a>  it was done properly and we're not going to have to expend any more money than what we have expended already.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1013.099s">So</a>  that was what the architect did do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1017.501s">They</a>  came up with a punch list, which I understand to be complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1020.562s">And</a>  then after that, it's a matter of the people who are in the building to report if there are any further issues.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1030.268s">So</a>  through the chair, if I could ask that each individual sub-department head within the DPW go through their section of that building to report to Commissioner Geer and the architect with their findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1046.781s">My</a>  concern is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1048.38s">you</a>  know, nobody's actually reviewing the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1051.181s">They're</a>  just, Oh, we have a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1052.681s">Let</a>  me report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1053.382s">Do</a>  you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1054.982s">I</a>  understand what, I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1056.783s">So</a>  we've been trying to work on that meeting with, um, the DPW weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1061.184s">Actually</a>  I have, and I've walked through the building a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1065.245s">The</a>  last time I walked through was last week, um, with what I understand are the last issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1071.527s">So</a>  there were two roof leaks that were reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1074.488s">There</a>  was an issue with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1076.621s">controls</a>  and controlling the temperature within the building as well as it's like a heating vent unit that seems to be leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1087.927s">So,</a>  and it's really not unusual to have issues with new construction, especially on a building this size and of this scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1098.432s">And</a>  I called the president of the company who did the building myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1104.183s">And</a>  they were going to report back to us this week or early next week.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1109.507s">And</a>  with regards to the punch list, how many things are on the punch list to go through?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1114.39s">At</a>  this point, it really is just adjusting the controls. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1119.614s">There</a>  are some small issues still with those very large doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1124.257s">Again,</a>  it's a control electrical type of issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1127.879s">And</a>  the roof leaks as they're appearing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1134.04s">I</a>  would suggest that not only do we have department heads go through that building, but we also have somebody from the building department to go through it in depth to create their own list to make sure that what we paid for was done correctly, so that, you know, this $300,000 is the last that we spend for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1151.793s">Obviously,</a>  my frustration is coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1153.634s">We</a>  have the issue with the fire department, you know, spent over a million dollars, and there was problems that, you know, we weren't going after through the warranty. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1163.214s">I</a>  don't want to be here two years from now with more requests for a leaky roof when it should have been fixed before this $300,000 is given to the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1173.042s">That's</a>  my concern.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1174.484s">This</a>  amendment will die when this paper is tabled.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1179.688s">If</a>  we can make that a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1184.032s">If</a>  I can make that a separate motion after the separate paper.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1188.135s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1189.917s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1192.623s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1194.844s">The</a>  question I had was, you broke it down by the cost of the building and also the cost of the remediation that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1202.788s">And</a>  it seems, regarding the cost of the building, we came under budget, which is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1209.992s">But</a>  how did we and what company did we use? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1213.093s">How</a>  did we come almost 100 percent off of the remediation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1217.155s">To</a>  me, that's, you know, I could see 10, 20 percent on a building project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1221.308s">When</a>  you're talking 100%, where was the mess up in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1225.129s">And</a>  what needed to take place that they didn't account for to double the remediation?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1231.33s">So</a>  the remediation was actually removing the contaminated soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1234.771s">And</a>  borings that had been done indicated a certain depth of contaminated soil, which turned out to be deeper and more widespread than we had originally anticipated.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1246.233s">Now,</a>  who did we pay to do that work?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1248.514s">The</a>  engineering firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1249.654s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1250.961s">Brown</a>  and Caldwell was the engineering firm that did that part of the work for us and designed the cleanup.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1257.663s">So</a>  what recourse do we have as a city to go back to someone we paid, we hired them to do a detailed study, and then the study is inaccurate and cost us double the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1269.866s">What</a>  recourse do we have as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1271.626s">Are</a>  we exploring what options we have?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1275.147s">With</a>  this particular project, because it was an environmental cleanup, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1278.748s">I</a>  am not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1279.909s">We</a>  can certainly look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1282.57s">But</a>  environmental contamination, as I understand it, is extremely difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1287.733s">It's</a>  difficult to predict exactly where all the contaminants are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1291.876s">And</a>  here we were trying to remove all of it so that the site is being closed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1296.958s">There</a>  are no contaminants.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1298.599s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1299.26s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1299.96s">That's</a>  why we pay a company that's a professional company that does that for a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1304.443s">And</a>  if that was my home and I had to pay double what I paid <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1308.761s">an</a>  expert to tell me what the cost was going to be, you know, there'd be some concern there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1314.023s">So</a>  I just hope the city doesn't, you know, let this go by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1318.305s">And</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that we get a response back from the city solicitor, because, in my opinion, you know, that's why we bring in these outside consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1328.89s">That's</a>  why we pay them hefty bills to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1335.343s">We're</a>  safeguarded as a community, because we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1337.964s">What</a>  if that mushroomed into a $3 million remediation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1341.785s">Who</a>  would foot the bill then? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1343.345s">We</a>  would still foot the bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1345.066s">So,</a>  at some point, I think, you know, we have to turn around and say, I don't know what legal recourse we have, but I know in other building projects, and I can't remember who we got that information from, but the typical margin is, I think, 10 or 20 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1361.551s">And</a>  to have 100 percent, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1363.598s">Is</a>  this far exceeds any standard, uh, that I'm aware of.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1368.902s">So</a>  the city solicitor is going to, uh, investigate.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1374.547s">I</a>  don't, I don't see how we can approve this right now asking for additional money when, uh, you know, we hide, I'm sorry, that company Brown and Caldwell, uh, they're a nationally known company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1385.88s">to</a>  come in and give us an estimate, tell us how deep the contaminants are, the width, and I'm sure that's all involved in the reporting, and they were off considerably. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1397.047s">I</a>  mean, you know, I don't, you know, I think, I agree with my Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1401.17s">I</a>  think, Councilor Petra, I think we should lay this on the table for another week, get some more answers on this, even ask the mayor to consider taking this out of free cash, because there's millions of dollars in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1412.617s">He</a>  may have told you personally that <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1414.77s">He</a>  wasn't going to do that, but maybe it should come from the council saying, hey, we'd like you to use free cash on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1419.956s">But</a>  I really believe that this could be a legal matter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1424.822s">Maybe</a>  all it takes is the city solicitor writing him a letter and saying, are they aware that the cost overruns? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1431.069s">Yes,</a>  they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1432.21s">And</a>  what was their response?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1435.408s">I'm</a>  sorry, I actually don't recall exactly what they responded, but there were issues that came up during the removal of the soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1442.112s">We'll</a>  have to go back and look at the file and I can come back.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1445.995s">What</a>  do they say? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1446.795s">If</a>  I was a contractor, someone came to me and said, hey, this is an overrun of a double what we anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1453.679s">I'd</a>  have to give some type of response. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1455.701s">It</a>  wouldn't be tough luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1457.262s">I</a>  mean, I mean, so I think we have to look at this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1460.344s">And</a>  I would agree with my council colleague, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1463.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1464.128s">Counsel</a>  Max chair recognizes council care of yellow.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1467.089s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1467.309s">Mr.</a>  President, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1468.47s">Um,</a>  on what council Max brought up, do we have a contract with a brown cover?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1472.991s">Yes,</a>  we did.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1474.192s">What</a>  did their contracts say for the scope of work they were going to do for that?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1479.534s">Um,</a>  at, they were designing the remediation and the closeout of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1485.576s">They</a>  also supervise the removal of the soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1489.438s">And</a>  then there was a cost associated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1490.839s">I</a>  don't have the contract in front of me, but that was basically what the contract was for the DPW building.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1495.143s">But</a>  they specified that the contamination was within a certain area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1499.907s">And</a>  once they started to work, they found that the contamination.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1503.13s">Yeah,</a>  they just gave us a cost estimate of what the soil remediation would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1507.293s">And</a>  we developed budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1508.594s">And</a>  yeah, that's just where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1511.056s">The</a>  estimate was under what we actually ended up expending.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1516.24s">You</a>  mentioned about the warranty of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1518.919s">Does</a>  the warranty of the building start when we actually take possession of the building or are we already under the warranty now?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1525.604s">Um,</a>  I believe we're under the warranty. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1527.225s">There</a>  was substantial completion and the building was accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1530.967s">I</a>  thought you said we don't have a final certificate of occupancy.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1535.65s">I</a>  thought you said we, we don't pay until we accept the building.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1539.553s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1539.833s">We</a>  don't have a final certificate of occupancy, so we have not paid the contractor, but the warranties are going to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1547.43s">from</a>  substantial completion date on the particular property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1551.552s">So</a>  the different warranties are running from different periods of time, depending upon what they are.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1555.315s">When</a>  does the warranty expire?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1556.956s">One</a>  year from whatever the date is in the document.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1560.198s">So</a>  we're almost out of warranty, correct?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1562.279s">Oh</a>  no, we are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1564.0s">I</a>  can get you the exact date.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1566.241s">We</a>  open the building like May? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1569.536s">Yes,</a>  but they were still working on the building.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1571.817s">We</a>  didn't move into the building at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1575.617s">So</a>  I'd have to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1576.638s">I'll</a>  have to get you the date.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1578.178s">I</a>  mean, I would feel comfortable if the warranty started on the day we actually took possession, which would be when we make our last final payments, rather than have the warranty start if it's a building we haven't accepted yet.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1593.861s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1595.082s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Panetta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1597.181s">Some</a>  interesting points here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1598.582s">Number</a>  one, the contract to build a building, was that an estimate by the contractor?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1605.124s">No,</a>  that was an estimate by the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1608.045s">They</a>  were two different firms.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1609.446s">Listen,</a>  the building cost over $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1612.287s">The</a>  cost to remove that soil was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1613.928s">It</a>  wasn't an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1614.948s">It</a>  was a cost that Brown and Caldwell gave to the city of Medford and signed a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1619.31s">Now,</a>  this is really interesting for you guys and girls that are coming in next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1623.072s">Brown</a>  and Caldwell also happens to be the same people that are going to do the spot in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1627.068s">and</a>  the city's own parking lot over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1628.868s">So</a>  if this is an example of their estimation of what needs to be done, the city really needs to take a hard look as to whether they're figures and whether they're really as good as they're supposed to be as good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1640.651s">Now,</a>  if there's a time sequence and there is a damage clause in there that basically says that they're going to do this for the city at a particular cost, is there anything in the contract that says if they find something that was unanticipated or unexpected, then there would be a cost overrun to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1657.061s">Those</a>  are the words you need to look at to see if they're in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1659.743s">And</a>  if it's not in there, and if they're just giving you a document that says this is the cost overrun, well, the city shouldn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1666.149s">It's</a>  like you go to the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1667.03s">You</a>  see something on sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1668.051s">Whatever</a>  the sale is, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1669.532s">If</a>  they mismarked it, shame on the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1671.874s">They</a>  mismarked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1672.615s">I</a>  mean, this is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1674.877s">Think</a>  about this, Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1675.918s">This</a>  is, you know, this does not make any sense.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1681.564s">What</a>  happens is Brown and Caldwell designs and plans for the contamination, then gives us an estimate of the cost of the remediation.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1691.586s">Did</a>  they do a sample survey?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1693.187s">Yes,</a>  they did.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1693.887s">And</a>  if they did the sample survey, they must have dug down into the ground to see how deep and how far they had to go to get that dirt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1701.149s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1701.729s">So</a>  why should the city of Medford now have to be paying for that for which they couldn't anticipate on? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1707.261s">Think</a>  about it, OK?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1708.622s">No,</a>  I understand what you're saying.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1710.023s">And</a>  that's totally unfair to the taxpayers of this community who have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1713.625s">I'm</a>  going to stick to my original thing, that the paper lay on the table until these questions, these legal questions, get answered.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1719.029s">Is</a>  that a motion?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1719.829s">Yes,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1721.39s">On</a>  the motion that this paper be tabled, undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1726.113s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1727.294s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1727.674s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1729.175s">The</a>  paper's tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1730.496s">We're</a>  going to take that up with the papers in the hand of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1734.038s">Is</a>  that all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1735.079s">So</a>  we can do it as? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1736.18s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1737.017s">I</a>  have it written down for myself and the Madame Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1742.121s">Is</a>  that satisfactory, Madame Vice President? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1745.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1747.385s">We</a>  are taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1752.869s">We've</a>  got these two more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1754.03s">15735,</a>  loan order on the Carriage House, Brooks Estate, $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1766.201s">That's</a>  going to stay in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1769.664s">Uh,</a>  that was still on the table though. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1771.285s">It</a>  was never sent into committee on the motion to take a 15, 7 35, uh, from the table, uh, to off the table and then to the committee of the whole, all those in favor, all those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1794.315s">15-736,</a>  loan order on Winthrop Street draining project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1800.858s">Before</a>  us to report on this matter is Louise Miller, Director of Procurement, Budget, Finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1808.381s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1808.581s">Miller.</a> </p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1810.402s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1810.922s">So</a>  this is for $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1814.064s">So</a>  this project was the Winthrop Street rotary and drainage project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1822.436s">which</a>  was a complex project with multiple funding sources, and there was an estimate for each funding source, and they did not divide up as we anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1834.0s">So</a>  our Chapter 90 reimbursable expenses ended up being under budget, left us short with our sewer, INI, and capital funding budget, and leaving us with a net deficit of $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1852.105s">In</a>  addition, in this instance, the engineering firm didn't do what they were supposed to under the contract in terms of the borings so that the contractor found ledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1871.111s">After</a>  they started doing the work, it slowed down the project and cost the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1879.918s">Some</a>  pipes that had to be moved, some of the work had to be done by hand, additional police details. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1887.36s">And</a>  the total cost, there were conflicts with some unmarked duck bank and the ledge, which added quantities to rock that had to be removed and additional police details. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1902.445s">So</a>  in this instance, we have already spoken with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1908.15s">We</a>  are pursuing the engineer for breach of contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1913.593s">We</a>  anticipate recovering a certain amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1917.116s">And</a>  because we anticipate this is going to litigation, I don't want to get too much into the details of where we are, what position we're in.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1927.242s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1933.126s">Doesn't</a>  a company such as this have to put up a bond? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1936.065s">Don't</a>  they have to put up a bond? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1938.047s">The</a>  people that are doing business with the city?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1939.989s">The</a>  construction company does, but there was nothing about their work that was not done according to construction standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1951.259s">The</a>  engineering firm, on the other hand, does not need to put up a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1955.663s">Instead,</a>  they have insurance.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1957.565s">Was</a>  the engineering company a subcontractor to the contractor?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1960.306s">No,</a>  they're separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1961.667s">The</a>  engineering firm and the contractors are always separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1963.947s">We</a>  have two different contracts with the firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1966.388s">The</a>  contractor goes out to bid after the engineering firm designs the project.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1971.87s">So</a>  who are we paying the $350,000 to?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1975.292s">Well,</a>  this is for the additional costs as a result of the issues that came up during the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1982.775s">So</a>  the cost would go to the contractor, but we're trying to recover some of it <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1987.075s">from</a>  the engineering firm.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1988.617s">But</a>  you also indicated that Chapter 90 funds were underfunded.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1992.02s">Well,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1992.68s">There,</a>  we just misestimated.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1995.363s">Who</a>  misestimated them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1996.464s">We</a>  did? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1997.225s">We</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1997.545s">The</a>  city did.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1998.245s">We</a>  did?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1998.946s">Yes,</a>  we did.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=1999.447s">And</a>  who was supposed to take that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2001.569s">Who</a>  misestimated?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2003.49s">Just</a>  our staff.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2004.571s">But</a>  who? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2004.852s">We</a>  misestimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2005.492s">What</a>  department? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2009.303s">I'd</a>  like to know.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2009.843s">Well,</a>  because it goes through a number of different eyes.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2014.326s">Somebody</a>  had to submit the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2016.387s">Who</a>  submitted the number, Louise?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2018.728s">I'm</a>  going to take responsibility as a budget director for whatever numbers needed to be done for the city.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2023.351s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2023.611s">Louise,</a>  it's not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2024.191s">It</a>  had to be a department that was responsible for this.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2028.733s">Yeah,</a>  purchasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2029.734s">It's</a>  me.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2032.055s">What's</a>  purchasing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2035.717s">City</a>  engineer's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2037.531s">Somebody</a>  had to put these numbers together, Chapter 90.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2039.411s">Yep,</a>  we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2040.872s">We</a>  put the numbers together.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2042.472s">So</a>  who is this conclave of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2044.893s">I</a>  mean, listen, understand something here, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2048.954s">You're</a>  being too honest by not being honest enough, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2052.135s">You</a>  have a job and I have a job to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2053.775s">My</a>  job right now until the end of this year is to make sure how these monies are spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2057.876s">And</a>  if somebody mis-estimated in their job, misappropriated or whatever it might, misfunded, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2063.428s">This</a>  council needs to know what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2065.649s">That's</a>  the problem around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2066.789s">Nobody</a>  wants, everybody hides everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2068.589s">Everything</a>  is hush-hush. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2070.01s">If</a>  it was misappropriated or mis-underfunded, what department did it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2073.971s">Maybe</a>  they need help in estimating, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2077.532s">Maybe</a>  we need someone to go out to these departments when jobs like this take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2082.153s">Now,</a>  we all know this was a complex job because I saw it every day when you went to, and I saw a lot of the ledge and everything that was going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2088.974s">But</a>  the Chapter 90 funds, that comes from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2091.876s">They</a>  give you a dollar amount, and that's it.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2093.737s">Yes,</a>  it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2094.897s">And</a>  I actually was part of conference calls with Chapter 90 regarding what portion of the drainage they would pay for versus paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2104.42s">And</a>  because of the way the drainage was, they agreed to pay a certain amount, which we thought was more than what we actually expended on the drainage, as opposed to what really is water and sewage.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2117.765s">How</a>  much money came from Chapter 90 in this?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2120.786s">I'll</a>  have to, um, I have to look that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2123.247s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2123.647s">This</a>  was almost a $3 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2126.208s">I</a>  want to say it was close to a million dollars.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2128.269s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2128.869s">And</a>  that's the city of Medford sending in that estimate, correct?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2133.711s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2134.071s">With</a>  our estimated quantities and chapter 90, what they do is they just review it and tell us whether these are eligible costs or not.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2140.573s">And</a>  so somebody from the city had to send that in.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2145.615s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2148.678s">I</a>  would just hope next year things are really done different around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2154.283s">This</a>  is really unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2156.805s">You</a>  do a project, and what's underestimated, and what's underestimated, what's overestimated, what's coming in, what's going in? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2163.27s">And</a>  then we're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash, $7 million in an enterprise fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2168.995s">We</a>  haven't seen anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2170.796s">Why</a>  isn't the money even coming out of the enterprise fund for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2173.418s">It's</a>  a water and soil project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2175.06s">Why</a>  are we even bonding for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2178.296s">Again,</a>  it's the administration's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2180.797s">Again,</a>  I would hope the Council takes a hard look at this and just saying, hey, you know, the water rates are almost off by $2 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2188.199s">And</a>  I hope that's corrected in some shape, manner, or form, and that the taxpayer doesn't have to pay for it because you're sitting on $7.5 million of a surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2195.12s">Here's</a>  another $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2196.601s">And</a>  God knows, if the engineers has any brains, we'll probably file bankruptcy, and you'll never see a dime from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2203.903s">This</a>  is just a shame, Mr. President, because <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2206.106s">This</a>  is what you get for having a lack of communication, a complete lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2211.329s">We're</a>  finding out at the end of the tunnel, not in the beginning or during the middle of it while it's being worked upon, at the end of the fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2217.252s">Now,</a>  when did you get this bill for $350,000?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2222.355s">We</a>  did become aware of cost overruns during, obviously, while the project was taking place.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2228.978s">Like</a>  when? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2230.039s">July,</a>  August? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2230.419s">Last</a>  summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2231.379s">Last</a>  summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2232.62s">Here</a>  we are, November 17.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2237.176s">So</a>  one thing I will say at the time, we did think we were going to try to reappropriate excess funds that we have in our MSBA projects, but those have not closed out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2246.698s">So</a>  we were going to come to council and ask for the loan or to be transferred from the loan, be transferred from one project to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2254.3s">Unfortunately,</a>  we're still working on closing out the paperwork for those projects and those came in under budget.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2266.141s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2267.642s">I'm</a>  going to move eventually to table this paper as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2270.324s">I</a>  truly feel that we need a written explanation, not only a cost breakdown of the $3 million, but at the very least, a cost breakdown of the overages of the $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2280.432s">I</a>  appreciate Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2282.954s">Miller</a>  being here before us, but I feel like just throwing out police details, ledge, rock, removed, borings is not a good enough explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2291.461s">I</a>  would not be able to explain to the taxpayer <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2294.363s">why</a>  we're taking either $350,000 from free cash or going out to bond for $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2298.244s">I</a>  don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2301.565s">I</a>  don't think it's fair to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2303.826s">And</a>  I thankfully got a quick call from the mayor today, but it's at the last hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2309.628s">It's</a>  not a detailed explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2314.129s">It's</a>  just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2315.65s">It's</a>  not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2317.971s">How</a>  much in police detail? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2319.911s">How</a>  much additional ledge had to be removed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2322.702s">What</a>  pipe, what piping needed, how much piping needed to be relocated? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2327.203s">When</a>  we, I get a call today and we, and they knew about the override, you know, the overages, I believe summer of 2014 or 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2337.445s">I</a>  mean, I didn't know, I don't even know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2342.166s">Whenever</a>  the project was under construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2344.766s">Well,</a>  it started in 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2345.907s">So</a>  we've known, you know, this is the, as of last week, it's the first time I've known of any $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2353.732s">additional</a>  expense for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2355.694s">It's</a>  a lot of money, so that's $650,000 in overages for projects, two projects that were done within the last year and a half in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2367.522s">I</a>  really hope that there's more oversight to projects that are done in the future, and I hope that we can start getting written explanations to things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2378.886s">For</a>  us to be scrambling — you know, I wanted to hear what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2380.847s">Miller</a>  had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2381.507s">I</a>  want to — I want the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2383.208s">But</a>  for me to be scrambling, trying to find paper to take notes on so that I can explain to somebody who reaches out to me tomorrow, what did you vote on? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2390.991s">And</a>  I say, some details, some ledge, some borings, pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2393.952s">It's</a>  just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2395.793s">We</a>  — we are elected by the taxpayer.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2401.955s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may, just for the record today, I understand you're going to be requesting for — <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2407.287s">further</a>  information, but I did have some detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2409.348s">It</a>  was $155,000 for the conflict with an unmarked duck bank and a water main relocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2418.211s">There</a>  were $80,000 in additional police details and $97,000 in additional quantities of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2426.874s">I</a>  didn't work out all the, down to the final tens of thousands, but those were the three big items.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2441.754s">Louise,</a>  she said something very, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2444.396s">Did</a>  you hear what she said? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2446.837s">She</a>  said she got a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2448.478s">Let</a>  me ask everyone around this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2449.838s">Did</a>  you all get phone calls? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2452.24s">You</a>  know, this is how this building has been operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2454.361s">It</a>  picks and chooses whatever it wants, when it wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2457.242s">It</a>  is so terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2459.323s">And</a>  I would just hope the new administration doesn't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2462.084s">Pick</a>  you off one at a time, get your full votes and see you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2464.706s">And</a>  goodbye. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2465.84s">That's</a>  the most despicable way to run a government.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2469.403s">It's</a>  terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2470.464s">Thank</a>  you, Counsel, for your point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2472.245s">Chair</a>  recognizes Counsel Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2474.047s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2475.068s">Louise,</a>  are we seeking full restitution from the engineering firm?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2479.972s">Yes,</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2483.515s">But</a>  I estimated what we would actually recover.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2489.56s">And</a>  I can— I'm sorry, could you repeat that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2493.673s">I'm</a>  sorry, could you repeat that, Louise?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2495.334s">Under</a>  that's a litigation, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2497.094s">Louise,</a>  I'm sorry, could you repeat that?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2498.615s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2500.635s">If,</a>  in fact, the matter is something that's going to go into litigation, I think that we need to err on the side of caution and not disclose too much in terms of what our litigation position is, our litigation strategies at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2510.739s">I</a>  think we've raised enough questions here for us to understand that the paper's not going to go through tonight, it's not going to pass tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2516.181s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2516.361s">Millers</a>  gave us a breakdown of what looks like $155,000 for <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2520.073s">replacement,</a>  a main replacement, $80,000 for police details, $90,000 for materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2523.736s">So</a>  we have some understanding, but we need to have more understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2526.397s">I'm</a>  just very concerned if, in fact, we owe the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2529.099s">We're</a>  going to have to pay the money sometime to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2531.781s">The</a>  question is whether or not we're going to be able to recuperate it and how much we're going to be able to recuperate back during the separation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2537.245s">And</a>  I'd be very cautious in compromising our position in separation moving forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2543.629s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2545.678s">You</a>  know, the overruns are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2547.518s">We</a>  need to find out what they're for, what they're from, and that's OK and fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2549.999s">But</a>  we also need to protect our interests, and we need to protect our position in litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2554.18s">So</a>  with that being said, I rest, and I thank you, Councilor, for allowing me to make the point.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2558.101s">I</a>  was just asking if we were seeking full restitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2560.822s">Yes,</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2562.482s">In</a>  the event that full restitution is not made to us, would the Water and Sewer Enterprise account, would this project fall under that?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2574.842s">I</a>  think some portion of it could.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2577.344s">So</a>  just say, for instance, we only recounted 150. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2579.805s">We</a>  can maybe take it from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2581.707s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2582.227s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2585.029s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2585.349s">Councilor</a>  Canfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2586.75s">I</a>  think a citizen wants to speak behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2592.274s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2593.835s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2594.795s">Hi,</a>  my name is Michael Wajiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2596.076s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2598.518s">Um,</a>  there's a couple of points I want to, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2600.728s">that</a>  it's sort of floating in the air right now that's very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2603.91s">The</a>  first is just a general lack of transparency that's available to us as citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2608.954s">If</a>  six members of the people that we elect to actually review these documents aren't receiving the documents within a year and a half, we have to ask, how could the average citizen ever find this out? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2623.984s">How</a>  could the average citizen ever find out that we have all of these overrides? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2627.726s">That's</a>  the first point I wish to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2630.104s">The</a>  second point I wish to make is about mistakes and how we handle mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2633.906s">I</a>  think it is poisonous for us to make mistakes and then just say, oh, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2639.208s">Let's</a>  just go out to bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2641.089s">It</a>  is not how we handle our errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2645.391s">When</a>  we do make mistakes, it's like free money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2647.212s">We</a>  just go fishing in bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2648.872s">If</a>  we actually have to take the money out of our general fund, then we'll actually feel it versus some future date that's going to be thrown down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2659.824s">We</a>  have to ask ourselves, is this a general trend? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2662.605s">Maybe</a>  it's a one-time mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2663.765s">Maybe</a>  it's $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2665.946s">It</a>  happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2668.247s">Projects</a>  do go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2670.247s">Maybe</a>  this is just a one-time thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2671.328s">But</a>  haven't we seen this reoccurring over and over and over again? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2675.189s">I</a>  ask the council to respectfully avoid using the easy motion of just simply going out to bond when we make mistakes like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2686.712s">We</a>  have to start paying for them, because then we'll actually start feeling them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2689.845s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2697.528s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2697.948s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushion Street, Bedford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2702.47s">I</a>  have a question for the chair, for the budget director, Louise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2711.294s">This</a>  talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2714.582s">floating</a>  a bond to pay for some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2718.046s">Knowing</a>  that the United States national debt is over $18 trillion, I'd like to ask her a question through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2727.376s">And</a>  that is, what is the total 0 to 155 for method bond debt as we speak today in 2015, please?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2750.976s">So</a>  the total interest balance as of July 1, 2015, is approximately $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2761.16s">And</a>  the total principal balance as of July 1, 2015, is approximately $60,800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2773.522s">That's</a>  a total outstanding balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2775.223s">But</a>  those are not what our payments are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2778.344s">Our</a>  payments are obviously much less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2781.345s">That's</a>  just a total outstanding debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2784.707s">Is</a>  that the question?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2788.909s">If</a>  you could repeat that, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2790.51s">Miller.</a> </p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2793.611s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2796.212s">The</a>  total principal balance outstanding is approximately $60 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2804.042s">$800,000,</a>  and the total interest balance, and I'm rounding as I add these up, is approximately $15,650,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2813.129s">Sixteen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2813.93s">He</a>  asked for the total amount that was outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2830.362s">The</a>  document that I have includes the three loan orders, so they have to be backed out of the total.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2839.764s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2840.324s">Miller.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2841.204s">Chair</a>  awaits a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2846.305s">On</a>  the motion of council, appended to table the, uh, paper until we receive further information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2852.686s">Your</a>  questions will be added with the, uh, papers in the hand of the clerk.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2856.559s">written</a>  responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2859.341s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2863.483s">So</a>  we'll, we'll have a chance to adjust that as we, as I read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2867.446s">So</a>  on that motion to table, all those in favor, all those opposed make this table on motion of council night to revert back to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2874.911s">All</a>  those in favor, all those opposed 15-seven 49 motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2882.588s">Be</a>  it resolved the city council meet with the chief of police and city solicitor to craft an ordinance banning replica handguns in public places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2891.633s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2892.653s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2894.014s">And</a>  thank you for entertaining this resolution this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2897.776s">Recently,</a>  the city of Boston on November 9th had signed into law the banning of replica handguns in public places as an effort to provide our police officers <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2907.971s">with</a>  safer streets to work in, in an effort to provide our children with an understanding that the use of replica handguns are relatively dangerous in public places, and to protect the citizenry from the use of replica handguns in criminal activities, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2927.419s">On</a>  November 9th, Mayor Walsh signed this local ordinance in the city of Boston into effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2934.361s">On</a>  November 10th, in the city of Medford, a gentleman was arrested for brandishing a replica handgun in a road rage incident on Mystic Avenue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2941.423s">So</a>  I think it's safe to say that the city of Medford is not exempt from these type of actions and from the harm that can be caused by replica handguns in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2951.446s">In</a>  this packet that I put together and had the messenger distribute to my <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2954.9s">Council</a>  colleagues, I've put together a couple of different materials relative to other communities that have done this, not here in Massachusetts, but across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2962.882s">And</a>  when I take a look from the back forward, you'll see Dallas, Texas has an ordinance that restricts and regulates the use of replica handguns in public places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2972.425s">You'll</a>  see that Beaverton, Oregon has similar laws in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2976.767s">You'll</a>  see that Minneapolis, Minnesota has similar laws that are in effect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2981.628s">New</a>  York City has actually gone a step further and has <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2985.393s">required</a>  that the sale of imitation guns in colors such as black, blue, silver, or aluminum is prohibited in New York City. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2991.318s">And</a>  those stores are not able to carry those in New York City. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=2994.46s">So</a>  I think that this is an ability for us to sit down and to help make Medford a safer place for our police officers, for our children, and for the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3003.387s">So</a>  Mr. President, I'd ask that the consulate detain this motion to vote in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3007.753s">to</a>  have a meeting with the chief of police and the city solicitor to craft an ordinance that will work best for Medford in keeping our residents and our police officers and our children safe.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3016.058s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3016.478s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3020.08s">Did</a>  you wish to speak on this item before us, sir, before we call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3023.001s">Yes,</a>  Council President, I would like to.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3025.303s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3025.943s">My</a>  name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3030.906s">Turn</a>  on your Saturday morning cartoons and you see guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3035.468s">You</a>  see cartoon characters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3037.602s">brandishing</a>  guns, and you go into your toy store and you see guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3043.287s">So,</a>  on one hand, we have kids using replica guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3047.13s">On</a>  the other hand, we now want to ban them in public places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3051.433s">Last</a>  year, there was a box cutter on that windowsill for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3056.017s">There</a>  was a dirty steak knife on a box outside for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3059.76s">It</a>  was my magazine, my proactive work that got the knife and the box cutter removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3066.225s">But</a>  we've had the police up here when two politicians were arguing outside just a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3072.588s">I</a>  was talking about the, um, that bill that passed the question one and there were two politicians out there fighting and the police had to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3080.211s">You</a>  come to a city council where police are a constant presence and there are knives out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3086.674s">I</a>  would ask that this city councilor who puts this motion forward would better clean up his backyard first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3091.807s">before</a>  he comes up with these cockamamie ideas, start being proactive, not reactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3097.132s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3097.633s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3102.818s">Please</a>  state your name and address.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3104.299s">Jean</a>  Martin, Tate Coming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3105.86s">I'm</a>  actually in favour of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3108.123s">You</a>  know, what happened 20 years ago is not what goes on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3113.114s">Unfortunately,</a>  kids can't play with guns the way I grew up playing with guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3118.779s">Fake</a>  guns look real today, and if I was a police officer, you can't take that chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3123.924s">Unfortunately,</a>  you can't take that chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3126.146s">There's</a>  too many on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3128.368s">And</a>  at one time, I had a BB gun, and I gave it up because it looked too real. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3132.921s">And</a>  I wanted to pick off some squirrels, but I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3138.187s">I</a>  called the appropriate authorities to have them come out of my attic, but I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3142.471s">But</a>  I gave up my BB gun because it looked so real, and with my reputation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3147.696s">But</a>  I didn't want anybody thinking that I was dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3151.66s">But</a>  it is not the times that we used to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3156.478s">So</a>  I just want to say that I support this, because you can't take that chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3161.561s">Unfortunately,</a>  and parents need to make their kids aware of it, that they look too real. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3166.804s">And</a>  you have to err on the side of caution sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3169.886s">And</a>  that might lead to a death when it's just a toy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3172.488s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3173.348s">On</a>  the motion of council, if I may, the data would reflect that this is not cockamamie at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3178.791s">But</a>  otherwise, in the city of Boston, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3182.136s">Between</a>  January 2014 and April 2015, replica firearms were used in at least 113 incidents that included assault and battery, robbery, drug dealing, destruction of property, breaking and entering, and home invasion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3194.358s">That's</a>  according to police department data. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3197.759s">And</a>  also, during the 2014 school year in the city of Boston, 15 replica guns were seized in the public schools, and this year, 13 have been seized. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3206.74s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I definitely think there is a need for us to take a look at this, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3213.501s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3218.805s">I</a>  just would make one amendment to give the Councilors time to review the ordinance and review the packet that we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3224.969s">Possibly</a>  change the language to meet with the Chief of Police and City Solicitor to begin discussion and possibly draft and craft an ordinance banning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3234.035s">Just</a>  to give us, you know, rather than say we're 100% for it or against it in the resolve, I'd like, you know, time to, you know, to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3241.562s">review</a>  the actual ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3242.582s">I</a>  think it's about four or five pages long, which we just got tonight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3245.663s">So</a>  those materials, none of the materials included in the packet or a draft ordinance in terms of what I'm looking for the city to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3254.865s">I</a>  think that this is going to be best done to sit down with our chief of police and to craft something that he feels would be right for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3262.246s">Um,</a>  what I included in here was just an illustration of other communities that have done this going back to 2007 and <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3267.257s">I</a>  included a copy of Dallas, Texas's ordinance just because it was very surprising to me to see a state like Texas and a community like Dallas actually putting restrictions on anything that shoots anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3276.884s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I thought that that was one of the reasons why this would be very helpful to show that it doesn't just happen in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3283.489s">It's</a>  a problem in Oregon, it's a problem in California, a problem in Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3286.771s">If</a>  it's a problem in other places across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3289.815s">We're</a>  not going to be exempt from it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3291.456s">So</a>  I think it's a proactive approach to addressing an issue that really hasn't cropped its head up in our city too much, but we have seen it within the last two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3298.758s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3301.94s">Hi,</a>  you wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3302.94s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3303.34s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3305.381s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3306.601s">Uh,</a>  Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street, uh, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3311.203s">Uh,</a>  while it's important for the topic of safety, if we're looking at other cities and towns across the nation and what they do, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3318.914s">The</a>  town of Kennesaw, Georgia, actually passed a law that required all households to have at least one firearm and ammunition on hand, and it dropped the crime rate in that town to practically nonexistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3338.429s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3339.49s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3342.793s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3344.828s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3346.669s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3352.913s">Yes,</a>  it was as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3354.414s">Councilor</a>  Penta, you wish to speak on this before we call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3357.796s">I</a>  don't know if the intent of the resolution is to ban any type of a handgun or a replica of a handgun.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3370.318s">The</a>  intent of the resolution is to craft an ordinance that would work for the City of Medford that would be similar to what the City of Boston has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3376.4s">If</a>  you look at the City of Boston's ordinance, Mr. President, a minor in a possession of a replica firearm in a public place, the replica firearm would be confiscated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3384.702s">It</a>  would be brought back to the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3386.322s">The</a>  minor would have to come back with their parent to receive the weapon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3390.283s">If</a>  it's confiscated from an adult, the adult has a 24-hour cooling off period. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3394.09s">before</a>  they're allowed to receive the replica firearm back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3398.452s">There</a>  are certain controls and requirements like an orange tip and green tape or paint on it to make it stand out so that police officers can discern these toy guns from real guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3411.058s">I</a>  mean, the last thing that we want to hear in this community is that a police officer is involved in a shots fired call with somebody that has a replica or a toy gun in their hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3421.247s">Also,</a>  if you look at some of the statistics and the data, and I don't have them in front of me here, Mr. President, but based on my remembrance from the research I did, there's a thing that's called suicide by co-op. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3430.391s">And</a>  in 48 percent of the instances of unarmed individuals, they considered them unarmed individuals because they had replica guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3438.494s">They</a>  weren't real guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3439.594s">But</a>  yet, the police executed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3442.955s">Not</a>  executed them, but used deadly force to stop the threat, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3446.437s">But</a>  in those situations, they determined that those people were unarmed because they had no <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3450.627s">real</a>  firearm, but rather a replica gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3452.248s">So</a>  I think that the intent of the resolution is to sit down with the chief of police, to sit down with members of this council and our solicitor, to come up with a legally sound resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3461.771s">I</a>  mean, an ordinance that would absolutely and positively protect our community here in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3467.013s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3468.273s">Councilor</a>  Penta, are you all set?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3469.473s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3470.254s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3470.694s">The</a>  difference between having a replica gun and the appearance of a replica gun are like night and day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3477.676s">The</a>  state of New York made it very imperative <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3480.638s">The</a>  colors are black, silver, I think dark blue, and there was four dark colors that they, aluminum, they would prohibit toy manufacturers from making guns like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3489.544s">But</a>  you could still have a gun that looks like a gun, but it could be in a different color. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3494.447s">And</a>  they believe there's a $300,000 fine that's attached to a gun manufacturer who makes a gun with those colors on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3504.113s">I</a>  think what you really need to take a look at is you're not banning it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3507.615s">What</a>  you're doing is you're controlling whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3510.456s">Now,</a>  Councilor Knight just alluded to the fact that a black gun, I believe a black gun, the way the standard was, had to be painted orange by the nozzle, by the barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3519.121s">And</a>  what some of these kids are doing is they're painting it black to match the gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3521.942s">Now,</a>  that puts a policeman in a very, you know, compromising position. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3525.884s">He</a>  doesn't know if that gun is going to be real, fake, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3529.326s">And</a>  I think that's one of the concerns that have been brought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3532.048s">But</a>  I think New York sort of like went about it the right way, because what they did in New York, as I said, they took a color and they made it iridescent, flashy, whatever it has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3540.358s">If</a>  a toy manufacturer wants to make a gun, the four colors that they took off the shelf that they could not put on, could not put on a gun, they could not sell it that way, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3549.763s">Now,</a>  if a kid gets the gun and he decides to modify it, once again, you're talking another incident because what's he doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3558.888s">It's</a>  either one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3561.269s">It's</a>  going to have a strict appearance in the sale of the gun or the toy gun, or are you going to just eliminate them all together? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3569.822s">You</a>  know, the question is, do you take the chance or you don't take the chance? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3572.825s">And</a>  maybe the middle of the road is to go by way of having a strict appearance first and see where that goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3577.949s">A</a>  fine this heavy, $300,000, is a pretty heavy fine to sell a gun that does not have a strict appearance to it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3585.556s">So</a>  I would say— This is a beginning to a process.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3587.578s">No,</a>  I understand that, but I would suggest that that type of information be forwarded <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3592.055s">to</a>  your subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3593.416s">I</a>  certainly agree, Councilor Pender. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3594.796s">I</a>  think that New York, and this is a city law, it's not New York State's law, it's New York City's actual local ordinance that prohibits the sale of any toy gun unless it's completely brightly colored. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3605.281s">And</a>  one of the things that Councilor Pender keeps referring to is the $300 in fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3609.183s">Those</a>  were $300,000 in fines that were levied upon businesses like Amazon and eBay who were violating the local ordinance and actually selling <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3618.834s">In</a>  Wal-Mart stores, actually, was one of the big purveyors of these replica firearms to New York City in violation of the local ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3626.436s">And</a>  that's where a lot of that recovery came from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3629.517s">But</a>  again, Councilor Penta, I couldn't agree with you more in terms of looking at it and saying, should these replica handguns in the city of Medford, if they're being sold there, be brightly colored? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3637.659s">I</a>  don't think that that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3638.72s">I</a>  think that's something that should be a great discussion topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3640.9s">And</a>  I also think that there really is no place for replica handguns in our parks, in our public parks, in our public schools, in our public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3647.943s">So,</a>  you know, that's why I brought the resolution forward, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3652.527s">So,</a>  on the motion of Council Knight, as amended by Vice President Leclerc, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[hFAk--zIv7g_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3664.477s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3665.258s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3666.319s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3668.821s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3670.142s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3670.682s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3670.983s">With</a>  a vote of six in the affirmative and one absent, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3676.604s">15-750</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3680.145s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council request the implementation of pedestrian crossing controls at the intersection of George and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3688.608s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3690.168s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that this resolution speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3693.069s">I</a>  got a call from a couple of constituents, one of whom is in the room this evening, whose birthday may be coming up, if I understand correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3700.431s">And</a>  this is an issue of importance to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3702.732s">And</a>  I think it's an issue, it should be an issue of importance to us as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3706.135s">The</a>  101 bus, for example, travels up and down Main Street all day long, and it makes stops right at George Street in Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3712.098s">There</a>  are no pedestrian crossing controls at George Street in Maine, which is a heavily traveled thoroughfare, and buses along that route have pretty high ridership, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3723.003s">So</a>  in the interest of public safety and keeping our pedestrians safe, I brought this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3727.065s">I</a>  think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3730.225s">long</a>  in the waiting, but it's something that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3733.327s">And</a>  as the sun goes down a little bit earlier here, and people are getting home from work at 4, 5, and 6 o'clock at night when it's dark out, it highlights the problem even more, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3742.114s">So</a>  I'd ask that my fellow colleagues support me in voting in the affirmative for the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3745.597s">I'd</a>  like to add that now, the result of an effort by our own councillor, Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3753.302s">Ma'am,</a>  you wish to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3754.764s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sqp6S0Yyr0A_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3756.645s">I</a>  would, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3757.205s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3767.175s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3768.717s">Hi,</a>  I'm Rachel Tandenhouse, 26 Pearl Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3774.363s">I</a>  would like to speak in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3777.347s">I</a>  live around the corner from there, from Georgia, Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3781.992s">It</a>  is a major bus stop for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3783.592s">The</a>  96 goes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3784.873s">The</a>  101 goes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3786.053s">Those</a>  are the buses that pass closest to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3788.674s">And</a>  that's how I get to work every day, is by the 101 or the 96. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3794.955s">I'm</a>  also blind. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3798.836s">And</a>  I think I get around pretty okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3801.077s">And</a>  I do my best. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3802.477s">And</a>  I have this awesome guide dog here that helps me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3807.158s">But</a>  some intersections are certainly more challenging than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3811.608s">And</a>  this is absolutely one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3814.412s">It's</a>  a really difficult one to navigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3817.697s">Nobody,</a>  whether you can see or not, can really tell what's coming around a corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3822.595s">And</a>  people come zooming through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3825.558s">And</a>  just some sort of, I mean, I would be very excited about a traffic light. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3830.181s">But</a>  some sort of traffic calming measure would be pretty exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3834.945s">I</a>  think that that would do a lot for my safety and my independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3838.988s">And</a>  frankly, the cars don't really care if they run over a blind person or a sighted one, so I bet it would do wonders for everybody else too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3846.134s">And</a>  I appreciate very much your bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3851.408s">love</a>  Medford very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3853.229s">Um,</a>  it occasionally tries to kill me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3855.671s">And,</a>  um, well, I know it's not personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3858.473s">Uh,</a>  you know, this is one of the intersections that would, uh, do wonders for my safety and, and that of my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3865.598s">And</a>  if you ever want to hear about any of the other ones, you know, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3870.801s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3871.042s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3871.602s">On</a>  the motion approved by council and I'd all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3875.164s">Oh,</a>  madam vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3876.105s">You</a>  want to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3876.806s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3877.504s">Quickly,</a>  thank you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3878.985s">I</a>  think it's a very good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3881.065s">I</a>  also got a couple emails this week on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3883.566s">It</a>  reminds me of Winthrop and George a couple years ago where we had a couple, I believe somebody was injured very badly at that intersection and we did traffic calming approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3897.832s">We</a>  installed a raised crosswalk very close by. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3901.373s">So</a>  this is parallel to that and definitely a speedway that needs some attention.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3908.74s">You</a>  wish to speak on this matter?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3911.622s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3912.703s">If</a>  we could also send this paper to the Pedestrian Committee to add to one of their list of intersections of concern, I'd appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3919.288s">So</a>  that this be sent to the Pedestrian Committee?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3923.151s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3924.713s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3924.913s">McGivern</a>  has been working with the Pedestrian Committee to implement some safety controls in our community to make Medford a safer place for those who choose to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3932.919s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3933.32s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, that this paper be sent <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3937.987s">to</a>  the pedestrian committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3939.588s">Did</a>  the vice president have a amendment there too? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3942.789s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3943.509s">Sir,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3946.81s">My</a>  name is Mario Martin from 198 Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3949.811s">And</a>  I actually think this is a really good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3953.032s">But</a>  I was wondering, because basically on Main Street, there are several stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3959.775s">And</a>  I was actually wondering if, in addition to this, would there be some sort of possibility where we can, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3966.788s">offer</a>  sidewalks on pretty much all of the bus stops on Main Street and South Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3973.811s">More</a>  particularly, I think it's Wellesley Street, the corner of Wellesley Street and Main Street, where I know that there's an elderly couple that lives on Main Street that usually tries to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3987.857s">And</a>  as I forget who mentioned it, but at nighttime, it's incredibly difficult to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3993.439s">Well,</a>  I mean, it's incredibly dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3996.536s">So</a>  there's people flying through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=3998.097s">So</a>  I would also if possible, um, you know, seek to ask, see if it's, see if it's, uh, if, if, if, if you guys can, you know, add, uh, all of us stops on mainstream as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4012.483s">Uh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4013.503s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4014.284s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4015.824s">On</a>  the motion of council night as amended by council night, all those in favor, all those opposed motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4025.095s">15-751</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4027.976s">Be</a>  it resolved that the lack of timely action regarding Medford Square bus stops be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4032.998s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4033.818s">Mr.</a>  President, this is not a new subject matter, at least for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4038.58s">And</a>  it's getting more and more disturbing the more we keep thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4041.821s">I</a>  first introduced this subject matter back on June 14, 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4046.782s">First</a>  time I introduced this idea of the bus stops in the square with an anticipation that there was going to be a lot of road work and bridge work and construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4054.627s">And</a>  bringing forward, I have a whole folder here of not only resolutions, but I have a folder of information coming back and going forth, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4063.452s">No</a>  resolution to the matter still as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4065.533s">And</a>  then on June 30th of this year, resolution 15525, once again offered by myself, as it related not only to the bus stops, but a meeting with the DOT people, the MBTA, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4078.573s">letting</a>  the governor of the Commonwealth know of our disappointment and our frustration over the idea of this bridge and its impact it's going to have here and the city of Medford, still no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4087.735s">I</a>  asked the city clerk for a copy of the letter, never got a copy of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4091.496s">Then</a>  again, on June 23rd of this, June, September, excuse me, on September 22nd of this year, I offered another resolution.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4098.918s">Did</a>  they meet with us?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4101.119s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4102.219s">They</a>  met with us this spring.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4104.88s">This</a>  was June. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4106.295s">We're</a>  talking about now September. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4107.715s">We</a>  have had no meetings since June 30th to September. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4111.776s">As</a>  a result of that, as a result of that in the Craddock Bridge, and I had asked you, Mr. President, on September 22nd to go forward and for the purposes of setting up a meeting with the MassDOT, letting them know and letting us know that we would have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4127.279s">I</a>  asked for a copy of the letter and apparently no letter was ever sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4131.462s">So</a>  now, with no letters going out, and we're just sitting here spinning our wheels and just talking about something that's having a major effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4140.266s">Last</a>  weekend, the downtown Medford Square, we were around 8, 7.30, 8, 9 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4145.988s">Unbeknownst</a>  to any business merchant down there, all of a sudden, everything was closed down because they were putting the bridge in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4150.81s">They</a>  were putting the bridge in early in the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4153.271s">And</a>  one particular business not only had it closed down and lost all his, probably, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4157.383s">$3,000</a>  to $4,000 worth of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4160.625s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4162.046s">Again,</a>  it's a lack of transparency, a lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4168.25s">What's</a>  the sense of us having these resolutions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4171.332s">You</a>  turned around and told us last week, we're going to get it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4174.695s">We</a>  haven't gotten nothing resolved, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4176.796s">Nothing's</a>  resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4177.877s">We</a>  got no letters going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4179.558s">We</a>  have no meetings set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4181.48s">And</a>  we have bus concerns issues in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4184.221s">And</a>  I believe it was last week, on one particular day, they even changed the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4188.042s">And</a>  people had to walk to Medford Square not knowing that the buses had been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4192.683s">All</a>  we're asking for is a little bit of common sense in this whole process of this Mystic, of this Kratik Bridge, you know, reconstruction, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4203.181s">And</a>  another reason, if anybody's out there watching this whole thing, the reason it's taking two and a half years is because they don't work there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4209.363s">They</a>  were supposed to be working there six days a week, double shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4212.224s">That</a>  was the deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4213.164s">I</a>  don't even know what that contract says if they're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4216.225s">But</a>  once again, it's another typical City of Medford contract for 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4219.967s">121</a>  feet is going to take two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4223.168s">With</a>  the state of technology that's out there today, moving wires, telephone lines and gas lines, it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4230.34s">But</a>  I'm more concerned over the fact, the abruptness that's going to take place once those buses have to be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4236.925s">And</a>  nobody has come to the city from the MassDOT, from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4242.389s">No</a>  letters have gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4243.55s">Council</a>  resolutions have been ignored and not adhered to for the disposition of what takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4248.834s">I</a>  don't know what's going on, but I certainly hope that the next city council coming in has a better firm and a better grip on their own resolutions, because this is absolutely making no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4258.407s">We're</a>  making resolutions and there's no action taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4261.428s">So</a>  why are we making these resolutions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4263.189s">Will</a>  you tell me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4265.29s">You</a>  can't answer it, because I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4267.671s">And</a>  the fact of the matter is, this is what people elect us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4270.872s">If</a>  we're going to do the people's business and we're going to talk about it, at least do what our own business tells us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4276.035s">At</a>  least adhere to our own resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4278.476s">If</a>  a letter went out to the MBTA and they ignored it, they didn't want to come back, or DOT, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4284.965s">You're</a>  the chairperson of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4286.665s">The</a>  letter should have gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4287.846s">And</a>  the letter should have been addressed to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4290.086s">It</a>  should have gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4291.307s">And</a>  if people are just getting lax around here and just letting resolutions come and go, well, then shame on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4298.048s">That's</a>  not what we're elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4300.089s">If</a>  you owned a business in Medford Square, and you had to figure out when you woke up in the morning, you had to turn that key. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4305.83s">And</a>  from the moment you turn that key, you've got to pay for the electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4309.071s">You've</a>  got to pay for the gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4310.362s">You've</a>  got to pay for the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4311.842s">You've</a>  got to pay for your stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4313.543s">You've</a>  got to pay for your employees, workman's comp, every other thing that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4318.264s">And</a>  then you come down and you have your business closed down or being given no information of when it's going to be closed down, no transparency, no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4326.447s">Not</a>  one person from this city building went down to Medford Square to tell those business merchants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4331.728s">And</a>  if the state was ignorant enough not to tell the business merchants or to tell the city hall, then the city should have been all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4338.582s">all</a>  over them and they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4340.402s">But</a>  this city council is just as much to blame because they didn't call the meeting that was supposed to be called from June of this year till again on September 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4348.604s">And</a>  this is now November 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4351.065s">I'm</a>  going to ask you, Mr. President, since it's obvious that the city clerk, would you please call this meeting ASAP? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4356.907s">You</a>  said you were the last time we had this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4359.607s">It</a>  needs to be done before a business person goes out of business.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4411.247s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Knight to request when the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4434.014s">I'd</a>  be delighted if given the chance council night, there'll be a meeting on Tuesday, uh, December 1st with representatives of the department of transportation, uh, in at Alia pertaining to the credit bridge project.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4449.027s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4449.207s">What</a>  about the MBTA, which is the bus stops?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4451.858s">The</a>  bus stop people have not expressed a willingness to attend a meeting of the city council.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4458.622s">Do</a>  you have that in writing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4459.462s">Do</a>  you have a letter that you sent to them or is it just phone calls? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4462.444s">Phone</a>  calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4463.004s">Phone</a>  calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4463.384s">Well,</a>  could you please put it in writing so we could have a paper trail that allows us now to do what we need to do for leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4470.308s">Common</a>  sense would tell you this is a business proposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4473.049s">This</a>  isn't a social phone call to say, would you please come? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4476.671s">Listen,</a>  they work for us, the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4478.878s">We</a>  don't work for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4479.718s">They</a>  work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4481.259s">And</a>  the bus stops are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4483.32s">They're</a>  important to not only to the commuters who use them every day, but they're also important to the business people that are in that square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4489.642s">And</a>  if they have to be moved.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4490.802s">Maybe</a>  the construction people will explain in their presentation the scheduling for moving of the bus stop as it's part of the construction plan.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4847.151s">I</a>  think it's a wonderful space for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4849.732s">The</a>  Cultural Arts and History Subcommittee is chaired by Vice President Breanna Lungo-Koehn and is membered by myself, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4860.774s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4861.474s">And</a>  the Honorable Robert M. Penta.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4864.735s">Like</a>  I said, there's nowhere wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4867.396s">I</a>  don't know if there's any direction for them to hire a new person to run the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4872.617s">Are</a>  they going to start paying somebody? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4874.318s">So</a>  I'd like to know where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4877.17s">for</a>  the future.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4878.791s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4880.012s">Thank</a>  you, President De La Ruzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4881.413s">I</a>  actually had coffee with one of the commissioners on Friday and I am going to set up a meeting in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4890.077s">I'm</a>  hoping for mid-December because they've reviewed what the city of Lexington has done as far as a master plan for the five to ten years and she's meeting with the, I don't know if Susan Fairchild herself or the whole board is meeting with the city of <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4904.85s">Lynn</a>  Auditorium to see how they've, Lexington was the last five years and they want to see how Lynn's done it the last 10 and how they've become so successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4914.697s">So</a>  one component to that is.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4916.398s">Lynn</a>  has a booking agent that works there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4918.92s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4919.14s">So</a>  they're looking into the booking agents, but they are going to be hopefully ready to, you know, present to the council and start the dialogue and see how the city can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4926.846s">And</a>  hopefully when the new mayor comes on in January, we get insight with regards to big capital, um,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4933.487s">And</a>  I would hope that the new mayor would have some vision and maybe see the, the survivor auditorium also.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4939.129s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4939.67s">So</a>  I do plan on calling a meeting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4942.451s">Hopefully</a>  mid December, if not mid January, once we get the new mayor's insight as well.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4948.113s">So</a>  on that motion, you wish to speak on the matter, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4952.295s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4952.655s">Council</a>  President Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield ave, Medford mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4956.457s">This</a>  is an excellent opportunity for something we've discussed for ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4960.525s">We</a>  have over $300,000 sitting in an account for a TV station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4964.728s">If</a>  we got a van parked outside of the Chevalier and we had a station in the Chevalier at the old space occupied by Boston Event Works, which I've been in many times, so it's on two separate floors, we now have monies that can go to the Chevalier and to the TV station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4982.121s">We</a>  could open a radio station, which I talked to Stephanie Muccini-Burke about a while back <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4987.835s">And</a>  Mrs. Burke said that there's money from Homeland Security for something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4991.936s">Now,</a>  there are two members of the board of directors of Boston Free Radio from Somerville right in this auditorium tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4996.878s">So</a>  there's a synergy that we could have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=4999.578s">There</a>  is activity that could bring in all sorts of fun stuff to the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5005.36s">But</a>  this is the perfect opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5007.881s">And</a>  also, I think Councilor Caraviello had the idea of the Medford Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5012.522s">You</a>  can now have two satellite sites, which Arlington has. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5016.837s">Your</a>  public access money now will work with the library and with the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5020.299s">It's</a>  a win-win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5022.421s">I</a>  present it to you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5025.863s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5026.243s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5028.324s">Jean</a>  Martin, Tuck Cummings Street, and I actually agree with Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5031.306s">This</a>  is a great opportunity to bring everything together in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5034.949s">Medford</a>  Square needs the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5036.289s">They</a>  need the arts and the culture to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5039.552s">We</a>  need to have that banner, the what do you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5044.295s">Yeah,</a>  the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5045.395s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, the marquee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5046.276s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5047.196s">We</a>  need to have the marquee put up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5048.637s">We</a>  need to take this building seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5050.498s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5051.178s">Yes,</a>  I need remedial help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5054.68s">So</a>  we need to really take that building seriously in the next coming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5061.964s">And</a>  if we don't, the Medford Square area isn't going to build out as fast as it could. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5067.467s">It's</a>  just that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5068.988s">Between</a>  the library, the community access channel, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5073.267s">and</a>  you can put it down in the theater, you can put it on the second floor of the library for all I care. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5077.269s">I</a>  don't care where you put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5078.41s">If</a>  you build another floor in the library, I'm all for that and put the channel in there, I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5083.092s">Put</a>  the channel in a small little retail spot, I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5086.774s">But</a>  that would really, those three things mixed together would really help to boom Medford Square and get the businesses going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5095.939s">So</a>  I really am in support of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5097.72s">You</a>  have to get the religions out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5100.221s">I'm</a>  totally, that sets me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5102.87s">and</a>  because it's just totally against everything I believe in, but we have to take that building seriously and we have to take the library seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5112.218s">Either</a>  these are buildings that the city owns and we take them seriously or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5116.061s">We</a>  had an earlier debate about the Brooks estates and we really need to think hard about putting more money into that because to me it's just, it's not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5127.11s">They</a>  have multiple issues, but anyway, the money that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5130.965s">that</a>  we need to do, we need to take those two buildings seriously, as well as the public safety building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5136.328s">Those</a>  three things need to be taken into consideration in the future year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5140.291s">Thank</a>  you so much for listening to me, and I really do want to see Medford Square take off, because then it needs to go up to Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5146.074s">We</a>  have empty buildings up there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5148.796s">Empty</a>  storefronts that could use the arts once they start in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5152.858s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5248.333s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5249.634s">And</a>  just if I could, this weekend, the Methodist Council held the first annual Methodist summit here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5258.478s">It</a>  was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5259.498s">There</a>  was probably 100 residents from all different backgrounds and different groups in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5268.302s">We</a>  all got together and sat in separate tables and in groups of five or six. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5273.765s">And</a>  we came up if we had a wish list of what we'd like to see <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5277.63s">done</a>  with the arts in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5280.031s">And</a>  that day, no one was allowed to say, we can't do, or we can't do it because of budget, or we can't, everything had to be positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5289.696s">And</a>  I think there was a common theme throughout all the attendees that were there was the need for more collaboration throughout the community, definitely community outreach, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5303.06s">And</a>  other communities, if you buy a home, they actually have what they call a welcome wagon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5308.222s">We'll</a>  come out and say, do you know that we have the Medford Family Network in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5313.003s">Do</a>  you know that the public library is open certain days of the week? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5316.604s">Do</a>  you know that we have the Mustangs play at Hormel? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5320.545s">And</a>  it's just a way of inviting people into the community, getting them to know what we have, and having some type of assemblance or central depository. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5332.379s">Because</a>  right now, if you move into the community, the only thing you get is a listing of when your trash is picked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5339.563s">That's</a>  all you get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5340.484s">The</a>  city hands you out, OK, here's your trash pickup, leaf pickup, see you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5344.866s">And</a>  so there was discussion about outreach within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5348.508s">I</a>  think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5350.269s">And</a>  also having a website similar to the city website, but allowing, and I'm not sure how this would be done, but allowing these different organizations to have access <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5361.835s">and</a>  be able to compile information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5363.976s">So</a>  you could have the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5365.917s">You</a>  could have the Arts Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5367.677s">You</a>  could have the Hormel Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5370.619s">All</a>  these different entities that have access to one particular site and be able to use that as a central depository for people to do one-stop shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5381.543s">Because</a>  it's very difficult to get answers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5384.084s">It's</a>  very difficult to find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5387.066s">And</a>  I think that would be a great asset in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5391.138s">and</a>  something that was reiterated over and over again that afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5397.043s">They</a>  plan on having, the Method Arts Council plans on having many more events. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5402.628s">They're</a>  gonna quantify all the different points that were brought up on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5408.212s">That</a>  was a three hour meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5409.513s">It</a>  was, let me tell you, it went by very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5411.935s">It</a>  was very fruitful and there was a cross section of a lot of different people in this community that attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5420.138s">And</a>  really, I think we'll go a long way to incorporating arts throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5427.221s">Right</a>  now you see arts events. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5428.522s">You</a>  have the West Method Open Studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5431.043s">It</a>  was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5431.623s">Why</a>  not have the Haines Square Open Studio, the Wellington Open, or the South Method Open Studio? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5436.365s">Why</a>  not branch that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5438.405s">You</a>  know, we have 23 parks in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5440.926s">What</a>  better way to do outreach when you actually have <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5445.11s">these</a>  parks that are used as a place where you can set up a stage or a performing arts type event, and have that in your own neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5455.136s">So</a>  you don't have to worry about, if you live in Wellington, saying, well, I'm going to go over to the West Medford Open Studios to take part in an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5464.041s">And</a>  so there was a lot of good subjects brought up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5467.883s">And</a>  I think over the next several years, we're going to see an infusion in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5474.79s">I</a>  don't want to understate it, but the fact that the arts currently doesn't really have a home in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5481.416s">We</a>  were very close back some years ago to getting an art center with art studio and lofts and so forth, which fell short. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5489.503s">But</a>  the need for a home in this community and a place where they can hang their hat and use it as a place that they can make calls from and organize from. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5501.734s">I</a>  think would go a long way to improving the atmosphere and the vibrance of the art community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5508.218s">And</a>  we all know the arts is directly related to property value. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5511.82s">And</a>  if anyone tells you otherwise, they're misinformed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5514.801s">Because</a>  any community that has a strong art association, similar to Somerville and Arlington and Lexington, they're all doing very well, not only with the arts, but in regards to property value in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5528.389s">So</a>  I just want to say it was a great event, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5531.549s">and</a>  I look forward to subsequent events to push this issue forward.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5537.271s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5538.472s">And</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello for approval, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5541.633s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5544.154s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5545.134s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5546.435s">And</a>  finally, offered by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor wants to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5552.657s">He</a>  attended the <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5555.567s">meeting</a>  that was held up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, uh, this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5560.549s">Uh,</a>  so, uh, be it resolved that the councilor Caraviello address the city council as to the happenings at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5567.571s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5568.891s">Um,</a>  this, this evening, along with myself and councilor Penta, uh, we were invited to the physicians operations committee, uh, at the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5577.434s">And,</a>  um, what it was is, um, they want to let us know and keep us abreast of what's happening up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5585.018s">during</a>  the time of the merger or non-merger happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5589.899s">But</a>  some of the things happening up there over the next couple of weeks is they're opening a brand new sleep center on December 7th, and that'll be the only one in this region other than Winchester Hospital has one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5606.382s">But</a>  that's not in this region. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5608.722s">Well,</a>  it's in Boston, but in the suburbs, there's no other one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5614.093s">They're</a>  opening also a brand new bariatric center on the third floor there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5617.816s">So</a>  there's two brand new departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5619.597s">They</a>  spent $700,000 on nuclear medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5622.739s">And</a>  one of the big things happening there, starting on January 4th, they're going back to operating on five days a week there, which they had cut back to three days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5633.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5635.388s">Councilor</a>  Pente, you're shaking your head no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5637.289s">He</a>  said that was one of the things that I think we talked about that before you got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5641.9s">But-</a>  This is your report, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5645.122s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5646.043s">But</a>  I say the hospital is doing their best to stay alive and remain viable during these difficult times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5652.968s">And</a>  they are spending money on renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5657.952s">Salt</a>  One and West One have just been completely done over. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5662.255s">So</a>  hopefully they'll invite us to some other meetings just to keep us abreast of what's happening at the hospital so people don't think it's closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5671.424s">It</a>  is viable, and they're working hard to keep it strong.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5675.146s">Did</a>  they comment at all as to where they are with merger plans at this point?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5680.368s">They</a>  did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5681.129s">It's</a>  still in the hands of the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5684.27s">And</a>  I asked that would it be helpful if we reached out to the Attorney General and maybe brought her in for a meeting, and they said that any help that we could be would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5695.276s">And</a>  they're still in negotiations with the Mass General Group? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5697.517s">Well,</a>  it seems to be more in the hands of <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5700.531s">uh,</a>  the attorney general. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5702.673s">So,</a>  and he did say that they had other groups that are interested in partnering up with them, but partners, uh, mass general is the only one that's actually bringing something to the table other than just being a partner with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5716.764s">So</a>  that's, that's the reason they're staying focused on the partners.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5721.128s">So</a>  on the motion of CAV council, Caraviello that this be, uh, received in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5726.898s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Penter.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5728.459s">On</a>  that motion, Rick is partially right on the idea of expanding the operating room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5732.88s">But</a>  the idea of expanding the operating room was also to go from three days to five days a week to take the transfers that have been going to the Melrose Wakefield back to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5743.183s">About</a>  a year and a half ago, they sort of like lost that influx of patient care for the operating room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5752.786s">It's</a>  been approximately 1,000 patients per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5755.715s">according</a>  to their records, which is holding their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5758.276s">And</a>  by doing that, they talked about block time, for which doctors have the opportunity to block time in the operating room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5765.398s">I</a>  think it starts from 730 in the morning to 3 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5768.899s">And</a>  that block time will allow certain types of operations, or more operations, that for which they had to give up before, that went to the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5778.622s">They</a>  also talked about the idea of the surgical volume <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5784.873s">possibly</a>  right now looking at 2016, it's approximately going to be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5793.698s">The</a>  question that seems to be having a problem with the hospital and all the hospitals is that a lot of the patients coming in are not paying the patient's care, what do you call it, their co-payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5805.003s">And</a>  some of these co-payments are kind of like high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5807.685s">And</a>  as a result of that, some of these patients are opting out not to have the operations now or waiting to a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5815.553s">So</a>  in essence, maybe the patient care volume is down, it's not because the patients don't want to do it, they just can't afford to do it or their co-payments are too high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5824.375s">Now</a>  we're into the insurance part of the whole program and that in and of itself presents another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5829.035s">Getting</a>  back to the idea of where this merger sits, one of the interesting components of the merger, hopefully the merger takes place, is the Lawrence Memorial Partners really wants the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5840.457s">It's</a>  accessibility to 93, it's a perfect match and it's a perfect fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5844.724s">And</a>  as a result of that, one of the two big stumbling blocks with the attorney general was this idea of licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5853.071s">And</a>  one of the things that held back the last merger was there was no definition of when this first five, six years of the merger taking place, when the licensure would become operative and effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5869.026s">And</a>  hopefully, it becomes effective as soon <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5872.743s">as</a>  partners makes this merge go through if the training general allows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5875.644s">With</a>  that being said, that'll just put the Lawrence Memorial right on the map all over again as a hospital completely affiliated with partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5884.407s">The</a>  doctors, they were pretty interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5885.868s">The</a>  interesting part about it is that they had a lot of interesting questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5890.41s">And</a>  some of the questions, they questioned about what was going on and as to why, because there's a lot of changes taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5896.612s">So</a>  they just didn't sit there like a lump on a log. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5899.433s">which</a>  was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5900.814s">They</a>  were inquisitive, and they wanted to know some of the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5903.536s">And</a>  some of their questions couldn't be answered, which was even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5906.118s">So</a>  people are going to have to get back to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5908.36s">There's</a>  no question you see a new movement up there at the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5911.342s">Hopefully,</a>  it's enough to keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5914.124s">It</a>  may not be able to keep it going with all its services. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5916.446s">But</a>  if the OR room can bring itself back, and this block time of operations can take place up there, as Rick alluded to with the other things going on, the hospital should do itself well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5927.014s">People</a>  should understand that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5929.608s">was</a>  a very financially endowed hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5932.949s">And</a>  when that merger took place between Hallmark and the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Melrose-Wakefield came into the picture, and unfortunately I think the Malden Hospital was part of it, and of course it's no longer there, that's when the finances of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and their bankroll became depleted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5947.712s">I</a>  think at one point in time they had a $34 million <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5951.404s">asset</a>  profit margin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5952.645s">Now,</a>  I believe they're in the minus column. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5956.008s">Getting</a>  better, but still not out of the woods yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5958.43s">So,</a>  hopefully, as we keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5961.773s">One</a>  of the best things the people of this community can do, if you are a patient or you know a doctor at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, make the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5968.559s">Find</a>  out what you can do to send that letter in, whether it be to the Attorney General or to the Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5972.683s">Tell</a>  them that you want to keep the hospital, you like their services, and as Rick alluded to, with the new services coming on board, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5979.545s">And</a>  again, their whole transportation needs, their 30-minute response period time for an ambulance, and putting everybody on call and on notice, it's going to be unacceptable if they don't meet the requirements that the hospital is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5993.075s">They'll</a>  be out of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=5994.396s">So,</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, hopefully this is the beginning of more transparency that the hospital has had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6000.381s">It</a>  hasn't had this in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6002.342s">These</a>  doctors, men and women that were there, and the doctor in charge, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6005.549s">seem</a>  to be wanting to do the right thing, and I want to thank them for inviting us.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6010.452s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6011.913s">Councilor</a>  Carfiello, on your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6015.796s">I</a>  got there a little earlier, and I was talking, but I did ask a question about Lawrence standing alone without Melrose, and they said that wouldn't happen because of the Hallmark branding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6032.72s">And</a>  I also asked, he says, you know, if everybody, if all these hospitals lose money, I says, how does anybody survive? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6038.262s">He</a>  said, most hospitals do lose money, but, um, they make money on their private investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6044.365s">And</a>  I guess that's, what's keeping all mock and Lawrence alive is there.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6048.506s">Uh,</a>  they, they do return on investment from their endowments.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6051.208s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6051.548s">They're</a>  making, they're doing quite well on their investments.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6053.769s">So</a>  he says that's been the saving grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6055.769s">So</a>  on the motion of council Caraviello to receive in place on file, all those in favor, all those opposed motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6062.648s">The</a>  records, the records of the meeting of November 10th, 2015 were passed to Vice President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6068.91s">Madam</a>  Vice President, how did you find those records?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6072.151s">In</a>  order.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6073.531s">And?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6074.251s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6075.171s">On</a>  the motion of approval of the records by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6078.752s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6079.513s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6080.073s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6081.313s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6082.913s">Chair</a>  recognizes, before we adjourn, the Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6088.683s">Mr.</a>  President, I believe it was last week we asked for a joint meeting with the school committee regarding school safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6093.886s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6094.206s">If</a>  we received any type of response, I have not.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6098.208s">We're</a>  going to, uh, I actually, I did, I received a call back from the, um, uh, superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6106.532s">Uh,</a>  but we've been playing telephone tag for the past two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6115.016s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6115.697s">So,</a>  uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6116.378s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello has just informed us that the perpetrator of the break in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6123.18s">A</a>  19 year old woman from Everett was arrested for that crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6127.602s">Councilor,</a>  but no doubt we will continue to pursue that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6135.264s">And</a>  we can be assured that the presence of two members of the school committee on this body in the next turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6142.048s">will</a>  certainly benefit the wisdom of this body, just as the two previous members of the school committee who joined this council may possibly have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6161.911s">Council</a>  of Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6163.772s">Did</a>  you make inquiry to the school committee to have this joint meeting?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6166.432s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6167.252s">Who</a>  did you make inquiry with to have the joint meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6169.913s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6170.613s">Who</a>  did?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6171.558s">I</a>  think the clerk may have.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6176.68s">I</a>  don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6177.92s">It's</a>  a council prerogative to make the inquiry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6180.761s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6181.181s">Number</a>  two, I believe the superintendent had some comments about it last night at the school committee meeting where he said that this wasn't done to keep it hush hush before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6189.224s">Well,</a>  I don't know what it was or why it wasn't, but it took place six days before the election, you know, and the teachers never responded and never called the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6198.007s">Police</a>  department wasn't called. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6199.207s">And</a>  it's the same situation they had up to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6201.681s">when</a>  they had a bomb scare and nobody knew nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6204.303s">And</a>  they wouldn't allow the dogs to come into the building because they didn't want the adverse publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6208.506s">You</a>  know, this is the problem around here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6210.908s">You're</a>  asked to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6211.968s">That's</a>  a huge issue that took place in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6214.73s">Someone</a>  got into that school building, could have kidnapped a kid, could have caused harm, could have done something that we're seeing every single day, devastation taking place in public places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6226.198s">And</a>  they got to think about having a joint meeting to discuss the public safety of a building <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6231.935s">What</a>  are they afraid of, a hard question being asked? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6235.216s">You</a>  know, I don't accept this, Mr. President, and I wouldn't hope that you would call tomorrow morning and just tell them, listen, this meeting is taking place next Tuesday night to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6243.58s">You</a>  know, we vote on their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6245.701s">We</a>  vote on their budget that they submit to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6250.563s">And</a>  if they can't be responsible enough to want to meet with another legislative body who is ready, willing, and able to help out the situation, they have no security in the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6261.768s">One</a>  thing, Chris Murphy, when he was running for school committee, that's what he was advocating for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6265.571s">He's</a>  the only one running for school committee that advocated for security, or lack thereof, in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6270.535s">And</a>  we're still talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6272.717s">Shame</a>  on every elected official, the superintendent, the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6275.9s">Shame</a>  on you all for not wanting to sit down by now to have even a date set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6280.503s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6284.587s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, Mr. Castagnetti.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6287.069s">Castagnetti,</a>  Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6287.689s">23</a>  Cushing Street, Method, Marist. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6290.72s">It's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6291.601s">Brought</a>  up this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6293.522s">My</a>  wife was one of the teachers that was robbed and she's very, very upset and concerned about her safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6301.627s">I</a>  love that meeting that trial that the perpetrators does not want to attend to today in Danvers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6310.172s">She's</a>  very, very concerned as should all the teachers and all citizens of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6315.996s">Thank</a>  you for listening, sir.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6317.577s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6332.067s">On</a>  the motion for adjournment.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6333.729s">We</a>  already voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dtPwwQz2O0&t=6336.631s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
