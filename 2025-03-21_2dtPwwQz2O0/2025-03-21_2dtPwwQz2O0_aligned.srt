1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:06,280
The 34th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:09,402
Please rise and salute.

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:12,664
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:14,104
Councilor Camuso.

5
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:16,146
Councilor Caviello.

6
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:16,486
Present.

7
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:17,846
Councilor Knight.

8
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:18,687
Present.

9
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,068
Vice President Lococourne.

10
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:20,388
Present.

11
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:22,069
Councilor Marks.

12
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:22,649
Present.

13
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,429
Councilor Panza.

14
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:23,670
Present.

15
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,331
President Del Rosso.

16
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:25,971
Present.

17
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:27,712
Six present, one absent.

18
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:29,653
Please rise to salute the flag now.

19
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:43,161
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,582
Mr. President.

21
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:45,783
Councilor Caravaglio.

22
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,705
May I ask that we have a moment of silence?

23
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:51,508
It's not the meeting of the victims of the terrorist attacks.

24
00:00:52,669 --> 00:01:00,135
Please join the Medford City Council and all rise for a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks.

25
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:02,195
in Paris this past weekend.

26
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:17,860
Thank you, Councillor CAVIOLLO.

27
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:29,663
The Committee of the Whole, if I can just report on the Committee of the Whole meeting held this evening.

28
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:53,551
at six o'clock in the council office, uh, to address the issues, uh, regarding the Shepard Brooks estate, an update on, uh, the goings on on the property and a, um, uh, consideration of, uh, some of the issues surrounding the request for the loan order.

29
00:01:54,311 --> 00:02:00,112
Uh, the, uh, committee has asked that the paper remain in paper and in committee.

30
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:04,772
However, they have asked for three things.

31
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:14,338
One, a report from the budget director's office for expenditures from the city of Medford on the Shepard Brooks estate for the past five years.

32
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:25,766
Two, that the fire chief report to the city council in writing on an outline of the parameters

33
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:38,876
and requirements he has for upgrades of the road to the Sheppard Brooks Estate, and also a cost estimate from the city engineer on that road.

34
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:55,122
And then three, that the director of public health, Karen Rose, report to the council on what restrictions or requirements might be to mitigate the present

35
00:02:56,163 --> 00:03:09,973
uh, sewage system up on the property and also to report back to us on, uh, requirements and restrictions, uh, on, uh, the property, uh, because of the presence of lead paint.

36
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,056
Did I get that all councils?

37
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,176
Thank you.

38
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,219
Uh, madam vice president.

39
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,580
Thank you, president Delaware.

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,541
So if we could have a paper waiting for,

41
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:37,700
our new mayor, just to ask the intentions of the Brooks Estates moving forward, some sort of master plan, obviously, in the scheme of the rest of the capital improvements we need to make, just so we know what to invest in, how to invest in it, and how we're going to move forward.

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,540
Very good.

43
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,801
I should have had that on the notes.

44
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,041
I apologize.

45
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,561
Thank you.

46
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:41,701
Thank you.

47
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,002
So, motions, orders, and resolutions, 15-749.

48
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:50,163
Motion for suspension of the rules, Councilor Knight.

49
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:50,963
All those in favor?

50
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:52,683
All those opposed?

51
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:56,706
The reason I asked to suspend the rules, Mr. President, is to take the tabled papers from last week.

52
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:02,189
On the motion of Councilor Knight to take the tabled papers from last week.

53
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:03,369
All those in favor?

54
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,230
All those opposed?

55
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,791
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,351
What papers?

57
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,212
The papers that you- Can we take them one at a time, please?

58
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:09,733
Absolutely.

59
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,934
I'd like to move first, Mr. President, with the DPW loan order.

60
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:13,995
Very good.

61
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,796
Mr. President, may I, on that motion?

62
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:17,796
On that motion, Councilor Penta.

63
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:23,938
Last week, the motion was laid on the table because we did not receive anything as it related to what we were spending $300,000 on.

64
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,919
I believe the council's request was to have a paper in our hands as we view it.

65
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,719
We did not receive anything this past week till today.

66
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:39,081
So I'm going to move that that paper lay on the table until we get a written explanation of what the $300,000 is needed for, for the department of public works.

67
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:43,202
Before we entertain that motion, we're going to entertain the motion to take the papers

68
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,676
off the table for consideration.

69
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:49,479
I'm going to take them one at a time and move to separate papers, Mr. President.

70
00:04:52,121 --> 00:05:02,970
On the motion of Council and Knight to take loan order 15-737 for the DPW facility project off the table.

71
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,292
On that motion, all those in favor?

72
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,676
I move the motion that the paper lay on the table until we get what the council asked for last week.

73
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,879
We're going to take it off the table.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,442
The chair is in doubt whether to take the matter off the table.

75
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:21,183
Ms.

76
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:24,325
Madam Clerk, please call the roll to take the matter off the table.

77
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:27,867
Mr. President, to be perfectly clear, it's kind of clear.

78
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:32,590
The council voted last week to lay it on the table pursuant to council rules until we get an explanation.

79
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,191
We have not received anything in writing as we asked for.

80
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:39,394
So I think I think on the roll on whether to take it off the table or not.

81
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,235
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

82
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,238
Councilor Camuso, Councilor Cabrera.

83
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:44,438
Yes.

84
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:45,979
Councilor Knight.

85
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,339
Yes.

86
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,100
Vice-President Monk-O'Connor.

87
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:53,363
Yes.

88
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:55,305
Councilor Mox.

89
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:55,705
Yes.

90
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:56,766
Councilor Pantano.

91
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:57,066
No.

92
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:59,107
President Del Rosso.

93
00:05:59,407 --> 00:05:59,707
Yes.

94
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:04,991
With a vote of five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent, the paper is before us.

95
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:08,773
The paper was already tabled for the purpose of information.

96
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:11,395
We had the vehicle of information before us.

97
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,623
So now the paper is before us on that motion, Mr. President, on that motion.

98
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:16,404
Counselor Pinto.

99
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:26,407
I mean, how do you explain to anyone who's watching or sitting out here when you ask for information, you lay it on the table for specific purpose and you still haven't got your purpose resolved.

100
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,508
How can you even entertain it going further?

101
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:31,769
Point of information, Mr. President, point of information.

102
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:38,471
Counselor Knight, a review of the minutes from last week's meeting would not indicate that the council requested anything other than enacting rule number 20 to motion to table it.

103
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:46,063
I believe, Mr. President, to be quite candid, if you go back and review the tape, the council is quite clear, and nobody objected to getting the information to be forthcoming.

104
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,504
And besides, that's not the point.

105
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,406
It's a $300,000 item.

106
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,069
It's a $300,000 item that you're asking this council.

107
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:58,014
It's quite obvious if this council is going to continue to go on, starting in January, nothing's going to change around here.

108
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,535
You people are going to have no information.

109
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:03,799
You're just going to take someone who comes to the podium and makes a presentation without any discussion.

110
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,762
Point of information, Counselor Marks.

111
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:13,105
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. President, Ann Baker was before the council representing the administration.

112
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:18,789
And this body asked, where is the paperwork behind each and every one of the three loan audits?

113
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:20,790
And she had nothing to provide us.

114
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:32,856
And that was what I remember why the issue was tabled until we got some information back to the council on why do we want to borrow money that the taxpayers are going to have to spend?

115
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,537
I think that's a logical request.

116
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:36,574
to ask.

117
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:38,435
So I have yet to receive anything.

118
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:41,557
I don't know if my other colleagues have.

119
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,558
Point of information, Madam Vice President.

120
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,259
I, too, agree with Councilor Penta.

121
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,520
I agree with Councilor Marks.

122
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,883
But at the same time, we have somebody here who could educate us on the two loan orders that are before us.

123
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:58,386
If we need to table it further to request more information, I will be happy to put that forward.

124
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,528
But while she's here, I'd like to hear what has to be said.

125
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,250
Quite reasonable.

126
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:08,746
So the paper is before us.

127
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:09,506
The paper is before us.

128
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,226
Why don't we invite Ms.

129
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:13,548
Miller up to explain to us this loan order.

130
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:14,668
Ms.

131
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:14,808
Miller.

132
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,129
Well, further information then.

133
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:17,670
What's the difference between Ms.

134
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,370
Miller and our city auditor?

135
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:20,691
I mean.

136
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,292
That's a question for the solicitor, Mr. President.

137
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:23,012
No, no, it isn't.

138
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,013
Please, don't try to twist the words.

139
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,314
We have two separate people making a presentation on the same paper.

140
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,236
And again, with all due respect to Ms.

141
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:32,756
Miller, you know,

142
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,551
Where's the information that the council asked for?

143
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,431
You have three members of the council.

144
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,572
I can't answer for anyone else.

145
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,312
Three members have spoken up waiting for information.

146
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:50,074
So I just think this is the tempo is being set for what's going to happen here in January.

147
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:51,675
Nothing is going to change.

148
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:52,095
Nothing.

149
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:54,696
Ms.

150
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:58,557
Miller, please state your name and address for the record.

151
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:00,417
Louise Miller.

152
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,338
I live in Needham, Massachusetts.

153
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:16,655
We have before us the matter for the City Yard, 15-734, loan order for the DPW facility.

154
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:22,019
Could you present to us what this is about and why it's before us today?

155
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:23,039
Yes.

156
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,822
Oh, my apologies.

157
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:32,003
Point of information, Councillor.

158
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:36,266
Were you forwarded the request that information be forwarded to this council ahead of time?

159
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:38,167
I did not receive that request.

160
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,231
Unbelievable.

161
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:43,031
Thank you.

162
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:44,673
Thank you, Councillor Pinto.

163
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:45,373
Ms.

164
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:46,374
Miller, if you would continue.

165
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:47,635
Yes.

166
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:50,837
So there were two phases to the DPW construction.

167
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:54,380
The first phase was the remediation of the site.

168
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,302
There had been contaminated soil on the site.

169
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:59,044
And the second phase was the building of the project.

170
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:12,104
When we had put the budget together for the two phases of the project, we had budgeted $500,000 for the remediation and redevelopment of the site, and we had budgeted $12,394,000 for the building of the new DPW building.

171
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:13,684
The remediation and redevelopment actually cost $975,000.

172
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:32,049
which was $475,000 over what we had budgeted.

173
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:44,772
When the bids came in for the DPW building, they were favorable, and including all change orders, the total cost of the building was $12,214,000, which leaves us with a deficit of approximately $300,000.

174
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:45,852
That's where the $300,000 came from.

175
00:10:58,422 --> 00:10:59,902
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

176
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:05,583
I was just wondering if I can ask, has all the furniture arrived within the DPW that was audited?

177
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:09,024
I believe all the furniture that was ordered has arrived.

178
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:13,885
We're still ordering a few shelves here and there, but I believe everything else has arrived.

179
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,446
So everything that was on audit has been received?

180
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:17,526
That is correct.

181
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:17,986
Thank you.

182
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:20,486
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

183
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,827
Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

184
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,251
Thank you, President De La Russo.

185
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:28,093
Can you tell us where the $300,000 is owed to?

186
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:29,635
Is it a certain contractor?

187
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,136
Is it multiple contractors?

188
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:37,401
No, it's just a single contractor, GNR Construction Company, and we're in the process of closing out the project.

189
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:43,086
We're finishing up certain warranty issues, and this would be, you know, close out all payments.

190
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:44,947
And through the chair,

191
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,402
We have millions of dollars in free cash.

192
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:54,988
Has that been thought of to use free cash rather than go out to bond on something that we've already bonded quite enough on?

193
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,370
That's actually the mayor's decision.

194
00:11:58,011 --> 00:12:01,634
And the mayor has chosen to go out to bond for the $300,000.

195
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:06,959
Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

196
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:10,903
You all set, Madam Vice President?

197
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:11,503
For now.

198
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:11,783
Thanks.

199
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,183
Thank you.

200
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:18,166
This concerns on that yard right now that there's leaks in the roof and the air conditioning and the heating system is not consistently working correct.

201
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:21,127
Where is the city's position on that and the contractor?

202
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:28,170
Um, actually we're still working with the contractor and all the subcontractors to get the final issues resolved.

203
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,331
So the contractor has come back out and looked at the roof.

204
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,513
I don't understand exactly what the construction is, but apparently it's not unusual.

205
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,383
during the first few months for this to occur.

206
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,525
So they've come back out and they're fixing leaks in the roof.

207
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:49,248
And the controls are being adjusted for the heat and the air conditioning.

208
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,810
This building isn't even a year old.

209
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,330
That's correct.

210
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,651
And it already has leaks in the roof.

211
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:55,832
It's wonderful.

212
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:04,996
More importantly, most importantly, if there's problems that still exist, why would you want to be paying this company off until their problems are fixed?

213
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:06,959
We haven't paid them off yet.

214
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,765
We're withholding money at this point, but we're going to, at some point, need to pay the contractor.

215
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:14,585
How much are you holding back?

216
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,107
We're holding back approximately $300,000.

217
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,148
How much?

218
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:18,148
$300,000.

219
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:21,651
Well, that's just $300,000.

220
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,352
Yes, that is correct.

221
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:24,673
So what do you need the money for now, then?

222
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:26,134
Why don't you wait until they do what they're supposed to do?

223
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:31,378
We do anticipate that everything will be taken care of in the next couple of weeks.

224
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:36,298
A good business approach would be to make sure that the job is done correctly.

225
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:38,679
Why would you want to pay them before the job is finished?

226
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:50,623
We're not paying them before the job is finished, but under the law, once they give us their final invoice and we accept the building finally, we only have 14 days to pay them, the contractor.

227
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:55,404
But how can you say within 14 days if you still have the leak and you have air conditioning and heating system problems?

228
00:13:56,185 --> 00:14:00,226
We're not going to pay them until we're satisfied, but we do need

229
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,311
the funds in place so that we are able to pay them?

230
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:07,552
Well, I'm going to concur with my colleague, Councilor Langel-Curran.

231
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:13,854
I would not bond another thing in this city and put the city into any further debt when you're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash.

232
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:19,316
You spent almost, not you, the city has spent almost $14.5 million to build that building.

233
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,677
It isn't even a year old and it's already leaking.

234
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,297
It doesn't make any sense.

235
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,398
You try to tell us that to the common person on the street

236
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,452
and they're going to tell you there's something wrong with how the city.

237
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:29,733
Look at that ceiling over there.

238
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,854
It's going over two years.

239
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:32,895
Two years you got holes in the ceiling.

240
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:39,299
And you came in here and I believe you indicated it's going to cost the city in excess of a million dollars to do the roof and that.

241
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,181
Where's that money going to come from?

242
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:43,402
Hope you're not going to bond for that too.

243
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:55,510
You know, the problem around here is that this administration has gotten away with it for way too long with not bringing the council in on issues such as this that have an extreme effect upon this community.

244
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:57,105
An extreme effect.

245
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:01,347
More importantly, it's the lack of communication.

246
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,028
You just sat there and rattled off numbers that I couldn't keep up with.

247
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,229
You had the numbers there.

248
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,330
We didn't even get a piece of paper.

249
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,350
I'm going to move to the paper.

250
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,032
Lay on the table, Mr. President, until further notice, until we get further information.

251
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,153
Motion to table is undebatable.

252
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,173
Hold up.

253
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,614
Okay, good.

254
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,175
If you want to ask a question.

255
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,576
Motion has been withdrawn.

256
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,397
Chair recognizes Vice President Lugo-Kern.

257
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:24,057
Thank you.

258
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:24,498
Sorry.

259
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:25,198
Thank you.

260
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:26,724
President De La Russo.

261
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:28,005
Ms.

262
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:31,445
Miller, this just led to another subject.

263
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:36,567
Sorry about the communication, but who's responsible for reviewing the construction?

264
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:38,887
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:46,049
To make sure that everything was constructed correctly before you hand out the remaining $300,000 owed.

266
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,010
Our architect, as well as the DPW

267
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,558
director or commissioner.

268
00:15:55,678 --> 00:16:04,645
He is supposed to be reporting issues that are reported to him by the men and women who are in the building.

269
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,606
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:06,966
Go ahead.

271
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:11,610
Is there a designated person?

272
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:19,816
DPW commission is just going to go off of what's reported to him.

273
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:32,878
I think my concern stems from the warranty that had to do with the fire station repairs and the lack of foresight and ability to go after the warranty with the city.

274
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:41,279
So with regards to, is there a designated person that's going to go through that building inch by inch to make sure that everything was done correctly?

275
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,680
So in a half year, year, two years, we know.

276
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:52,659
that it was done properly and we're not going to have to expend any more money than what we have expended already.

277
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,621
So that was what the architect did do.

278
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,522
They came up with a punch list, which I understand to be complete.

279
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:08,585
And then after that, it's a matter of the people who are in the building to report if there are any further issues.

280
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:25,180
So through the chair, if I could ask that each individual sub-department head within the DPW go through their section of that building to report to Commissioner Geer and the architect with their findings.

281
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:27,582
My concern is that

282
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,021
you know, nobody's actually reviewing the building.

283
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:32,561
They're just, Oh, we have a leak.

284
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:33,362
Let me report it.

285
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:34,582
Do you know what I mean?

286
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,723
I understand what, I understand what you're saying.

287
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:41,064
So we've been trying to work on that meeting with, um, the DPW weekly.

288
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:45,205
Actually I have, and I've walked through the building a couple of times.

289
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:51,387
The last time I walked through was last week, um, with what I understand are the last issues.

290
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,448
So there were two roof leaks that were reported.

291
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,169
There was an issue with the,

292
00:17:56,621 --> 00:18:06,746
controls and controlling the temperature within the building as well as it's like a heating vent unit that seems to be leaking.

293
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:17,331
So, and it's really not unusual to have issues with new construction, especially on a building this size and of this scale.

294
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:23,134
And I called the president of the company who did the building myself,

295
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:28,246
And they were going to report back to us this week or early next week.

296
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:33,710
And with regards to the punch list, how many things are on the punch list to go through?

297
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,852
At this point, it really is just adjusting the controls.

298
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:43,877
There are some small issues still with those very large doors.

299
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,379
Again, it's a control electrical type of issue.

300
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,442
And the roof leaks as they're appearing.

301
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:10,492
I would suggest that not only do we have department heads go through that building, but we also have somebody from the building department to go through it in depth to create their own list to make sure that what we paid for was done correctly, so that, you know, this $300,000 is the last that we spend for a very long time.

302
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,614
Obviously, my frustration is coming out.

303
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:22,180
We have the issue with the fire department, you know, spent over a million dollars, and there was problems that, you know, we weren't going after through the warranty.

304
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:32,542
I don't want to be here two years from now with more requests for a leaky roof when it should have been fixed before this $300,000 is given to the contractor.

305
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:33,743
That's my concern.

306
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,886
This amendment will die when this paper is tabled.

307
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,890
If we can make that a B paper.

308
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,615
If I can make that a separate motion after the separate paper.

309
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:48,295
Yes.

310
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,238
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

311
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:53,544
Thank you, Mr. President.

312
00:19:54,844 --> 00:20:01,888
The question I had was, you broke it down by the cost of the building and also the cost of the remediation that was done.

313
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:09,391
And it seems, regarding the cost of the building, we came under budget, which is great news.

314
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:13,053
But how did we and what company did we use?

315
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:16,395
How did we come almost 100 percent off of the remediation?

316
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:20,717
To me, that's, you know, I could see 10, 20 percent on a building project.

317
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:24,489
When you're talking 100%, where was the mess up in this?

318
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:30,130
And what needed to take place that they didn't account for to double the remediation?

319
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,451
So the remediation was actually removing the contaminated soil.

320
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:46,133
And borings that had been done indicated a certain depth of contaminated soil, which turned out to be deeper and more widespread than we had originally anticipated.

321
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,033
Now, who did we pay to do that work?

322
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,494
The engineering firm.

323
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:49,834
Right.

324
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:57,643
Brown and Caldwell was the engineering firm that did that part of the work for us and designed the cleanup.

325
00:20:57,663 --> 00:21:09,266
So what recourse do we have as a city to go back to someone we paid, we hired them to do a detailed study, and then the study is inaccurate and cost us double the money?

326
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,526
What recourse do we have as a community?

327
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:14,067
Are we exploring what options we have?

328
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:18,168
With this particular project, because it was an environmental cleanup,

329
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:19,869
I am not sure.

330
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,670
We can certainly look into it.

331
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,673
But environmental contamination, as I understand it, is extremely difficult.

332
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,435
It's difficult to predict exactly where all the contaminants are.

333
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:36,678
And here we were trying to remove all of it so that the site is being closed right now.

334
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,439
There are no contaminants.

335
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:38,799
Right.

336
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,900
I understand that.

337
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,462
That's why we pay a company that's a professional company that does that for a living.

338
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:48,345
And if that was my home and I had to pay double what I paid

339
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:53,463
an expert to tell me what the cost was going to be, you know, there'd be some concern there.

340
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:57,925
So I just hope the city doesn't, you know, let this go by the wayside.

341
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:08,490
And I would ask, Mr. President, that we get a response back from the city solicitor, because, in my opinion, you know, that's why we bring in these outside consultants.

342
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,473
That's why we pay them hefty bills to make sure that

343
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:17,944
We're safeguarded as a community, because we don't know.

344
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:21,265
What if that mushroomed into a $3 million remediation?

345
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:23,305
Who would foot the bill then?

346
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,366
We would still foot the bill?

347
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:40,950
So, at some point, I think, you know, we have to turn around and say, I don't know what legal recourse we have, but I know in other building projects, and I can't remember who we got that information from, but the typical margin is, I think, 10 or 20 percent.

348
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:42,411
And to have 100 percent,

349
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:48,562
Is this far exceeds any standard, uh, that I'm aware of.

350
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:52,245
So the city solicitor is going to, uh, investigate.

351
00:22:54,547 --> 00:23:05,395
I don't, I don't see how we can approve this right now asking for additional money when, uh, you know, we hide, I'm sorry, that company Brown and Caldwell, uh, they're a nationally known company.

352
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:14,886
to come in and give us an estimate, tell us how deep the contaminants are, the width, and I'm sure that's all involved in the reporting, and they were off considerably.

353
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:21,130
I mean, you know, I don't, you know, I think, I agree with my counselor.

354
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:31,996
I think, Councilor Petra, I think we should lay this on the table for another week, get some more answers on this, even ask the mayor to consider taking this out of free cash, because there's millions of dollars in free cash.

355
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:34,498
He may have told you personally that

356
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,596
He wasn't going to do that, but maybe it should come from the council saying, hey, we'd like you to use free cash on this.

357
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:44,782
But I really believe that this could be a legal matter, Mr. President.

358
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:50,288
Maybe all it takes is the city solicitor writing him a letter and saying, are they aware that the cost overruns?

359
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:51,629
Yes, they were.

360
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,552
And what was their response?

361
00:23:55,408 --> 00:24:02,092
I'm sorry, I actually don't recall exactly what they responded, but there were issues that came up during the removal of the soil.

362
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:05,915
We'll have to go back and look at the file and I can come back.

363
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:06,775
What do they say?

364
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:12,959
If I was a contractor, someone came to me and said, hey, this is an overrun of a double what we anticipated.

365
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,220
I'd have to give some type of response.

366
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,621
It wouldn't be tough luck.

367
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,923
I mean, I mean, so I think we have to look at this, Mr. President.

368
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:22,645
And I would agree with my council colleague, Councilor Penta.

369
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,088
Thank you.

370
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,229
Counsel Max chair recognizes council care of yellow.

371
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:27,289
Thank you.

372
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,450
Mr. President, please.

373
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,591
Um, on what council Max brought up, do we have a contract with a brown cover?

374
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:33,532
Yes, we did.

375
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:38,874
What did their contracts say for the scope of work they were going to do for that?

376
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:45,456
Um, at, they were designing the remediation and the closeout of the site.

377
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:48,337
They also supervise the removal of the soil.

378
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:50,819
And then there was a cost associated.

379
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,063
I don't have the contract in front of me, but that was basically what the contract was for the DPW building.

380
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:59,346
But they specified that the contamination was within a certain area.

381
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:03,029
And once they started to work, they found that the contamination.

382
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,193
Yeah, they just gave us a cost estimate of what the soil remediation would be.

383
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:08,494
And we developed budgets.

384
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:11,036
And yeah, that's just where we are.

385
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:15,580
The estimate was under what we actually ended up expending.

386
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,342
You mentioned about the warranty of the building.

387
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,283
Does the warranty of the building start when we actually take possession of the building or are we already under the warranty now?

388
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,205
Um, I believe we're under the warranty.

389
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,947
There was substantial completion and the building was accepted.

390
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:35,550
I thought you said we don't have a final certificate of occupancy.

391
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,692
I thought you said we, we don't pay until we accept the building.

392
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:39,753
Right.

393
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:46,698
We don't have a final certificate of occupancy, so we have not paid the contractor, but the warranties are going to run.

394
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,532
from substantial completion date on the particular property.

395
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:55,295
So the different warranties are running from different periods of time, depending upon what they are.

396
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:56,455
When does the warranty expire?

397
00:25:56,956 --> 00:26:00,178
One year from whatever the date is in the document.

398
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:02,039
So we're almost out of warranty, correct?

399
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,959
Oh no, we are not.

400
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,981
I can get you the exact date.

401
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,402
We open the building like May?

402
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,757
Yes, but they were still working on the building.

403
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:15,357
We didn't move into the building at that point in time.

404
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,358
So I'd have to go back.

405
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:17,838
I'll have to get you the date.

406
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:29,000
I mean, I would feel comfortable if the warranty started on the day we actually took possession, which would be when we make our last final payments, rather than have the warranty start if it's a building we haven't accepted yet.

407
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,042
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

408
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:36,422
Chair recognizes Councilor Panetta.

409
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,562
Some interesting points here.

410
00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:44,244
Number one, the contract to build a building, was that an estimate by the contractor?

411
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:47,565
No, that was an estimate by the architect.

412
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,386
They were two different firms.

413
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:51,787
Listen, the building cost over $14 million.

414
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:53,908
The cost to remove that soil was in there.

415
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:54,888
It wasn't an estimate.

416
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,910
It was a cost that Brown and Caldwell gave to the city of Medford and signed a contract.

417
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,391
Now, this is really interesting for you guys and girls that are coming in next year.

418
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:06,673
Brown and Caldwell also happens to be the same people that are going to do the spot in West Medford.

419
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:08,548
and the city's own parking lot over there.

420
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:19,571
So if this is an example of their estimation of what needs to be done, the city really needs to take a hard look as to whether they're figures and whether they're really as good as they're supposed to be as good.

421
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:36,594
Now, if there's a time sequence and there is a damage clause in there that basically says that they're going to do this for the city at a particular cost, is there anything in the contract that says if they find something that was unanticipated or unexpected, then there would be a cost overrun to that?

422
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,523
Those are the words you need to look at to see if they're in the contract.

423
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:45,689
And if it's not in there, and if they're just giving you a document that says this is the cost overrun, well, the city shouldn't have to pay for it.

424
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:47,010
It's like you go to the store.

425
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,031
You see something on sale.

426
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:49,192
Whatever the sale is, that's it.

427
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:51,854
If they mismarked it, shame on the store.

428
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:52,595
They mismarked it.

429
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:54,817
I mean, this is crazy.

430
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:55,878
Think about this, Louise.

431
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:57,639
This is, you know, this does not make any sense.

432
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:11,446
What happens is Brown and Caldwell designs and plans for the contamination, then gives us an estimate of the cost of the remediation.

433
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:12,787
Did they do a sample survey?

434
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:13,747
Yes, they did.

435
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:20,529
And if they did the sample survey, they must have dug down into the ground to see how deep and how far they had to go to get that dirt out.

436
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:21,429
OK?

437
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:25,930
So why should the city of Medford now have to be paying for that for which they couldn't anticipate on?

438
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:28,602
Think about it, OK?

439
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:29,943
No, I understand what you're saying.

440
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:33,445
And that's totally unfair to the taxpayers of this community who have to pay for it.

441
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:38,408
I'm going to stick to my original thing, that the paper lay on the table until these questions, these legal questions, get answered.

442
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,589
Is that a motion?

443
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:40,289
Yes, it is.

444
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,133
On the motion that this paper be tabled, undebatable.

445
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:46,914
All those in favor?

446
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:47,394
Aye.

447
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:48,435
All those opposed?

448
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:49,856
The paper's tabled.

449
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,998
We're going to take that up with the papers in the hand of the clerk.

450
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:54,519
Is that all right?

451
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,799
So we can do it as?

452
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,340
Yes.

453
00:28:57,017 --> 00:29:01,040
I have it written down for myself and the Madame Clerk.

454
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:04,823
Is that satisfactory, Madame Vice President?

455
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:06,884
Thank you.

456
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:08,245
We are taking.

457
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:13,990
We've got these two more.

458
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,251
15735, loan order on the Carriage House, Brooks Estate, $200,000.

459
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:27,302
That's going to stay in committee.

460
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:31,265
Uh, that was still on the table though.

461
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:51,941
It was never sent into committee on the motion to take a 15, 7 35, uh, from the table, uh, to off the table and then to the committee of the whole, all those in favor, all those opposed.

462
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:57,597
15-736, loan order on Winthrop Street draining project.

463
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:07,741
Before us to report on this matter is Louise Miller, Director of Procurement, Budget, Finance.

464
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:08,541
Ms.

465
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:08,821
Miller.

466
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:10,782
All right.

467
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:14,024
So this is for $350,000.

468
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:17,625
So this project was the Winthrop Street rotary and drainage project.

469
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:33,920
which was a complex project with multiple funding sources, and there was an estimate for each funding source, and they did not divide up as we anticipated.

470
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:49,424
So our Chapter 90 reimbursable expenses ended up being under budget, left us short with our sewer, INI, and capital funding budget, and leaving us with a net deficit of $350,000.

471
00:30:52,105 --> 00:31:10,190
In addition, in this instance, the engineering firm didn't do what they were supposed to under the contract in terms of the borings so that the contractor found ledge.

472
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:17,613
After they started doing the work, it slowed down the project and cost the city.

473
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:25,060
Some pipes that had to be moved, some of the work had to be done by hand, additional police details.

474
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:42,385
And the total cost, there were conflicts with some unmarked duck bank and the ledge, which added quantities to rock that had to be removed and additional police details.

475
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:46,806
So in this instance, we have already spoken with the city solicitor.

476
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:53,513
We are pursuing the engineer for breach of contract.

477
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:56,956
We anticipate recovering a certain amount.

478
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:07,222
And because we anticipate this is going to litigation, I don't want to get too much into the details of where we are, what position we're in.

479
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:12,665
Point of information, Councilor Penta.

480
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:14,987
Doesn't a company such as this have to put up a bond?

481
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:17,807
Don't they have to put up a bond?

482
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:19,428
The people that are doing business with the city?

483
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:31,119
The construction company does, but there was nothing about their work that was not done according to construction standards.

484
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,482
The engineering firm, on the other hand, does not need to put up a bond.

485
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,044
Instead, they have insurance.

486
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:40,166
Was the engineering company a subcontractor to the contractor?

487
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:41,446
No, they're separate.

488
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,927
The engineering firm and the contractors are always separate.

489
00:32:43,947 --> 00:32:46,208
We have two different contracts with the firms.

490
00:32:46,388 --> 00:32:51,370
The contractor goes out to bid after the engineering firm designs the project.

491
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,012
So who are we paying the $350,000 to?

492
00:32:55,292 --> 00:33:02,454
Well, this is for the additional costs as a result of the issues that came up during the construction.

493
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:06,476
So the cost would go to the contractor, but we're trying to recover some of it

494
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:08,256
from the engineering firm.

495
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:11,639
But you also indicated that Chapter 90 funds were underfunded.

496
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,600
Well, no.

497
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,862
There, we just misestimated.

498
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:16,424
Who misestimated them?

499
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:16,824
We did?

500
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:17,525
We did.

501
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:18,225
The city did.

502
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:18,526
We did?

503
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:19,367
Yes, we did.

504
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,148
And who was supposed to take that?

505
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:22,429
Who misestimated?

506
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,171
Just our staff.

507
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:24,792
But who?

508
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:25,412
We misestimated.

509
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:26,073
What department?

510
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:29,783
I'd like to know.

511
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:34,286
Well, because it goes through a number of different eyes.

512
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:36,347
Somebody had to submit the number.

513
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:37,407
Who submitted the number, Louise?

514
00:33:38,728 --> 00:33:43,331
I'm going to take responsibility as a budget director for whatever numbers needed to be done for the city.

515
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:43,591
No, no, no.

516
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:44,151
Louise, it's not your job.

517
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,292
It had to be a department that was responsible for this.

518
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:49,654
Yeah, purchasing.

519
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:50,094
It's me.

520
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:52,636
What's purchasing?

521
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:56,738
City engineer's office?

522
00:33:57,531 --> 00:33:59,291
Somebody had to put these numbers together, Chapter 90.

523
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:00,852
Yep, we did.

524
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,912
We put the numbers together.

525
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:04,613
So who is this conclave of people?

526
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:07,473
I mean, listen, understand something here, you know.

527
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:12,095
You're being too honest by not being honest enough, okay?

528
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,715
You have a job and I have a job to do here.

529
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:17,056
My job right now until the end of this year is to make sure how these monies are spent.

530
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:22,117
And if somebody mis-estimated in their job, misappropriated or whatever it might, misfunded,

531
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,208
This council needs to know what's going on here.

532
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,749
That's the problem around here.

533
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:28,549
Nobody wants, everybody hides everything.

534
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:29,390
Everything is hush-hush.

535
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,931
If it was misappropriated or mis-underfunded, what department did it?

536
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,551
Maybe they need help in estimating, you know?

537
00:34:37,532 --> 00:34:41,673
Maybe we need someone to go out to these departments when jobs like this take place.

538
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:47,914
Now, we all know this was a complex job because I saw it every day when you went to, and I saw a lot of the ledge and everything that was going on over there.

539
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:51,075
But the Chapter 90 funds, that comes from the state.

540
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:53,437
They give you a dollar amount, and that's it.

541
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:54,437
Yes, it does.

542
00:34:54,897 --> 00:35:03,880
And I actually was part of conference calls with Chapter 90 regarding what portion of the drainage they would pay for versus paving.

543
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:17,725
And because of the way the drainage was, they agreed to pay a certain amount, which we thought was more than what we actually expended on the drainage, as opposed to what really is water and sewage.

544
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:18,946
How much money came from Chapter 90 in this?

545
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,007
I'll have to, um, I have to look that up.

546
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:23,627
I'm not sure.

547
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,988
This was almost a $3 million project.

548
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,728
I want to say it was close to a million dollars.

549
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:28,749
Okay.

550
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,570
And that's the city of Medford sending in that estimate, correct?

551
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:33,971
Yes.

552
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:40,233
With our estimated quantities and chapter 90, what they do is they just review it and tell us whether these are eligible costs or not.

553
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,474
And so somebody from the city had to send that in.

554
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:46,135
That is correct.

555
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:53,182
I would just hope next year things are really done different around here.

556
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:55,364
This is really unfair.

557
00:35:56,805 --> 00:36:03,070
You do a project, and what's underestimated, and what's underestimated, what's overestimated, what's coming in, what's going in?

558
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,935
And then we're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash, $7 million in an enterprise fund.

559
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:09,896
We haven't seen anything.

560
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:12,878
Why isn't the money even coming out of the enterprise fund for this?

561
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:14,459
It's a water and soil project.

562
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,121
Why are we even bonding for this?

563
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:19,776
Again, it's the administration's decision.

564
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:28,179
Again, I would hope the Council takes a hard look at this and just saying, hey, you know, the water rates are almost off by $2 million this year.

565
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,480
And I hope that's corrected in some shape, manner, or form, and that the taxpayer doesn't have to pay for it because you're sitting on $7.5 million of a surplus account.

566
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,800
Here's another $350,000.

567
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:41,882
And God knows, if the engineers has any brains, we'll probably file bankruptcy, and you'll never see a dime from this.

568
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:45,803
This is just a shame, Mr. President, because

569
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:50,748
This is what you get for having a lack of communication, a complete lack of communication.

570
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:57,232
We're finding out at the end of the tunnel, not in the beginning or during the middle of it while it's being worked upon, at the end of the fund.

571
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:59,073
Now, when did you get this bill for $350,000?

572
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:08,658
We did become aware of cost overruns during, obviously, while the project was taking place.

573
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:09,498
Like when?

574
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:10,399
July, August?

575
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:10,919
Last summer.

576
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,200
Last summer.

577
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,461
Here we are, November 17.

578
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:26,158
So one thing I will say at the time, we did think we were going to try to reappropriate excess funds that we have in our MSBA projects, but those have not closed out yet.

579
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:34,240
So we were going to come to council and ask for the loan or to be transferred from the loan, be transferred from one project to another.

580
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:40,482
Unfortunately, we're still working on closing out the paperwork for those projects and those came in under budget.

581
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,562
Thank you, President De La Russo.

582
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:50,244
I'm going to move eventually to table this paper as well.

583
00:37:50,324 --> 00:38:00,312
I truly feel that we need a written explanation, not only a cost breakdown of the $3 million, but at the very least, a cost breakdown of the overages of the $350,000.

584
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:02,934
I appreciate Ms.

585
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:11,241
Miller being here before us, but I feel like just throwing out police details, ledge, rock, removed, borings is not a good enough explanation.

586
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:13,463
I would not be able to explain to the taxpayer

587
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:17,944
why we're taking either $350,000 from free cash or going out to bond for $350,000.

588
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,785
I don't think it's fair.

589
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,806
I don't think it's fair to the council.

590
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:29,448
And I thankfully got a quick call from the mayor today, but it's at the last hour.

591
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:32,749
It's not a detailed explanation.

592
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,270
It's just not enough.

593
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,290
It's not enough.

594
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:39,371
How much in police detail?

595
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:42,312
How much additional ledge had to be removed?

596
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:46,443
What pipe, what piping needed, how much piping needed to be relocated?

597
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:46,443
$350,000.

598
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:56,185
When we, I get a call today and we, and they knew about the override, you know, the overages, I believe summer of 2014 or 2015.

599
00:38:57,445 --> 00:39:01,706
I mean, I didn't know, I don't even know.

600
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:01,706
2014.

601
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,446
Whenever the project was under construction.

602
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:05,367
Well, it started in 14.

603
00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:09,947
So we've known, you know, this is the, as of last week, it's the first time I've known of any $350,000.

604
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:15,274
additional expense for the project.

605
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:24,680
It's a lot of money, so that's $650,000 in overages for projects, two projects that were done within the last year and a half in this city.

606
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:38,090
I really hope that there's more oversight to projects that are done in the future, and I hope that we can start getting written explanations to things.

607
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:40,807
For us to be scrambling — you know, I wanted to hear what Ms.

608
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:41,487
Miller had to say.

609
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,168
I want to — I want the information.

610
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:50,190
But for me to be scrambling, trying to find paper to take notes on so that I can explain to somebody who reaches out to me tomorrow, what did you vote on?

611
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:53,532
And I say, some details, some ledge, some borings, pipes.

612
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:54,932
It's just not enough.

613
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,114
We — we are elected by the taxpayer.

614
00:40:01,955 --> 00:40:06,917
Mr. President, if I may, just for the record today, I understand you're going to be requesting for —

615
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,308
further information, but I did have some detail.

616
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:17,250
It was $155,000 for the conflict with an unmarked duck bank and a water main relocation.

617
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:26,854
There were $80,000 in additional police details and $97,000 in additional quantities of material.

618
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:35,717
I didn't work out all the, down to the final tens of thousands, but those were the three big items.

619
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:37,752
Point of further information.

620
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:39,813
Point of further information.

621
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:40,594
Counsel Penta.

622
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:44,376
Louise, she said something very, very important.

623
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:45,236
Did you hear what she said?

624
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:47,997
She said she got a phone call.

625
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:49,818
Let me ask everyone around this room.

626
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:50,759
Did you all get phone calls?

627
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,321
You know, this is how this building has been operating.

628
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,862
It picks and chooses whatever it wants, when it wants.

629
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:58,543
It is so terribly wrong.

630
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,564
And I would just hope the new administration doesn't do this.

631
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,686
Pick you off one at a time, get your full votes and see you later.

632
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:05,126
And goodbye.

633
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,282
That's the most despicable way to run a government.

634
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,104
It's terrible.

635
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:12,205
Thank you, Counsel, for your point of information.

636
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:13,807
Chair recognizes Counsel Caviello.

637
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:14,808
Thank you, Mr. President.

638
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:19,251
Louise, are we seeking full restitution from the engineering firm?

639
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:20,593
Yes, we are.

640
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:27,679
But I estimated what we would actually recover.

641
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,583
And I can— I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

642
00:41:33,673 --> 00:41:34,894
I'm sorry, could you repeat that, Louise?

643
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,054
Under that's a litigation, yeah.

644
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,515
Louise, I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

645
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:39,955
Point of information, Counselor Knight.

646
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:50,719
If, in fact, the matter is something that's going to go into litigation, I think that we need to err on the side of caution and not disclose too much in terms of what our litigation position is, our litigation strategies at this point in time, Mr. President.

647
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:55,601
I think we've raised enough questions here for us to understand that the paper's not going to go through tonight, it's not going to pass tonight.

648
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:56,321
Ms.

649
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,062
Millers gave us a breakdown of what looks like $155,000 for

650
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:03,716
replacement, a main replacement, $80,000 for police details, $90,000 for materials.

651
00:42:03,736 --> 00:42:06,277
So we have some understanding, but we need to have more understanding.

652
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:09,079
I'm just very concerned if, in fact, we owe the money.

653
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,960
We're going to have to pay the money sometime to somebody.

654
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:17,225
The question is whether or not we're going to be able to recuperate it and how much we're going to be able to recuperate back during the separation process.

655
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:23,589
And I'd be very cautious in compromising our position in separation moving forward, Mr. President.

656
00:42:23,629 --> 00:42:24,489
I mean, ultimately,

657
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:27,478
You know, the overruns are there.

658
00:42:27,518 --> 00:42:29,979
We need to find out what they're for, what they're from, and that's OK and fine.

659
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:33,380
But we also need to protect our interests, and we need to protect our position in litigation.

660
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,241
So with that being said, I rest, and I thank you, Counselor, for allowing me to make the point.

661
00:42:38,101 --> 00:42:40,582
I was just asking if we were seeking full restitution.

662
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:41,962
Yes, we are.

663
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:51,604
In the event that full restitution is not made to us, would the Water and Sewer Enterprise account, would this project fall under that?

664
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,303
I think some portion of it could.

665
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:59,765
So just say, for instance, we only recounted 150.

666
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:01,647
We can maybe take it from there.

667
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:01,927
Okay.

668
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:02,507
Thank you.

669
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:05,329
Thank you.

670
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,150
Councilor Canfield.

671
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,012
I think a citizen wants to speak behind you.

672
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:13,795
Please state your name and address for the record.

673
00:43:13,835 --> 00:43:14,135
Welcome.

674
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:16,036
Hi, my name is Michael Wajiro.

675
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:17,417
I live on 18 Pembroke street.

676
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:19,899
Um, there's a couple of points I want to,

677
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:23,870
that it's sort of floating in the air right now that's very frustrating.

678
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,033
The first is just a general lack of transparency that's available to us as citizens.

679
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:43,343
If six members of the people that we elect to actually review these documents aren't receiving the documents within a year and a half, we have to ask, how could the average citizen ever find this out?

680
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:47,146
How could the average citizen ever find out that we have all of these overrides?

681
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:48,967
That's the first point I wish to make.

682
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:53,466
The second point I wish to make is about mistakes and how we handle mistakes.

683
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:59,188
I think it is poisonous for us to make mistakes and then just say, oh, no problem.

684
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,028
Let's just go out to bond.

685
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,230
It is not how we handle our errors.

686
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:07,172
When we do make mistakes, it's like free money.

687
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:08,492
We just go fishing in bond.

688
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:17,936
If we actually have to take the money out of our general fund, then we'll actually feel it versus some future date that's going to be thrown down the line.

689
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,045
We have to ask ourselves, is this a general trend?

690
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:23,705
Maybe it's a one-time mistake.

691
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:25,586
Maybe it's $350,000.

692
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:26,526
It happens.

693
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:29,627
Projects do go over.

694
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:31,307
Maybe this is just a one-time thing.

695
00:44:31,328 --> 00:44:35,169
But haven't we seen this reoccurring over and over and over again?

696
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:46,392
I ask the council to respectfully avoid using the easy motion of just simply going out to bond when we make mistakes like this.

697
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:49,413
We have to start paying for them, because then we'll actually start feeling them.

698
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:50,125
Thank you.

699
00:44:51,506 --> 00:44:51,846
Thank you.

700
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:54,447
Welcome.

701
00:44:54,587 --> 00:44:56,208
Please state your name and address for the record.

702
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:57,848
Thank you.

703
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:01,170
Andrew Castanetti, Cushion Street, Bedford, Massachusetts.

704
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:07,692
I have a question for the chair, for the budget director, Louise Miller.

705
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,315
This talk about

706
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:16,765
floating a bond to pay for some of these things.

707
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:24,853
Knowing that the United States national debt is over $18 trillion, I'd like to ask her a question through the chair.

708
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:33,282
And that is, what is the total 0 to 155 for method bond debt as we speak today in 2015, please?

709
00:45:50,976 --> 00:46:00,800
So the total interest balance as of July 1, 2015, is approximately $15 million.

710
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,202
And the total principal balance as of July 1, 2015, is approximately $60,800,000.

711
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:15,203
That's a total outstanding balance.

712
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:17,084
But those are not what our payments are.

713
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:21,305
Our payments are obviously much less than that.

714
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,626
That's just a total outstanding debt.

715
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:25,587
Is that the question?

716
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:30,469
If you could repeat that, Ms.

717
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:30,830
Miller.

718
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:33,931
Yes.

719
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:42,255
The total principal balance outstanding is approximately $60 million.

720
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:53,089
$800,000, and the total interest balance, and I'm rounding as I add these up, is approximately $15,650,000.

721
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:53,910
Sixteen.

722
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,033
He asked for the total amount that was outstanding.

723
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:16,243
The document that I have includes the three loan orders, so they have to be backed out of the total.

724
00:47:19,764 --> 00:47:20,304
Thank you, Ms.

725
00:47:20,324 --> 00:47:20,584
Miller.

726
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,544
Chair awaits a motion.

727
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:32,146
On the motion of council, appended to table the, uh, paper until we receive further information.

728
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:36,127
Your questions will be added with the, uh, papers in the hand of the clerk.

729
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,060
written responses.

730
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:41,702
Yes.

731
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:47,086
So we'll, we'll have a chance to adjust that as we, as I read it.

732
00:47:47,446 --> 00:47:54,870
So on that motion to table, all those in favor, all those opposed make this table on motion of council night to revert back to the regular order of business.

733
00:47:54,911 --> 00:48:02,035
All those in favor, all those opposed 15 dash seven 49 motions, orders, and resolutions offered by counselor night.

734
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:10,812
Be it resolved the city council meet with the chief of police and city solicitor to craft an ordinance banning replica handguns in public places.

735
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:12,193
Councilor Knight.

736
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:13,974
Mr. President, thank you very much.

737
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:16,735
And thank you for entertaining this resolution this evening.

738
00:48:17,776 --> 00:48:27,501
Recently, the city of Boston on November 9th had signed into law the banning of replica handguns in public places as an effort to provide our police officers

739
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:45,748
with safer streets to work in, in an effort to provide our children with an understanding that the use of replica handguns are relatively dangerous in public places, and to protect the citizenry from the use of replica handguns in criminal activities, Mr. President.

740
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:53,481
On November 9th, Mayor Walsh signed this local ordinance in the city of Boston into effect.

741
00:48:54,361 --> 00:49:01,383
On November 10th, in the city of Medford, a gentleman was arrested for brandishing a replica handgun in a road rage incident on Mystic Avenue, Mr. President.

742
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:10,326
So I think it's safe to say that the city of Medford is not exempt from these type of actions and from the harm that can be caused by replica handguns in our community.

743
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:14,447
In this packet that I put together and had the messenger distribute to my

744
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:22,782
Council colleagues, I've put together a couple of different materials relative to other communities that have done this, not here in Massachusetts, but across the nation.

745
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:31,985
And when I take a look from the back forward, you'll see Dallas, Texas has an ordinance that restricts and regulates the use of replica handguns in public places.

746
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:36,727
You'll see that Beaverton, Oregon has similar laws in effect.

747
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,928
You'll see that Minneapolis, Minnesota has similar laws that are in effect, Mr. President.

748
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:44,549
New York City has actually gone a step further and has

749
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:51,098
required that the sale of imitation guns in colors such as black, blue, silver, or aluminum is prohibited in New York City.

750
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:54,420
And those stores are not able to carry those in New York City.

751
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:02,326
So I think that this is an ability for us to sit down and to help make Medford a safer place for our police officers, for our children, and for the residents.

752
00:50:03,387 --> 00:50:07,430
So Mr. President, I'd ask that the consulate detain this motion to vote in the affirmative.

753
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:15,257
to have a meeting with the chief of police and the city solicitor to craft an ordinance that will work best for Medford in keeping our residents and our police officers and our children safe.

754
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:16,398
Very good.

755
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:18,319
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

756
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,761
Did you wish to speak on this item before us, sir, before we call the roll?

757
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,462
Yes, Council President, I would like to.

758
00:50:25,303 --> 00:50:25,863
Thank you very much.

759
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:29,905
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

760
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:34,247
Turn on your Saturday morning cartoons and you see guns.

761
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:36,929
You see cartoon characters.

762
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:41,385
brandishing guns, and you go into your toy store and you see guns.

763
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:46,629
So, on one hand, we have kids using replica guns.

764
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,933
On the other hand, we now want to ban them in public places.

765
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:55,537
Last year, there was a box cutter on that windowsill for months.

766
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:59,240
There was a dirty steak knife on a box outside for months.

767
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,945
It was my magazine, my proactive work that got the knife and the box cutter removed.

768
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:11,867
But we've had the police up here when two politicians were arguing outside just a month ago.

769
00:51:12,588 --> 00:51:19,691
I was talking about the, um, that bill that passed the question one and there were two politicians out there fighting and the police had to come.

770
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:26,134
You come to a city council where police are a constant presence and there are knives out there.

771
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:31,316
I would ask that this city councilor who puts this motion forward would better clean up his backyard first.

772
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:36,732
before he comes up with these cockamamie ideas, start being proactive, not reactive.

773
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:37,512
Thank you.

774
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,835
On the motion of Councillor Knight, all those in favour?

775
00:51:42,818 --> 00:51:43,839
Please state your name and address.

776
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:45,500
Jean Martin, Tate Coming Street.

777
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,582
I'm actually in favour of this.

778
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:50,705
You know, what happened 20 years ago is not what goes on today.

779
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:57,598
Unfortunately, kids can't play with guns the way I grew up playing with guns.

780
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:03,303
Fake guns look real today, and if I was a police officer, you can't take that chance.

781
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:05,706
Unfortunately, you can't take that chance.

782
00:52:06,146 --> 00:52:08,348
There's too many on the streets.

783
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:12,392
And at one time, I had a BB gun, and I gave it up because it looked too real.

784
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:18,026
And I wanted to pick off some squirrels, but I didn't.

785
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:21,890
I called the appropriate authorities to have them come out of my attic, but I did.

786
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:27,236
But I gave up my BB gun because it looked so real, and with my reputation.

787
00:52:27,696 --> 00:52:31,260
But I didn't want anybody thinking that I was dangerous.

788
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,065
But it is not the times that we used to have.

789
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:41,501
So I just want to say that I support this, because you can't take that chance.

790
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:46,164
Unfortunately, and parents need to make their kids aware of it, that they look too real.

791
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:49,606
And you have to err on the side of caution sometimes.

792
00:52:49,886 --> 00:52:52,107
And that might lead to a death when it's just a toy.

793
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:52,788
Thank you.

794
00:52:53,348 --> 00:52:58,771
On the motion of council, if I may, the data would reflect that this is not cockamamie at all.

795
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,453
But otherwise, in the city of Boston, for example,

796
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:14,318
Between January 2014 and April 2015, replica firearms were used in at least 113 incidents that included assault and battery, robbery, drug dealing, destruction of property, breaking and entering, and home invasion, Mr. President.

797
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,139
That's according to police department data.

798
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:26,660
And also, during the 2014 school year in the city of Boston, 15 replica guns were seized in the public schools, and this year, 13 have been seized.

799
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:31,601
So, Mr. President, I definitely think there is a need for us to take a look at this, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

800
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:38,065
I just want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

801
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:44,289
I just would make one amendment to give the Councilors time to review the ordinance and review the packet that we got.

802
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:53,495
Possibly change the language to meet with the Chief of Police and City Solicitor to begin discussion and possibly draft and craft an ordinance banning.

803
00:53:54,035 --> 00:54:01,260
Just to give us, you know, rather than say we're 100% for it or against it in the resolve, I'd like, you know, time to, you know, to discuss it.

804
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:02,542
review the actual ordinance.

805
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:05,603
I think it's about four or five pages long, which we just got tonight.

806
00:54:05,663 --> 00:54:14,805
So those materials, none of the materials included in the packet or a draft ordinance in terms of what I'm looking for the city to do.

807
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:21,906
I think that this is going to be best done to sit down with our chief of police and to craft something that he feels would be right for Medford.

808
00:54:22,246 --> 00:54:25,947
Um, what I included in here was just an illustration of other communities that have done this going back to 2007 and

809
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:36,504
I included a copy of Dallas, Texas's ordinance just because it was very surprising to me to see a state like Texas and a community like Dallas actually putting restrictions on anything that shoots anything.

810
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:43,429
So, Mr. President, I thought that that was one of the reasons why this would be very helpful to show that it doesn't just happen in Massachusetts.

811
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,431
It's a problem in Oregon, it's a problem in California, a problem in Texas.

812
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:49,313
If it's a problem in other places across the nation.

813
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,136
We're not going to be exempt from it either.

814
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:58,418
So I think it's a proactive approach to addressing an issue that really hasn't cropped its head up in our city too much, but we have seen it within the last two weeks.

815
00:54:58,758 --> 00:54:58,939
Yes.

816
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,880
Hi, you wish to speak?

817
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,300
Welcome.

818
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,961
Please state your name and address for the record.

819
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:06,401
Thank you, Mr. President.

820
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:10,343
Uh, Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street, uh, through the chair.

821
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:18,326
Uh, while it's important for the topic of safety, if we're looking at other cities and towns across the nation and what they do,

822
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:38,149
The town of Kennesaw, Georgia, actually passed a law that required all households to have at least one firearm and ammunition on hand, and it dropped the crime rate in that town to practically nonexistent.

823
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:39,330
Thank you, Mr. President.

824
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,592
On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

825
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:43,293
As amended.

826
00:55:44,828 --> 00:55:46,569
Roll call vote has been requested.

827
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:48,650
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

828
00:55:52,913 --> 00:55:54,374
Yes, it was as amended.

829
00:55:54,414 --> 00:55:57,615
Councilor Pinto, you wish to speak on this before we call the roll?

830
00:55:57,796 --> 00:56:03,759
I don't know if the intent of the resolution is to ban any type of a handgun or a replica of a handgun.

831
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:15,500
The intent of the resolution is to craft an ordinance that would work for the City of Medford that would be similar to what the City of Boston has done.

832
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:24,682
If you look at the City of Boston's ordinance, Mr. President, a minor in a possession of a replica firearm in a public place, the replica firearm would be confiscated.

833
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:26,262
It would be brought back to the police station.

834
00:56:26,322 --> 00:56:29,263
The minor would have to come back with their parent to receive the weapon.

835
00:56:30,283 --> 00:56:33,524
If it's confiscated from an adult, the adult has a 24-hour cooling off period.

836
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,732
before they're allowed to receive the replica firearm back.

837
00:56:38,452 --> 00:56:50,998
There are certain controls and requirements like an orange tip and green tape or paint on it to make it stand out so that police officers can discern these toy guns from real guns.

838
00:56:51,058 --> 00:57:00,483
I mean, the last thing that we want to hear in this community is that a police officer is involved in a shots fired call with somebody that has a replica or a toy gun in their hand.

839
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:09,810
Also, if you look at some of the statistics and the data, and I don't have them in front of me here, Mr. President, but based on my remembrance from the research I did, there's a thing that's called suicide by co-op.

840
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:18,454
And in 48 percent of the instances of unarmed individuals, they considered them unarmed individuals because they had replica guns.

841
00:57:18,494 --> 00:57:19,354
They weren't real guns.

842
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:22,595
But yet, the police executed them.

843
00:57:22,955 --> 00:57:26,337
Not executed them, but used deadly force to stop the threat, Mr. President.

844
00:57:26,437 --> 00:57:29,938
But in those situations, they determined that those people were unarmed because they had no

845
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,208
real firearm, but rather a replica gun.

846
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:41,751
So I think that the intent of the resolution is to sit down with the chief of police, to sit down with members of this council and our solicitor, to come up with a legally sound resolution.

847
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:45,572
I mean, an ordinance that would absolutely and positively protect our community here in Medford.

848
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:47,853
Thank you, Counselor.

849
00:57:48,273 --> 00:57:49,333
Counselor Pinto, are you all set?

850
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:49,633
No.

851
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:50,494
Please.

852
00:57:50,694 --> 00:57:57,656
The difference between having a replica gun and the appearance of a replica gun are like night and day.

853
00:57:57,676 --> 00:58:00,257
The state of New York made it very imperative

854
00:58:00,638 --> 00:58:09,504
The colors are black, silver, I think dark blue, and there was four dark colors that they, aluminum, they would prohibit toy manufacturers from making guns like that.

855
00:58:09,544 --> 00:58:13,766
But you could still have a gun that looks like a gun, but it could be in a different color.

856
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:22,632
And they believe there's a $300,000 fine that's attached to a gun manufacturer who makes a gun with those colors on it.

857
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:27,555
I think what you really need to take a look at is you're not banning it.

858
00:58:27,615 --> 00:58:30,117
What you're doing is you're controlling whatever it might be.

859
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:38,580
Now, Councilor Knight just alluded to the fact that a black gun, I believe a black gun, the way the standard was, had to be painted orange by the nozzle, by the barrel.

860
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:41,882
And what some of these kids are doing is they're painting it black to match the gun.

861
00:58:41,942 --> 00:58:45,844
Now, that puts a policeman in a very, you know, compromising position.

862
00:58:45,884 --> 00:58:48,406
He doesn't know if that gun is going to be real, fake, or whatever it might be.

863
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,567
And I think that's one of the concerns that have been brought about.

864
00:58:52,048 --> 00:58:59,932
But I think New York sort of like went about it the right way, because what they did in New York, as I said, they took a color and they made it iridescent, flashy, whatever it has to be.

865
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:09,403
If a toy manufacturer wants to make a gun, the four colors that they took off the shelf that they could not put on, could not put on a gun, they could not sell it that way, so be it.

866
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:16,907
Now, if a kid gets the gun and he decides to modify it, once again, you're talking another incident because what's he doing?

867
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,408
It's either one of two things.

868
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:28,693
It's going to have a strict appearance in the sale of the gun or the toy gun, or are you going to just eliminate them all together?

869
00:59:29,822 --> 00:59:32,424
You know, the question is, do you take the chance or you don't take the chance?

870
00:59:32,825 --> 00:59:37,869
And maybe the middle of the road is to go by way of having a strict appearance first and see where that goes.

871
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:44,576
A fine this heavy, $300,000, is a pretty heavy fine to sell a gun that does not have a strict appearance to it.

872
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:47,558
So I would say— This is a beginning to a process.

873
00:59:47,578 --> 00:59:51,582
No, I understand that, but I would suggest that that type of information be forwarded

874
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:52,835
to your subcommittee.

875
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:54,776
I certainly agree, Councilor Pender.

876
00:59:54,796 --> 01:00:04,561
I think that New York, and this is a city law, it's not New York State's law, it's New York City's actual local ordinance that prohibits the sale of any toy gun unless it's completely brightly colored.

877
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:09,163
And one of the things that Councilor Pender keeps referring to is the $300 in fines.

878
01:00:09,183 --> 01:00:18,187
Those were $300,000 in fines that were levied upon businesses like Amazon and eBay who were violating the local ordinance and actually selling

879
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:26,376
In Wal-Mart stores, actually, was one of the big purveyors of these replica firearms to New York City in violation of the local ordinance.

880
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:28,817
And that's where a lot of that recovery came from, Mr. President.

881
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:37,079
But again, Councilor Pinto, I couldn't agree with you more in terms of looking at it and saying, should these replica handguns in the city of Medford, if they're being sold there, be brightly colored?

882
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:38,700
I don't think that that's a problem.

883
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,880
I think that's something that should be a great discussion topic.

884
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:47,162
And I also think that there really is no place for replica handguns in our parks, in our public parks, in our public schools, in our public buildings.

885
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,425
So, you know, that's why I brought the resolution forward, Mr. President.

886
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:59,133
So, on the motion of Council Knight, as amended by Vice President Leclerc, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

887
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:04,657
Yes.

888
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:05,998
Yes.

889
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,780
Yes.

890
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:10,122
Yes.

891
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:10,482
Yes.

892
01:01:10,682 --> 01:01:10,922
Yes.

893
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:16,067
With a vote of six in the affirmative and one absent, the motion passes.

894
01:01:16,604 --> 01:01:19,325
15-750 offered by Councilor Knight.

895
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:28,548
Be it resolved that the City Council request the implementation of pedestrian crossing controls at the intersection of George and Main Street.

896
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:29,248
Councilor Knight.

897
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:32,729
Mr. President, I think that this resolution speaks for itself.

898
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:39,771
I got a call from a couple of constituents, one of whom is in the room this evening, whose birthday may be coming up, if I understand correctly.

899
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,712
And this is an issue of importance to them.

900
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,573
And I think it's an issue, it should be an issue of importance to us as well, Mr. President.

901
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:51,417
The 101 bus, for example, travels up and down Main Street all day long, and it makes stops right at George Street in Maine.

902
01:01:52,098 --> 01:02:02,663
There are no pedestrian crossing controls at George Street in Maine, which is a heavily traveled thoroughfare, and buses along that route have pretty high ridership, Mr. President.

903
01:02:03,003 --> 01:02:07,025
So in the interest of public safety and keeping our pedestrians safe, I brought this resolution forward.

904
01:02:07,065 --> 01:02:08,365
I think it's a good idea.

905
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:13,287
long in the waiting, but it's something that's necessary.

906
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:22,094
And as the sun goes down a little bit earlier here, and people are getting home from work at 4, 5, and 6 o'clock at night when it's dark out, it highlights the problem even more, Mr. President.

907
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,577
So I'd ask that my fellow colleagues support me in voting in the affirmative for the resolution.

908
01:02:25,597 --> 01:02:32,082
I'd like to add that now, the result of an effort by our own councillor, Penta.

909
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:34,724
Ma'am, you wish to address the council.

910
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:36,245
Please state your name and address for the record.

911
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:37,185
I would, sir.

912
01:02:37,205 --> 01:02:37,926
Thank you very much.

913
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:47,976
Okay, thanks.

914
01:02:48,717 --> 01:02:53,182
Hi, I'm Rachel Tandenhouse, 26 Pearl Street, Medford.

915
01:02:54,363 --> 01:02:56,586
I would like to speak in support of this.

916
01:02:57,347 --> 01:03:01,412
I live around the corner from there, from Georgia, Maine.

917
01:03:01,992 --> 01:03:03,572
It is a major bus stop for me.

918
01:03:03,592 --> 01:03:04,853
The 96 goes there.

919
01:03:04,873 --> 01:03:06,013
The 101 goes there.

920
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:08,234
Those are the buses that pass closest to my house.

921
01:03:08,674 --> 01:03:14,515
And that's how I get to work every day, is by the 101 or the 96.

922
01:03:14,955 --> 01:03:16,276
I'm also blind.

923
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,997
And I think I get around pretty okay.

924
01:03:21,077 --> 01:03:22,397
And I do my best.

925
01:03:22,477 --> 01:03:25,578
And I have this awesome guide dog here that helps me out.

926
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:30,459
But some intersections are certainly more challenging than others.

927
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,331
And this is absolutely one of them.

928
01:03:34,412 --> 01:03:37,056
It's a really difficult one to navigate.

929
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:41,583
Nobody, whether you can see or not, can really tell what's coming around a corner.

930
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:45,297
And people come zooming through.

931
01:03:45,558 --> 01:03:49,721
And just some sort of, I mean, I would be very excited about a traffic light.

932
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:53,104
But some sort of traffic calming measure would be pretty exciting.

933
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:57,767
I think that that would do a lot for my safety and my independence.

934
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:04,993
And frankly, the cars don't really care if they run over a blind person or a sighted one, so I bet it would do wonders for everybody else too.

935
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:10,298
And I appreciate very much your bringing this up.

936
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:12,929
love Medford very, very much.

937
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:14,890
Um, it occasionally tries to kill me.

938
01:04:15,671 --> 01:04:17,752
And, um, well, I know it's not personal.

939
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:25,538
Uh, you know, this is one of the intersections that would, uh, do wonders for my safety and, and that of my neighbors.

940
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:29,340
And if you ever want to hear about any of the other ones, you know, let me know.

941
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:31,002
Thanks.

942
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:31,502
Thank you.

943
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,444
On the motion approved by council and I'd all those in favor.

944
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,065
Oh, madam vice president.

945
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:36,746
You want to speak on this?

946
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:37,326
I apologize.

947
01:04:37,504 --> 01:04:38,945
Quickly, thank you, President De La Russo.

948
01:04:38,985 --> 01:04:40,965
I think it's a very good resolution.

949
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:43,226
I also got a couple emails this week on it.

950
01:04:43,566 --> 01:04:57,772
It reminds me of Winthrop and George a couple years ago where we had a couple, I believe somebody was injured very badly at that intersection and we did traffic calming approaches.

951
01:04:57,832 --> 01:05:01,273
We installed a raised crosswalk very close by.

952
01:05:01,373 --> 01:05:06,915
So this is parallel to that and definitely a speedway that needs some attention.

953
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,021
You wish to speak on this matter?

954
01:05:11,622 --> 01:05:12,163
Councilor Knight?

955
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:18,428
If we could also send this paper to the Pedestrian Committee to add to one of their list of intersections of concern, I'd appreciate it.

956
01:05:19,288 --> 01:05:22,931
So that this be sent to the Pedestrian Committee?

957
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:24,412
Yes.

958
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:24,873
Ms.

959
01:05:24,913 --> 01:05:32,599
McGivern has been working with the Pedestrian Committee to implement some safety controls in our community to make Medford a safer place for those who choose to walk.

960
01:05:32,919 --> 01:05:33,260
Very good.

961
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,583
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, that this paper be sent

962
01:05:37,987 --> 01:05:39,227
to the pedestrian committee.

963
01:05:39,588 --> 01:05:41,888
Did the vice president have a amendment there too?

964
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,969
No.

965
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:45,590
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

966
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,971
My name is Mario Martin from 198 Harvard.

967
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,572
And I actually think this is a really good resolution.

968
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:58,714
But I was wondering, because basically on Main Street, there are several stops.

969
01:05:59,775 --> 01:06:05,817
And I was actually wondering if, in addition to this, would there be some sort of possibility where we can, you know,

970
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:13,471
offer sidewalks on pretty much all of the bus stops on Main Street and South Medford as well.

971
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:27,837
More particularly, I think it's Wellesley Street, the corner of Wellesley Street and Main Street, where I know that there's an elderly couple that lives on Main Street that usually tries to cross the street.

972
01:06:27,857 --> 01:06:33,419
And as I forget who mentioned it, but at nighttime, it's incredibly difficult to cross the street.

973
01:06:33,439 --> 01:06:35,480
Well, I mean, it's incredibly dangerous.

974
01:06:36,536 --> 01:06:37,757
So there's people flying through.

975
01:06:38,097 --> 01:06:50,642
So I would also if possible, um, you know, seek to ask, see if it's, see if it's, uh, if, if, if, if you guys can, you know, add, uh, all of us stops on mainstream as well.

976
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:53,483
Uh, thank you.

977
01:06:53,503 --> 01:06:53,823
Thank you.

978
01:06:54,284 --> 01:06:54,604
Thank you.

979
01:06:55,824 --> 01:07:04,508
On the motion of council night as amended by council night, all those in favor, all those opposed motion passes.

980
01:07:05,095 --> 01:07:07,536
15-751 offered by Councillor Penta.

981
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:12,618
Be it resolved that the lack of timely action regarding Medford Square bus stops be discussed.

982
01:07:12,998 --> 01:07:13,678
Councillor Penta.

983
01:07:13,818 --> 01:07:18,440
Mr. President, this is not a new subject matter, at least for me.

984
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,801
And it's getting more and more disturbing the more we keep thinking about it.

985
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:25,002
I first introduced this subject matter back on June 14, 2011.

986
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:34,045
First time I introduced this idea of the bus stops in the square with an anticipation that there was going to be a lot of road work and bridge work and construction.

987
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:42,311
And bringing forward, I have a whole folder here of not only resolutions, but I have a folder of information coming back and going forth, whatever it might be.

988
01:07:43,452 --> 01:07:45,373
No resolution to the matter still as of yet.

989
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:57,199
And then on June 30th of this year, resolution 15525, once again offered by myself, as it related not only to the bus stops, but a meeting with the DOT people, the MBTA,

990
01:07:58,573 --> 01:08:07,695
letting the governor of the Commonwealth know of our disappointment and our frustration over the idea of this bridge and its impact it's going to have here and the city of Medford, still no response.

991
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:10,736
I asked the city clerk for a copy of the letter, never got a copy of the letter.

992
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:18,798
Then again, on June 23rd of this, June, September, excuse me, on September 22nd of this year, I offered another resolution.

993
01:08:18,918 --> 01:08:20,579
Did they meet with us?

994
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,299
No.

995
01:08:22,219 --> 01:08:23,339
They met with us this spring.

996
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,520
This was June.

997
01:08:26,295 --> 01:08:27,695
We're talking about now September.

998
01:08:27,715 --> 01:08:30,276
We have had no meetings since June 30th to September.

999
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:46,639
As a result of that, as a result of that in the Craddock Bridge, and I had asked you, Mr. President, on September 22nd to go forward and for the purposes of setting up a meeting with the MassDOT, letting them know and letting us know that we would have a committee of the whole.

1000
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,540
I asked for a copy of the letter and apparently no letter was ever sent out.

1001
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:59,866
So now, with no letters going out, and we're just sitting here spinning our wheels and just talking about something that's having a major effect.

1002
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:05,428
Last weekend, the downtown Meffitt Square, we were around 8, 7.30, 8, 9 o'clock at night.

1003
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:10,790
Unbeknownst to any business merchant down there, all of a sudden, everything was closed down because they were putting the bridge in.

1004
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:13,251
They were putting the bridge in early in the night.

1005
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:16,793
And one particular business not only had it closed down and lost all his, probably,

1006
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:18,864
$3,000 to $4,000 worth of business.

1007
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:21,766
It just doesn't make any sense.

1008
01:09:22,046 --> 01:09:27,090
Again, it's a lack of transparency, a lack of communication.

1009
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,932
What's the sense of us having these resolutions?

1010
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:34,355
You turned around and told us last week, we're going to get it resolved.

1011
01:09:34,695 --> 01:09:36,276
We haven't gotten nothing resolved, Fred.

1012
01:09:36,796 --> 01:09:37,577
Nothing's resolved.

1013
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:39,198
We got no letters going out.

1014
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:40,639
We have no meetings set up.

1015
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,681
And we have bus concerns issues in the square.

1016
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:47,721
And I believe it was last week, on one particular day, they even changed the buses.

1017
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:51,762
And people had to walk to Meffitt Square not knowing that the buses had been changed.

1018
01:09:52,683 --> 01:10:02,545
All we're asking for is a little bit of common sense in this whole process of this Mystic, of this Kratik Bridge, you know, reconstruction, whatever it might be.

1019
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:08,663
And another reason, if anybody's out there watching this whole thing, the reason it's taking two and a half years is because they don't work there every day.

1020
01:10:09,363 --> 01:10:12,144
They were supposed to be working there six days a week, double shifts.

1021
01:10:12,224 --> 01:10:12,864
That was the deal.

1022
01:10:13,164 --> 01:10:15,705
I don't even know what that contract says if they're not doing that.

1023
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:19,767
But once again, it's another typical City of Medford contract for 121 feet.

1024
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,848
121 feet is going to take two and a half years.

1025
01:10:23,168 --> 01:10:29,670
With the state of technology that's out there today, moving wires, telephone lines and gas lines, it just doesn't make any sense.

1026
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:36,745
But I'm more concerned over the fact, the abruptness that's going to take place once those buses have to be moved.

1027
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:41,889
And nobody has come to the city from the MassDOT, from the MBTA.

1028
01:10:42,389 --> 01:10:43,410
No letters have gone out.

1029
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:48,714
Council resolutions have been ignored and not adhered to for the disposition of what takes place.

1030
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:58,121
I don't know what's going on, but I certainly hope that the next city council coming in has a better firm and a better grip on their own resolutions, because this is absolutely making no sense at all.

1031
01:10:58,407 --> 01:11:00,408
We're making resolutions and there's no action taken.

1032
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,169
So why are we making these resolutions?

1033
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,629
Will you tell me?

1034
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,031
You can't answer it, because I can't answer it.

1035
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:10,312
And the fact of the matter is, this is what people elect us to do.

1036
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:15,655
If we're going to do the people's business and we're going to talk about it, at least do what our own business tells us to do.

1037
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:17,775
At least adhere to our own resolutions.

1038
01:11:18,476 --> 01:11:23,438
If a letter went out to the MBTA and they ignored it, they didn't want to come back, or DOT, so be it.

1039
01:11:24,965 --> 01:11:26,425
You're the chairperson of the council.

1040
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:27,706
The letter should have gone out.

1041
01:11:27,846 --> 01:11:30,046
And the letter should have been addressed to the city clerk.

1042
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:30,766
It should have gone out.

1043
01:11:31,307 --> 01:11:36,608
And if people are just getting lax around here and just letting resolutions come and go, well, then shame on everyone.

1044
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:39,388
That's not what we're elected to do.

1045
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:45,530
If you owned a business in Medford Square, and you had to figure out when you woke up in the morning, you had to turn that key.

1046
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:49,051
And from the moment you turn that key, you've got to pay for the electric.

1047
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,091
You've got to pay for the gas.

1048
01:11:50,362 --> 01:11:51,582
You've got to pay for the insurance.

1049
01:11:51,842 --> 01:11:53,523
You've got to pay for your stock.

1050
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,564
You've got to pay for your employees, workman's comp, every other thing that goes along with it.

1051
01:11:58,264 --> 01:12:06,407
And then you come down and you have your business closed down or being given no information of when it's going to be closed down, no transparency, no communication.

1052
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:11,148
Not one person from this city building went down to Medford Square to tell those business merchants.

1053
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:17,970
And if the state was ignorant enough not to tell the business merchants or to tell the city hall, then the city should have been all over them.

1054
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:19,822
all over them and they weren't.

1055
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:28,524
But this city council is just as much to blame because they didn't call the meeting that was supposed to be called from June of this year till again on September 22nd.

1056
01:12:28,604 --> 01:12:29,565
And this is now November 17.

1057
01:12:31,065 --> 01:12:36,666
I'm going to ask you, Mr. President, since it's obvious that the city clerk, would you please call this meeting ASAP?

1058
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:39,267
You said you were the last time we had this conversation.

1059
01:12:39,607 --> 01:12:42,908
It needs to be done before a business person goes out of business.

1060
01:12:45,204 --> 01:12:46,604
On the motion of Councilor Penta.

1061
01:12:46,644 --> 01:12:48,025
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1062
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:51,766
Transportation meeting is going to take place.

1063
01:12:52,526 --> 01:12:58,748
And amended by Councilor Knight that we get an update when the subcommittee on transportation is going to meet.

1064
01:13:00,069 --> 01:13:05,550
On that motion that roll call, Madam Clerk, please call the roll on the motion of Councilor Penta.

1065
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:10,592
The roll call vote, Mr. President, is going to be that the city, you, Mr. President, you call the meeting.

1066
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:11,712
You call the meeting.

1067
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:12,973
You get in touch with DOT.

1068
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,093
You get in call the MBTA.

1069
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:19,161
and just tell them they've either been lax or they can use the excuse that they never got it.

1070
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:30,647
We need to have a meeting ASAP because there is a concern relative to the businesses in Medford Square and to the people of this community not knowing when and how these bus stops are going to be moved and where they're going to be moved.

1071
01:13:31,247 --> 01:13:35,850
As amended by Councilor Knight to request when the next meeting.

1072
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:38,031
Separate, sever the motion, Mr. President.

1073
01:13:39,411 --> 01:13:40,892
Request to sever the motion.

1074
01:13:41,712 --> 01:13:42,633
Mr. President, I have a question.

1075
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:47,469
Um, have you had any correspondence at all with anybody from dot to date relative to the issue?

1076
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,449
I have.

1077
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:53,634
And, uh, would you be so kind as to report back to the council as to how those conversations have gone?

1078
01:13:54,014 --> 01:14:08,607
I'd be delighted if given the chance council night, there'll be a meeting on Tuesday, uh, December 1st with representatives of the department of transportation, uh, in at Alia pertaining to the credit bridge project.

1079
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:09,167
No.

1080
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:11,229
What about the MBTA, which is the bus stops?

1081
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:18,582
The bus stop people have not expressed a willingness to attend a meeting of the city council.

1082
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:19,442
Do you have that in writing?

1083
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:22,143
Do you have a letter that you sent to them or is it just phone calls?

1084
01:14:22,444 --> 01:14:22,824
Phone calls.

1085
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:23,364
Phone calls.

1086
01:14:23,384 --> 01:14:29,867
Well, could you please put it in writing so we could have a paper trail that allows us now to do what we need to do for leverage.

1087
01:14:30,308 --> 01:14:33,029
Common sense would tell you this is a business proposition.

1088
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:36,051
This isn't a social phone call to say, would you please come?

1089
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,472
Listen, they work for us, the taxpayers.

1090
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:39,658
We don't work for them.

1091
01:14:39,718 --> 01:14:40,519
They work for us.

1092
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:42,839
And the bus stops are very important.

1093
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:49,622
They're important to not only to the commuters who use them every day, but they're also important to the business people that are in that square.

1094
01:14:49,642 --> 01:14:50,402
And if they have to be moved.

1095
01:14:50,802 --> 01:15:01,606
Maybe the construction people will explain in their presentation the scheduling for moving of the bus stop as it's part of the construction plan.

1096
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:01,926
I don't know.

1097
01:15:02,106 --> 01:15:04,587
The Memphis City Council is the only people that can move bus stops.

1098
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:06,548
DOT doesn't tell you they're going to move them.

1099
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:07,668
MBTA doesn't tell you they're going to move them.

1100
01:15:08,186 --> 01:15:11,288
You need to have a discussion with them so they are aware of what we're going to do.

1101
01:15:11,568 --> 01:15:16,591
This council has to agree amongst themselves where those bus stops are going to go, and they're going to have to adhere to it.

1102
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:19,633
We've been through this over and over again.

1103
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:25,957
Any move, Mr. President, that you include the MBTA at this meeting?

1104
01:15:27,218 --> 01:15:29,800
Please.

1105
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,482
Do you have the word MBTA in there, Madam Clerk?

1106
01:15:32,902 --> 01:15:34,243
DOT and the MBTA?

1107
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:36,224
Motion to sever the two items, Mr. President.

1108
01:15:38,377 --> 01:15:41,018
Could you, could you read the, could you read the motion please?

1109
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:55,823
Motion is that the department of transportation be called to the report to the Metro city council regarding the credit bridge project.

1110
01:15:56,523 --> 01:15:58,324
It was amended by you, councilor Penta.

1111
01:15:58,852 --> 01:16:06,839
to have the request for the MBTA bus stop people to come to present themselves to the council regarding the bus stop.

1112
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:09,862
I'm going to amend it further that it be in writing immediately ASAP.

1113
01:16:09,902 --> 01:16:15,907
This has been going on since June 15th, so I think we'd like to have this in writing both to the DOT and the MBTA.

1114
01:16:17,148 --> 01:16:18,349
You're saying what, next Tuesday night?

1115
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:19,190
No.

1116
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:22,032
You just said December for, what is it, two weeks?

1117
01:16:22,993 --> 01:16:23,634
Is that two weeks?

1118
01:16:23,894 --> 01:16:24,014
Yeah.

1119
01:16:24,515 --> 01:16:25,275
Thanksgiving's next week.

1120
01:16:29,815 --> 01:16:30,075
Get it?

1121
01:16:30,115 --> 01:16:32,257
I can't hear a thing.

1122
01:16:33,938 --> 01:16:34,319
Say it again.

1123
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:37,081
I can't hear you.

1124
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:40,023
That it also request that the MBTA be present.

1125
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:40,404
I have that.

1126
01:16:40,724 --> 01:16:43,406
And that the requests and responses be made in writing.

1127
01:16:43,426 --> 01:16:43,986
Be in writing.

1128
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:56,416
Excuse me.

1129
01:16:56,436 --> 01:16:56,717
Excuse me.

1130
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,798
On that motion, please call the roll.

1131
01:16:58,818 --> 01:16:59,439
Councilor Camuso.

1132
01:17:00,527 --> 01:17:01,387
Councilor Cabrera.

1133
01:17:01,427 --> 01:17:01,547
Yes.

1134
01:17:02,187 --> 01:17:02,848
Councilor Knight.

1135
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:04,288
Yes.

1136
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:05,728
Vice president.

1137
01:17:06,608 --> 01:17:06,789
Yes.

1138
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:07,989
Councilor Max.

1139
01:17:08,009 --> 01:17:08,089
Yes.

1140
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:09,629
Councilor Pinto.

1141
01:17:09,649 --> 01:17:11,170
Yes.

1142
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:11,610
Yes.

1143
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:28,174
The vote of six in the affirmative, non-negative motion passes on the B paper that report be given back to the city council as to when the subcommittee on transportation will meet on that motion.

1144
01:17:28,194 --> 01:17:28,974
All those in favor.

1145
01:17:28,994 --> 01:17:29,334
Roll call.

1146
01:17:29,842 --> 01:17:31,683
Roll call vote has been requested.

1147
01:17:35,126 --> 01:17:38,829
Councilor Camuso, Councilor Kerrio, Councilor Nye.

1148
01:17:38,849 --> 01:17:39,109
Yes.

1149
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,891
Councilor present among the current.

1150
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:40,971
Yes.

1151
01:17:41,671 --> 01:17:42,372
Councilor Maxwell.

1152
01:17:42,552 --> 01:17:42,792
Yes.

1153
01:17:42,872 --> 01:17:43,573
Councilor Penta.

1154
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:43,893
Yes.

1155
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:44,794
Councilor Talbot.

1156
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:45,134
Yes.

1157
01:17:45,234 --> 01:17:52,000
With a vote of six in the affirmative, none negative, one absent, the motion passes.

1158
01:17:53,774 --> 01:17:56,916
On the motion of Council appended to take papers in the hand of the clerk.

1159
01:17:57,496 --> 01:17:58,336
All those in favor?

1160
01:17:58,656 --> 01:17:58,737
Aye.

1161
01:17:59,297 --> 01:18:00,097
All those opposed?

1162
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,899
By Vice President Nungo Kern.

1163
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:13,884
That a written explanation be given to the City Council regarding the loan order for the Winthrop Street Rotary as to what are the overages in detail.

1164
01:18:14,845 --> 01:18:15,625
On that motion.

1165
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:17,146
All those in favor?

1166
01:18:17,966 --> 01:18:18,086
Aye.

1167
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:19,447
All those opposed?

1168
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:21,128
Motion passes.

1169
01:18:22,046 --> 01:18:38,611
Offered by Vice President Longo Kern be resolved that all DPW department heads review and tabulate all needed repairs on the Pompeo DPW facility and that the building inspector review the construction concerns therein.

1170
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:50,015
Commended by Councilor Marks that the city solicitor review our recourse to inaccurate findings on soil contamination.

1171
01:18:52,016 --> 01:18:53,616
On that motion, all those in favor?

1172
01:18:54,717 --> 01:18:55,517
All those opposed?

1173
01:18:56,217 --> 01:18:57,237
The motion carries.

1174
01:18:58,258 --> 01:19:20,663
Offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the Arts and Culture Subcommittee hold a committee meeting with the Chevalier Commission to discuss, in light of the dismissal of Boston EventWorks as its building manager and booking agent, which was working on a commission basis for the Chevalier Commission,

1175
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:32,043
Who will be accountable for operating the auditorium and booking future events, and will there be expenses involved for someone to handle these responsibilities?

1176
01:19:32,483 --> 01:19:33,424
Councillor Caviello.

1177
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:34,264
Thank you, Mr. President.

1178
01:19:34,324 --> 01:19:46,271
For those of you who don't know, Boston Events Works has vacated the building this week so that we no longer have a building manager there or a booking agent for the building.

1179
01:19:47,872 --> 01:19:49,073
And I was notified that

1180
01:19:49,788 --> 01:19:58,014
Uh, the Jafari commission has put out an hour of, uh, some type of position for a janitor or some type of person to maintain the building.

1181
01:19:58,054 --> 01:20:05,540
But in the meantime, the DPW is going to be sending people over there on Sunday mornings to staff the building.

1182
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:13,606
So is there going to be a cost because the gentleman was the one before was doing it as part of the commission basis thing.

1183
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:16,729
And where is the building going as far as

1184
01:20:17,242 --> 01:20:18,862
booking events for the future.

1185
01:20:18,882 --> 01:20:20,883
Are they going to hire another booking agent?

1186
01:20:21,823 --> 01:20:32,185
I'd like to know what direction they're going to go into now, as far as hiring another agent or where they're going.

1187
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:46,667
So if I could ask that that be sent to subcommittee for a meeting, and I would assume that the arts and culture would be the correct venue, unless, through your wisdom, you think of a better place it should go.

1188
01:20:47,151 --> 01:20:49,192
I think it's a wonderful space for it.

1189
01:20:49,732 --> 01:21:00,574
The Cultural Arts and History Subcommittee is chaired by Vice President Brianna Lungo Kern and is membered by myself, Councilor DelaRusso.

1190
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:01,454
Thank you.

1191
01:21:01,474 --> 01:21:04,415
And the Honorable Robert M. Penta.

1192
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,956
Like I said, there's nowhere wrong.

1193
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:12,197
I don't know if there's any direction for them to hire a new person to run the building.

1194
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:13,897
Are they going to start paying somebody?

1195
01:21:14,318 --> 01:21:15,638
So I'd like to know where they're going.

1196
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:17,691
for the future.

1197
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:19,592
Madam Vice President.

1198
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:21,393
Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

1199
01:21:21,413 --> 01:21:29,677
I actually had coffee with one of the commissioners on Friday and I am going to set up a meeting in December.

1200
01:21:30,077 --> 01:21:44,285
I'm hoping for mid-December because they've reviewed what the city of Lexington has done as far as a master plan for the five to ten years and she's meeting with the, I don't know if Susan Fairchild herself or the whole board is meeting with the city of

1201
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:54,317
Lynn Auditorium to see how they've, Lexington was the last five years and they want to see how Lynn's done it the last 10 and how they've become so successful.

1202
01:21:54,697 --> 01:21:56,138
So one component to that is.

1203
01:21:56,398 --> 01:21:58,580
Lynn has a booking agent that works there.

1204
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,100
Right.

1205
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:06,766
So they're looking into the booking agents, but they are going to be hopefully ready to, you know, present to the council and start the dialogue and see how the city can help.

1206
01:22:06,846 --> 01:22:12,450
And hopefully when the new mayor comes on in January, we get insight with regards to big capital, um,

1207
01:22:13,487 --> 01:22:18,869
And I would hope that the new mayor would have some vision and maybe see the, the survivor auditorium also.

1208
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:19,329
Yes.

1209
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:22,371
So I do plan on calling a meeting on that.

1210
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:27,193
Hopefully mid December, if not mid January, once we get the new mayor's insight as well.

1211
01:22:28,113 --> 01:22:32,075
So on that motion, you wish to speak on the matter, please state your name and address for the record.

1212
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:32,635
Thank you.

1213
01:22:32,655 --> 01:22:36,036
Council President Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield ave, Medford mass.

1214
01:22:36,457 --> 01:22:39,898
This is an excellent opportunity for something we've discussed for ages.

1215
01:22:40,525 --> 01:22:43,908
We have over $300,000 sitting in an account for a TV station.

1216
01:22:44,728 --> 01:23:01,701
If we got a van parked outside of the Chevalier and we had a station in the Chevalier at the old space occupied by Boston Event Works, which I've been in many times, so it's on two separate floors, we now have monies that can go to the Chevalier and to the TV station.

1217
01:23:02,121 --> 01:23:07,185
We could open a radio station, which I talked to Stephanie Muccini-Burke about a while back

1218
01:23:07,835 --> 01:23:11,556
And Mrs. Burke said that there's money from Homeland Security for something like this.

1219
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:16,357
Now, there are two members of the board of directors of Boston Free Radio from Somerville right in this auditorium tonight.

1220
01:23:16,878 --> 01:23:19,158
So there's a synergy that we could have.

1221
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:25,300
There is activity that could bring in all sorts of fun stuff to the Chevalier.

1222
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,361
But this is the perfect opportunity.

1223
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:32,142
And also, I think Councilor Caravello had the idea of the Medford Library.

1224
01:23:32,522 --> 01:23:35,683
You can now have two satellite sites, which Arlington has.

1225
01:23:36,837 --> 01:23:40,239
Your public access money now will work with the library and with the Chevalier.

1226
01:23:40,299 --> 01:23:41,340
It's a win-win-win.

1227
01:23:42,421 --> 01:23:43,121
I present it to you.

1228
01:23:45,863 --> 01:23:46,203
Welcome.

1229
01:23:46,243 --> 01:23:47,764
Please state your name and address for the record.

1230
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,666
Jean Martin, Tuck Cummings Street, and I actually agree with Joe.

1231
01:23:51,306 --> 01:23:54,909
This is a great opportunity to bring everything together in Medford Square.

1232
01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:56,249
Medford Square needs the business.

1233
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:58,891
They need the arts and the culture to come in.

1234
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:03,694
We need to have that banner, the what do you call it?

1235
01:24:04,295 --> 01:24:04,895
Yeah, the thing.

1236
01:24:05,395 --> 01:24:06,235
Yeah, yeah, the marquee.

1237
01:24:06,276 --> 01:24:06,656
Thank you.

1238
01:24:07,196 --> 01:24:08,617
We need to have the marquee put up there.

1239
01:24:08,637 --> 01:24:10,358
We need to take this building seriously.

1240
01:24:10,498 --> 01:24:10,878
Thank you.

1241
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,279
Yes, I need remedial help.

1242
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:20,043
So we need to really take that building seriously in the next coming year.

1243
01:24:21,964 --> 01:24:27,127
And if we don't, the Medford Square area isn't going to build out as fast as it could.

1244
01:24:27,467 --> 01:24:28,267
It's just that simple.

1245
01:24:28,988 --> 01:24:32,950
Between the library, the community access channel,

1246
01:24:33,267 --> 01:24:36,869
and you can put it down in the theater, you can put it on the second floor of the library for all I care.

1247
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:38,270
I don't care where you put it.

1248
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:42,812
If you build another floor in the library, I'm all for that and put the channel in there, I don't care.

1249
01:24:43,092 --> 01:24:46,334
Put the channel in a small little retail spot, I don't care.

1250
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:55,879
But that would really, those three things mixed together would really help to boom Medford Square and get the businesses going down there.

1251
01:24:55,939 --> 01:24:57,419
So I really am in support of that.

1252
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,140
You have to get the religions out of there.

1253
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:02,182
I'm totally, that sets me off.

1254
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:11,838
and because it's just totally against everything I believe in, but we have to take that building seriously and we have to take the library seriously.

1255
01:25:12,218 --> 01:25:15,441
Either these are buildings that the city owns and we take them seriously or not.

1256
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:26,150
We had an earlier debate about the Brooks estates and we really need to think hard about putting more money into that because to me it's just, it's not going anywhere.

1257
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:30,133
They have multiple issues, but anyway, the money that we,

1258
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:36,008
that we need to do, we need to take those two buildings seriously, as well as the public safety building.

1259
01:25:36,328 --> 01:25:39,870
Those three things need to be taken into consideration in the future year.

1260
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:45,754
Thank you so much for listening to me, and I really do want to see Medford Square take off, because then it needs to go up to Haines Square.

1261
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,675
We have empty buildings up there, too.

1262
01:25:48,796 --> 01:25:52,738
Empty storefronts that could use the arts once they start in Medford Square.

1263
01:25:52,858 --> 01:25:53,198
Thank you.

1264
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:53,839
You're right.

1265
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:54,519
Thank you.

1266
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:56,841
Please state your name and address for the record.

1267
01:25:57,201 --> 01:25:58,382
Thank you, Council President.

1268
01:25:58,682 --> 01:25:59,582
Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1269
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:06,164
might be a little redundant, but enough can't be said about the Chevalier Theatre.

1270
01:26:06,604 --> 01:26:11,987
It is a treasure and a gem that's not real well known here north of Boston.

1271
01:26:12,487 --> 01:26:17,369
I went there last Saturday night, saw the four a cappella singing groups, it was sensational.

1272
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:26,634
What I didn't see around Medford, what Lynn does, I have friends who live on the Lynn Shore Drive up in the Swampscott area, when they have a big show coming in,

1273
01:26:27,156 --> 01:26:44,926
they put out these A-frame placards that, maybe Medford is doing this and I just missed it, so forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn, but maybe in our five business districts, we could put up an A-frame and let people know, like this Saturday night, they have a comedian and a singer named Sarah Blacker, I think.

1274
01:26:46,387 --> 01:26:52,110
After the show Saturday night, I went to a local restaurant, Carol's, that everybody knows, and a lot of people showed up.

1275
01:26:52,451 --> 01:26:56,493
I'm sure there was spillout for Salvatore's and other places,

1276
01:26:57,251 --> 01:27:10,536
If people driving home on a Friday afternoon saw an A-frame that these acapella bands, who were sensational, that were at the Chevalier, I mean, this is how we revitalize our business networks.

1277
01:27:10,936 --> 01:27:20,440
And I hope that the city of Medford will take action on this and help to advertise some of the great shows that are coming in at the Chevalier.

1278
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,062
And I want to thank the Chevalier Theatre for the awesome job that they're doing.

1279
01:27:24,122 --> 01:27:25,002
Thank you, Mr. President.

1280
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:29,354
Thank you, Mr. President.

1281
01:27:29,634 --> 01:27:37,777
And just if I could, this weekend, the Methodist Council held the first annual Methodist summit here at City Hall.

1282
01:27:38,478 --> 01:27:39,458
It was well attended.

1283
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:47,382
There was probably 100 residents from all different backgrounds and different groups in this community.

1284
01:27:48,302 --> 01:27:53,104
We all got together and sat in separate tables and in groups of five or six.

1285
01:27:53,765 --> 01:27:56,886
And we came up if we had a wish list of what we'd like to see

1286
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:59,231
done with the arts in our community.

1287
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:08,896
And that day, no one was allowed to say, we can't do, or we can't do it because of budget, or we can't, everything had to be positive.

1288
01:28:09,696 --> 01:28:22,263
And I think there was a common theme throughout all the attendees that were there was the need for more collaboration throughout the community, definitely community outreach,

1289
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:28,202
And other communities, if you buy a home, they actually have what they call a welcome wagon.

1290
01:28:28,222 --> 01:28:32,983
We'll come out and say, do you know that we have the Meffitt Family Network in this community?

1291
01:28:33,003 --> 01:28:36,284
Do you know that the public library is open certain days of the week?

1292
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:40,045
Do you know that we have the Mustangs play at Hormel?

1293
01:28:40,545 --> 01:28:52,049
And it's just a way of inviting people into the community, getting them to know what we have, and having some type of assemblance or central depository.

1294
01:28:52,379 --> 01:28:58,563
Because right now, if you move into the community, the only thing you get is a listing of when your trash is picked up.

1295
01:28:59,563 --> 01:29:00,444
That's all you get.

1296
01:29:00,484 --> 01:29:04,086
The city hands you out, OK, here's your trash pickup, leaf pickup, see you later.

1297
01:29:04,866 --> 01:29:08,428
And so there was discussion about outreach within the community.

1298
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:09,609
I think it's a great idea.

1299
01:29:10,269 --> 01:29:21,376
And also having a website similar to the city website, but allowing, and I'm not sure how this would be done, but allowing these different organizations to have access

1300
01:29:21,835 --> 01:29:23,516
and be able to compile information.

1301
01:29:23,976 --> 01:29:25,877
So you could have the Meffitt Family Network.

1302
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:27,637
You could have the Arts Council.

1303
01:29:27,677 --> 01:29:30,219
You could have the Hormel Commission.

1304
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:40,983
All these different entities that have access to one particular site and be able to use that as a central depository for people to do one-stop shopping.

1305
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,044
Because it's very difficult to get answers in this community.

1306
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,405
It's very difficult to find out what's going on.

1307
01:29:47,066 --> 01:29:50,467
And I think that would be a great asset in this community

1308
01:29:51,138 --> 01:29:56,282
and something that was reiterated over and over again that afternoon.

1309
01:29:57,043 --> 01:30:02,608
They plan on having, the Method Arts Council plans on having many more events.

1310
01:30:02,628 --> 01:30:07,872
They're gonna quantify all the different points that were brought up on Saturday.

1311
01:30:08,212 --> 01:30:09,473
That was a three hour meeting.

1312
01:30:09,513 --> 01:30:11,495
It was, let me tell you, it went by very quick.

1313
01:30:11,935 --> 01:30:19,141
It was very fruitful and there was a cross section of a lot of different people in this community that attended.

1314
01:30:20,138 --> 01:30:26,861
And really, I think we'll go a long way to incorporating arts throughout the community.

1315
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,502
Right now you see arts events.

1316
01:30:28,522 --> 01:30:30,142
You have the West Method Open Studio.

1317
01:30:31,043 --> 01:30:31,583
It was brought up.

1318
01:30:31,623 --> 01:30:36,085
Why not have the Haines Square Open Studio, the Wellington Open, or the South Method Open Studio?

1319
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:37,545
Why not branch that out?

1320
01:30:38,405 --> 01:30:40,186
You know, we have 23 parks in the city.

1321
01:30:40,926 --> 01:30:44,708
What better way to do outreach when you actually have

1322
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:54,736
these parks that are used as a place where you can set up a stage or a performing arts type event, and have that in your own neighborhood.

1323
01:30:55,136 --> 01:31:03,321
So you don't have to worry about, if you live in Wellington, saying, well, I'm going to go over to the West Meffitt Open Studios to take part in an event.

1324
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:07,363
And so there was a lot of good subjects brought up, Mr. President.

1325
01:31:07,883 --> 01:31:12,526
And I think over the next several years, we're going to see an infusion in this community.

1326
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:20,635
I don't want to understate it, but the fact that the arts currently doesn't really have a home in this community.

1327
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:28,702
We were very close back some years ago to getting an art center with art studio and lofts and so forth, which fell short.

1328
01:31:29,503 --> 01:31:41,113
But the need for a home in this community and a place where they can hang their hat and use it as a place that they can make calls from and organize from.

1329
01:31:41,734 --> 01:31:47,617
I think would go a long way to improving the atmosphere and the vibrance of the art community.

1330
01:31:48,218 --> 01:31:51,279
And we all know the arts is directly related to property value.

1331
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,281
And if anyone tells you otherwise, they're misinformed.

1332
01:31:54,801 --> 01:32:07,948
Because any community that has a strong art association, similar to Somerville and Arlington and Lexington, they're all doing very well, not only with the arts, but in regards to property value in their community.

1333
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,910
So I just want to say it was a great event, Mr. President.

1334
01:32:11,549 --> 01:32:16,351
and I look forward to subsequent events to push this issue forward.

1335
01:32:17,271 --> 01:32:18,352
Thank you, Councillor Mox.

1336
01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:21,613
And on the motion of Councillor Karaviello for approval, all those in favour?

1337
01:32:21,633 --> 01:32:23,194
All those opposed?

1338
01:32:24,154 --> 01:32:25,014
Motion passes.

1339
01:32:25,134 --> 01:32:25,975
Thank you, Councillor.

1340
01:32:26,435 --> 01:32:32,477
And finally, offered by Councillor Karaviello, Councillor wants to address the council.

1341
01:32:32,657 --> 01:32:33,538
He attended the

1342
01:32:35,567 --> 01:32:39,868
meeting that was held up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, uh, this evening.

1343
01:32:40,549 --> 01:32:46,971
Uh, so, uh, be it resolved that the councilor Caviello address the city council as to the happenings at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1344
01:32:47,571 --> 01:32:48,751
Thank you, Mr. President.

1345
01:32:48,891 --> 01:32:56,754
Um, this, this evening, along with myself and councilor Penta, uh, we were invited to the physicians operations committee, uh, at the hospital.

1346
01:32:57,434 --> 01:33:04,476
And, um, what it was is, um, they want to let us know and keep us abreast of what's happening up there.

1347
01:33:05,018 --> 01:33:09,379
during the time of the merger or non-merger happening.

1348
01:33:09,899 --> 01:33:24,782
But some of the things happening up there over the next couple of weeks is they're opening a brand new sleep center on December 7th, and that'll be the only one in this region other than Winchester Hospital has one.

1349
01:33:26,382 --> 01:33:27,442
But that's not in this region.

1350
01:33:28,722 --> 01:33:31,843
Well, it's in Boston, but in the suburbs, there's no other one here.

1351
01:33:34,093 --> 01:33:37,595
They're opening also a brand new bariatric center on the third floor there.

1352
01:33:37,816 --> 01:33:39,257
So there's two brand new departments.

1353
01:33:39,597 --> 01:33:42,039
They spent $700,000 on nuclear medicine.

1354
01:33:42,739 --> 01:33:53,246
And one of the big things happening there, starting on January 4th, they're going back to operating on five days a week there, which they had cut back to three days a week.

1355
01:33:53,567 --> 01:33:54,968
Yes.

1356
01:33:55,388 --> 01:33:56,669
Councilor Pente, you're shaking your head no.

1357
01:33:57,289 --> 01:34:01,112
He said that was one of the things that I think we talked about that before you got there.

1358
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,942
But- This is your report, Counselor.

1359
01:34:05,122 --> 01:34:05,283
Yes.

1360
01:34:06,043 --> 01:34:12,888
But I say the hospital is doing their best to stay alive and remain viable during these difficult times.

1361
01:34:12,968 --> 01:34:16,531
And they are spending money on renovations.

1362
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:21,755
Salt One and West One have just been completely done over.

1363
01:34:22,255 --> 01:34:30,922
So hopefully they'll invite us to some other meetings just to keep us abreast of what's happening at the hospital so people don't think it's closing.

1364
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,826
It is viable, and they're working hard to keep it strong.

1365
01:34:35,146 --> 01:34:39,908
Did they comment at all as to where they are with merger plans at this point?

1366
01:34:40,368 --> 01:34:40,969
They did not.

1367
01:34:41,129 --> 01:34:43,950
It's still in the hands of the Attorney General.

1368
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:54,876
And I asked that would it be helpful if we reached out to the Attorney General and maybe brought her in for a meeting, and they said that any help that we could be would be appreciated.

1369
01:34:55,276 --> 01:34:57,477
And they're still in negotiations with the Mass General Group?

1370
01:34:57,517 --> 01:34:59,578
Well, it seems to be more in the hands of

1371
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:01,452
uh, the attorney general.

1372
01:35:02,673 --> 01:35:16,304
So, and he did say that they had other groups that are interested in partnering up with them, but partners, uh, mass general is the only one that's actually bringing something to the table other than just being a partner with them.

1373
01:35:16,764 --> 01:35:20,387
So that's, that's the reason they're staying focused on the partners.

1374
01:35:21,128 --> 01:35:26,472
So on the motion of CAV council, Caviello that this be, uh, received in place on file.

1375
01:35:26,898 --> 01:35:28,439
On that motion, Councillor Penter.

1376
01:35:28,459 --> 01:35:32,860
On that motion, Rick is partially right on the idea of expanding the operating room.

1377
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:42,363
But the idea of expanding the operating room was also to go from three days to five days a week to take the transfers that have been going to the Melrose Wakefield back to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1378
01:35:43,183 --> 01:35:51,706
About a year and a half ago, they sort of like lost that influx of patient care for the operating room.

1379
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:54,947
It's been approximately 1,000 patients per year.

1380
01:35:55,715 --> 01:35:58,236
according to their records, which is holding their own.

1381
01:35:58,276 --> 01:36:05,358
And by doing that, they talked about block time, for which doctors have the opportunity to block time in the operating room.

1382
01:36:05,398 --> 01:36:08,779
I think it starts from 730 in the morning to 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

1383
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:18,221
And that block time will allow certain types of operations, or more operations, that for which they had to give up before, that went to the Melrose-Wakefield.

1384
01:36:18,622 --> 01:36:23,823
They also talked about the idea of the surgical volume

1385
01:36:24,873 --> 01:36:32,697
possibly right now looking at 2016, it's approximately going to be the same.

1386
01:36:33,698 --> 01:36:44,363
The question that seems to be having a problem with the hospital and all the hospitals is that a lot of the patients coming in are not paying the patient's care, what do you call it, their co-payment.

1387
01:36:45,003 --> 01:36:47,545
And some of these co-payments are kind of like high.

1388
01:36:47,685 --> 01:36:53,928
And as a result of that, some of these patients are opting out not to have the operations now or waiting to a later date.

1389
01:36:55,553 --> 01:37:03,675
So in essence, maybe the patient care volume is down, it's not because the patients don't want to do it, they just can't afford to do it or their co-payments are too high.

1390
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:08,355
Now we're into the insurance part of the whole program and that in and of itself presents another thing.

1391
01:37:09,035 --> 01:37:20,037
Getting back to the idea of where this merger sits, one of the interesting components of the merger, hopefully the merger takes place, is the Lawrence Memorial Partners really wants the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1392
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:24,138
It's accessibility to 93, it's a perfect match and it's a perfect fit.

1393
01:37:24,724 --> 01:37:32,151
And as a result of that, one of the two big stumbling blocks with the attorney general was this idea of licensure.

1394
01:37:33,071 --> 01:37:48,245
And one of the things that held back the last merger was there was no definition of when this first five, six years of the merger taking place, when the licensure would become operative and effective.

1395
01:37:49,026 --> 01:37:51,628
And hopefully, it becomes effective as soon

1396
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:55,604
as partners makes this merge go through if the training general allows it.

1397
01:37:55,644 --> 01:38:03,067
With that being said, that'll just put the Lawrence Memorial right on the map all over again as a hospital completely affiliated with partners.

1398
01:38:04,407 --> 01:38:05,808
The doctors, they were pretty interesting.

1399
01:38:05,868 --> 01:38:09,529
The interesting part about it is that they had a lot of interesting questions.

1400
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:16,352
And some of the questions, they questioned about what was going on and as to why, because there's a lot of changes taking place.

1401
01:38:16,612 --> 01:38:19,013
So they just didn't sit there like a lump on a log.

1402
01:38:19,433 --> 01:38:20,634
which was very good.

1403
01:38:20,814 --> 01:38:23,056
They were inquisitive, and they wanted to know some of the answers.

1404
01:38:23,536 --> 01:38:26,038
And some of their questions couldn't be answered, which was even better.

1405
01:38:26,118 --> 01:38:28,000
So people are going to have to get back to them.

1406
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,102
There's no question you see a new movement up there at the hospital.

1407
01:38:31,342 --> 01:38:33,604
Hopefully, it's enough to keep it going.

1408
01:38:34,124 --> 01:38:36,366
It may not be able to keep it going with all its services.

1409
01:38:36,446 --> 01:38:46,854
But if the OR room can bring itself back, and this block time of operations can take place up there, as Rick alluded to with the other things going on, the hospital should do itself well.

1410
01:38:47,014 --> 01:38:49,036
People should understand that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital

1411
01:38:49,608 --> 01:38:52,289
was a very financially endowed hospital.

1412
01:38:52,949 --> 01:39:07,672
And when that merger took place between Hallmark and the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Melrose-Wakefield came into the picture, and unfortunately I think the Malden Hospital was part of it, and of course it's no longer there, that's when the finances of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and their bankroll became depleted.

1413
01:39:07,712 --> 01:39:09,073
I think at one point in time they had a $34 million

1414
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:12,585
asset profit margin.

1415
01:39:12,645 --> 01:39:15,107
Now, I believe they're in the minus column.

1416
01:39:16,008 --> 01:39:18,310
Getting better, but still not out of the woods yet.

1417
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:20,893
So, hopefully, as we keep moving forward.

1418
01:39:21,773 --> 01:39:28,539
One of the best things the people of this community can do, if you are a patient or you know a doctor at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, make the call.

1419
01:39:28,559 --> 01:39:32,663
Find out what you can do to send that letter in, whether it be to the Attorney General or to the Mass General.

1420
01:39:32,683 --> 01:39:38,648
Tell them that you want to keep the hospital, you like their services, and as Rick alluded to, with the new services coming on board,

1421
01:39:39,545 --> 01:39:52,535
And again, their whole transportation needs, their 30-minute response period time for an ambulance, and putting everybody on call and on notice, it's going to be unacceptable if they don't meet the requirements that the hospital is asking for.

1422
01:39:53,075 --> 01:39:53,956
They'll be out of a job.

1423
01:39:54,396 --> 01:40:00,361
So, with that being said, Mr. President, hopefully this is the beginning of more transparency that the hospital has had.

1424
01:40:00,381 --> 01:40:01,621
It hasn't had this in a long time.

1425
01:40:02,342 --> 01:40:05,004
These doctors, men and women that were there, and the doctor in charge,

1426
01:40:05,549 --> 01:40:09,612
seem to be wanting to do the right thing, and I want to thank them for inviting us.

1427
01:40:10,452 --> 01:40:11,793
Thank you, Counselor.

1428
01:40:11,913 --> 01:40:15,236
Counselor Carfiello, on your motion.

1429
01:40:15,796 --> 01:40:30,025
I got there a little earlier, and I was talking, but I did ask a question about Lawrence standing alone without Melrose, and they said that wouldn't happen because of the Hallmark branding.

1430
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:38,242
And I also asked, he says, you know, if everybody, if all these hospitals lose money, I says, how does anybody survive?

1431
01:40:38,262 --> 01:40:43,504
He said, most hospitals do lose money, but, um, they make money on their private investments.

1432
01:40:44,365 --> 01:40:48,426
And I guess that's, what's keeping all mock and Lawrence alive is there.

1433
01:40:48,506 --> 01:40:51,007
Uh, they, they do return on investment from their endowments.

1434
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:51,408
Yeah.

1435
01:40:51,548 --> 01:40:53,148
They're making, they're doing quite well on their investments.

1436
01:40:53,769 --> 01:40:55,209
So he says that's been the saving grace.

1437
01:40:55,769 --> 01:41:01,972
So on the motion of council Caviello to receive in place on file, all those in favor, all those opposed motion passes.

1438
01:41:02,648 --> 01:41:08,290
The records, the records of the meeting of November 10th, 2015 were passed to Vice President Lungo Kern.

1439
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:11,450
Madam Vice President, how did you find those records?

1440
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:12,531
In order.

1441
01:41:13,531 --> 01:41:13,691
And?

1442
01:41:14,251 --> 01:41:14,771
Move approval.

1443
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:18,652
On the motion of approval of the records by Councilor Lungo Kern.

1444
01:41:18,752 --> 01:41:19,493
All those in favor?

1445
01:41:19,513 --> 01:41:20,013
Aye.

1446
01:41:20,073 --> 01:41:20,833
All those opposed?

1447
01:41:21,313 --> 01:41:22,193
Motion passes.

1448
01:41:22,913 --> 01:41:28,375
Chair recognizes, before we adjourn, the Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1449
01:41:28,683 --> 01:41:33,425
Mr. President, I believe it was last week we asked for a joint meeting with the school committee regarding school safety.

1450
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:34,066
Yes.

1451
01:41:34,206 --> 01:41:37,788
If we received any type of response, I have not.

1452
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:45,812
We're going to, uh, I actually, I did, I received a call back from the, um, uh, superintendent of schools.

1453
01:41:46,532 --> 01:41:49,254
Uh, but we've been playing telephone tag for the past two days.

1454
01:41:55,016 --> 01:41:55,657
Congratulations.

1455
01:41:55,697 --> 01:41:55,977
So, uh,

1456
01:41:56,378 --> 01:42:03,100
Counselor Caviello has just informed us that the perpetrator of the break in.

1457
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:06,521
A 19 year old woman from Everett was arrested for that crime.

1458
01:42:07,602 --> 01:42:14,604
Counselor, but no doubt we will continue to pursue that meeting.

1459
01:42:15,264 --> 01:42:21,366
And we can be assured that the presence of two members of the school committee on this body in the next turn.

1460
01:42:22,048 --> 01:42:36,130
will certainly benefit the wisdom of this body, just as the two previous members of the school committee who joined this council may possibly have done that.

1461
01:42:41,911 --> 01:42:42,992
Council of Penta.

1462
01:42:43,772 --> 01:42:46,172
Did you make inquiry to the school committee to have this joint meeting?

1463
01:42:46,432 --> 01:42:46,772
I'm sorry?

1464
01:42:47,252 --> 01:42:49,193
Who did you make inquiry with to have the joint meeting?

1465
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:50,253
I didn't.

1466
01:42:50,613 --> 01:42:50,913
Who did?

1467
01:42:51,558 --> 01:42:52,558
I think the clerk may have.

1468
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,520
I don't understand this.

1469
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,341
It's a council prerogative to make the inquiry.

1470
01:43:00,761 --> 01:43:01,141
Number one.

1471
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:09,084
Number two, I believe the superintendent had some comments about it last night at the school committee meeting where he said that this wasn't done to keep it hush hush before the election.

1472
01:43:09,224 --> 01:43:17,707
Well, I don't know what it was or why it wasn't, but it took place six days before the election, you know, and the teachers never responded and never called the police department.

1473
01:43:18,007 --> 01:43:19,147
Police department wasn't called.

1474
01:43:19,207 --> 01:43:21,108
And it's the same situation they had up to high school.

1475
01:43:21,681 --> 01:43:23,742
when they had a bomb scare and nobody knew nothing about it.

1476
01:43:24,303 --> 01:43:28,226
And they wouldn't allow the dogs to come into the building because they didn't want the adverse publicity.

1477
01:43:28,506 --> 01:43:30,868
You know, this is the problem around here, Mr. President.

1478
01:43:30,908 --> 01:43:31,868
You're asked to do something.

1479
01:43:31,968 --> 01:43:34,210
That's a huge issue that took place in that school.

1480
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:45,198
Someone got into that school building, could have kidnapped a kid, could have caused harm, could have done something that we're seeing every single day, devastation taking place in public places.

1481
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:50,902
And they got to think about having a joint meeting to discuss the public safety of a building

1482
01:43:51,935 --> 01:43:53,876
What are they afraid of, a hard question being asked?

1483
01:43:55,216 --> 01:44:03,180
You know, I don't accept this, Mr. President, and I wouldn't hope that you would call tomorrow morning and just tell them, listen, this meeting is taking place next Tuesday night to be here.

1484
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:04,841
You know, we vote on their budget.

1485
01:44:05,701 --> 01:44:08,182
We vote on their budget that they submit to us.

1486
01:44:10,563 --> 01:44:20,948
And if they can't be responsible enough to want to meet with another legislative body who is ready, willing, and able to help out the situation, they have no security in the schools,

1487
01:44:21,768 --> 01:44:25,411
One thing, Chris Murphy, when he was running for school committee, that's what he was advocating for.

1488
01:44:25,571 --> 01:44:30,215
He's the only one running for school committee that advocated for security, or lack thereof, in the building.

1489
01:44:30,535 --> 01:44:31,696
And we're still talking about it.

1490
01:44:32,717 --> 01:44:35,579
Shame on every elected official, the superintendent, the mayor.

1491
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:40,163
Shame on you all for not wanting to sit down by now to have even a date set up.

1492
01:44:40,503 --> 01:44:40,824
Thank you.

1493
01:44:44,587 --> 01:44:47,049
Please state your name and address for the record, Mr. Castaneda.

1494
01:44:47,069 --> 01:44:47,669
Castaneda, Andrew.

1495
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:48,930
23 Cushing Street, Method, Marist.

1496
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,581
It's good.

1497
01:44:51,601 --> 01:44:52,501
Brought up this evening.

1498
01:44:53,522 --> 01:45:00,966
My wife was one of the teachers that was robbed and she's very, very upset and concerned about her safety.

1499
01:45:01,627 --> 01:45:08,331
I love that meeting that trial that the perpetrators does not want to attend to today in Danvers.

1500
01:45:10,172 --> 01:45:15,375
She's very, very concerned as should all the teachers and all citizens of the city.

1501
01:45:15,996 --> 01:45:17,257
Thank you for listening, sir.

1502
01:45:17,577 --> 01:45:17,897
Thank you.

1503
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:33,348
On the motion for adjournment.

1504
01:45:33,729 --> 01:45:36,511
We already voted on it.

1505
01:45:36,631 --> 01:45:37,012
Thank you.
