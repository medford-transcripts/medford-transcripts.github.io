00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,581

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're going to, we have two items on our agenda.

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,581
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a continuation, not a technically a continuation, but as a subsequent meeting to the same exact agenda.

39
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:03,243
[SPEAKER_04]: The first item on our agenda is to discuss the school attorney policy.

40
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:10,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna share my screen once I minimize and move things around.

41
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:12,485
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

42
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:38,053
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I have a gigantic screen.

43
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Is everybody able to see this without it being too small?

44
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Look okay?

45
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:45,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, great.

46
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:53,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the school attorney policy that we discussed at the last meeting, we had one question regarding the last sentence.

47
00:03:53,357 --> 00:04:03,720
[SPEAKER_04]: This last sentence being, this does not preclude individual member contact with legal counsel related to ongoing legal questions or matters before the school committee, before the committee.

48
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:10,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I did email our attorney, Attorney Granzband, and ask him about that question, about that sentence and his thoughts.

49
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I have his response right here.

50
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:15,844
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, things have been working fine.

51
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:20,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the wording that requires school committee action to seek legal advice, et cetera.

52
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's clear that the committee makes the decision.

53
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no objection if an individual seeks an update on a matter that has been referred to the entire committee.

54
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:31,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone has been respectful of the process.

55
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:32,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, thank you for asking.

56
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:41,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless there are any members that want to further discuss the policy or the sentence, it sounds like he's fine with it.

57
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We can always change it later if it turns out.

58
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask?

59
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:47,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

60
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:48,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have some questions.

61
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I was not in this last meeting.

62
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:52,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was, yeah, I think I had COVID.

63
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:53,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You did, correct.

64
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:54,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

65
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:55,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um,

66
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a question I'm sort of reading it over and had a question.

67
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:17,628
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm because I missed the discussion many types of legal assistance or routine and do not require specific committee approval or prior notice however when the superintendent concludes that unusual types of amount or amounts of professional legal service may be required required they will advise the committee and seek either initial

68
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:20,659
[SPEAKER_08]: or continuing authorization for such service.

69
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you distill that for me?

70
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not quite sure what you're saying there.

71
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:25,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

72
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:30,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So, essentially, I read that as we have a retainer at

73
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:42,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Green's ban is paid the retainer, but if we're going to engage him in a process where we're going to start getting another $100,000 right here and there, that we need to approve that.

74
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:56,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that we wouldn't approve it, but we just don't want to be like, as a secretary, I don't want to be showing up and seeing a bill for a quarter of a million dollars to an attorney, and we never approved it for our regular legal activities.

75
00:05:57,516 --> 00:06:00,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what that's meant to be.

76
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:00,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

77
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:07,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we, do you think, I don't know, is there a way to wordsmith that just a little bit more because that was really a hard read for me.

78
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I don't, and I can see it.

79
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,580
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that it was more that it was a really hard read for me.

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't know what you were talking about.

81
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:16,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that.

82
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:22,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew that you had a purpose, but I couldn't see what exactly the purpose was if you follow me.

83
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um,

84
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hard when we don't have specific sets.

85
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:37,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so if we could just say something like, you know, something as simple as you said, you know, there's a standard retainer fee for legal services.

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:49,069
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if that retainer, if it's, you know, if there's an unusual amount of services needed that will, you know, exceed that standard fee, then, you know, if then something.

87
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So that sort of spells it out a little bit more because it's not clear what is being said there.

88
00:06:54,882 --> 00:07:01,873
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, and I would you know obviously ask other members what they what their opinions are but I didn't really understand that.

89
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:09,223
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah i'm trying to figure out how to say it because I don't actually know the details about.

90
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we have it in our budget.

91
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:17,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we need to know the details, just that we have one, that we have a retainer that is a budgeted amount.

92
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:30,921
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it looks as though that retainer is going to be significantly exceeded, the superintendent will advise the committee and seek authorization for that excess.

93
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:36,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want me to put that in the chat?

94
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,573
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm starting to type it.

95
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:41,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, since I'm sharing, it seems that Google.

96
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:42,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes slow, yeah.

97
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:45,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That Safari, I should have been in Google Chrome, but.

98
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be helpful.

99
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:57,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And then while you're typing that, if you don't mind, if I could ask another question, since I wasn't here and maybe some other folks could help answer, is that okay, Member Rizzo?

100
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

101
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what was the conversation around this regarding.

102
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:20,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So Howard is one aspect of our legal services, but as folks know I'm sure there's another aspect through to me and Lane Lane and I forget the third name, which is the special education representation.

103
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:39,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this policy is just about the school attorney, the standard when we retain, it isn't about those other legal services, which I do think, I don't know if we have a policy on that and it's definitely worth looking into.

104
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:42,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

105
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,133
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree that that I completely unaware of whether we even have a policy on those that matters.

106
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, does that sentence look okay?

107
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,808
[SPEAKER_04]: because I got distracted by the typing.

108
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,330
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not require specific committee approval of prior notice.

109
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:14,703
[SPEAKER_08]: However, when the superintendent, the usual types or amounts of personnel may be required that exceed the budget of retainer, they will advise the committee and seek either initial... Yeah, that's fine.

110
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:18,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that helps me understand a little bit more.

111
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:23,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you just need to take retainer out of the sentence for budget.

112
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:24,994
[SPEAKER_07]: No, leave that one.

113
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Take on the other side of budgeted.

114
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,963
[SPEAKER_08]: In front of budgeted, you have it twice.

115
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:33,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

116
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:34,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

117
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:39,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they should be the superintendent.

118
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then.

119
00:09:45,993 --> 00:10:00,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So, given what you just said member or so about this separate issue that this is specific to the school attorney which is a little bit vague because we technically have to school attorneys we have Howard and then we have a firm.

120
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:09,275
[SPEAKER_08]: that represents against the special education law, because it's more, I assume, because it's more complex and you need a specific license for that.

121
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:14,816
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the top and the open sentence, it says it will be the duty of the council for the committee to advise the school committee.

122
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:26,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be the, yeah, so the council for the committee, I would call it, instead of school attorney, I might say on the top, council for the committee, because that really specifically says it's our, essentially.

123
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, because we have more than one, yeah, council for the committee.

124
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, committee, yeah, whatever.

125
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:35,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I like what you said there.

126
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:39,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Council for the committee to advise the school committee and the superintendent on the specific legal problems submitted to them.

127
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

128
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:47,189
[SPEAKER_08]: The council for the committee, I would say instead of they, because it's suggested- Where are you?

129
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:47,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

130
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:48,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

131
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

132
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:59,796
[SPEAKER_08]: The council for the committee will attend meetings upon request and will be, yeah, sufficiently familiar with committee policies.

133
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:00,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

134
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:03,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's fine.

135
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:10,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so either school committee attorney or counsel for the committee, I would say one or the other.

136
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,667
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that looks good.

137
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for bearing with me.

138
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry I missed the last meeting.

139
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:15,749
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

140
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,790
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a pretty good reason.

141
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:20,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

142
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:27,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, the superintendent obviously uses the services as well, but really it's acting on our behalf.

143
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,831
[SPEAKER_04]: in all of those matters.

144
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:31,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think we need to be more detailed.

145
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:37,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually the word school is a little, it's not like the Missittook has a school attorney.

146
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:43,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the... So any other questions or comments?

147
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing everybody, sorry.

148
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:56,146
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody does see anybody raising hands, please let me know because while I'm sharing, it's hard to see

149
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Rizzo?

150
00:11:58,191 --> 00:11:58,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

151
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just ask a quick question?

152
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

153
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:17,320
[SPEAKER_01]: On the second paragraph, and I think this may have been discussed on the floor when this was initially referred, or maybe you've already talked about it today, but that sentence of the superintendent may also take such action at the direction of the committee.

154
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that's meant to suggest that each time the superintendent or her staff are seeking

155
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,711
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance that they're doing it with specific committee authorization, correct?

156
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:36,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have to consult with the attorneys.

157
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:57,078
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that this is a piece of counsel that I've provided to the committee in the past, but the risk here with the language not being that precise is that a future committee could exploit the language to unfairly hold a future superintendent accountable

158
00:12:57,617 --> 00:13:00,679
[SPEAKER_01]: for just doing basic day-to-day functions of their job.

159
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:15,426
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no superintendent in Massachusetts who does not consult with the person who, and the term school attorney, frankly, comes from antiquated statutory language that then worked its way into MASC policy.

160
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:22,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not unusual for that to be a term that's used.

161
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,392
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think to the point that I heard made a few minutes ago,

162
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:40,613
[SPEAKER_01]: as the nature of school law has expanded, there are attorneys that, well, we would consider it to be an umbrella term of education law or a school district representation.

163
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:48,537
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some parts of that that typically attorneys that have practiced in that area will focus more heavily on in one direction or another.

164
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But my recommendation would be that the second sentence

165
00:13:55,502 --> 00:14:05,864
[SPEAKER_01]: be reworked to make it clear that there's an understanding that the administration is seeking legal counsel based on day-to-day matters.

166
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:23,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I take the brunt of this policy and the amendments you're looking at to indicate that, because the attorney ultimately works for the school committee, if the administration, through its legal representation, is going to be taking an action

167
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:41,545
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to have some significant impact on the district, primarily financial, that's the type of impact that would, you know, how it would normally manifest itself, that this is a policy reminding the administration to come back to seek guidance from the committee as to whether to do that or not.

168
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a fair characterization of what the goal is?

169
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly what I believe it is.

170
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

171
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

172
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:59,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering if it's not either or, but maybe both and, and I don't know, but I would put that out there.

173
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:16,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm hearing is that, obviously nobody would wanna limit the superintendent's authority and ability to consult with the school attorney, which I'm sure happens on multiple occasions in multiple ways.

174
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,634
[SPEAKER_08]: But it seems to me,

175
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:27,136
[SPEAKER_08]: What I, what I thought part of this was as well is that the school committee is informed should legal action be taken.

176
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:33,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And not just that it's exceeding the budget right so I thought it was both.

177
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:48,236
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sort of responding to both what Mr. Murphy was just saying and my impression of what I thought this document was as well.

178
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if I'm being clear.

179
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,678
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think, Ms.

180
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,739
[SPEAKER_01]: McLaughlin, I think you are.

181
00:15:53,779 --> 00:16:03,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take that to, I sort of see that as sort of an expansion of the point that I was making, not in any way contradictory to it.

182
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:09,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I would disagree with it, with one exception, I guess I would say one thing.

183
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:22,808
[SPEAKER_01]: So the superintendent who functions as the agent of the school committee, generally speaking, although there are exceptions to this in some of the larger districts, does not enjoy their own legal counsel.

184
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:33,615
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is not uncommon for the school attorney to be advising the district on matters that involve

185
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:36,354
[SPEAKER_01]: implicate strict confidentiality.

186
00:16:37,495 --> 00:17:01,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, whether it's sometimes it's through regulation, promulgated by DESE, other times it's just a well-developed practice, but it is the case that by acting as the agent of the committee, while I think that ultimately the school committee as a body could generally vote

187
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:24,420
[SPEAKER_01]: to obtain any information that the attorney has, it would require that level of action by the committee to obtain that information, which I think is the other point that I think that this policy is making, is that the attorney is functioning as the attorney to the committee, not as individual members of the committee, meaning individual members do not have access to that information, right?

188
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:29,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is like, there's some blurriness to that.

189
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like,

190
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:36,448
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not, it's not uncommon for committees and superintendents to have tension around this issue.

191
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:46,772
[SPEAKER_01]: The sort of like most well-worn path for this is that the superintendent is the one that works with the committee, excuse me, with the council on a day-to-day basis, sometimes for years, right?

192
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:51,714
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the committee decides that they'd like to move on from the superintendent, it's the council that they call.

193
00:17:51,774 --> 00:18:00,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying this having experience as a former attorney to a school committee, like that can become an awkward moment when the person that you've worked most closely with

194
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,029
[SPEAKER_01]: is the person that you're now charged with disposing of.

195
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it happens.

196
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,533
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens in communities all the time.

197
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:14,059
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of tension and awkwardness, I don't think we can legislate that out.

198
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think there's any reason to.

199
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, the only way to remove that tension is for the administration to have its own attorney.

200
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a need for that.

201
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's not a good use of resources.

202
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:42,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as the policy does not restrict the administration to communicate with and work with the attorney on a day-to-day basis, which I don't think this language does, particularly with the change that Mr. Rousseau, I think, just edited in, I don't see it as inherently problematic.

203
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:48,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Just understand that the subtext of this policy and of the relationship

204
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:53,382
[SPEAKER_01]: is one that has that natural tension that districts all across the state deal with.

205
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:55,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

206
00:18:55,743 --> 00:19:01,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, so I just wanted to point out that you missed committee at the top on the second.

207
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I just noticed it and I didn't want to forget.

208
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:07,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So second sentence, yeah, that sentence, the council for the committee.

209
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:09,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Second sentence.

210
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:12,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

211
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:15,429
[SPEAKER_02]: For the, yeah.

212
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:16,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

213
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

214
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:37,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to add, you know, just to not to belabor the point, but, you know, I expect that the superintendent might speak with our attorney about personnel matters, for instance, for which I fully expect her to do, but neither the committee as a full vote or individual members

215
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:40,214
[SPEAKER_04]: can ask for any of that detail.

216
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:47,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's a pretty interesting example for which the attorney works for us.

217
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:54,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, there's these weird spots where we can't even really know what's going on.

218
00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:02,761
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but anyways, if there are any other comments or questions, we always can amend this on the floor before hopefully approving it.

219
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, is there a motion to approve?

220
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:18,828
[SPEAKER_03]: to send to the full committee.

221
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:20,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

222
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:20,388
523.

223
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I do wish I could see all of the people at the same time.

224
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,991
[SPEAKER_03]: You can stop sharing your screen now.

225
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, thank you.

226
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:29,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do that.

227
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:30,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll help.

228
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see us.

229
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

230
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, member Graham.

231
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:40,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

232
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:42,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

233
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

234
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:45,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Rousseau?

235
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:46,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

236
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Three in the affirmative.

237
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:56,270
[SPEAKER_04]: This policy will be sent to the full committee at the, I believe May 23rd, if my dates are correct, school committee meeting.

238
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:58,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

239
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:01,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up we have, let me get my agenda up.

240
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:09,195
[SPEAKER_04]: the dress code policy, which we discussed.

241
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,858
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some community feedback and input in the last meeting.

242
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:19,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We discussed, I was trying to have us not steer into the specific policy, but it was hard not to go there.

243
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:27,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I have drafted, and when I say I've drafted, I've stolen for the most part, as a lot of policies are.

244
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: No sense to reinvent the wheel.

245
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,534
[SPEAKER_04]: A dress code policy that I thought we could use as a,

246
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,791
[SPEAKER_04]: As a place to begin, frankly, let me share that.

247
00:21:42,811 --> 00:22:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I have sent it to member Graham, member McLaughlin, Dr. Edward Vincent, and the assistant superintendent for elementary as well as secondary, but they received it in a blind CC, so we could not have dialogue, but I wanted to give them a chance to read it beforehand.

248
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:03,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me share that.

249
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:30,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so as I mentioned, a lot of this has been much, most of it, frankly, has been taken from the Seattle dress code policy, which I personally really like because it is, aside from being short, it leaves relatively little up to interpretation, which is sort of the biggest challenge around dress codes and implementation.

250
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to,

251
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:33,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to read it.

252
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two pages with lots of spacing.

253
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:54,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So the dress code is the policy of the committee that the student and their parent, guardian, caregiver hold the primary responsibility in determining the student's personal attire, hairstyle, jewelry, and personal items, i.e., or e.g., backpacks, book bags,

254
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:07,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Schools are responsible for ensuring that student attire, hairstyle, jewelry, and personal items do not interfere with the health or safety of any student and do not contribute to a hostile or intimidating environment for any student.

255
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:14,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Core values in relation to student dress, this district's core values are as follows.

256
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:22,285
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, obviously, I'm asserting these are our core values having actually not been told that we all agree these are our core values.

257
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:31,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Students should be able to dress and style their hair for school in a manner that expresses their individuality without fear of unnecessary discipline or body shaming.

258
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Students have the right to be treated equitably

259
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:54,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Dress code enforcement will not create disparities, reinforce or increase marginalization of any group, nor will it be more strictly enforced against students because of racial identity, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, gender nonconformity, sexual orientation, cultural or religious identity, household income, body size, type, or body maturity.

260
00:23:54,965 --> 00:24:02,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Students and staff are responsible for managing their personal distractions, and students should not face unnecessary barriers to school attendance.

261
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the core values.

262
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:20,968
[SPEAKER_04]: The dress code is students must wear a top, which is a shirt, blouse, sweater, sweatshirt, tank, et cetera, bottom, pants, shorts, shirt, dress, et cetera, and footwear.

263
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:31,053
[SPEAKER_04]: This policy permits additional student attire requirements when necessary to ensure safety in certain academic settings, such as physical activity,

264
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:34,975
[SPEAKER_04]: gym, science, or CPE courses.

265
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:38,657
[SPEAKER_04]: There are specific requirements for many of those areas.

266
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, this policy allows for reasonable variation in required student attire for participation in activities such as swimming or gymnastics.

267
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:53,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Students may not wear clothing, jewelry, or personal items that are pornographic,

268
00:24:55,027 --> 00:25:13,669
[SPEAKER_04]: contain threats or that promote illegal or violent conduct such as the unlawful use of weapons, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or drug paraphernalia, demonstrate hate group affiliation, association or affiliation, and or use hate speech targeting groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity,

269
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,132
[SPEAKER_04]: religious affiliation, or other protected groups.

270
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Intentionally show private parts, nipples, genitals, or buttocks.

271
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Clothing must cover private parts and opaque, not able to be seen through materials.

272
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:38,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Cover the student's face to the extent that the student is not identifiable, except clothing or headgear worn for religious or medical purposes, or demonstrate gang affiliation or association.

273
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Attire worn in observance of a student's religion is not subject to this policy.

274
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:47,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Enforcement.

275
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:58,890
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably where we'll probably want to have some real discussion around this because I frankly don't feel strongly about its principles or assistant superintendents, assistant

276
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:05,997
[SPEAKER_04]: But principles are required to ensure that all staff are aware of and understand the guidelines of this policy.

277
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:12,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Staff will use reasonable efforts to avoid dress coding students in front of other students.

278
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:39,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Students shall not be disciplined or removed from class as a consequence for wearing attire in violation of this policy, unless the attire creates a substantial disruption to the educational environment, poses a hazard to the health or safety of others, or factors into a student behavior rule violation, such as malicious harassment or the prohibition on harassment, intimidation, and bullying.

279
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:45,724
[SPEAKER_04]: No student shall be referred to as a distraction due to their appearance or attire.

280
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:56,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Typical consequences for a violation of this policy include parent, guardian, caregiver contact or conference and the directive to cover, change or remove the non-compliant attire.

281
00:26:56,774 --> 00:27:00,998
[SPEAKER_04]: A student may be instructed to leave their classroom briefly to change clothes.

282
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,040
[SPEAKER_04]: The principal or their designee

283
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:11,215
[SPEAKER_04]: should notify a student's parent, guardian, caregiver of the school's response to violations of the student dress policy.

284
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:17,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, dress code policy.

285
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's draft one.

286
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine there are people who have feedback.

287
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:28,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll open the floor for thoughts, comments.

288
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:33,978
[SPEAKER_02]: can't be perfect.

289
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:34,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that.

290
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:43,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Russell.

291
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:44,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

292
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:45,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

293
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I did want to say that I

294
00:27:57,544 --> 00:28:01,206
[SPEAKER_07]: the universal dress code specifically around things that are not permitted.

295
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:17,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this does a really nice job of getting at the spirit and the intent of the work that we're trying to do around the dress code and does, I think, put some really appropriate boundaries.

296
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:25,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think we heard, I'll say fears from folks in the last meeting around the notion that

297
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:31,054
[SPEAKER_07]: things students wear to school could make others uncomfortable.

298
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think discomfort is a hard thing to sort of get to an objective place, but I do like sort of the framing that you've used to say,

299
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:50,771
[SPEAKER_07]: what do we consider to be objectionable in some way, shape or form?

300
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did really appreciate the framing of that.

301
00:28:57,056 --> 00:29:00,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agreed with all that you wrote.

302
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:11,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I think on the enforcement side, the one question I had around students not being sent out of class,

303
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:26,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the question is, if we're saying that students can't be sent out of class, how can non-compliant students be expected to become compliant inside of the school day?

304
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:35,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just curious about that component of it and how that might play out in a school building.

305
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:39,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd love to hear from the administration about that as well.

306
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just jump in on what my thoughts are on that particular thing.

307
00:29:48,486 --> 00:30:00,513
[SPEAKER_04]: What I understand that to mean is students can be removed from class under certain circumstances, but if I come to school and

308
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:07,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to come up with examples because frankly the stress code is very permissive.

309
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:27,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I come to school and I'm violating the dress code somehow, and I am not creating a substantial disruption to the environment or creating obviously the hazard and health and safety stuff, I'm still violating it, but like the class can go on.

310
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:32,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a teacher stopping the class to say,

311
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:38,674
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, your pants are too low and I can see your buttocks.

312
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:41,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the student is sitting in their chair in the back row.

313
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:48,060
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an example where it's like, that can wait till the class is over rather than stopping the class and making the student a spectacle.

314
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:54,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Or frankly, if you notice it when the student's coming in, then, you know, before class starts.

315
00:30:54,885 --> 00:31:00,549
[SPEAKER_04]: But because it's such a permissive policy, it is kind of hard to think about like,

316
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you even get to the point where you're in a classroom.

317
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:15,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point you realize there's a violation, I mean, nobody's coming to school barefoot, and nobody notices till they're sitting in their first period class right i mean.

318
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody notices before that probably.

319
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:20,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just my thoughts.

320
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,244
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll let Member McLaughlin.

321
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:28,726
[SPEAKER_08]: But just as a point of information on the next paragraph, don't you say the typical consequences for violation?

322
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:36,909
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like the options would be if they're staying in class, there could be a directive to cover or change the attire.

323
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So they could cover up potentially while they're in class.

324
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:57,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So there does seem like there are some options if they stay in the class, but that's you're not what you're what I'm hearing you say, if I'm, if it's, if I'm hearing you right member or so is your that paragraph that says they should not be removed from class was not the intention that you had.

325
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:20,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was it the intention that you had I'm not sure what you're saying because I, from what I'm hearing member Graham say is that she's wondering if they're not removed from the class, you know, how are they, then, addressing the, the code violation but I feel like the next paragraph addresses some of how they could address it within the class but I'm not sure that was your intention so what was your, I mean,

326
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:34,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's hard to discuss without a specific example sometimes, you know, a violation that isn't disrupting the class, but it's still a violation that needs to be taken care of.

327
00:32:35,816 --> 00:32:36,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you an example.

328
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:39,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Say somebody has something on their shirt that has a swear on it, right?

329
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:43,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, it's not, the kids are used to seeing hearing, talking swears.

330
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:47,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not gonna, the class is not gonna go, oh, that kid has a swear on their shirt.

331
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:47,939
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

332
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:52,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they're used to seeing that kind of thing, but clearly it's a violation of the code, right?

333
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,681
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's an example.

334
00:32:53,761 --> 00:33:01,123
[SPEAKER_08]: In that instance, there could be whatever, a jacket, a sweatshirt, something in the room that, you know, they could zip up, cover up until they can change or something.

335
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's the example.

336
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:10,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and in that example, I think this other issue of avoidance of dress coding students in front of their peers becomes an issue.

337
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:31,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if the students are coming in and there's the rigmarole of class squeezing through a door and the teacher sees it and says, look, you can either, before the class is assembled and everybody's looking at the teacher, can you go to the office and get a sweatshirt or do you have something to cover that versus

338
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:41,231
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the student is sitting in their chair and on the back of it, there's something that is like causing problems with the students that can read it from behind.

339
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in that case, that's disrupting the class.

340
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:49,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously that needs to be addressed then.

341
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's so much about that.

342
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:57,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did say that, you know, what I like about the policy is that it leads less to the interpretation, but I think,

343
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:06,111
[SPEAKER_04]: My experience is the judgment of a lot of our teachers and staff is quite capable of handling that situation.

344
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:06,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that Ms.

345
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:07,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucy really wants to speak.

346
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:09,742
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you know what?

347
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Russo.

348
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:26,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for me, the only concerning piece I have is that if I'm, what I'm listening to this conversation seems like it kind of weighs a little bit heavier to the secondary piece, which maybe Dr. Cushing can speak to in a minute.

349
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:31,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if there's a violation, at least at the elementary level,

350
00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:35,071
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, students, for the most part, are contained to the same classroom.

351
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that it's not always as cut and dry.

352
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:43,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think we'd really have to have a conversation about how's the communication.

353
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:50,463
[SPEAKER_05]: First and foremost, we don't want students to be embarrassed or have their education disrupted.

354
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:59,090
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there is a violation, trying to get them in a transition period from one class to the other,

355
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:09,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how realistic that is in terms of like, by the time the teacher maybe even alerts an assistant principal, the student might be in the next class.

356
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:17,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just worry a little bit about the strictness of the language there in the third paragraph.

357
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: This one or the last one there?

358
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,472
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusively, which of that, this is the third one, but is that the one you mean?

359
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's just like best efforts.

360
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:55,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to see students disciplined, but I think just the stark nature of the language doesn't really lend itself to a lot of flexibility in how the conversations can happen.

361
00:35:57,053 --> 00:36:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about this paragraph right here?

362
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

363
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:07,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anybody hear me?

364
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can hear you.

365
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:12,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you.

366
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:13,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

367
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:14,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Ms.

368
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:15,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Galussi can hear me.

369
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:18,446
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks frozen, actually.

370
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:30,185
[SPEAKER_02]: She does look frozen.

371
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:31,805
[SPEAKER_02]: She's frozen.

372
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:36,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's moving.

373
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:37,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if she can hear me though.

374
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,807
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I actually could not hear you.

375
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:41,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

376
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:42,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

377
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:47,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you hear me now?

378
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:48,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't, sorry.

379
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:51,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sharing the same audio.

380
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:52,469
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all in the same room.

381
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:52,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

382
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

383
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:57,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it the paragraph that I've highlighted is the issue or the one at the bottom in particular?

384
00:36:57,937 --> 00:36:59,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one for me.

385
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:07,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, I appreciate the conversation with the caregivers that I have no problem with that.

386
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:14,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious as to like in real time and taking into account the varying levels.

387
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:21,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was, in response to that, there was one sentence that I removed.

388
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:30,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's more than one sentence but there was a sentence I removed about the superintendent will promulgate.

389
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:39,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the exact words but essentially, you know procedures around how this will be enforced.

390
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:46,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of anticipate that that would happen anyways, like even with the current language.

391
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:59,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this does not get into the details of a kindergartner versus a senior versus a voc student who's half the time out on, you know, doing their internship.

392
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:04,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it doesn't get into that nitty gritty that

393
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:11,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly understand is different from a student who's going from one classroom to the next versus a student who's just in the same room all day.

394
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:14,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

395
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very open to language changes.

396
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:25,362
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have suggestions, we also do not have to finish this one tonight.

397
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:33,865
[SPEAKER_04]: If people want more time to think on it and obviously,

398
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:39,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it comes to the full committee, when it gets to the full committee, we can edit all we want there as well.

399
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's preferred that we do it in a smaller setting.

400
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:44,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally would appreciate that.

401
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:48,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I had two meetings prior to this.

402
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:51,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the first time I'm seeing the language.

403
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:55,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So I personally would prefer that, but I don't want to necessarily speak for everybody.

404
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:59,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

405
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:15,532
[SPEAKER_07]: The sort of spirit of the preceding sentence, the staff will use reasonable efforts to avoid dress coding students in front of other students.

406
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:30,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's some similar language that can be used in this next paragraph around staff using reasonable efforts to avoid removing students from class.

407
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:57,208
[SPEAKER_07]: unless the attire creates a substantial disruption, just so that there is some flexibility there, because there are reasons that we could certainly brainstorm that would lend it to not being a true disruption, but also being important to address at that time.

408
00:39:57,368 --> 00:40:01,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe just something like that would cover it.

409
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: with the slow typing again, sorry.

410
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:09,518
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

411
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:50,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like this sentence really the one above it covers it, but I certainly see how there are separate paragraph and.

412
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, no teacher wants to turn their whole classroom into a circus over a dress code violation.

413
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not anything anybody's interested in.

414
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:12,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's sort of, it's a bit of that, like we're saying it to make sure everybody gets that.

415
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:21,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I was a student, no teacher wants their classroom to be turned upside down over a dress code violation.

416
00:41:22,669 --> 00:41:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: student who's got something inappropriate that something in violation on their on their sweater hoodie or or whatever else so I certainly I hear you miss closely but I also.

417
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:45,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this is like the intent is the goal here at this.

418
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:54,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering what you think about this change because I do want it to make it clear that this is not a black and white issue.

419
00:41:55,361 --> 00:42:03,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And there may be students that every single day they wanna show up violating the dress code at some moment in there.

420
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:05,251
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, for whatever reason.

421
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:19,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's different if that's the situation, then you may end up dress coding somebody in front of a student in front of other students, because the student is tempting or taunting the whole situation and policy.

422
00:42:21,235 --> 00:42:27,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we wanna make sure that there is the wiggle room to deal with that.

423
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edward-Vinson?

424
00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:30,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was gonna say,

425
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,894
[SPEAKER_06]: That adjustment to the sentence, adding that phrasing, staff will use reasonable efforts.

426
00:42:40,397 --> 00:42:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that captures it.

427
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like that phrasing for that second paragraph as well.

428
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:59,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was also going to suggest that given the amount of time to really digest

429
00:43:02,023 --> 00:43:04,225
[SPEAKER_06]: these recommendations in a concise format.

430
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:22,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to be able to at least let some of the administrative team see this version and just look at what is already in place, the things that are happening, and how the two

431
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:34,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Mary, I, I feel like hitting the areas that there does need to be, um, enforcement is necessary in some situations and circumstances.

432
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:37,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Some students will just test it for the sake of testing.

433
00:43:37,626 --> 00:43:47,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And some students may not even realize that they're violating the policy because you know, they're just checking out news, you know, new fashion or a new style.

434
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have seen situations where, um,

435
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:54,258
[SPEAKER_06]: shirts that might have inappropriate language.

436
00:43:55,179 --> 00:44:00,604
[SPEAKER_06]: The students can be sent to the restroom, and they can put the shirt on inside out.

437
00:44:01,145 --> 00:44:07,471
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't want to like go put a, you know, a school, a different piece of clothing on, but

438
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:35,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, also at the beginning of the year, when students get their kind of rules, their book of rules at the beginning of the year and talking about this being a substantive shift, I think this could be something that could happen as the school year launches to really spend time talking about what our expectations are around dress code and

439
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:41,222
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what's acceptable, what is not, you know, acceptable.

440
00:44:42,362 --> 00:45:00,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it's clearly articulated that we're not trying to target students based on, you know, their different physical builds and clearly, you know, to be clear about that, but at the same time, give them an opportunity to understand

441
00:45:02,653 --> 00:45:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, these are the expectations moving forward.

442
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:20,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would love to be able to get this in front of, you know, more administrators for them to just see the shifts and staff for them to also see what some of the expected changes are.

443
00:45:21,826 --> 00:45:37,729
[SPEAKER_06]: for the dress code so that we could, you know, have a little bit more of a robust conversation and everyone be clear on what the new policy is moving forward once it's, you know, approved by the full body.

444
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

445
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:48,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I, about, yeah, certainly going into the new year is when I was hoping we would approve this, if it gets approved, that it would begin.

446
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just have a quick question about procedure around the handbooks.

447
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember when the handbooks get updated.

448
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like us to be sure that we don't approve all the handbooks and then, you know, two weeks later, a real part of the handbooks has to be replaced.

449
00:46:11,443 --> 00:46:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know when that happens?

450
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:13,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

451
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:19,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we would be able to have the summer I want to say the handbooks are given out at the start of the school year.

452
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:26,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So, over the summer, August would have like there definitely would be time before we get them, you know, printed and.

453
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:52,229
[SPEAKER_06]: know changing the year usually it's the same handbook that you kind of update but especially for something as substantive as dress code you know being you know clearly delineated we want to make sure that this gets added to all of the yearbooks not yearbooks all of the handbooks and

454
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:01,743
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, for staff to be aware of this change, for students to be aware, for parents to be aware of the change that's being recommended.

455
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:04,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

456
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:09,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanna make sure to pay attention to the time.

457
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe somebody has to drive somewhere right now.

458
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: But is there a motion to continue this one policy to one more subcommittee meeting?

459
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:22,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to continue this policy to another subcommittee meeting.

460
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:27,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments?

461
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:27,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

462
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:32,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have one more meeting sometime in May.

463
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, if we can send this up to the first meeting in June for approval, whatever it looks like then.

464
00:47:38,835 --> 00:47:39,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

465
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:40,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

466
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:42,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

467
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:43,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

468
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:45,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo, yes.

469
00:47:45,736 --> 00:47:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Three in the affirmative.

470
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:52,718
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be continued until the next, we'll have another subcommittee meeting on this topic.

471
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:53,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We may actually add another item

472
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really good point.

473
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's another agenda item to that as well.

474
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Um and, um.

475
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:01,443
[SPEAKER_04]: No other comments.

476
00:48:01,664 --> 00:48:02,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

477
00:48:03,384 --> 00:48:04,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

478
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

479
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:11,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

480
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:12,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

481
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:14,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

482
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes Member.

483
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, three in the affirmative.

484
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:17,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you,
