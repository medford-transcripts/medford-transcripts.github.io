1
00:00:01,074 --> 00:00:02,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready, Mr. Clerk?

2
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:03,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I proceed?

4
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:06,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your roll call.

5
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

6
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:31,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Several short weeks ago, I filed a resolution asking the city assessor to take a look into third-party lodging websites such as Airbnb and HomeAway.

7
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,514
[SPEAKER_15]: The assessor had reported back that the Department of Revenue does not

8
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:59,520
[SPEAKER_15]: have any mechanism to define these residents as short-term lodging facilities at this point in time, and the burden falls back on the local government to establish an ordinance that would, in effect, create this type of designation for a property so that the city would be able to, number one, capture some of the revenues that are associated with these short-term rentals, but also, number two, and more importantly, ensure that these units are safe for habitation, Mr. President.

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,522
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd ask that my council colleagues support me

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,083
[SPEAKER_15]: in voting for this resolution so that we can have an ordinance on the books that will allow us the opportunity to capture revenue from third party lodging websites.

11
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:27,790
[SPEAKER_12]: On that motion, some years ago before council and I came on the council, this was an issue that was brought up at that point in time.

12
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:41,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe one of the concerns we had was that our building department were getting complaints from people who were renting out rooms, if not spaces, within the homes.

13
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:48,147
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of them went to college kids, some of them went to transients, and some of them were just for the purposes of, you know, raising some money.

14
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:57,833
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe then, at the time, when Councilor Burke was on the council, she had offered a resolution as it related to the fact of maybe

15
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:08,003
[SPEAKER_12]: going forward in addressing this particular matter so as to make it a revenue-producing part of the real estate that the rental properties were on.

16
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:15,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, the comment that you made, Councilor Night, is basically the same thing that came back then when the conversation took place.

17
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:22,087
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe there was a side mechanism that could be involved in that, and that would be through zoning.

18
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:26,268
[SPEAKER_12]: If the zoning does not or does allow for it,

19
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:33,496
[SPEAKER_12]: then I believe it becomes an issue that you don't need the Department of Revenue to indicate whether it's legal or not.

20
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:36,997
[SPEAKER_12]: We were supposed to then at that point in time get an answer back.

21
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:40,378
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, we might even have something in our law department on that.

22
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:45,220
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd like to amend your motion to go one step further to have a report back.

23
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:54,004
[SPEAKER_12]: If we were to do this, can we do this through our zoning ordinance change, make a change specifically in the zoning ordinances,

24
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:58,645
[SPEAKER_12]: that would either allow or disallow that type of a, of an issue to take place.

25
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:06,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Repeat that amendment to the main motion, a counselor again, courtesy to the clerk.

26
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:21,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to amend counts and nights resolution to look into having a law department look into the legalese, so to speak, of whether to allow or whether we can allow or disallow depending on which way you want to use this mechanism.

27
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:26,914
[SPEAKER_12]: to be included within specific or particular zoning areas in the city of Medford.

28
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:32,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So that way there, let's just say someone has a two-family house, or they want to rent out a room, whatever it might be.

29
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:38,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe if you look at our zoning charts, it'll not be allowed, or it is allowed, or whatever it might be.

30
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:45,519
[SPEAKER_12]: But if it has to be included in there to make itself regulatory for the purposes of taxation, you can do that through zoning.

31
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I just want to be clear that this isn't

32
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:57,910
[SPEAKER_15]: resolution that I'm putting forward to discourage or impede the use of these third-party websites.

33
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that, you know, Airbnb and HomeAway provide a great alternative to hotels.

34
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:12,337
[SPEAKER_15]: They're also very pet-friendly, so individuals who like to travel with their pets are able to use these type of services as opposed to going to the Hyatt or the Hilton or the Marriott.

35
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:19,740
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I want to be very clear that I want this resolution that gets authored to actually

36
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:30,851
[SPEAKER_15]: define the same parameters relative to public safety and also define some parameters relative to registering the unit that they have for sale or for rent rather.

37
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,475
[SPEAKER_15]: And this isn't something where someone goes in and says, I want to sign a lease for 12 months and live in the unit.

38
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:41,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, I want to come and stay at your condo on 28 ninth street for a week and pay you $800 instead of going to a hotel downtown.

39
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,364
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I have no problem with the resolution provided the counselor and I are on the same page.

40
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:55,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly think we are in terms of asking the city solicitor whether or not this is something that's legal, and we're asking the treasurer, collector, and assessor to work in concert with the solicitor.

41
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,460
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we're on the same page in this regard.

42
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:08,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to be very clear that this is not a resolution that I'm putting forward to impede that actual commerce, Mr. President, but rather embrace it and figure out ways that we can capture the revenue and ensure public safety.

43
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:09,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

44
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:09,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Penta.

45
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,145
[SPEAKER_12]: One particular addendum to that.

46
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:15,426
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the concerns that were brought up at that point in time when this was discussed

47
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:24,724
[SPEAKER_12]: some years back was if, in fact, you are renting out that room or a particular part of the house, the parking situation as it relates to cars and within the neighborhood.

48
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:29,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's something that, again, through the law department, I think that's one of the things you need to have addressed.

49
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:31,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's the criteria that I would speak up when I see a criteria in place.

50
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:32,088
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

51
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:33,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

52
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion as amended by Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

53
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

54
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:40,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

55
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,373
[SPEAKER_04]: 15-388 offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

56
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the administration and Office of Community Development update the Medford City Council with regard to any updates they may have on the Malden Hospital redevelopment.

57
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:07,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that we become apprised of any recent discussions between Medford personnel and Malden personnel regarding the redevelopment.

58
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, Vice President Langel-Kern.

59
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:12,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

60
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:13,645
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been

61
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:21,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The city councillors in Malden held one meeting that I was in attendance for with regards to the Malden redevelopment.

62
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,386
[SPEAKER_00]: They spoke to the citizens of Malden.

63
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:31,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Really didn't give the citizens of Medford, you know, too much time to speak and throw out their concerns.

64
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:39,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also a group that is having meetings with regards to how they see the Malden site being redeveloped.

65
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Three acres of the property is in

66
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:50,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and it abuts our neighborhoods up in the heights.

67
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:52,538
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that are concerned on this.

68
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:59,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Lauren DiLorenzo from Office of Community Development was at the first meeting held by the City of Malden.

69
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at that meeting.

70
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:04,488
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also at one of the two meetings from this private group.

71
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,310
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of talk going on.

72
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,533
[SPEAKER_00]: There are developers, I'm sure, working on their plan.

73
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,435
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a while since, you know, Lauren was

74
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:16,004
[SPEAKER_00]: involved at that one meeting.

75
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:23,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to get an update from whether that's Office of Community Development and or the city administrations to see where we stand.

76
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:32,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that our mayor and city administration are on top of what is going on and definitely have a say in the development.

77
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:37,083
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of things that Medford residents are concerned about, obviously opening up that gate.

78
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,245
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed it at prior meetings.

79
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:45,255
[SPEAKER_00]: They're concerned about traffic flow on Salem Street and up in the Heights and people cutting through the neighborhoods.

80
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,696
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already enough traffic around that area.

81
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:51,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to make sure that the City of Medford stays on top of this.

82
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:59,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to, you know, obviously be vigilant in getting in Malden's ear, saying, hey, you know, we have a stake in this too.

83
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,781
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, partly our property as well.

84
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:08,864
[SPEAKER_00]: So just any updates the City of Medford can give us, the City Council with regards to that, because I know there are a lot of,

85
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:14,361
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Medford residents that reach out to the councillors about this proposal.

86
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's very dense.

87
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:21,626
[SPEAKER_00]: They want hundreds of units from townhouses to apartments.

88
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:27,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just a site that probably cannot take that type of density.

89
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:35,735
[SPEAKER_00]: And this other group would like to see some parkland, some public buildings, and where does the city stand is my question.

90
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:36,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

91
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion of Vice

92
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:40,562
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

93
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:42,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Those opposed?

94
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:43,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

95
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:47,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso?

96
00:09:48,244 --> 00:10:00,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to move suspension of two papers, 15-307 and then another one in the hands of the clerk that Councilor Penta submitted regarding the parking kiosks.

97
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:04,648
[SPEAKER_03]: 15-307, do we have that?

98
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the revenues.

99
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfinished business.

100
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:14,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of a suspension of the rules to take two items by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

101
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,440
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

102
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion carries.

103
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:18,641
[SPEAKER_04]: 15-307.

104
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:25,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Revenues from parking kiosks after hours.

105
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Whose motion was that originally?

106
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:29,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Pinto.

107
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Councilor Pinto wish to speak on that?

108
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:35,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Pinto.

109
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, members of the council,

110
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:40,393
[SPEAKER_12]: and also our citizen taxpayers.

111
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:45,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the resolution goes a little bit deeper than the highlight that's basically saying there.

112
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:52,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I know tomorrow night we are supposedly having a meeting as it relates to the parking meter system here in the city of Medford.

113
00:10:53,518 --> 00:11:00,721
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all know what's been going on as it relates to this mayor's parking program here in the city.

114
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a couple of things.

115
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,763
[SPEAKER_12]: The meeting is going to take place at six o'clock tomorrow night.

116
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Allegedly, our chief of police, the mayor,

117
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:20,776
[SPEAKER_12]: The people from Republic, from Tennessee are going to be there, and hopefully any and all interested citizens who have a concern as it relates to what this is all about and how they've been impacted.

118
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:29,858
[SPEAKER_12]: But during this past week, and then once again, I don't know where we begin and where we end with all of this, because it's becoming a nonstop issue.

119
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll jump on to you, Councilor Caviello.

120
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,779
[SPEAKER_12]: On the issue with the meters.

121
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,535
[SPEAKER_12]: They still say 7 in the morning to 7 at night.

122
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:38,275
[SPEAKER_12]: OK?

123
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:46,440
[SPEAKER_12]: And as a result of them saying 7 in the morning to 7 at night, the fact of the matter is, I still see people trying to put the money in the machine.

124
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,661
[SPEAKER_12]: They were supposed to correct it.

125
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:50,443
[SPEAKER_12]: That's nothing more than simple terminology.

126
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,745
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't changed the screens, and that's another issue.

127
00:11:54,185 --> 00:12:01,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking with the folks down in Riverside Avenue today, just today, because I unfortunately haven't been around for a while,

128
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:09,850
[SPEAKER_12]: speaking of the fact, the rudeness of the individuals, the rudeness of the individuals, and how they talk to the patrons utilizing that.

129
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:22,033
[SPEAKER_12]: They finally, from what I understand, just finally highlighted the back of the van that basically says, this truck makes frequent stoppings, and that's all to be included here in the contract.

130
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:27,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank one of our citizen taxpayers, Michael O'Jerry, who comes up here almost every week

131
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:38,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's been very insightful, and he's been very helpful to me, because in my discussions back and forth, we have labored over conversations as it relates to contents within the contract.

132
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:48,804
[SPEAKER_12]: But the contract has very specific sections as it relates to performance duties and responsibilities that not only the city has, but more importantly, the operator has.

133
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:57,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And those duties and responsibilities do come within the first 90 days of the contract, or within the first year, depending on how you want to read this.

134
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:58,399
[SPEAKER_12]: and take advantage of it.

135
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:01,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But we all know what took place yesterday, which is absolute disgrace.

136
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,902
[SPEAKER_12]: These people, these out-of-town bounty hunters from Tennessee, yesterday were tagging people all across the city.

137
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,242
[SPEAKER_12]: City Hall was closed yesterday.

138
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,743
[SPEAKER_12]: There was no rubbish picked up yesterday in the city.

139
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:15,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Nowhere in government was there to be operating.

140
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:17,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And what do we have?

141
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:24,066
[SPEAKER_12]: We have out-of-town bounty hunters going around, tagging people and making their lives miserable here in the city of Medford.

142
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:27,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we all received, if not all of you, at least I received,

143
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:39,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Three of them, through the email today, would pitch us not only of the tickets, but of the tags, and the people saying, I'm not even going to appeal it, I'm going to pay it, but I am not going back to that place of business again, because it's just absolutely wrong.

144
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:47,066
[SPEAKER_12]: If this is what we have denigrated our community to, I just think it's wrong.

145
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,006
[SPEAKER_12]: It's absolutely wrong.

146
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:55,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I had made a resolution, I believe some four weeks ago, and then I had brought it up again at another time.

147
00:13:56,476 --> 00:14:03,400
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I was asked not to force the council or put the council in a position to take a vote until we have this meeting tomorrow night.

148
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,463
[SPEAKER_12]: You folks as counselors, you can have this meeting all you want tomorrow night.

149
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,605
[SPEAKER_12]: But I am moving here right now, tonight, as a result of this resolution.

150
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:16,148
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe you have my paper up there too, as it talks to under suspension.

151
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I am sure you can introduce it now.

152
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

153
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Put it in there.

154
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:21,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

155
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:26,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Enter to combine his paper under suspension offered by council Penta.

156
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:31,515
[SPEAKER_04]: be resolved that the matter of Wednesday's 6 p.m.

157
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:36,319
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting regarding the mayor's new parking program be briefed upon?

158
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:36,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

159
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:44,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is what we're briefing upon it because right now the briefing upon this is very, very brief as far as I'm concerned.

160
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:46,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I am not going to go any further with this.

161
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:53,030
[SPEAKER_12]: And before I go over to my colleague, Councilor Camuso, I just want to

162
00:14:53,882 --> 00:15:05,733
[SPEAKER_12]: say to Councilor Marks, I mean, it was his insight dating back some five years ago with the committee that he served on that basically said we should have nothing more than a traffic enforcement program.

163
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:06,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start it.

164
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:08,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see where we're going.

165
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:13,620
[SPEAKER_12]: When my resolution came up, I think it was three weeks ago, and you asked to lay it on the table, which I did.

166
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,021
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe at that point in time,

167
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:23,954
[SPEAKER_12]: It was your druthers council's marks that said, you know, maybe we should, if we're going to get rid of it, maybe we should think about having a traffic enforcement program, set it small, keep it in house.

168
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that point in time, take it to go forward.

169
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I am, I want to, I'm going to move on my resolution as I had.

170
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:35,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And council Camuso, he can speak on it as well because we've discussed this.

171
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:44,819
[SPEAKER_12]: I am going to move that the city of Medford drop out whatever the proper terminology might be to cease its operations with Republic.

172
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,392
[SPEAKER_12]: because of their multiple violations, for which I won't acknowledge here tonight.

173
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll put it in writing if the clerk wants it or if the city solicitor wants it.

174
00:15:52,953 --> 00:16:05,678
[SPEAKER_12]: The multiple sections of the contract that have been totally violated by the operator and for which the city and for which our own chief of police has publicly acknowledged that he has warned them, advised them what to do, what to change.

175
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,479
[SPEAKER_12]: I have brought in here week after week with pictures.

176
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:11,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I have brought in the fact that they haven't honored their contract for lettering of their trucks.

177
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,402
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't honored their contracts for the kiosk, for the Times,

178
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:19,266
[SPEAKER_12]: the collections of the money, and after yesterday, I think that was the ultimate straw.

179
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:41,104
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm moving, Mr. President, that the council take official position to A, terminate its contract with Tennessee, and B, to support the resolution offered by Councilman Marks, which basically says that the city look at and investigate its own traffic enforcement program for the purposes of the parking, the signage, which is two hours, 30 minutes, whatever it might be,

180
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,960
[SPEAKER_12]: at least take that position and then begin to go forward.

181
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta, the City Council has no contract with that company.

182
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:52,044
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I said advising the Mayor to terminate the contract.

183
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,746
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Penta, Councilor Camuso.

184
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:57,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

185
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:04,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a few weeks ago when Councilor Penta brought the paper forward to get rid of the contract.

186
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that point, I had stated that I'm getting very close to supporting his resolution, but I wanted to see it take

187
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:14,859
[SPEAKER_06]: take a few more weeks and just to see if they could get things straightened out.

188
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:23,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, at this point, the mayor and his top officials have not held this company accountable, as far as I'm concerned.

189
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:29,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in light of that, I have a resolution I'd like to submit on behalf of Councillor Pinter and myself.

190
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:49,034
[SPEAKER_06]: basically that says that in light of the recent actions of Republic Parkins job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable Be it resolved that the mayor and his top administration officials remove the pay-to-park kiosks throughout this community It's to the point now where it's loud and clear.

191
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:49,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

192
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:51,935
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a complete failure of

193
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,661
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a complete failure.

194
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:58,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand the mayor's very busy, but he had his top people put this thing together.

195
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,586
[SPEAKER_06]: This wasn't the new schools they built.

196
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,669
[SPEAKER_06]: This wasn't the DPW yard that looks so great.

197
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,492
[SPEAKER_06]: For whatever reason, this has been a complete and utter failure.

198
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:15,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think it's time that we move forward with doing in-house parking enforcement.

199
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:16,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked a question.

200
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:17,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to actually have it up a little later.

201
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:21,642
[SPEAKER_06]: A few weeks ago, I actually asked, and the council supported this unanimously,

202
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:37,060
[SPEAKER_06]: for a copy of all the transfers that have taken place from July 1st to now, because I wanted to see what money out there they're transferring around within the budget, because obviously that's overtaxing the people, and everyone talks about how fiscally stable this community is.

203
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:42,123
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only because they overbudgeted, and at the end of the year, it gets certified and put into the free cash accounts.

204
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:43,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It's obviously what they're doing.

205
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:50,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get $6 million in a rainy day certified free cash account if you're not overtaxing the people during the year.

206
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not too quick to give us that information.

207
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:58,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again, I'd ask Budget Director Burke to send us this information forthwith.

208
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:08,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that point, look and see if we have additional funding so that we can either purchase some of the equipment to do it in-house, whatever has to be done.

209
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:12,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But the public outcry from the citizens of this community, it's, I'm done.

210
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:18,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday, Mr. President, yesterday, people parked their cars on streets in the whole West Medford area.

211
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:24,320
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole West Medford area, they parked their cars so they could go down and watch Paul Revere ride.

212
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And they came back to tickets on their cars.

213
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:34,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And the signs clearly said, parking certain hours, excluding holidays, Saturday and Sunday.

214
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:47,837
[SPEAKER_06]: If Patriot's Day is not a considered holiday, the mayor doesn't have this building open to come down here and pay your water bill, or to come down here and get some information that you may need from the city.

215
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,755
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to get a parking ticket the same day.

216
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:53,236
[SPEAKER_06]: The trash is put off by a day.

217
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:57,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't get it.

218
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought this to the attention of the budget director yesterday afternoon.

219
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:06,105
[SPEAKER_06]: She was gracious enough to take my call on a day off, and I explained to her the situation.

220
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But to have the city administration and

221
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:15,656
[SPEAKER_06]: The parking company, not on the same page as far as what consists of holiday.

222
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:19,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to go through this every Bunker Hill day, every evacuation day, everything else?

223
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:21,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It just, it doesn't make sense.

224
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And once again, I'm asking, I'm asking to support Councillors Penta's motion.

225
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,553
[SPEAKER_06]: from a few weeks ago and get rid of this evening.

226
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:36,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, if I can just read it again, and this is offered by Councilor Penter and myself.

227
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:46,162
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would, Councilor, so we've taken 15-307 off the table, which the revenues from parking kiosks after hours to be discussed.

228
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:47,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to amend it.

229
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:53,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We've combined that with be it resolved that the matter of Wednesday's 6 p.m.

230
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:53,947
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting

231
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,173
[SPEAKER_04]: be discussed tonight, or briefed upon, I think was the terminology you used, Counselor.

232
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:14,822
[SPEAKER_04]: You've, Counselor Camuso has amended that to make a second request of the Mayor's Office to provide us with a update of free cash exchanges.

233
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:16,483
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I get another paper, I'm gonna discuss that later.

234
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:23,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we'll withdraw that, and we'll now add this amendment, which we'll read into the record, Counselor.

235
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:41,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's going to be an amendment, excuse me, an amendment from myself and counselor Penta that in light of the actions of Republic Parkings, recent job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable, be it resolved that the mayor and his administration remove the pay to park kiosks for it with.

236
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:44,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I would request a roll call vote on this.

237
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:46,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

238
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:46,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor fuel.

239
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:51,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the, uh, this is messenger present that to the clerk for its accuracy.

240
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:52,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, as I said,

241
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been very, very patient, trying not to get to this point.

242
00:21:57,473 --> 00:22:03,215
[SPEAKER_06]: But after yesterday, and just when you call the office too and ask them, they really didn't have any answers.

243
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:07,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Councilor Penta mentioned earlier, he called the office and they were rude.

244
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:11,578
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't rude, they were very nice to me, but they just, well, I have to call another guy here and there.

245
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:16,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville, Somerville, as Councilor Marks often says, they jump out of the trees to give you tickets.

246
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville wasn't giving out tickets yesterday.

247
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And they bring in $8 million a year with their program.

248
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:24,552
[SPEAKER_06]: So something's wrong here.

249
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point, let's get these kiosks out of here.

250
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:30,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get the city back to some sort of sense of normalcy.

251
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:37,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, as far as I'm concerned, I still think there should be strict parking enforcement.

252
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:48,498
[SPEAKER_06]: But do it in a manner that's not so disrupting to the community and with a company or a department here within City Hall that can actually get the job done.

253
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

254
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification, Councilor Penta.

255
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Camuso, it wasn't the people I spoke to.

256
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,279
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the people working the streets, not the people at the office.

257
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:00,979
[SPEAKER_12]: That's number one.

258
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:09,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Number two, I believe inclusive of that resolution that you have in there, there is also a request for my resolution for a roll call vote.

259
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:10,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the thing that was laid in the table.

260
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:11,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we have two of them.

261
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:18,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you get to the, if you look at the official minutes and if you look at the record on the resolution, there was a request

262
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:20,598
[SPEAKER_12]: The one that just took off the table, Eddie.

263
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:21,579
[SPEAKER_12]: The one that came off the table.

264
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,220
[SPEAKER_12]: The one that came off the table had a request for a vote.

265
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President, if I can finish.

266
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Councillor.

267
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:31,082
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could just finish.

268
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:32,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, please, by all means.

269
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:35,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Penter alluded to the fact that we're having a meeting tomorrow night.

270
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I spoke with you earlier today, but I think this meeting should be postponed till when the carnival's out of here.

271
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way to park.

272
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:48,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Based upon the last few meetings on this particular matter, based upon the public outcry with this particular issue,

273
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:56,429
[SPEAKER_06]: To have it on a Wednesday night where City Hall is open and we have this carnival out back here, I just think it's, I think it's doing an injustice.

274
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:04,011
[SPEAKER_06]: We got, we got seven of us here tonight, elected members of the City Council, and I think only two or three of us got parking spots on City Hall property.

275
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:10,752
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, I just don't think we should move forward with it tomorrow night, but that's my humble opinion and whatever the Council sees fit.

276
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello.

277
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

278
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:17,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'm going to agree with Councilor Pantera.

279
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:22,802
[SPEAKER_09]: In Councilor Camuso, I mean, this company's had four months to get their act together here.

280
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:28,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And instead of getting better, it says they've gotten worse.

281
00:24:28,463 --> 00:24:33,144
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done nothing to improve their job performance at all in this community.

282
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:37,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these are simple things that shouldn't be going on.

283
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:38,525
[SPEAKER_09]: You shouldn't be taking them to holidays.

284
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting cars mocked and everything.

285
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:43,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, simple things.

286
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:46,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And I say, for a company of this size,

287
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:54,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to get their act together after four months is just a disgrace, and I'll support my two councillors on this.

288
00:24:55,338 --> 00:25:00,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also agree with Councillor Camuso for tomorrow night with the carnival here.

289
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:01,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm parked on Oakland Street.

290
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:06,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's going to be a large amount of people there tomorrow night, I don't know where they're going to park.

291
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:10,385
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd be in favor of moving the meeting to after the carnival also.

292
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,688
[SPEAKER_04]: May I take this opportunity to point out that it's been advertised at the council's request for two weeks.

293
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:19,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we knew about the carnival at that time, Mr. President.

294
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:24,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was carnival, but, you know.

295
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:27,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we have the meeting and then a follow-up meeting, if necessary?

296
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the advisable thing.

297
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:30,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Marks.

298
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

299
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:45,080
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I agree that it's difficult to find parking, but at this late stage, to cancel a meeting that's been scheduled for several weeks, I think would pose a larger hardship on people that have already made it part of their calendar.

300
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:55,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I would ask that we meet tomorrow night and also set up a meeting for the next few weeks after that to have a follow-up meeting also, Mr. President.

301
00:25:55,775 --> 00:26:04,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Just if I could add my opinion, and I've been very consistent on this mayor's proposed parking plan from day one.

302
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:14,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was actually myself and Councilor Penta, when the mayor presented his plan to us, asked for a plan of doing this in-house versus outsourcing.

303
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:25,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor came back with a shoddy plan, in my opinion, that showed that it was far more expensive to take this parking program in-house than to outsource it.

304
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:32,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And from the start, Mr. President, I, as one member of the council, thought that we could do this in-house.

305
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,730
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the ability to do it.

306
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,651
[SPEAKER_08]: We have crossing guards that already have uniforms and familiar with working on the streets.

307
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:44,392
[SPEAKER_08]: We have retired police officers that have expressed

308
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:48,441
[SPEAKER_08]: interests to me and other members of this council.

309
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:58,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Our original view of this parking proposal was just to enforce existing signage, nothing more.

310
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:13,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay for parking was never a subject that was brought up to institute in this community until the mayor got hold of that particular idea and felt that the revenue, which we all want additional revenue, was the way to go.

311
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:27,563
[SPEAKER_08]: in this aspect and I believe firmly revenue is secondary when it comes to parking enforcement and the primary objective is to move cars along in the business districts and also to enforce resident permit parking in our neighborhoods.

312
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:33,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, from the get-go I have not been in favor of this particular program.

313
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:45,999
[SPEAKER_08]: On the flip side, and I stated this a couple of weeks ago, there are aspects of the program that currently exist, not to pay for parking aspects, but other aspects that are underway.

314
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:53,483
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of time and effort went into them, and I think we can keep portions of the parking program without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

315
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:58,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have been supportive from day one, taking this in-house.

316
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:02,227
[SPEAKER_08]: You lose all local control, as we found out,

317
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:09,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said this seven months ago, actually even longer, eight months ago, even before the mayor signed a contract.

318
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:14,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you hire an outside contractor, you lose all local control, Mr. President.

319
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're seeing that now.

320
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:20,524
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hearing from the public saying, well, how can they give out a ticket on a holiday?

321
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:25,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And how come they're giving out tickets when I have a permit sticker and they're still giving me a ticket on my own street?

322
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,508
[SPEAKER_08]: How come they're enforcing after hours?

323
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:31,130
[SPEAKER_08]: How come they're taking my money when the kiosks aren't supposed to accept money?

324
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:36,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're here on all these issues, and partly based on because we're dealing with an outside entity.

325
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,872
[SPEAKER_08]: This council also asked for financial reporting.

326
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:49,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if anyone else has received any reporting, but we have yet to receive one iota of financial reporting on this particular program.

327
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a major concern, Mr. President.

328
00:28:51,755 --> 00:29:00,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just take this opportunity to point out, if you notice on the call for the Committee of the Whole meeting, I asked for a number of reports from a number of different constituencies within City Hall.

329
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:08,249
[SPEAKER_04]: and without and the clerk to date has received nothing to attach to our packets for tomorrow night's meeting.

330
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

331
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have not received it.

332
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:29,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so at this point, uh, Mr. President, um, I, I support, uh, the, uh, resolution brought forward, uh, not only cause it's the right thing to do, but the fact that councilor Camuso and council Penter are both, uh, on the resolution as offering it,

333
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:32,053
[SPEAKER_08]: to me, is a milestone in this community.

334
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:37,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is another reason why I will support this tonight, Mr. President.

335
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:49,022
[SPEAKER_08]: And it makes sense on behalf of this community, on the residents that I've spoken to, the hundreds of residents that have sent us emails, stopped me at Stop and Shop in the street, saying that they don't agree with this particular program.

336
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:55,545
[SPEAKER_08]: The business owners that are struggling now, hearing that customers are not going to come back because of this program.

337
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,625
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that say to a small business?

338
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:03,308
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that say to a small business that, you know what, we don't care if people don't come back to your business.

339
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:04,408
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a parking

340
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:08,444
[SPEAKER_08]: plan in place, and according to the mayor, it's working.

341
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:12,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that it's not working.

342
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:18,970
[SPEAKER_08]: People in this community are struggling now with the program, and let's go back to the basics and move forward.

343
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:27,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And the basics would be, Mr. President, enforce the existing signage, look at the permit parking, and move forward after that, Mr. President.

344
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:28,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor.

345
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:29,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Penta.

346
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:34,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments, but once again,

347
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:40,511
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the issues that were brought up in this thing is the parking spaces in the permit parking.

348
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:48,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And on page two of the contract, one of the things that really, I think, have riled some of the neighborhood folks is, A, maintain and update permit database.

349
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:52,558
[SPEAKER_12]: B, redo, hold, revoke, and reinstate, reactivate permits.

350
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:55,080
[SPEAKER_12]: C, update all permit files.

351
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,301
[SPEAKER_12]: D, inquire into permit data.

352
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,412
[SPEAKER_12]: and E, billing and payment for permits.

353
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:07,135
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of those issues, those five issues, have been really bones of controversy with the parking program and the contract.

354
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we have folks from South Medford.

355
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:10,716
[SPEAKER_12]: We have people from Medford.

356
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:16,518
[SPEAKER_12]: We have people on streets that have permit parking that are getting tickets, and they have the stickers right on their cars.

357
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:27,062
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have the fact that into the contract, it basically says that the city has its exclusive right within its initial time period, which I believe is the first three months,

358
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:31,428
[SPEAKER_12]: for the purposes of, hey, taking an investigation and looking at and reviewing.

359
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:34,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And by looking and reviewing, we're not going anywhere.

360
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:40,291
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact of the matter is, Councilor Marks, you just hit something on the head that probably we should have brought up before, and that's this.

361
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:45,213
[SPEAKER_12]: People said there are more spaces now available than there was before.

362
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:55,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Where those spaces that are available, go to the stores, go to the merchants in front of the stores where those spaces are, and ask them if those spaces are helping or hurting their business.

363
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,930
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the answer is very pronouncedly, no, it's not helping their business at all.

364
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:15,517
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is, you know, on page four of the contract, in the event that the operator terminates the agreement or, quote, ceases to perform its obligations herein prior to the completion of the initial term, that's the beginning, that's it, they're out.

365
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:23,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think with that being said, and I'm not going to rehash it, I'm moving to terminate it, thank Councilor Camuso for being part of it.

366
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:26,245
[SPEAKER_12]: And the resolution, I believe, speaks for itself, Mr. President.

367
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask what the actual resolve is.

368
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So the resolve is to pull the kiosks and terminate the contract?

369
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:37,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

370
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:42,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from my perspective, I feel the same way.

371
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:46,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very frustrated with regards to, you know, the amount of emails we get.

372
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:50,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday was almost the last straw, and I think it was for the council, with regards to

373
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,012
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets going out when it was a holiday.

374
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:57,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I specifically asked the chief of police, are they ticketing today?

375
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:58,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said no.

376
00:32:58,315 --> 00:33:05,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden we get e-mails that night that people are getting ticketed, not only in our squares, but also in our residential streets.

377
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,841
[SPEAKER_00]: People are upset.

378
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,582
[SPEAKER_00]: People do not like this program.

379
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:13,846
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of it is the way it was rolled out, when it was rolled out, and how it was rolled out.

380
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,535
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also that they're just not following the contract.

381
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:22,778
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, even though week after week after week, we're pointing out errors.

382
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:23,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pointing out mistakes.

383
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,480
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pointing out violations.

384
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're pointing out reason after reason after reason of why the public hates the program, on top of the fact that most people didn't like it.

385
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:41,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess where I'm confused is we have a meeting tomorrow night that's probably going to lead to another meeting.

386
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:49,525
[SPEAKER_00]: if I could suggest, make a suggestion that we ask the mayor to terminate all dealings, have them get off our streets.

387
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure this out.

388
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:53,167
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not going to do it the right way, I agree.

389
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:54,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pull the plug.

390
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:54,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure out.

391
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:57,168
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, the mayor didn't want to do it in-house.

392
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the discussions.

393
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:00,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember asking, why not meters?

394
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, kiosks.

395
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,071
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor wanted kiosks.

396
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:03,931
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.

397
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:07,673
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no say in what type of machines were going into our city.

398
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,314
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, I want to hear what they have to say.

399
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:12,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, probably

400
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:16,498
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 questions that I have to ask for public, information that we need from them.

401
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,040
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not doing it right.

402
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:37,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just suggest that we ask the mayor to have, until we resolve these issues and figure out a way that we can do it the right way, whether that's free half-hour parking, free parking, and have, you know, the city lose some portion of the intake that we were supposed to get, because I agree, this isn't about the money.

403
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:39,018
[SPEAKER_00]: This is turning over our squares

404
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,609
[SPEAKER_00]: This was creating more business, not less.

405
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:42,529
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our goal.

406
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:43,949
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the city council's goal.

407
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So changes do need to be made.

408
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions do need to be answered.

409
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:50,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just ask that we have the meeting tomorrow night.

410
00:34:50,912 --> 00:35:04,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the meantime, whether it's tomorrow night and next Wednesday as well, we ask the mayor to have them cease giving out any type of tickets, cease the program, and then we can decide after we meet with them what to do, what is the right answer.

411
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they make any changes?

412
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they amend the contract?

413
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:34,199
[SPEAKER_06]: contract where they haven't you know, there's just so many unanswered questions and Just just another thought Thank you, and I thank councillor lungo current for her thoughts and like I said this this resolution didn't come easy but it's at a juncture where They just keep every week.

414
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something new.

415
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something new.

416
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something new

417
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:38,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Street sweeping has not started yet.

418
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:42,840
[SPEAKER_06]: We tick it in and toe, well, it has started, but like in full force, tick it in and towing.

419
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And just enough is enough.

420
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:47,342
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

421
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having a meeting tomorrow night.

422
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:56,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to park at Representative Donato's office down on Salem Street to walk here because there's going to be no parking in the immediate area.

423
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, and that's why I still say that we should cancel this meeting.

424
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:04,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm only one of seven, but to give people the opportunity

425
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:08,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello this evening is parked up behind Tony Lucci's.

426
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:12,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm parked down in an adjacent parking lot.

427
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:17,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Other members of the council are parked far beyond the area of this building.

428
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's not fair.

429
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:21,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't have City Hall open this evening.

430
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:31,592
[SPEAKER_06]: City Hall is closed for all intents and purposes tonight except the Medford City Council members, a few people from the administration that were here earlier, as well as the few guests that are here.

431
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:41,512
[SPEAKER_06]: But to do it tomorrow night, and I respectfully, I understand what Councilor Marks says, but we're not going to get the administration back at the table in two weeks or four weeks to discuss this.

432
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:53,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, that's my thoughts and I would like to see it canceled and move forward to a date that, and you know what, if no one shows up at that point, then so be it.

433
00:36:54,154 --> 00:36:57,054
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's incumbent upon us to get the community feedback.

434
00:36:57,574 --> 00:37:00,415
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the people's forum and that's why

435
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,625
[SPEAKER_06]: If yesterday didn't happen, I would have been bringing this up tomorrow evening with Councillor Penta.

436
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:08,647
[SPEAKER_06]: But after yesterday, you know what?

437
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:10,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

438
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:13,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not going to be changing my mind on their performance.

439
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:20,236
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor and his senior staff, they're holding this company accountable.

440
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

441
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,562
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I certainly think that

442
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:33,305
[SPEAKER_15]: This program has been nothing short of a disaster since the rollout.

443
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:34,945
[SPEAKER_15]: I was supportive of it.

444
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I felt as though it was something that was going to work.

445
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:39,186
[SPEAKER_15]: And boy, was I wrong.

446
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:41,326
[SPEAKER_15]: The rollout's been done poorly.

447
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:44,167
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no signage, no loading zones, no striping.

448
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:52,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a huge competing interest between the needs of the residents in the residential communities and the needs of the businesses in the business communities, Mr. President.

449
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:56,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was always a firm believer that the residents should come.

450
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Residential enforcement should be done first and foremost.

451
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:02,118
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that that's really where we need to focus our efforts at this point in time.

452
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:08,139
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm glad to see that the police department is investing some money into the same technology the republic is using.

453
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:23,023
[SPEAKER_15]: However, in terms of the job the republic is doing in enforcing our business districts, I think it's come to a point now where, I mean, I think it's safe to say that Paul Revere's horse got a ticket yesterday out in front of gappy funeral home, Mr. President.

454
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:23,623
[SPEAKER_15]: They were everywhere.

455
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:24,543
[SPEAKER_15]: They were all over the place.

456
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:26,944
[SPEAKER_15]: And my major concern is,

457
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:36,575
[SPEAKER_15]: This program and this plan was pitched to the council as having an objective to turn spots over and to keep all day commuters out of our business districts.

458
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:39,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was going to be a residential component on top of that.

459
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:45,699
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that we've certainly met the objective of keeping commuters out of our business districts all day.

460
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:54,183
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we're also meeting an objective of keeping 50% of the people that were comfortable utilizing our business districts out of our business districts as well.

461
00:38:55,475 --> 00:39:06,799
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm a little bit less concerned about the financial cash windfall side of this program, and I'm a little bit more concerned about the fact that the stated objective is just not being met at this point in time.

462
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:13,401
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been very vocal and outspoken in our displeasure with certain aspects of the plan.

463
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:18,023
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had individuals from Republic come down and talk to us and give us nothing but lip service.

464
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:24,403
[SPEAKER_15]: We've realized and come to the realization that Republic's only doing what they're told.

465
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:30,005
[SPEAKER_15]: The Traffic Commission governs traffic policy here in the city of Medford, and the Traffic Commission needs to be before us.

466
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:36,246
[SPEAKER_15]: And I certainly share the frustration that Councilor Penter and Councilor Camuso and Councilor Mox has.

467
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,927
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I think that we do need this meeting.

468
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:54,721
[SPEAKER_15]: for any other reason but for to have the traffic commission explain itself as to why the program's been implemented so poorly, why it's going in the direction that it's going in, whether or not they've actually had their finger on the pulse of what's going on in the implementation and rollout of this plan, Mr. President.

469
00:39:55,541 --> 00:40:05,826
[SPEAKER_15]: And more so, I think, one of the glaring factors that leads me to find that I think it's time that we really take a long, hard look at scrapping this plan is the fact that

470
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:09,446
[SPEAKER_15]: We've continuously requested information, and we just don't get this information.

471
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:15,948
[SPEAKER_15]: So, either there's something going on that they don't want to share with us, or there's some reason why this material is being withheld from us.

472
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:17,869
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to have a good, productive meeting tomorrow night.

473
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:24,191
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't, because we don't have the information that we requested, for which we felt was going to help us to be productive, Mr. President.

474
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:34,734
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, at this point in time, I'd like an opportunity to hear from the Traffic Commission to see what they have to say as to why they're being so ineffective in the implementation of this contract.

475
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,551
[SPEAKER_15]: and what the reason is for the holdups.

476
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:41,613
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, it doesn't matter at this point.

477
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:44,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been eight months, five months, four months, however long it's been.

478
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:45,975
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been far too long.

479
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,136
[SPEAKER_15]: And the people are suffering, and the businesses are suffering.

480
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:50,857
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mr. President, I'm really torn at this point in time.

481
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:54,679
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we do need an opportunity to speak with the Traffic Commission to hear what they have to say.

482
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:56,460
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's what it's going to be.

483
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,420
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only going to be say.

484
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to see more do and less say.

485
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor.

486
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Longo Kern.

487
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:15,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Just quickly, if I could also amend this and request, I've already emailed the chief of police, but request that any tickets that were given out yesterday, which was a holiday, it's Patriot's Day, be wiped out.

488
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,735
[SPEAKER_00]: That people don't have to go down and appeal these tickets.

489
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,035
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a holiday.

490
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Republic should not have been out tagging anybody on a holiday.

491
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:30,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So just ask my council colleagues to agree with me on that and hopefully wipe out those tickets.

492
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Penter.

493
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:42,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, in regards to Councilor Knight's remark, I'd like to refer back to our city clerk, Ed Finn.

494
00:41:42,357 --> 00:41:43,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was last Friday.

495
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:48,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I had called Mr. Finn up and I asked him for something that the council included in the resolution that we brought up.

496
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:57,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we had asked for all the resolutions that had been sent to the traffic commission for the purposes of their action and those that have not been acted upon.

497
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Did that ring a bell, Mr. Finn?

498
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:03,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

499
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,294
[SPEAKER_12]: And the request was to have it for our packet this weekend so we could review it.

500
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:12,076
[SPEAKER_12]: The chief responded back, said, it's not ready yet.

501
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:20,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the second letter went out and asked them if we could have it before or on tonight's meeting so we do not go to tomorrow's meeting ill-prepared.

502
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just symptomatic of what you're talking about.

503
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:31,090
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what it takes for people to respond to resolutions and requests, but every part of this program is just not working.

504
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,092
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a disaster from day one.

505
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta, Councilor Camuso?

506
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:38,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one more thing.

507
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:52,019
[SPEAKER_06]: If we also could get an update, I believe when the budget was put together by the budget director and the city administration, anticipated receipts from this anticipated program is in the budget.

508
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So that may be why they don't want to pull out of this as quick.

509
00:42:57,122 --> 00:43:02,825
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could ask that question, because they factored this year's budget, I'm assuming based upon the income from this program.

510
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,804
[SPEAKER_06]: We've asked for the data, and we still don't get it.

511
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Further, further amended by Councilor Camuso, that the question be asked of the budget director was the projected income from this program factored into the budget?

512
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:22,753
[SPEAKER_06]: FY 2016 budget.

513
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,854
[SPEAKER_04]: FY 2016 budget.

514
00:43:24,914 --> 00:43:26,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

515
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:27,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Sir, you wish to speak?

516
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:27,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

517
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:29,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Please state your name and address for the record.

518
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:31,444
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

519
00:43:31,624 --> 00:43:33,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

520
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:41,048
[SPEAKER_10]: My first suggestion is I'm also frustrated by the carnival being here and the lack of parking.

521
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:50,513
[SPEAKER_10]: May I suggest that the city provides a shuttle that ferries people from Riverside, the parking lot on Riverside, which would be available at 6 o'clock, to this building?

522
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:54,075
[SPEAKER_10]: There are numerous different agencies that would be able to do that.

523
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:58,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So perhaps that would be an option, rather than having people hunt for parking all across town.

524
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:07,516
[SPEAKER_10]: My second suggestion involves the wording of the resolution, and it involves the word, I think you should involve the word breach, due to breach of contract.

525
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:16,319
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why I suggest this is that there's numerous places in the contract where you can terminate, but those terminations also have some consequences for the city.

526
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let me read you off this particular section.

527
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,080
[SPEAKER_10]: It's off page 15 of the contract, section 23.

528
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,661
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to other termination rights here under,

529
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:46,484
[SPEAKER_10]: with party may terminate this agreement upon breach by the other party of any covenant, term, or condition wherein provided the breaking party first releases written notice, which you have in multiple resolutions, of such breach and fails to remedy same within 10 days if a monetary breach or 30 days if a non-monetary breach.

530
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:52,027
[SPEAKER_10]: After receipt of written notice thereof and any breaching party fails to commerce

531
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:59,470
[SPEAKER_10]: remedying such non-monetary breach within said 30 days, period, if such breach cannot be reasonably remedied within 30 days.

532
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,670
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of lawyer speak, but the idea is this.

533
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:21,315
[SPEAKER_10]: If they've broken the contract, which they have seemed to on multiple accounts, some of which you all have pointed out, some of which I've handed to Councilor Penta and highlighted points, they haven't responded within 30 days, they haven't remedied these points, they're under breach of contract, there are no consequences for canceling this contract under the city.

534
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:29,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the city can, we don't know if they've been responded to.

535
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:29,754
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem.

536
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:34,498
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the mayor may have asked them and, but they just haven't been conveyed to us.

537
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:40,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, so that's part of the frustration that we've, that we're having here is he may have them.

538
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,663
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know.

539
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:41,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

540
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:51,352
[SPEAKER_12]: I, Rick, we've had multiple conversations about the cars not being properly signage, the back of the cars not being properly signage.

541
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:59,796
[SPEAKER_12]: the kiosks themselves not having proper signage, people putting money in the meter after 6 o'clock at night up until this past week, OK?

542
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:02,459
[SPEAKER_12]: These are multiple issues that have been ongoing.

543
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:07,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's their problem for not doing it.

544
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,244
[SPEAKER_04]: You've both made your points.

545
00:46:09,404 --> 00:46:11,086
[SPEAKER_04]: The citizen can continue speaking.

546
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:21,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So in conclusion, I think you should, due to breach of contract, those words might sound trivial and maybe legalistic, but if a judge

547
00:46:22,543 --> 00:46:30,648
[SPEAKER_10]: agrees that Republic is under breach of the contract, there are no serious consequences for the city, where if you just cancel, there may be some consequences.

548
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:31,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

549
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wish to speak, please present yourself and state your name and address for the record.

550
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:38,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim.

551
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:42,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, city councillors.

552
00:46:42,134 --> 00:46:45,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Jim Bilodeau of Guild Street, Medford.

553
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:47,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say first that I'm 100%

554
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:58,072
[SPEAKER_11]: in favor of all the city councils of our fine city in regards to this disastrous parking situation that we now have ourselves into.

555
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:10,714
[SPEAKER_11]: All the discrepancies that they've been committing, all the crimes, collecting money on a holiday when the signs specify holidays are exempt and Sundays, Sundays and holidays.

556
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,315
[SPEAKER_11]: This is illegal, that's a theft.

557
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:14,795
[SPEAKER_11]: They're thieves, that's what they are.

558
00:47:14,815 --> 00:47:16,356
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just common thieves.

559
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:18,296
[SPEAKER_11]: They're stealing people's money.

560
00:47:19,216 --> 00:47:21,116
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't have that, not in our fine city.

561
00:47:22,837 --> 00:47:31,859
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, and all the other problems that we've had, they're collecting money before hours, before they're in effect, and after they're in effect.

562
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,019
[SPEAKER_11]: That's thievery.

563
00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:33,939
[SPEAKER_11]: That's theft.

564
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't commit a theft and get away with it.

565
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,200
[SPEAKER_11]: How are they?

566
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are the things that we have to think about.

567
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to say, too, any one of our city councilors that want to be the mayor, if they make this one of their topical

568
00:47:48,166 --> 00:48:02,231
[SPEAKER_11]: programs on their, you know, what they're going to do for the city, you know, I think they'll be elected if they say they're going to clean up this parking mess that Republic has, if it drags on to the point for the new mayor to come into office.

569
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:10,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if you run on that platform and you tell the people of Medford that you're going to get rid of this program for us, you're going to be elected mayor.

570
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:11,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

571
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:11,974
[SPEAKER_11]: And God bless you all.

572
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:12,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jim.

573
00:48:13,814 --> 00:48:14,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, sir.

574
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Please state your name and address for the record.

575
00:48:16,445 --> 00:48:18,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe Filione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

576
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:24,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Last September, I videotaped the meeting to inform this public.

577
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:32,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Three councillors had the foresight, Councillor Marks, Longo Kern, and Penta, to vote for the public to see it.

578
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,642
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so interesting to see this Mitt Romney flip-flop.

579
00:48:36,722 --> 00:48:37,622
[SPEAKER_05]: It's refreshing.

580
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy the guys that were adamantly in McGlynn's pocket

581
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:47,008
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting for it, denying residents to be able to talk about it because they kept doing point of information to shut people up.

582
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:48,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, they've got religion.

583
00:48:48,508 --> 00:49:08,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a leader, 195 days from now, when it's election day, a real leader is someone who has the vision, like Councilor Marx, like Councilor Penta, like Councilor Lungo Kern, the vision to see that this was wrong in the beginning and to let the public speak and to maybe put the video on the air so that people could see Mayor McGlynn in all his glory, the prima donna,

584
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,642
[SPEAKER_05]: telling us how it's going to be, not working with us, but working against us.

585
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:14,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That video is still there.

586
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked hard.

587
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:20,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked very hard because I was moving my company from one space to another.

588
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:21,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dead tired.

589
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:24,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I videotaped it, and three councils shot me down.

590
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,651
[SPEAKER_05]: One was absent, driving for his own company.

591
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:28,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Disgraceful.

592
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

593
00:49:31,454 --> 00:49:32,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The flip-flop is here.

594
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:33,455
[SPEAKER_05]: We were right.

595
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:34,356
[SPEAKER_05]: They were wrong.

596
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:35,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But they want to be mayor?

597
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:36,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

598
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:37,938
[SPEAKER_04]: You.

599
00:49:38,805 --> 00:49:48,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motions of Councilor Penta, Camuso, as amended, and Councilor Lungo, as amended by Councilor Lungo.

600
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:49,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

601
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:55,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd ask that you read that back, because we have been going for a little bit of time.

602
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:58,250
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. President, it's been amended on multiple occasions.

603
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,350
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd ask if the clerk would read it back in its current form.

604
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:06,952
[SPEAKER_04]: If Mr. Clerk will kindly read back to us in current form.

605
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,584
[SPEAKER_04]: the resolution as amended so many times.

606
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:20,089
[SPEAKER_15]: If I understand this correctly, it's paper 15307 was taken off the table combined with a paper that was filed on suspension.

607
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:22,391
[SPEAKER_15]: That language has been replaced with what the clerk said.

608
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:31,717
[SPEAKER_04]: An additional and an additional amendment or an additional motion that was in hand by, co-sponsored by Camuso and Penta.

609
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:37,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So the paper that was taken off the table, introduced it into discussion.

610
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:50,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the paper that was in hand to the clerk under suspension was absorbed into 15 dash three Oh seven and further amended by the paper presented by Kumuso and Penta, which the clerk will read.

611
00:50:50,693 --> 00:50:52,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

612
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:52,835
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

613
00:50:52,855 --> 00:51:00,640
[SPEAKER_13]: 15 dash three seven zero offered by council path to be resolved at the intentional failure of the mayor's revenue enhancement parking program

614
00:51:01,307 --> 00:51:13,489
[SPEAKER_13]: not monitoring why the reprogramming of the parking kiosks in their continued collections of revenues not entitled to revenue collection totals after operating hours be discussed.

615
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:30,793
[SPEAKER_13]: A, amended by Councilor Penta, that the city terminate its parking contract with Republic from Tennessee pursuant to the contract section 56II in the interest of the taxpayers of the city, small businesses, and city as a whole.

616
00:51:31,649 --> 00:51:40,536
[SPEAKER_13]: amended by Councilor Caviello, that a meeting be called with the Mayor and Republican Committee of the Whole or in the Council Chambers within 14 days.

617
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:57,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Amended by Councilor Knight, that a meeting be called with all parties concerned as previously requested in 30 days prior to the meeting within 14 days to the Council meeting to share their concerns, complaints, and recommendations to present to the 30-day meeting.

618
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Amended by Councilor Martin, that the Mayor report back

619
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:07,517
[SPEAKER_13]: if the individual enforcement part of the contract can be eliminated from the contract and enforcement done in-house.

620
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:10,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, we end up tabling that.

621
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,980
[SPEAKER_13]: And OK, now in conjunction with that.

622
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:20,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, now you took it off the table.

623
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, yeah.

624
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:24,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all off the table and before us.

625
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:26,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, in conjunction now.

626
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:28,366
[SPEAKER_13]: with that paper.

627
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:41,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure how to word it, but, uh, be it resolved that the matter of Wednesday, 6 PM meeting regarding the mayor's new parking program be briefed upon.

628
00:52:41,514 --> 00:52:43,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

629
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:46,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Now then we have the Camuso Penta.

630
00:52:47,018 --> 00:52:52,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Camuso Penta in the light of amended.

631
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:52,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

632
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:54,963
[SPEAKER_13]: In the light of actions of the actions,

633
00:52:55,705 --> 00:53:15,389
[SPEAKER_13]: and breach of contract obligations of the Republic parking recent job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable, be it resolved that the mayor and his administration remove the pay to park kiosk forthwith.

634
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:17,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

635
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have several additional amendments that were given off the floor tonight.

636
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:24,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of these a little bit redundant because, uh,

637
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:31,645
[SPEAKER_13]: from the past, but Council Penter also is to terminate, advise the mayor to terminate the contract.

638
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:43,350
[SPEAKER_13]: And Councilor Kern amended that any parking tickets issued on Patriot's Day should be voided.

639
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:54,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And amended by Councilor Camuso.

640
00:53:56,008 --> 00:54:14,560
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, their report back on the fiscal 15, 2015, uh, budget on anticipated receipts, uh, from the parking program.

641
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,181
[SPEAKER_04]: The question has been moved.

642
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:19,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call has been requested.

643
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:22,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, did counselor one question?

644
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:25,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, President DelaRusso.

645
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:26,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President?

646
00:54:28,108 --> 00:54:32,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some of the—it's a lot of language to digest, but I feel like some of it is almost contradictory.

647
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:49,841
[SPEAKER_00]: To terminate the contract, that's fine, but then to enforce—the enforcement be done in-house, I'm assuming with the kiosks, because to terminate the contract, we quite possibly have to pay for the kiosks anyway.

648
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:53,538
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have another resolve that we remove the kiosks.

649
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:58,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, so how are we going to enforce the kiosks in-house, yet terminate?

650
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:04,703
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like we need to sit down and figure out a plan going forward.

651
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:07,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I agree, it should probably, it should have been done in-house.

652
00:55:07,564 --> 00:55:10,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't have been a moneymaker like it is.

653
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,206
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been for the businesses.

654
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:13,667
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like we need to

655
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:21,198
[SPEAKER_00]: throw around this language, whether it's, we have, we're all going to sit down tomorrow night and we need to discuss going forward.

656
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:25,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we just, do we just want to go back and remove the kiosk and go back to where we were before?

657
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then we'd have to ask the mayor to, like we did in the first place.

658
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:36,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, I truly believe it's a few counselors that said no parking garage, let's enforce our streets.

659
00:55:36,943 --> 00:55:37,684
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't happen.

660
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:38,664
[SPEAKER_00]: This plan came out.

661
00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:44,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're stuck with these kiosks and we have bounty hunters, as Councilor Pinto will put it.

662
00:55:45,354 --> 00:55:46,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we need a plan.

663
00:55:46,655 --> 00:55:59,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we all feel that we should go back to where we were, not enforcing anything and hoping or asking the mayor to put enforcement in with or without kiosks, with or without in-house enforcement?

664
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:10,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like we need to sit down and really talk about this and become unison because I agree, maybe the contract should be terminated or maybe the kiosk should be taken out and we should do it in-house.

665
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:13,196
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need the administration on board

666
00:56:13,724 --> 00:56:15,765
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we don't go back to the same old, same old.

667
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:19,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people didn't, we had people on us all the time.

668
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,386
[SPEAKER_00]: You need parking enforcement.

669
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:29,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have people still now who want our streets, their own streets, enforced with permit parking.

670
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:33,430
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that sat at this meeting begging for permit parking enforcement.

671
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I agree, I see where the councilors are going.

672
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:42,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it's a disgrace, it's frustrating, and it's,

673
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:53,023
[SPEAKER_00]: things need to change, but don't you think one, you know, we should sit down for more than, you know, just a council meeting and sit down and talk about it.

674
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,024
[SPEAKER_00]: We're meeting tomorrow night.

675
00:56:54,224 --> 00:56:55,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should come up with a plan.

676
00:56:56,125 --> 00:57:03,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mr. Mayor, we don't want Republic in this city anymore, but we want A, B and C. We want the kiosks to stay.

677
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,671
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be free parking.

678
00:57:06,271 --> 00:57:07,812
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the kiosks to stay.

679
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:10,233
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be free parking, but we want enforcement.

680
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:11,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we need

681
00:57:11,782 --> 00:57:18,047
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a better idea of what direction we want to lead in, not just saying, let's terminate the contract, because it sounds great.

682
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a call to move the question.

683
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:21,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta.

684
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

685
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:25,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor.

686
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:26,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

687
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:40,044
[SPEAKER_12]: To clarify the point that Councilor Longo just alluded to is, number one, I believe what we're referring to was Councilor Mox's suggestion, is that if, in fact, we were going to terminate or eliminate, correct me if I'm wrong, if you're going to terminate or eliminate

688
00:57:41,072 --> 00:57:47,555
[SPEAKER_12]: the Republic Company, then we should look into having our own in-house with signage and whatever it might be.

689
00:57:48,256 --> 00:58:00,762
[SPEAKER_12]: If the confusion is taken away and we just stick to the resolution itself to eliminate and terminate the contract, the first one, the second one is offered by Councilor Camuso and myself because of the breach of the contract, I'd be willing to let everything else go.

690
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:01,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you know something?

691
00:58:02,202 --> 00:58:05,884
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things the mayor said in his newspaper editorial is to

692
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:14,213
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the reasons why he is no longer wanting to serve is because of his inability or his lack of getting along with this council.

693
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:16,554
[SPEAKER_12]: He's never sat down with this council.

694
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:19,595
[SPEAKER_12]: He's never discussed our concerns relative to these issues.

695
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:25,417
[SPEAKER_12]: He's made the outrageous statement that he's never received one complaint about this program.

696
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:28,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, if he hasn't received one complaint,

697
00:58:28,913 --> 00:58:33,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's everybody, blind in City Hall that they don't know what's going on?

698
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:36,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, of course it's an issue that it's outstanding.

699
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:47,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And if he wants to leave office magnanimously, and he could stand up here and say, you know something, we all make mistakes, and I made a big mistake by bringing this company in, but I'm going to rectify it.

700
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:51,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to listen to you, Council, or I'm going to pull the plug, and we're going to sit down.

701
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:54,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if he said something correctly, Councilman

702
00:58:54,553 --> 00:58:57,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't he say that he's been working on this for five years?

703
00:58:57,715 --> 00:59:00,036
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been working on this program for five years.

704
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:02,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And you people put a report together.

705
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:04,739
[SPEAKER_12]: You people put a report together in September of 2009.

706
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,000
[SPEAKER_12]: This is now 2015.

707
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:12,523
[SPEAKER_12]: What did it take him five to six years to put together?

708
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:18,066
[SPEAKER_12]: An out-of-state bounty hunter country company to come in here and disrupt our community?

709
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:32,339
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be willing to forego all the amendments to the resolution, stick to my original one, Councillor, Councillor Camuso, if you want to stick to yours, vote on both of those resolutions, and everything else will work itself out.

710
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:35,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Because whether he's going to sit down with us or not, it's immaterial.

711
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:37,663
[SPEAKER_12]: He hasn't even called us up.

712
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:48,231
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't even give us the courtesy that he wasn't even going to run anymore to bring his legislative body in, the council who approves his budget year in and year out.

713
00:59:49,147 --> 00:59:50,608
[SPEAKER_12]: whether we agree or disagree.

714
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:53,189
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had many good days.

715
00:59:53,369 --> 01:00:03,393
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had, I think, more bad days as of late because of the lack of communication, the lack of conversation, the lack of the wherewithal to put eight heads together instead of one.

716
01:00:03,754 --> 01:00:05,634
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we're in the problem that we're in right now.

717
01:00:06,595 --> 01:00:10,657
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe it was you, Councilor Camuso, who said right from the beginning, you would have favored meters.

718
01:00:10,717 --> 01:00:18,140
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think if meters were in, people would have absolutely understood a meter, instead of this crazy, outlandish parking kiosk that you can't see at nighttime,

719
01:00:18,402 --> 01:00:20,942
[SPEAKER_12]: You've confused every single senior citizen in the community.

720
01:00:21,142 --> 01:00:27,724
[SPEAKER_12]: You've had people falling down in the snow, having to get an emergency ambulance to go to a hospital, and everything else that's been associated with it.

721
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:42,026
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're willing to do that, I am willing to forego all of my amendments there, stick to my resolution, Mr. Fenn, as it relates to terminating the contract, and then subsequent with Councilor Camusos, for the same reason, and move on the question.

722
01:00:42,586 --> 01:00:43,747
[SPEAKER_12]: And let the chips fall where they may.

723
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:46,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President?

724
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:48,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

725
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, as well, too, we have to send a loud, clear message to the mayor.

726
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:56,648
[SPEAKER_06]: He's done so many great things for this community.

727
01:00:57,188 --> 01:01:00,491
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing has not been done the way it could have been done.

728
01:01:01,512 --> 01:01:03,313
[SPEAKER_06]: But at this point, we have to move forward.

729
01:01:03,813 --> 01:01:05,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree with Councillor Penta.

730
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:13,380
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, we have to make the statement that we think that this was a complete and utter failure, done under different circumstances.

731
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it would have worked.

732
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:15,502
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously, it's not.

733
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:21,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear about this particular issue everywhere I go every single day.

734
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:27,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that this vote, it's not long overdue.

735
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,052
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's about 24 hours overdue.

736
01:01:30,472 --> 01:01:43,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as of yesterday, when the frosting on the cake was people going on a holiday and parking and getting citations, and it's time to just move forward.

737
01:01:44,565 --> 01:01:51,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, as I stated in the resolution, as a result of the breach of contract, remove the kiosks and have enforcement.

738
01:01:52,048 --> 01:02:02,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, as one member of this council, and I believe all the councillors chimed in at the Committee of the Whole meeting when we were there, there were several meetings with the budget director, Stephanie Burke, as well as the mayor, who instituted the program.

739
01:02:05,293 --> 01:02:08,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Loud and clear, we said we preferred meters.

740
01:02:09,034 --> 01:02:11,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Single head or double head meters, where people would just throw a quarter in,

741
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,320
[SPEAKER_06]: No one could say they didn't know how to work them, didn't know how to use them.

742
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:21,004
[SPEAKER_06]: People, you look at some of the old pitches in Medford Square, they had the meters way back in the day.

743
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, obviously, they didn't take our recommendations then.

744
01:02:26,207 --> 01:02:31,951
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to just go upon the past precedents and the past practices of what happened around here.

745
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:35,353
[SPEAKER_06]: We send recommendations, very few of them get acted upon.

746
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:37,734
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gonna be no different with this one.

747
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a vote as a council.

748
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you feel that you're at the point where this is out of control and it should be terminated, vote yes.

749
01:02:47,025 --> 01:02:48,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And otherwise, vote no.

750
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:53,450
[SPEAKER_06]: But to say that we're going to meet tomorrow night and we're going to get this all straightened out, it's not going to happen.

751
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We're four months into this.

752
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:56,512
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a carnival going on here.

753
01:02:56,552 --> 01:02:57,874
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to hear half of the stories.

754
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,235
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to drive here not knowing there's a carnival.

755
01:03:00,456 --> 01:03:02,657
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to keep going because they can't get a parking spot.

756
01:03:03,378 --> 01:03:07,441
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a lot of senior citizens that came to the last meetings from different parts of this community.

757
01:03:07,461 --> 01:03:09,222
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to be able to find a spot.

758
01:03:10,256 --> 01:03:13,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really believe I'm just one member.

759
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:19,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to make another amendment to take a vote on holding the meeting tomorrow as a result with a roll call.

760
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:23,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we get the mayor and the administrative team in here tomorrow, they're not coming back at a later date.

761
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:30,249
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not coming back at a later date if they decide that they are not going to agree with the council if we do vote to terminate this.

762
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:35,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank Councilor Penta because, as we said, we are in unison with this.

763
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:38,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me a while to get here, but the fact of the matter is

764
01:03:40,335 --> 01:03:41,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be straightened out.

765
01:03:41,536 --> 01:03:42,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be straightened out.

766
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,821
[SPEAKER_08]: The Press Thank you, Mr. President.

767
01:03:51,082 --> 01:04:00,527
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I'm concerned, a vote tonight to terminate the contract for breach of contract acts as a shot across the bow to this administration.

768
01:04:01,668 --> 01:04:03,349
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with the comments.

769
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:05,750
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to solve all the issues tonight.

770
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,993
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Mr. President, when the mayor was rolling out this plan,

771
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:16,199
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't look for any advice, input, suggestions from any member of this council.

772
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:34,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So what would lead anyone to believe that when we sit down with the administration tomorrow and say, you know what, we're not happy with this plan, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to take it in-house, that we're going to get any different of feedback than we already received four or five months back saying, we don't need your involvement.

773
01:04:34,627 --> 01:04:36,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what it was, Mr. President.

774
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:40,630
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the mayor stating to us that our input didn't matter.

775
01:04:41,112 --> 01:04:48,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what we're seeing now is that our input would have mattered because our input was talking about in-house.

776
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:53,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Our input was talking about potentially no pay for parking at all or meters.

777
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:59,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Our input was talking about having kiosks in parking lots, not on the streets.

778
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,387
[SPEAKER_08]: That was our input, Mr. President.

779
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:05,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And it all fell on deaf ears at the time.

780
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:08,892
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this vote is critical tonight.

781
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:10,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly,

782
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:23,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I was prepared to take this vote eight weeks ago, along with my colleague, Councilor Penta, because at the time, Mr. President, you know, one incident doesn't sway me one way or another.

783
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:36,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize tickets were issued on a holiday, but this is compounded over weeks after weeks after weeks of running a program that, in my opinion, was not well thought out.

784
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't one particular isolated incident that

785
01:05:39,462 --> 01:05:40,202
[SPEAKER_08]: triggered me off.

786
01:05:40,642 --> 01:05:46,865
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a systematic neglect of running an appropriate program that led us to where we are.

787
01:05:47,545 --> 01:05:53,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a shame, really, that the city of Meffitt has had to put so much time and effort.

788
01:05:54,548 --> 01:06:06,512
[SPEAKER_08]: And eventually, if we do get out of the contract, you know, and if it's not breach of contract, there's going to be a sizable amount of money that this community is going to have to pay Republic.

789
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:09,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's going to be a whole other issue, Mr. President.

790
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:29,047
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm willing, at this point, based on what I've seen out of this particular group, Republic, and based on the current plans that the administration set forth for this parking program, I'm willing to sit down and listen to what the alternatives are and listen to potentially what it may cost this community.

791
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:33,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, hey, no one wants to talk about it, but there may be a financial cost to get out of this contract.

792
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:35,630
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm willing to listen to it.

793
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:38,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm willing also to keep aspects of the program.

794
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there could be some give and take on this.

795
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:45,659
[SPEAKER_08]: There are certain things I won't give, but there are other things I will give.

796
01:06:46,560 --> 01:07:00,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think if we all get together, we can work on something that's amenable to the business community, residents alike, this council, the administration, and devise a program that will be suitable for our community.

797
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:03,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Somerville, not Cambridge, not Malden, but for the city of Medford,

798
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:10,150
[SPEAKER_08]: and how we want to see our community operated, and that is not aggressive enforcement, Mr. President.

799
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:15,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

800
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:28,925
[SPEAKER_15]: I've really tried to approach this issue with an open mind, Mr. President, because I truly believe we need residential and business district enforcement, as this was really a nonexistent aspect of our local government prior to the kiosk plan.

801
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:36,783
[SPEAKER_15]: However, at this point in time, the hardship is certainly outweighing the benefits of any type of parking management plan that's been put into place.

802
01:07:38,024 --> 01:07:44,630
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, Mr. President, you know, we have a five or six part resolution before us at this point in time.

803
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:46,771
[SPEAKER_15]: The language is contradictory.

804
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:50,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penter has made a suggestion to eliminate some of that language.

805
01:07:51,035 --> 01:07:53,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Councilor Camuso and Councilor Moxley are both 110% right.

806
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,945
[SPEAKER_15]: This meeting tomorrow night is not going to solve any problems.

807
01:07:57,985 --> 01:07:59,686
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to change or fix anything.

808
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:08,712
[SPEAKER_15]: But one thing it is going to do is it's going to give us a peace of mind and an understanding as to why these shortfalls are occurring, why this breach of contract is in place.

809
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:16,957
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, I think that, you know, we're all close as a body right now to scrap this project.

810
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:18,418
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm right there, Mr. President.

811
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:22,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I want an opportunity to hear from the Traffic Commission, because they haven't been before us yet.

812
01:08:22,661 --> 01:08:23,782
[SPEAKER_15]: They've sent the chief up here.

813
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:31,789
[SPEAKER_15]: as their sacrificial lamb over and over and over again to express to us what their public policy is and how they're implementing it and why they're implementing it.

814
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:39,472
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I think that we're going to have a very productive session tomorrow night, regardless of the traffic and parking problems that we're going to have outside.

815
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:43,874
[SPEAKER_15]: And regardless of the fact that we haven't been provided with the information that we've asked for.

816
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:48,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason I feel that way is because everybody behind this rail is very passionate about this issue.

817
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:51,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think everybody behind this rail wants to come up with a solution to the problem.

818
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:53,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, we're all here.

819
01:08:53,544 --> 01:08:54,485
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all here to help people.

820
01:08:54,525 --> 01:08:56,487
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all here to protect the integrities of the neighborhoods.

821
01:08:56,547 --> 01:09:00,492
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all here to ensure that everybody has a strong quality of life, Mr. President.

822
01:09:00,882 --> 01:09:03,745
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now, based on the current plan, we certainly do not have that.

823
01:09:03,926 --> 01:09:06,128
[SPEAKER_15]: We certainly do not have that based on the current plan.

824
01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:18,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the hardships that the business district is feeling and the hardships that the residents in the community are feeling are not outweighing the benefits, are outweighing, are not outweighing the benefits that we're seeing here in the pay-to-park program or the parking management program.

825
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:23,912
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, Mr. President, you know, I think that we're all right there.

826
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,693
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all right on the cusp of all being on the same page.

827
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:37,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I need one more meeting and I have some questions about language, but I think that Councilor Lungo was right on the ball when she said, okay, so we vote to get rid of this and we vote to return it in-house, but what's our plan going to look like?

828
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:37,958
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it look like?

829
01:09:38,078 --> 01:09:39,319
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we want?

830
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:40,299
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we expect?

831
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,021
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've said it time and time again, and we've sent resolutions forward time and time again.

832
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:48,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's time we sit down and we put together a comprehensive plan upon a review.

833
01:09:48,663 --> 01:10:00,867
[SPEAKER_15]: of the contract that's in place as well as what we see in terms of our constituents calling us and expressing concern and what we see based upon the meetings that we have had here, what it is this council can live with and put a plan forward.

834
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly don't think anybody wants to see these kiosks around the city anymore.

835
01:10:05,009 --> 01:10:06,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly think they're too far apart.

836
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:08,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly think the signage is a nightmare.

837
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:09,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly think that

838
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:20,318
[SPEAKER_15]: This council has done a good job of confusing people as well as to what's going on because we discussed it so much because we have so many questions because, in fact, the plan was rolled out inappropriately and improperly, Mr. President.

839
01:10:20,638 --> 01:10:27,760
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, at this point in time, I'm not comfortable with the language of the resolution or the message that the resolution sends.

840
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,601
[SPEAKER_15]: We've tabled it once or twice before.

841
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:31,501
[SPEAKER_15]: We've asked for the Traffic Commission to come before us.

842
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:34,282
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the first opportunity that they've had.

843
01:10:34,682 --> 01:10:36,623
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm right there, Mr. President, and if my

844
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,208
[SPEAKER_15]: The responses to my questions aren't satisfactory.

845
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:42,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Tomorrow evening, I will join in and I will happily vote to remove these kiosks.

846
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:46,432
[SPEAKER_15]: But at this point in time, I think, at the very least, we should hear what they have to say.

847
01:10:47,473 --> 01:10:48,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

848
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:50,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Carvillo, and then we'll take our vote.

849
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:51,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

850
01:10:51,235 --> 01:10:56,998
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think what we're going to find out once we start this meeting is, you know, we've sat here and we beat up on Republic a lot.

851
01:10:57,998 --> 01:11:03,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Republic had made a lot of suggestions for the parking plan that were not taken.

852
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:06,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, our Chamber of Commerce had meetings with them.

853
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:10,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And the plan that was rolled out was not the plan.

854
01:11:12,556 --> 01:11:15,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the plan wasn't the plan that was offered by Republic.

855
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:19,877
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the major things Republic offered was not to roll this plan out in the middle of the winter.

856
01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:28,859
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys who do this as a business gave the city suggestions that weren't taken.

857
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:35,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you'll see that coming out once these guys come up here and they explain that to you.

858
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:44,733
[SPEAKER_09]: But then they say, maybe this plan might have worked if their suggestions were taken right down the line, because they do this for a business.

859
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:50,137
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's say, their plan wasn't implemented.

860
01:11:57,203 --> 01:11:57,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

861
01:11:57,744 --> 01:12:00,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta, so you withdrew for clarity.

862
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:01,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You withdrew.

863
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm leaving my original motion on the indeterminate

864
01:12:05,842 --> 01:12:09,083
[SPEAKER_12]: in concert with Councilor Camuso's joint resolution with me.

865
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:18,265
[SPEAKER_12]: For the breach of the contract and to, what's my resolution, Mr. Clark?

866
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:20,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

867
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:23,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

868
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the combined resolution.

869
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:31,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Potential failure of the mayor, that part of the resolution?

870
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,910
[SPEAKER_12]: We're the one that asked to eliminate,

871
01:12:35,468 --> 01:12:38,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, that's the... No, it's right there.

872
01:12:40,391 --> 01:12:40,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

873
01:12:41,711 --> 01:12:43,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all withdrawn.

874
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:46,914
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would, Mr. Clerk, show us the one that... Where's the two?

875
01:12:47,054 --> 01:12:48,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

876
01:12:48,735 --> 01:12:58,821
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the most important amendment to that resolution was Councilor Longo's, which would authorize the evacuation, I guess, for lack of a better term, of all the tickets that were issued yesterday.

877
01:12:58,841 --> 01:12:59,881
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would have to be included.

878
01:13:00,602 --> 01:13:01,362
[SPEAKER_15]: On Monday, rather, yes.

879
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:02,343
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would have to be included.

880
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,040
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

881
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:11,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's positively start from the beginning.

882
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:18,322
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's go back to the tabled paper with all the amendments.

883
01:13:18,342 --> 01:13:18,362
[SPEAKER_12]: 15-307.

884
01:13:18,402 --> 01:13:27,364
[SPEAKER_12]: On the tabled paper, take my resolution to terminate the contract, and then take Councilor Camuso and Councilor Penta's resolution for the breach of the contract.

885
01:13:27,464 --> 01:13:30,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can't withdraw other people's amendments, Councilor Penta.

886
01:13:30,885 --> 01:13:33,305
[SPEAKER_12]: I made that as an offering if everybody's satisfied.

887
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll withdraw mine, Mr. President.

888
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:45,964
[SPEAKER_13]: You can take that paper that's tabled and receive and place on file, and then that whole thing goes away, and then you start this as your resolution.

889
01:13:46,545 --> 01:13:47,285
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the resolution?

890
01:13:47,806 --> 01:13:50,568
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the resolution that you have there of mine that was tabled?

891
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:54,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Camuso, point of information.

892
01:13:56,614 --> 01:14:01,538
[SPEAKER_06]: The original paper that was brought forward, 15-307, by Councilor Penta that was on the table,

893
01:14:02,202 --> 01:14:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: If we withdraw that whole paper and approve the new one with the language that you just added to, in breach of contract, because I like that language, add Councillor Lungo Kearns to that, I think we all get what we're looking to do here.

894
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, and here's the other piece too.

895
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:22,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, leave the kiosk only?

896
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It's clear in the resolution I submitted.

897
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:27,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Remove, and Councilor Penta, remove the kiosks.

898
01:14:28,183 --> 01:14:29,704
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have in-house enforcement tomorrow.

899
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:31,525
[SPEAKER_06]: People do not like the kiosk approach.

900
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:32,446
[SPEAKER_06]: They hate it.

901
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,588
[SPEAKER_06]: They absolutely hate being able to go to the kiosk and do it.

902
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:36,628
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know how to do it.

903
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:44,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty computer savvy and it was a hard time the other day when you use your credit card and you're trying to add time to it.

904
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:47,374
[SPEAKER_06]: How much time do you want to do max, this, that?

905
01:14:47,534 --> 01:14:50,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's overwhelming to people, these kiosks, the user side of things.

906
01:14:50,877 --> 01:14:52,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso, for your point.

907
01:14:52,938 --> 01:14:54,539
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you take the paper.

908
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,580
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my recommendation.

909
01:14:56,061 --> 01:14:58,503
[SPEAKER_13]: As it existed, not what was entered tonight.

910
01:14:58,743 --> 01:14:59,383
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same thing, Bob.

911
01:14:59,403 --> 01:15:01,765
[SPEAKER_13]: And you just receive and place that on the front.

912
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:03,026
[SPEAKER_13]: That whole thing goes away now.

913
01:15:04,888 --> 01:15:08,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And now you just enter this as just a new resolution in light of it.

914
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:12,474
[SPEAKER_12]: That can be the substitute language for that resolution.

915
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,075
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion of Councilor Penta,

916
01:15:14,758 --> 01:15:18,059
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to use the same number.

917
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:19,019
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to get rid of it.

918
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:21,239
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to reintroduce this paper.

919
01:15:21,259 --> 01:15:23,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Receive yours in place on file and move for the new one.

920
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

921
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it 15370 on the table?

922
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:29,541
[SPEAKER_15]: We took that paper off the table.

923
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:31,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we just strike the language from that paper?

924
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,442
[SPEAKER_15]: We have 15370 as the number for the paper.

925
01:15:34,462 --> 01:15:34,783
[SPEAKER_04]: 307 rather.

926
01:15:34,803 --> 01:15:39,084
[SPEAKER_15]: We strike the language from that paper in its entirety and replace it with the language that we've discussed right now.

927
01:15:39,144 --> 01:15:41,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Now what I've come up with is be it resolved.

928
01:15:41,653 --> 01:15:48,036
[SPEAKER_15]: The kiosk be removed due to contractual breaches, parking enforcement be handled in-house, and all tickets issued on 4-2015 be vacated.

929
01:15:50,037 --> 01:15:50,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what you have.

930
01:15:51,397 --> 01:15:53,038
[SPEAKER_12]: He already has them.

931
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:53,898
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the resolution.

932
01:15:53,918 --> 01:15:54,679
[SPEAKER_13]: The crux of it.

933
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,880
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the resolution.

934
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,121
[SPEAKER_13]: You could just start it over again, like I said, and just add the other two things and you'd be done.

935
01:16:01,982 --> 01:16:02,402
In light?

936
01:16:02,482 --> 01:16:08,685
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

937
01:16:09,777 --> 01:16:38,680
[SPEAKER_13]: If you start, if this was a resolution, you'd probably be whereas, because you started with this thing yet in the light of, you know, whereas in the light of light of the actions in the breach of contract breach and breach of contract obligations of the Republic Parking's recent job performance and the failure of the city administration to hold them accountable, be it resolved that the mayor and his administration removed the paid to park kiosk forthwith.

938
01:16:41,137 --> 01:16:44,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you have the termination.

939
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,301
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to advise the mayor on terminating the contract.

940
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:50,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Longo should have the amendment.

941
01:16:51,322 --> 01:16:51,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And.

942
01:16:51,442 --> 01:16:57,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, may I be so bold to suggest that

943
01:17:08,546 --> 01:17:14,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the individual sit down and write something up and we can move on to another item and then come back if in fact we can have some language.

944
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Recess for five minutes to recraft.

945
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:20,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we can move on to the next item on the agenda.

946
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:30,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to recess for five minutes.

947

960
01:21:44,952 --> 01:21:46,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, where's the word terminate at?

961
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:47,473

01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:18,411
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the key.

970
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:24,194
[SPEAKER_12]: That was going to be a key paper or a separate motion.

971
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:26,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you want it to be part of this?

[SPEAKER_13]: President Dela Russo.

990
01:23:26,599 --> 01:23:30,080
[SPEAKER_13]: He was the first one that said it.

991
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Caravaglia, did you call Caravaglia?

992
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:33,621

1001
01:24:29,216 --> 01:24:30,777

01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:35,539

1014
01:24:57,046 --> 01:24:57,786

1015
01:24:58,227 --> 01:24:58,947
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1016
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the regular order of business.

1017
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: 15-390 offered by Councilor Knight.

1018
01:25:04,114 --> 01:25:19,345
[SPEAKER_04]: be resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Roy Belson, Superintendent of Medford Public Schools, on his recent appointment to the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Financial Literacy Trust Fund, Counselor Knight.

1019
01:25:20,126 --> 01:25:21,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1020
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:28,192
[SPEAKER_15]: The Financial Literacy Trust Fund is a trust fund that is governed by the State Treasurer's Office.

1021
01:25:28,933 --> 01:25:40,175
[SPEAKER_15]: And the purpose of this trust fund is to support public and private institutions that have displayed success in advancing financial education and empowerment to certain underprivileged communities.

1022
01:25:40,676 --> 01:25:47,677
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Belson is the sole public sector educator that's been appointed to the board, Mr. President.

1023
01:25:47,697 --> 01:25:51,798
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's a testament to his wherewithal, his experience, his knowledge, and his standing

1024
01:25:52,298 --> 01:25:53,459
[SPEAKER_15]: in the educational community.

1025
01:25:53,939 --> 01:26:06,106
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I saw this on the Internet, I wasn't too familiar with the Massachusetts Financial Literacy Trust Fund, so I did a little poking around, and it's quite a big deal.

1026
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:15,691
[SPEAKER_15]: The treasurer of the commonwealth has the power to appoint, and she used her divine wisdom to select our superintendent of schools because he does such a great job, Mr. President.

1027
01:26:16,152 --> 01:26:21,835
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's very important to highlight when people in our community do good things, because that builds social capital and it builds community.

1028
01:26:22,298 --> 01:26:27,259
[SPEAKER_15]: and make sure that the next generation of kids from Medford have that blue and white running through their veins.

1029
01:26:27,339 --> 01:26:30,440
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd ask my council colleagues, Mr. President, to support this resolution.

1030
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,201
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso.

1031
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:41,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations offered by Councilor Camuso, and seconded by Councilor Camuso.

1032
01:26:41,562 --> 01:26:42,322
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1033
01:26:42,983 --> 01:26:43,683
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1034
01:26:43,983 --> 01:26:44,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1035
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:50,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters, 15-389.

1036
01:26:50,586 --> 01:26:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Petition by Mr. Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street, Metron, Mass., to discuss online council meetings.

1037
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Lieberman, please state your name and address for the record.

1038
01:27:01,532 --> 01:27:02,833
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

1039
01:27:02,853 --> 01:27:04,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 15 Canal Street.

1040
01:27:05,294 --> 01:27:14,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been six months since I've been here, and I want to congratulate Councilor De La Rosa and Councilor Loyola for presidency and vice presidency.

1041
01:27:16,258 --> 01:27:19,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I was here, I spoke, I wanted two things.

1042
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,323
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I wanted the price of archive meetings to be decreased.

1043
01:27:23,623 --> 01:27:25,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is I wanted the meetings to be online.

1044
01:27:26,345 --> 01:27:29,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So I passed out some of the work that I've been doing.

1045
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:38,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, I spoke with Ed, who suggested I speak with Allison, Allison, the webpage person.

1046
01:27:38,374 --> 01:27:41,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Allison suggested that I speak with the mayor.

1047
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met with the mayor in November.

1048
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:45,759
[SPEAKER_01]: and he said he would talk to Alison, and he didn't.

1049
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:49,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw him again in February, and I asked, have you spoken with Alison?

1050
01:27:50,082 --> 01:27:57,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked Mary to write down a note to remind him to talk to her, which at that point, I basically figured nothing's going to happen.

1051
01:27:57,928 --> 01:28:00,330
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just been uploading the videos on my own.

1052
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:02,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put up about 20 of them.

1053
01:28:03,532 --> 01:28:04,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at this point,

1054
01:28:06,225 --> 01:28:07,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent another email to Allison today.

1055
01:28:07,905 --> 01:28:12,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to force anybody's hand, but I would like to kind of formalize this.

1056
01:28:12,348 --> 01:28:14,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made it really easy at this point.

1057
01:28:14,869 --> 01:28:25,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping the city can perhaps suggest to the mayor to just ask Allison to just put on links of all the videos that I've uploaded onto the city website.

1058
01:28:25,615 --> 01:28:27,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's very, very little work.

1059
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:45,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I think, I just wanted to give an update that, yeah, I think Councilors Marks and Councilor Knight, you both sent my thing to the Rules Subcommittee, and I really appreciate the work that happened in March when the price of the archive meetings went from $20 down to $5.

1060
01:28:45,877 --> 01:28:51,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I really thank you very much for that.

1061
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:52,159
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.

1062
01:28:52,179 --> 01:28:53,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. Lieberman.

1063
01:28:57,853 --> 01:28:58,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Marks, yes.

1064
01:28:58,654 --> 01:29:06,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Just if I could, Matt, can you tell us what type of data you want entered into the city website?

1065
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I put the videos online.

1066
01:29:09,382 --> 01:29:14,306
[SPEAKER_01]: All that Allison really has to do is, I mean, she uploads the agendas and everything like that.

1067
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:16,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And she has all these different pages.

1068
01:29:16,427 --> 01:29:17,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a page for the city council.

1069
01:29:17,929 --> 01:29:19,570
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pages for all the different commissions.

1070
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:23,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So she could just have like a page for meetings and just put on a link.

1071
01:29:23,713 --> 01:29:24,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can send her the link.

1072
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:31,671
[SPEAKER_01]: or I can send her the embed code, and she really just has to put it on a web page, and then everybody can watch it online.

1073
01:29:32,091 --> 01:29:38,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as it is right now, you know, there have been some problems with Comcast when they rebroadcast the messages.

1074
01:29:39,192 --> 01:29:40,073
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very distorted.

1075
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,153
[SPEAKER_01]: There have also been some scheduling problems.

1076
01:29:42,513 --> 01:29:46,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, this just makes it a lot easier for everybody to access them at any time.

1077
01:29:46,254 --> 01:29:53,475
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I figure I've done, you know, some of the work, and I figure, you know, as a citizen, I mean, we should do a little bit, and then perhaps the government can meet us halfway.

1078
01:29:54,225 --> 01:30:07,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one thing, one thing is that, um, I know that there's a concern about the official city stuff that it, uh, online that we don't, we don't have like, it's very, it doesn't become unprofessional where a lot of online trolls are bickering.

1079
01:30:08,393 --> 01:30:11,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that I uploaded the videos is they're all unlisted.

1080
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:13,136
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people won't kind of stumble upon them.

1081
01:30:13,196 --> 01:30:14,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just pass a link.

1082
01:30:14,357 --> 01:30:18,759
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is I've, I've cut off all commenting, so it can't really turn into any kind of bickering.

1083
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:20,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So really all I want is just,

1084
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping the city can just kind of pass a recommendation for whatever it's worth.

1085
01:30:24,141 --> 01:30:29,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ask a mayor, just say, or just, you know, and I'm not trying to push Allison's hand.

1086
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:32,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, you know, it would be nice if we just said, you know, it's really not that much work.

1087
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:36,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Just accept the links from Matt and just put them on the city website.

1088
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:37,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about it.

1089
01:30:38,323 --> 01:30:38,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1090
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:40,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Penter.

1091
01:30:40,764 --> 01:30:41,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I hear you correctly?

1092
01:30:41,944 --> 01:30:48,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you said that you would want to edit what goes onto the city website rather than getting the actual true content?

1093
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:51,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't edit anything.

1094
01:30:51,401 --> 01:30:52,522
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you say?

1095
01:30:52,762 --> 01:30:53,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I misunderstood.

1096
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:59,384
[SPEAKER_01]: What I said is that I deactivated comments so that it doesn't break into people bickering.

1097
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:04,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I also said that they're unlisted so people don't stumble upon it.

1098
01:31:05,425 --> 01:31:17,769
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I try to get them done the night that they are live, but depending on how long the meeting lasts, it can take me a little bit longer to have these deep links where you see on the second page I put in

1099
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:24,202
[SPEAKER_01]: a calendar so people can click, and it'll go directly to that particular resolution being discussed.

1100
01:31:25,383 --> 01:31:25,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

1101
01:31:25,763 --> 01:31:26,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Carviollo.

1102
01:31:26,864 --> 01:31:27,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1103
01:31:27,825 --> 01:31:36,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I did ask Alison Goldsberry about putting the city council meetings on the website, and she explained to me that the website is not large enough.

1104
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:38,192
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have the capability of putting it.

1105
01:31:38,212 --> 01:31:42,955
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the other side, I've been on other cities' websites, and they have six months' worth of meetings on there.

1106
01:31:43,636 --> 01:31:47,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know what it takes to get a bigger website

1107
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,311
[SPEAKER_09]: or do whatever it is.

1108
01:31:48,331 --> 01:31:53,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, I'm not a computed person, but many, many other cities have it.

1109
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:59,843
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't think it's that big of a deal to upgrade the site so you can put on even a month's worth of meetings on the site.

1110
01:32:00,624 --> 01:32:04,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Alison had told me that we needed a new TV station before it could happen.

1111
01:32:05,047 --> 01:32:07,628
[SPEAKER_01]: which also I think is not correct.

1112
01:32:07,928 --> 01:32:12,649
[SPEAKER_01]: When she says that the website isn't large enough, she's talking about space to store everything.

1113
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:14,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've done is I've just uploaded them.

1114
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:15,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all stored free.

1115
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:21,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I said to her, I'm not saying you store the whole year, but if you at least have the last four meetings,

1116
01:32:21,996 --> 01:32:22,656
[SPEAKER_09]: at a time.

1117
01:32:22,696 --> 01:32:24,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if people want to get them, they can get them after.

1118
01:32:24,357 --> 01:32:29,280
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I say, I've been on other cities' websites, and they've got up to six months worth of meetings on them.

1119
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,180
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I put up.

1120
01:32:30,241 --> 01:32:31,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I put up the last six months.

1121
01:32:31,561 --> 01:32:33,222
[SPEAKER_01]: The only ones that are missing are two from February.

1122
01:32:33,242 --> 01:32:37,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know what it takes to upgrade the website, to put that on.

1123
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you know better than I do.

1124
01:32:39,766 --> 01:32:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly don't know.

1125
01:32:41,387 --> 01:32:44,208
[SPEAKER_01]: All she really needs to do is copy and paste a link.

1126
01:32:44,228 --> 01:32:51,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, on floor nine.

1127
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1128
01:32:53,181 --> 01:32:54,683
[SPEAKER_15]: And Matthew, thank you for your work.

1129
01:32:54,763 --> 01:32:56,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I've spoken with Matt a little bit about this in the past.

1130
01:32:57,365 --> 01:33:07,854
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things that this council spoke about was not only the rebroadcasting of these council meetings, but also live streaming of the meetings as they're going on.

1131
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:10,897
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think that that's too much to ask as well, Mr. President.

1132
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:17,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd certainly be supportive of a resolution going forward requesting that provided the IT department can

1133
01:33:18,102 --> 01:33:29,408
[SPEAKER_14]: go through and make sure that there are no viruses and no materials that'll corrupt our system, that this be, you know, maybe referred to Mike Ferretti for a review to see if that's something that we can do possibly.

1134
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:31,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Please.

1135
01:33:34,571 --> 01:33:34,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1136
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:46,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just have a little problem with this where, and this is no disrespect to you, Matt, where Matt is uploading these and it's not an official city employee that's actually doing it.

1137
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:51,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason I say that, I've been very consistent with this.

1138
01:33:51,864 --> 01:34:10,294
[SPEAKER_06]: When other people wanted to put stuff on the webpage or on something, I think it has to be, should be done by a city official in some sort of a capacity that could be held accountable if indeed they went a little haywire and put something on there or the wrong link was, you know what I'm trying to say?

1139
01:34:11,595 --> 01:34:13,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly I don't think you'd ever do anything malicious.

1140
01:34:14,397 --> 01:34:16,478
[SPEAKER_06]: But with that being said,

1141
01:34:17,213 --> 01:34:19,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's more of a city function.

1142
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:28,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like you got this all into a compact area where at least it's all the data and the videos are collected.

1143
01:34:29,796 --> 01:34:38,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is something that really the city IT department, not Mike Ferretti, but the website management, Alison Goldsberry and whoever else runs it.

1144
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:42,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I know at one time the city webpage was done by Councillor Burke.

1145
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,681
[SPEAKER_06]: She did a great job with it, getting it to this new platform.

1146
01:34:45,161 --> 01:34:45,801
[SPEAKER_06]: But at this point,

1147
01:34:47,422 --> 01:35:04,408
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, I think what we need to see is this done by a city employee that, like I said, in no disrespect to yourself, and this is something the council called for of a Ponya recommendation, actually, but I definitely think this should be done by a city official and not an outside entity.

1148
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:16,692
[SPEAKER_06]: If the city wanted to enter into a contract with the gentleman to do it, maybe for a small stipend or something, but where he's held accountable and it has to be done on time and everything else, I could see something like that, but that certainly

1149
01:35:17,465 --> 01:35:26,187
[SPEAKER_06]: up to the mayor's office, but I just, the next precedent would be what if someone else wants to upload something and they're not as credible as you.

1150
01:35:26,827 --> 01:35:27,348
[SPEAKER_06]: You follow me?

1151
01:35:28,048 --> 01:35:30,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly do, but I mean, this is a situation.

1152
01:35:30,268 --> 01:35:32,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when the mayor's office doesn't respond.

1153
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:36,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're the ones that are going to have to respond to put the links on the webpage, so.

1154
01:35:36,615 --> 01:35:40,016
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not responding about... I've made the job really easy.

1155
01:35:40,076 --> 01:35:44,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a debate last week about, you know, how to handle outstanding resolutions.

1156
01:35:44,537 --> 01:35:50,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ideally, I mean, I remember, if I remember correctly, Councillor March, you were saying that it's basically letting the mayor off the hook.

1157
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:56,220
[SPEAKER_01]: My opinion is, like, we kind of, we live in the world as it is, not in the world that we'd like it to be.

1158
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

1159
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:05,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, ideally, certainly the mayor's office would do it, and Alison, she wouldn't tell me information that was incorrect.

1160
01:36:06,056 --> 01:36:11,560
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but until, and, you know, I wouldn't, like I said six months ago, you know, I'll work for like a dollar a year, whatever.

1161
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I also said I would volunteer.

1162
01:36:15,162 --> 01:36:17,143
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mike has been really helpful.

1163
01:36:18,024 --> 01:36:23,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to him and I talked to Ed as well to make sure that there aren't any conflicts about me uploading the videos.

1164
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:28,171
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like if some of them I don't have, Mike lent me three and I uploaded them.

1165
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:31,170
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so I just, yeah, I mean, I'll sign anything.

1166
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:43,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, yeah, I'm not, I mean, I have my, I'm not really interested in editing these videos to make anybody look bad or put any kind of message, you know, but I wouldn't mind, you know, I wouldn't mind signing anything.

1167
01:36:43,076 --> 01:36:49,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just my understanding is there's just so many hoops to jump through before the mayor will say, okay, you can do this.

1168
01:36:54,402 --> 01:36:55,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1169
01:36:55,622 --> 01:36:58,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, if I'm not mistaken, prior to, uh,

1170
01:36:59,347 --> 01:37:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Channel 3 going off air, they would also have on their website the last several months of the council meetings.

1171
01:37:07,332 --> 01:37:12,956
[SPEAKER_08]: And they started that towards the end of when Channel 3 went under.

1172
01:37:13,396 --> 01:37:14,637
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was very helpful.

1173
01:37:14,717 --> 01:37:17,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Residents can go on and view any meeting and so forth.

1174
01:37:18,659 --> 01:37:26,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the issue, Mr. President, naturally we're not going to give anyone, Matt or anyone else, access to the city website.

1175
01:37:26,364 --> 01:37:28,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even have access to the city website.

1176
01:37:28,389 --> 01:37:31,932
[SPEAKER_08]: That's by the web master and whoever has that dedication.

1177
01:37:32,613 --> 01:37:34,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and that's the way it should be.

1178
01:37:35,396 --> 01:37:38,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but what I think Matt is saying, he wants to volunteer.

1179
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:41,001
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to get active in the community.

1180
01:37:41,261 --> 01:37:43,183
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to do something in the community.

1181
01:37:43,863 --> 01:37:48,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, he's finding a hundred obstacles in order to do something.

1182
01:37:49,068 --> 01:37:53,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, the, the, the one thing that I have to say about this administration is

1183
01:37:53,462 --> 01:37:59,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor has failed over the years to tap the number one resource we have, which is our residents.

1184
01:38:00,704 --> 01:38:10,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a big failure because we have a lot of people out there with a lot of different job experiences that could help in this community.

1185
01:38:11,128 --> 01:38:15,229
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, one thing that comes to mind, just even the restroom here at City Hall.

1186
01:38:15,909 --> 01:38:17,730
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how many plumbers live in this community?

1187
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: that if you approached him and said, hey, would you like to do something for the community?

1188
01:38:21,607 --> 01:38:23,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to donate your labor?

1189
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:24,527
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll buy the pots.

1190
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:28,408
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be surprised how many people would come out of the woodwork to say, you know what?

1191
01:38:28,628 --> 01:38:30,169
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd like to give back to the community.

1192
01:38:30,589 --> 01:38:33,349
[SPEAKER_08]: But you'd never hear of a volunteer program.

1193
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:36,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And what Matt is trying to say is he'd like to do something.

1194
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:41,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether he's the one that puts those on directly or so forth, that's all semantics.

1195
01:38:41,971 --> 01:38:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to give you the time and effort.

1196
01:38:43,952 --> 01:38:46,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a community, we should be welcoming that.

1197
01:38:46,448 --> 01:38:50,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And our administrators should be reaching out to them and saying, Matt, this is what we'd like you to do.

1198
01:38:50,929 --> 01:38:54,990
[SPEAKER_08]: But instead, every door is a closed door, which is unfortunate.

1199
01:38:55,030 --> 01:39:00,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But I honestly think that this needs to move forward.

1200
01:39:01,432 --> 01:39:09,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think any avenue of transparency, and one is providing another avenue for our council meetings, is a great avenue.

1201
01:39:09,874 --> 01:39:11,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we can go wrong in doing that.

1202
01:39:11,635 --> 01:39:15,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we should take a vote here tonight, asking the administration to look into

1203
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:25,929
[SPEAKER_08]: the volunteer services that Mr. Lieberman wants to offer, and have them devise a program that safeguards the city website.

1204
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:27,830
[SPEAKER_08]: No one wants to jeopardize the city website.

1205
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:31,073
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's looking to put videos that make someone else look bad on there.

1206
01:39:31,093 --> 01:39:32,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want to see that.

1207
01:39:32,335 --> 01:39:34,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure no one else behind this railing.

1208
01:39:34,397 --> 01:39:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a way to do it that I think makes sense and also involves people that want to get active in the community.

1209
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:46,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we start here, this is just the first step in the process.

1210
01:39:46,932 --> 01:39:52,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we can open it up to volunteerism throughout the city, which currently we lack right now, Mr. President.

1211
01:39:53,335 --> 01:39:54,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1212
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:54,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1213
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:58,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think you can put it much better than that, Mr. President.

1214
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:01,778
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a gentleman who is willing, able, and ready to volunteer his time.

1215
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:03,359
[SPEAKER_15]: He has a plan.

1216
01:40:03,559 --> 01:40:05,440
[SPEAKER_15]: He has a template in place that we could adopt.

1217
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:14,602
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would make sense for our IT department and our webmaster to take a look at it to see if they can come up with any glitches or any problems that they see might corrupt our system and then move on it.

1218
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:34,447
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to- Motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks, that the city administration, the mayor's office coordinate to engage the volunteerism for the purpose of transparency in

1219
01:40:35,343 --> 01:40:51,236
[SPEAKER_04]: adding the city council meetings to the city website into conjunction or with the assistance of Mr. Ferretti and, uh, uh, the city webmaster to, um, uh, be in consultation with that.

1220
01:40:53,037 --> 01:40:55,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, yes.

1221
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:55,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1222
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:57,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Labor.

1223
01:40:57,481 --> 01:40:59,322
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the council is one open meeting.

1224
01:40:59,742 --> 01:41:01,984
[SPEAKER_08]: There are other meetings that are held at city hall here.

1225
01:41:02,004 --> 01:41:03,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, that would be great.

1226
01:41:04,146 --> 01:41:04,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

1227
01:41:04,668 --> 01:41:08,109
[SPEAKER_08]: information for residents of this community, Office of Community Development.

1228
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:10,070
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have the Board of Appeals meetings.

1229
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:13,612
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have the Board of Health meetings, the Park Board meetings.

1230
01:41:13,892 --> 01:41:15,632
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot that goes on in this city.

1231
01:41:15,712 --> 01:41:16,733
[SPEAKER_04]: The Parking Commission meetings.

1232
01:41:16,753 --> 01:41:17,673
[SPEAKER_08]: The Park League Commission.

1233
01:41:17,913 --> 01:41:21,535
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot that goes on in this city that I think would be a tremendous asset.

1234
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:25,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Councilor Camuso has offered this before, that these meetings be televised.

1235
01:41:25,636 --> 01:41:32,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wouldn't just limit it, and I don't think that's what we're trying to do, but I would say that this would be open to any board, commission,

1236
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:38,733
[SPEAKER_08]: that would like to have meetings taped, that they can have access to this as well, Mr. President.

1237
01:41:38,973 --> 01:41:40,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So admitted by Councilor Mox.

1238
01:41:41,094 --> 01:41:41,854
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1239
01:41:41,874 --> 01:41:43,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need the Councilor?

1240
01:41:43,475 --> 01:42:02,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Moreover, Mr. President, I think that Councilor Mox makes a great point, and maybe for these boards and commissions that meet during normal business hours, that the broadcast or rebroadcast could become a requirement in the near future, because I know it's very hard for me to get to 2 o'clock meetings here at City Hall when I'm engaged in my day-to-day workplace activities.

1241
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:03,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1242
01:42:04,222 --> 01:42:04,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1243
01:42:05,843 --> 01:42:06,483
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1244
01:42:06,803 --> 01:42:07,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1245
01:42:07,863 --> 01:42:08,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Lieberman.

1246
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:09,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

1247
01:42:09,743 --> 01:42:11,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot add anything?

1248
01:42:12,004 --> 01:42:12,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?

1249
01:42:12,764 --> 01:42:13,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

1250
01:42:13,124 --> 01:42:14,084
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to say something.

1251
01:42:14,104 --> 01:42:15,084
[SPEAKER_01]: He just wants to say something.

1252
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:16,505
[SPEAKER_01]: With the suspension of the rules, then?

1253
01:42:17,705 --> 01:42:22,886
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the volunteering, that's what I met with the mayor in November about.

1254
01:42:22,926 --> 01:42:28,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to kind of get a feel from him about how he felt about perhaps a time bank, you know, where people volunteer.

1255
01:42:29,884 --> 01:42:30,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm disabled.

1256
01:42:30,824 --> 01:42:31,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work in IT.

1257
01:42:31,805 --> 01:42:37,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I don't want to keep going out to Cambridge and Somerville when my city is right here.

1258
01:42:37,187 --> 01:42:38,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you completely.

1259
01:42:38,907 --> 01:42:40,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I talked to him about.

1260
01:42:40,528 --> 01:42:43,129
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we kind of tap on all these people who really want to work?

1261
01:42:43,369 --> 01:42:44,789
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people who leave the city.

1262
01:42:45,349 --> 01:42:45,889
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to do.

1263
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:48,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, this is just kind of a general thing.

1264
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:51,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't only seen it from the mayor's office, but a lot of people in City Hall.

1265
01:42:52,172 --> 01:42:57,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I offered to volunteer, and they just seem almost to feel uncomfortable, like it means more work for them.

1266
01:42:58,354 --> 01:42:59,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whatever that means.

1267
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:01,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I thank you very much for what you've voiced.

1268
01:43:01,912 --> 01:43:16,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, maybe under the next administration, there will be an office of volunteerism, and we'll be able to tap our residents and our resources that currently exist and really bring some community pride back to this community, Mr. President.

1269
01:43:16,502 --> 01:43:16,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1270
01:43:18,684 --> 01:43:22,086
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Penta to take papers in the hand of the clerk, all those in favor?

1271
01:43:22,927 --> 01:43:23,608
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1272
01:43:25,509 --> 01:43:26,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Penta.

1273
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:29,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the

1274
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:38,283
[SPEAKER_04]: One op, the cable ascertainment hearing be discussed.

1275
01:43:38,664 --> 01:43:40,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that one op?

1276
01:43:40,645 --> 01:43:43,646
[SPEAKER_16]: What does that word?

1277
01:43:45,067 --> 01:43:47,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the, I apologize.

1278
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:50,931
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue of the cable ascertainment hearing be discussed.

1279
01:43:51,331 --> 01:43:52,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Penta.

1280
01:43:53,732 --> 01:43:54,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank counsel a night.

1281
01:43:54,973 --> 01:43:57,114
[SPEAKER_12]: You just lead me into my conversation.

1282
01:43:57,575 --> 01:44:01,437
[SPEAKER_12]: This ascertainment hearing that is scheduled for next Wednesday at two o'clock in the afternoon.

1283
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:03,472
[SPEAKER_12]: makes absolutely no sense at all.

1284
01:44:04,173 --> 01:44:09,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one, the contract that the city of Medford has with Comcast Cable has already now been terminated.

1285
01:44:10,237 --> 01:44:12,098
[SPEAKER_12]: It ended on April 20th.

1286
01:44:12,758 --> 01:44:14,660
[SPEAKER_12]: April 20th has now come and gone.

1287
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:28,609
[SPEAKER_12]: An ascertainment hearing, if anybody follows it, is for the purposes of gating information that one would have within a community as it relates to a forthcoming renewal to a contract.

1288
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,011
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, in Belmont,

1289
01:44:31,797 --> 01:44:43,720
[SPEAKER_12]: the Board of Selectmen, who happened to be the issuing authority, and I would hope next Wednesday at that hearing, and I'm going to make the request tonight that the hearing take place at 6.30 at night rather than 2 o'clock in the afternoon, making it available for people.

1290
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:57,084
[SPEAKER_12]: But the ascertainment hearing, which was offered by the Board of Selectmen, because they were the issuing authority, had a whole bunch of people who came forward that explained what they felt was needed in the community, for example,

1291
01:44:57,861 --> 01:45:00,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people complained that their reception was poor.

1292
01:45:01,082 --> 01:45:04,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Other people complained, was it possible to get channels without commercials?

1293
01:45:05,003 --> 01:45:10,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Another one complained, can senior citizens have a special break?

1294
01:45:10,905 --> 01:45:13,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Movie channels were also taken into consideration.

1295
01:45:13,966 --> 01:45:19,268
[SPEAKER_12]: They also talked about cable subscriptions and the lack of some cable subscriptions.

1296
01:45:19,728 --> 01:45:27,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Another resident complained about the unavailability of people to respond to their phone calls instead of a voicemail message and requesting people to leave messages.

1297
01:45:28,112 --> 01:45:31,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Another resident complained about the lack of a food channel and the Fox channels.

1298
01:45:31,995 --> 01:45:36,678
[SPEAKER_12]: And another resident complained about continual increases in the cost for cable services.

1299
01:45:37,238 --> 01:45:40,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And another resident complained about... And we can go on and on and on.

1300
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,982
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea, if you're getting it, is the fact that people had an opportunity to come.

1301
01:45:44,443 --> 01:45:51,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the purposes of them having that opportunity to come, they would be able to explain what was wrong within the cable system within their community.

1302
01:45:52,648 --> 01:45:57,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, hunting all of this down, in some of the contracts that Comcast has,

1303
01:45:57,808 --> 01:46:05,833
[SPEAKER_12]: There are provisos in the contract that says within a 15-year period of time that a contract takes place.

1304
01:46:05,893 --> 01:46:09,115
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would give you a span of either one or two contracts.

1305
01:46:09,936 --> 01:46:22,583
[SPEAKER_12]: A public survey needs to be done or should be done by Comcast, in this particular case, because we're talking about Comcast, within the community for which they are securing their renewal to the license.

1306
01:46:22,764 --> 01:46:24,044
[SPEAKER_12]: And in that survey,

1307
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:30,220
[SPEAKER_12]: They would be asking all kinds of questions as it relates to the needs within the community.

1308
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,781
[SPEAKER_12]: What would you like to see?

1309
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:34,163
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think that Comcast could do better?

1310
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:37,666
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you believe that they could be a better provider within the community?

1311
01:46:38,646 --> 01:46:45,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And with that being said, and I don't believe Medford has ever had it, and with that being said, Philadelphia is a perfect example.

1312
01:46:45,772 --> 01:46:47,073
[SPEAKER_12]: The city of Philadelphia did it.

1313
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:54,419
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a great response from the rate payers within that community, and they got a better reception as it relates to

1314
01:46:54,863 --> 01:46:58,926
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the services that Comcast was going to give them.

1315
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:10,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, this merger taking place, the proposed merger to take place between Comcast and Time Warner is really a deadly issue.

1316
01:47:11,755 --> 01:47:20,661
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a group of a non-profit organization of individuals, it's called Stop the Cap, and these are a citizens-activated watchdog group.

1317
01:47:20,681 --> 01:47:23,923
[SPEAKER_12]: They promote better broadband, they fight data caps,

1318
01:47:24,413 --> 01:47:27,514
[SPEAKER_12]: usage-based billings, and other internet overcharging schemes.

1319
01:47:28,414 --> 01:47:38,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And in this particular case, only 52 mayors, only 52 mayors throughout the entire United States of America signed off on this merger.

1320
01:47:38,797 --> 01:47:42,558
[SPEAKER_12]: And who do you think one of the two, one of the 52 mayors was?

1321
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:45,559
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our mayor and the city of Medford, Mayor McGlynn.

1322
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:51,521
[SPEAKER_12]: And what he and the other 51 mayors did, they brought together and they signed a letter

1323
01:47:52,137 --> 01:47:57,879
[SPEAKER_12]: And in this letter that they signed, that they sent to the FCC, they unfortunately made a big mistake.

1324
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what they did is it was a terribly misleading letter.

1325
01:48:02,401 --> 01:48:11,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what they did is they took facts and figures from the Comcast proposal that was used as part of their press release.

1326
01:48:12,725 --> 01:48:21,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And the letter was signed, and the text was taken almost, quote, almost entirely from Comcast's own talking points, and the letter

1327
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:25,180
[SPEAKER_12]: was misleading in the parts because the facts were inaccurate.

1328
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:34,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, one other thing a lot of people don't know about, that Comcast and Time Warner have what they call cross-marketing agreements with Verizon.

1329
01:48:35,343 --> 01:48:41,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now, the three of them do work together, and especially in the western part of our country, and California, and so forth.

1330
01:48:42,485 --> 01:48:49,307
[SPEAKER_12]: And the 52 mayors, which includes Mayor McGlynn, advocating for this multi-billion dollar cable merger is not good for the cable subscribers.

1331
01:48:50,273 --> 01:49:09,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if this merger succeeds, rates will increase, your delivery and your service will increase or decrease, depending on how you're viewed it, and you'll have no place to turn because you're going to be involved with what they call compulsory user allowance.

1332
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:18,443
[SPEAKER_12]: And what compulsory user allowance means that whatever Comcast decides to make a decision on, and if this decision goes through with Time Warner,

1333
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:23,052
[SPEAKER_12]: and Verizon, because they're all working together on this, rate changes and rate charges.

1334
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:34,299
[SPEAKER_12]: And if they get into this term called compulsory usage allowance, that is going to precipitate the rates and the charges that people are going to take place.

1335
01:49:34,999 --> 01:49:39,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we here in the city of Medford have a very unfortunate circumstance.

1336
01:49:39,902 --> 01:49:42,823
[SPEAKER_12]: We're dealing with a contract that's already been signed.

1337
01:49:43,284 --> 01:49:47,526
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I understand the contract that's already been signed, that's presently existing,

1338
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:54,193
[SPEAKER_12]: not its renewal, it's part of a three year lapse over from the original contract.

1339
01:49:54,713 --> 01:50:01,758
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're dealing with the contract that is 13 years old here within our city of Medford, 13 years old.

1340
01:50:02,998 --> 01:50:04,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And what have the rate payers gotten out of this?

1341
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:09,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Personally, they've gotten rate increases.

1342
01:50:10,242 --> 01:50:15,345
[SPEAKER_12]: If you notice on the second box and the second, third and fourth box of the rooms, they've now gone up from 199 to 299.

1343
01:50:15,466 --> 01:50:16,626
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the building,

1344
01:50:18,207 --> 01:50:19,087
[SPEAKER_12]: They secretly went up.

1345
01:50:19,867 --> 01:50:26,829
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's interesting here, there's only one person who's had a political gain out of all of this, and that's the mayor of this community.

1346
01:50:26,869 --> 01:50:36,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Because each and every year, while this contract has been in effect, he has received $2,500 for his annual golf classic, for the mayor's golf classic.

1347
01:50:37,911 --> 01:50:47,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, does anybody in this council, in the school committee, is there any rate payer out there that gets $2,500 from your cable provider for your golf classic or for whatever you want to do?

1348
01:50:48,382 --> 01:50:56,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And if, according to the records under the Freedom of Information Act, disclosed, he also gets an additional $10,000 a year for his celebrations committee.

1349
01:50:57,187 --> 01:51:00,588
[SPEAKER_12]: And what he does with that money and how he celebrates, we don't know.

1350
01:51:01,409 --> 01:51:02,469
[SPEAKER_12]: But isn't that interesting?

1351
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:12,515
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay our cable rates, and this mayor gets $2,500 a year annually for his golf tournament, and he gets an additional $10,000 for his celebrations committee.

1352
01:51:12,935 --> 01:51:16,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I ask every member of this council and anyone who might be watching at any rate

1353
01:51:17,758 --> 01:51:20,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have that luxury and do you have that privilege?

1354
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:25,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the mayor of this community under the present contract is the issuing authority.

1355
01:51:25,803 --> 01:51:27,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should he be given that luxury?

1356
01:51:28,124 --> 01:51:42,273
[SPEAKER_12]: And more importantly, how bold and brazen can he be to let a contract be signed and then he now calls for an ascertainment hearing for next Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in the dead of day when people are working

1357
01:51:43,105 --> 01:51:44,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Who are going to be able to come here?

1358
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:46,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what are you going to do?

1359
01:51:46,507 --> 01:51:55,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Have the poor people come and park behind City Hall and not understand that there's a kiosk there, and you're going to give them a ticket for coming to an ascertainment hearing that relates to their cable bills?

1360
01:51:56,674 --> 01:51:57,355
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

1361
01:51:58,155 --> 01:52:03,719
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with all due respect, Mr. President, I just think it's — we have two big issues here.

1362
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:09,043
[SPEAKER_12]: We have one of 252 mayors throughout the entire country

1363
01:52:10,016 --> 01:52:19,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Only 52 mayors signed off on this merger because maybe those 52 mayors, maybe those 52 mayors were getting special privileges like our mayor was.

1364
01:52:19,844 --> 01:52:26,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think he or anyone else deserved to get a special privilege because he signs a contract in behalf of ratepayers.

1365
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,631
[SPEAKER_12]: That's number one.

1366
01:52:28,252 --> 01:52:33,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the other part, Mr. President, the ratepayers have no vantage point here.

1367
01:52:33,376 --> 01:52:38,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we need to know what does Verizon, what is Verizon giving to the city of Medford?

1368
01:52:38,838 --> 01:52:47,382
[SPEAKER_12]: What special perks, if any, does the mayor derive from Verizon toward any of A, his charities, or whatever his wants need to be?

1369
01:52:47,702 --> 01:52:51,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they're only enhancing his political background and his political career.

1370
01:52:52,585 --> 01:52:58,627
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is an interesting, because this year here, he normally gets this money midway through the year.

1371
01:52:58,667 --> 01:53:04,710
[SPEAKER_12]: But this year, I believe he got it early on, because he probably knew he was retiring or getting out of office.

1372
01:53:04,990 --> 01:53:08,312
[SPEAKER_12]: And he took that money as a use for his

1373
01:53:08,728 --> 01:53:11,409
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, for his political wherewithal, wherever he wants to put it.

1374
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:12,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's wrong.

1375
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:27,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Mr. Peter Epstein, who's the attorney who represents the city of Medford for cable issues, whose failure to tell this council when asked if there's going to be a hearing, I don't even know if he's going to be here to do the ascertainment hearing.

1376
01:53:28,558 --> 01:53:32,140
[SPEAKER_12]: But how do you ascertain something after the fact?

1377
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:34,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell me that?

1378
01:53:35,101 --> 01:53:37,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think you can answer that, because in your profession,

1379
01:53:37,298 --> 01:53:42,321
[SPEAKER_12]: You can never ascertain anything after the fact, because your clients are already, unfortunately, deceased.

1380
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:47,704
[SPEAKER_12]: But these people, who are alive and well, don't have that ability.

1381
01:53:48,024 --> 01:53:51,066
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have the ability to know why and how.

1382
01:53:52,266 --> 01:54:06,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I strongly suggest that anyone who wants to come to the meeting next week, and I hope this council votes that it takes place at 6 o'clock at night, not 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but they eliminate any special perks and privileges

1383
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:11,552
[SPEAKER_12]: associated to the issuing authority, whether it be the mayor, the city council, whoever it might be.

1384
01:54:13,612 --> 01:54:34,779
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact of the matter is, over $300,000 right now is still sitting in the city's coffers because there's been no public access, I believe, since September of 2013 because of the mayor's failure, and I say intentional failure, to do his job to make sure that the board of directors of Channel 3

1385
01:54:35,449 --> 01:54:40,693
[SPEAKER_12]: performed what they were supposed to perform in their motion of dissolution.

1386
01:54:41,394 --> 01:54:46,038
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to give Martha Healy, the new Attorney General, credit because she went right after the town of Lynn.

1387
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:56,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And she put together an absolutely beautiful document going after them for failure of records, failure of minutes, inappropriate spending.

1388
01:54:57,292 --> 01:54:59,253
[SPEAKER_12]: in basically lying about their jobs.

1389
01:54:59,853 --> 01:55:01,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what took place here in the city of Medford.

1390
01:55:02,114 --> 01:55:10,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And Judge Jackson, who was paid almost $15,000, wrote that in her report, that if those guys and girls did not get their act together, they should be removed.

1391
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:12,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And the mayor is yet, and he has never removed them.

1392
01:55:12,959 --> 01:55:14,340
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been afraid to confront them.

1393
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:16,501
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President.

1394
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:17,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion?

1395
01:55:17,261 --> 01:55:18,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there is a motion.

1396
01:55:18,241 --> 01:55:18,962
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion is this.

1397
01:55:19,002 --> 01:55:19,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Relax.

1398
01:55:19,462 --> 01:55:20,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get nervous.

1399
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:21,383
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion is this.

1400
01:55:22,183 --> 01:55:26,565
[SPEAKER_12]: The next week's ascertainment hearing be changed from 2 o'clock in the afternoon

1401
01:55:26,938 --> 01:55:33,423
[SPEAKER_12]: to 6 o'clock at night to give every single Medford taxpayer who was a rate payer to Comcast Cable an opportunity to speak.

1402
01:55:33,443 --> 01:55:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Penta that the ascertainment meeting be moved from 2 in the afternoon to 6 in the evening.

1403
01:55:40,948 --> 01:55:43,050
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, sir, you wish to speak.

1404
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1405
01:55:45,572 --> 01:55:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1406
01:55:48,314 --> 01:55:52,336
[SPEAKER_05]: The ascertainment hearing is very important for everyone in this city for a number of reasons.

1407
01:55:52,897 --> 01:55:54,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Customers purchasing internet,

1408
01:55:55,240 --> 01:56:00,144
[SPEAKER_05]: television, telephone, all the services you get from these cable providers.

1409
01:56:00,505 --> 01:56:01,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just public access TV.

1410
01:56:02,026 --> 01:56:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just your cable.

1411
01:56:03,487 --> 01:56:04,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It is all the services.

1412
01:56:05,048 --> 01:56:06,710
[SPEAKER_05]: You must attend this ascertainment hearing.

1413
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:13,916
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because it's a lot stronger than going to the Department of Telecommunications and Cable.

1414
01:56:14,216 --> 01:56:15,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the DTC, they do a good job.

1415
01:56:15,858 --> 01:56:17,059
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very informational.

1416
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:19,401
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't have much teeth.

1417
01:56:20,001 --> 01:56:20,842
[SPEAKER_05]: People think they do.

1418
01:56:20,962 --> 01:56:22,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to give you one example.

1419
01:56:22,943 --> 01:56:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: When Comcast faced competition, when the mayor finally brought Verizon in, the rates were reduced.

1420
01:56:29,528 --> 01:56:34,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So you, anyone out there in the audience, would sign a two-year deal to get a reduced rate.

1421
01:56:35,252 --> 01:56:38,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when you signed that contract, it was so that the rates wouldn't go up.

1422
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:48,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly, we got one of those little attachments from Comcast so that a third TV, we bought two boxes, but Comcast would give you a thing for a third TV

1423
01:56:49,018 --> 01:56:51,060
[SPEAKER_05]: a little attachment where you could get the basic cable.

1424
01:56:51,900 --> 01:57:04,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly, we were being charged $2.50 for this attachment after we signed a contract that was supposed to be firm, 89 bucks a month.

1425
01:57:05,632 --> 01:57:11,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went to Comcast, and they said, well, that's not in the contract.

1426
01:57:12,456 --> 01:57:13,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the DTC.

1427
01:57:13,356 --> 01:57:16,798
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they were getting purportedly thousands of complaints.

1428
01:57:17,319 --> 01:57:19,220
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the way the cable providers act.

1429
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:26,164
[SPEAKER_05]: When they get together, and they're all one combine, and they make an agreement with you, you, you're stuck with a two-year deal.

1430
01:57:27,224 --> 01:57:28,365
[SPEAKER_05]: This ascertainment hearing,

1431
01:57:28,714 --> 01:57:31,897
[SPEAKER_05]: is where you can come and put on public record, and here's where I advise people.

1432
01:57:32,477 --> 01:57:33,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a letter from Mark Rumley.

1433
01:57:33,618 --> 01:57:34,399
[SPEAKER_05]: He's already received it.

1434
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:35,580
[SPEAKER_05]: You counselors have received it.

1435
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:40,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be going to Ed Finn's office and to Mark Rumley's office and getting it time-stamped.

1436
01:57:40,785 --> 01:57:42,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be bringing it to the ascertainment hearing.

1437
01:57:44,365 --> 01:57:45,425
[SPEAKER_05]: You bring it to the city clerk.

1438
01:57:45,585 --> 01:57:46,806
[SPEAKER_05]: You bring it to the city lawyer.

1439
01:57:47,166 --> 01:57:48,506
[SPEAKER_05]: You bring it to the ascertainment hearing.

1440
01:57:48,546 --> 01:57:50,186
[SPEAKER_05]: You make sure it's on public record.

1441
01:57:50,966 --> 01:57:54,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a problem having the Comcast guy come to your house?

1442
01:57:54,947 --> 01:57:56,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Was he three hours late?

1443
01:57:56,448 --> 01:57:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they move the meeting?

1444
01:57:58,688 --> 01:57:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: The appointment.

1445
01:57:59,588 --> 01:58:01,589
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all incredibly important.

1446
01:58:02,429 --> 01:58:03,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredibly important.

1447
01:58:04,089 --> 01:58:06,570
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, when you look at that document, the public

1448
01:58:07,783 --> 01:58:10,384
[SPEAKER_05]: records request, and you see that the mayor gets these perks.

1449
01:58:11,024 --> 01:58:12,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Who made him the issuing authority?

1450
01:58:12,425 --> 01:58:14,246
[SPEAKER_05]: The issuing authority is the city or town.

1451
01:58:14,986 --> 01:58:16,266
[SPEAKER_05]: In Belmont, they have the selectmen.

1452
01:58:16,286 --> 01:58:17,767
[SPEAKER_05]: In Winchester, they have the selectmen.

1453
01:58:18,147 --> 01:58:19,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Richard Howard, the town manager.

1454
01:58:20,248 --> 01:58:25,710
[SPEAKER_05]: In Winchester, it is a body of five or six people that actually get to vote on it, not the town manager.

1455
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:28,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mayor McGlynn

1456
01:58:29,056 --> 01:58:31,718
[SPEAKER_05]: finds himself as the issuing authority and he makes precedent.

1457
01:58:32,378 --> 01:58:37,021
[SPEAKER_05]: This city council, I would trust seven people voting on this rather than one.

1458
01:58:37,782 --> 01:58:44,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if seven people are voting, no one's going to get a $10,000 Maya celebratory fund for the lighting of the Christmas tree.

1459
01:58:44,206 --> 01:58:45,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, how long has that been going on?

1460
01:58:45,326 --> 01:58:46,807
[SPEAKER_05]: $10,000 a year for 15 years we know of.

1461
01:58:48,388 --> 01:58:50,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nick Lucci of Comcast was with Time Warner.

1462
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:57,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would suspect this May's celebratory fund has probably gone the entire length of McGlynn's career, 28 years.

1463
01:58:58,253 --> 01:58:59,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct me if I'm wrong, Your Honor.

1464
01:59:00,254 --> 01:59:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to come here to the city council next week, Your Honor, and talk to us about this.

1465
01:59:05,617 --> 01:59:06,357
[SPEAKER_05]: The golf tournament.

1466
01:59:08,246 --> 01:59:10,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifteen years, the public records request, $2,500.

1467
01:59:12,530 --> 01:59:23,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have public access, but on top of that, the issuing authority takes $800,000 from the million or so and gives $200,000 to three teachers and $600,000 to the general fund.

1468
01:59:24,701 --> 01:59:26,062
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this general fund?

1469
01:59:26,422 --> 01:59:27,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Where does this money go?

1470
01:59:27,403 --> 01:59:28,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get a line item on it?

1471
01:59:28,964 --> 01:59:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we see that it fixes roads?

1472
01:59:31,015 --> 01:59:34,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we see that it brings stores to the empty storefronts?

1473
01:59:34,116 --> 01:59:41,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we see what this money, this second tax, this additional tax, that's not delivering public access?

1474
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:46,282
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, this city council couldn't even get a $400 piece of equipment if memory serves me right.

1475
01:59:47,663 --> 01:59:50,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we can upload the government meetings up on Made in Medford.

1476
01:59:50,744 --> 01:59:53,065
[SPEAKER_05]: They've given us this breadcrumb called Made in Medford.

1477
01:59:54,746 --> 01:59:55,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just YouTube.

1478
01:59:55,606 --> 01:59:59,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You put your stuff on YouTube, and then you can upload it to Made in Medford with a simple link.

1479
02:00:00,552 --> 02:00:07,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Video-on-demand Comcast gave us customers, please come down here and say, why didn't we have council meetings on video-on-demand?

1480
02:00:08,416 --> 02:00:10,217
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been the first thing to do.

1481
02:00:11,738 --> 02:00:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with the council is that, you know, a city official should be uploading the government channel materials.

1482
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:25,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Made in Medford, you have video-on-demand, you have the contiguous channels on Verizon, but none of this stuff is being used because this mayor doesn't care to use it.

1483
02:00:25,725 --> 02:00:29,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I want this city council

1484
02:00:31,242 --> 02:00:34,464
[SPEAKER_05]: to grab ahold of the situation, to say to the mayor, hey, you're a lame duck.

1485
02:00:35,125 --> 02:00:37,166
[SPEAKER_05]: You've resigned in April.

1486
02:00:38,607 --> 02:00:41,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, why did you get the tournament fund, the monies, March 31st?

1487
02:00:41,690 --> 02:00:46,233
[SPEAKER_05]: You usually get those monies in June, but March 31st of this year, he's got his check for the tournament already.

1488
02:00:46,293 --> 02:00:46,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1489
02:00:46,994 --> 02:00:48,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a lottery ticket for this guy.

1490
02:00:49,896 --> 02:00:51,677
[SPEAKER_05]: This council should be the issuing authority.

1491
02:00:53,038 --> 02:00:59,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And as the issuing authority, then you can look at all the problems with cable TV and see where we go and see about public access TV.

1492
02:01:01,485 --> 02:01:05,387
[SPEAKER_05]: make it a deal for the residents, not a deal for one guy who's leaving office.

1493
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:10,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what's very, very important here is this.

1494
02:01:10,491 --> 02:01:11,711
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2002, the contract expired.

1495
02:01:12,292 --> 02:01:13,472
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor didn't sign a new one until 2005.

1496
02:01:15,983 --> 02:01:19,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's had a 13-year deal here, a 13-year deal.

1497
02:01:19,584 --> 02:01:28,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we, this council, and the residents didn't come up here and look for this Comcast letter, you better believe they were going to have another three years before they signed the agreement.

1498
02:01:29,586 --> 02:01:32,587
[SPEAKER_05]: So why should a lame-duck mayor sign this agreement next week?

1499
02:01:33,027 --> 02:01:39,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what they usually do, if you people aren't aware of ascertainment hearings, they have the hearing quick, quick, and then they sign the paper, and it's done.

1500
02:01:40,369 --> 02:01:42,949
[SPEAKER_05]: They never expected that we'd be talking about this week after week.

1501
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:44,890
[SPEAKER_05]: They just thought they'd have a little quiet meeting,

1502
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:48,451
[SPEAKER_05]: signed the contract, it's all done, another 10 years.

1503
02:01:49,332 --> 02:01:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's all changed.

1504
02:01:51,173 --> 02:01:56,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Councilor Penta, this should be at six o'clock at night, seven o'clock at night, it should be in an Alden Chamber, it's not in room 207.

1505
02:01:58,978 --> 02:02:00,438
[SPEAKER_05]: This ascertainment meeting's important.

1506
02:02:00,859 --> 02:02:06,802
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor, who's now stepping down, should say, hey, you're right, I'm not issuing authority, I can't make a decision for the next 10 years.

1507
02:02:07,583 --> 02:02:08,583
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys wanna do three years?

1508
02:02:08,623 --> 02:02:09,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the city council handle it.

1509
02:02:10,364 --> 02:02:13,066
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about it, the mayor hasn't been talking about it, it's our issue.

1510
02:02:15,546 --> 02:02:16,866
[SPEAKER_05]: This meeting is very important.

1511
02:02:16,886 --> 02:02:19,407
[SPEAKER_05]: People of Medford, you've got to come out here next Wednesday.

1512
02:02:19,447 --> 02:02:26,609
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to come out here and talk about the appointments you have with the Verizon and Comcast guys, both cable providers, and Dish Network as well.

1513
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:33,211
[SPEAKER_05]: All of your needs, AT&T, everything, talk about it at the Comcast hearing, because this is your opportunity.

1514
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:34,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, the mayor will be here.

1515
02:02:34,912 --> 02:02:36,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, Peter Epstein will be here.

1516
02:02:36,993 --> 02:02:39,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, Mark Rumley will be here, and we can all discuss this.

1517
02:02:39,453 --> 02:02:44,995
[SPEAKER_05]: But people, you need to come out, because this is your one window of opportunity, one window of opportunity for this city.

1518
02:02:46,582 --> 02:02:47,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, people.

1519
02:02:47,802 --> 02:02:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1520
02:02:48,063 --> 02:02:50,083
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

1521
02:02:51,084 --> 02:02:52,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1522
02:02:52,424 --> 02:02:56,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to move the meeting from 2 to 6.

1523
02:02:56,866 --> 02:03:00,047
[SPEAKER_04]: 6.30, as amended by Councilor Penta, 6.30.

1524
02:03:00,087 --> 02:03:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Newton?

1525
02:03:00,587 --> 02:03:00,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1526
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:01,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

1527
02:03:01,287 --> 02:03:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1528
02:03:01,367 --> 02:03:01,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mack?

1529
02:03:01,707 --> 02:03:01,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1530
02:03:01,787 --> 02:03:02,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Blum?

1531
02:03:02,307 --> 02:03:02,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1532
02:03:02,387 --> 02:03:02,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Martins?

1533
02:03:02,928 --> 02:03:02,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1534
02:03:18,138 --> 02:03:18,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1535
02:03:19,399 --> 02:03:21,420
[SPEAKER_04]: A vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1536
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1537
02:03:23,321 --> 02:03:44,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by President De La Russo, be it resolved that the mayor's office update the council on the status of the environmentally friendly golf carts caged in the southeast corner of City Hall amidst the stacks of recycling bins.

1538
02:03:45,132 --> 02:03:47,533
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Lugo-Kern for approval,

1539
02:03:48,007 --> 02:03:48,847
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1540
02:03:49,948 --> 02:03:50,908
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1541
02:03:51,088 --> 02:03:52,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1542
02:03:52,949 --> 02:04:03,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Counselor Caraviello, be it resolved that the DPW Director inspect some of the recent repairs to our streets from different utilities and their subcontractors.

1543
02:04:03,274 --> 02:04:04,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Caraviello.

1544
02:04:04,374 --> 02:04:05,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1545
02:04:05,275 --> 02:04:10,097
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, our streets are, you know, because of the winter, we're in pretty bad shape anyways.

1546
02:04:10,477 --> 02:04:16,800
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, Mr. President, I drove around the last few days, and I saw some new work that has just been completed.

1547
02:04:18,312 --> 02:04:26,918
[SPEAKER_09]: The job that the subcontractor did for the utility company, I mean, this is part of the reason our streets are in deplorable condition.

1548
02:04:27,778 --> 02:04:33,042
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing them, they're shoddy, and they're sinking, and no one's ever coming back and fixing them.

1549
02:04:33,362 --> 02:04:39,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like the DPW director to go out and look at some of the new work that was just done and see if that meets his approval.

1550
02:04:39,526 --> 02:04:44,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, Arlington Street was just done this week, and some of it's already coming up.

1551
02:04:47,269 --> 02:04:48,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

1552
02:04:48,610 --> 02:05:01,817
[SPEAKER_09]: But I say, you know, this is the reason our streets are in the condition they're in, because the National Grid and all these companies come in, they rip up the streets, and they put a little thin coat of tying down, and we never see them again.

1553
02:05:02,237 --> 02:05:05,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And they sink, and then it just keeps getting worse and worse.

1554
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be helpful if there was a person whose job was follow through on all of that.

1555
02:05:10,682 --> 02:05:15,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think that would be a nice job if it was available, Mr. President.

1556
02:05:16,405 --> 02:05:16,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

1557
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:18,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we have one.

1558
02:05:19,372 --> 02:05:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Knight?

1559
02:05:20,474 --> 02:05:21,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

1560
02:05:22,256 --> 02:05:32,890
[SPEAKER_15]: In correlation to Councillor Caviello's resolution just several weeks ago, I believe this council approved a resolution unanimously that was tied to a permit for national grid to tear up Columbia Road.

1561
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:46,536
[SPEAKER_15]: And we asked the city engineer, who in her public hearing documents, frequently closes with, be it understood that the contractor will have to close the street up and leave it and meet city of Medford standards, I believe is the language that's used.

1562
02:05:46,556 --> 02:05:49,957
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've asked for a copy of what those city of Medford standards are.

1563
02:05:49,997 --> 02:05:51,998
[SPEAKER_15]: And to date, we have yet to receive them, Mr. President.

1564
02:05:52,038 --> 02:06:01,602
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to ask that the resolution be amended to include an update as to where we are on top of the city of Medford standards for public utility operators and tearing up our streets.

1565
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:02,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1566
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Cavillo as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso.

1567
02:06:06,443 --> 02:06:06,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1568
02:06:06,684 --> 02:06:15,931
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could also, um, once again, I brought it up, uh, about a month or so ago to send it to the mayor and the director of budget and personnel, the DPW commission position.

1569
02:06:17,052 --> 02:06:20,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the personnel director posted the job on the webpage.

1570
02:06:20,074 --> 02:06:20,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it came down.

1571
02:06:20,975 --> 02:06:22,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm hearing they're not filling the job.

1572
02:06:23,897 --> 02:06:30,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another example of us funding a position within a budget.

1573
02:06:30,787 --> 02:06:35,910
[SPEAKER_06]: for over $100,000 a year, and them not doing what the intent was.

1574
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why I asked for the transfer list.

1575
02:06:41,834 --> 02:06:42,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be.

1576
02:06:42,994 --> 02:06:43,174
Yes.

1577
02:06:43,795 --> 02:06:45,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So as amended by Councillor Camuso.

1578
02:06:45,696 --> 02:06:47,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of approval by Councillor Carapiello.

1579
02:06:47,617 --> 02:06:48,618
[SPEAKER_06]: The status of the DPW job.

1580
02:06:48,978 --> 02:06:49,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1581
02:06:49,818 --> 02:06:50,519
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

1582
02:06:51,319 --> 02:06:51,899
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1583
02:06:51,939 --> 02:06:52,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1584
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:59,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councillor Marks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held

1585
02:07:00,095 --> 02:07:03,416
[SPEAKER_04]: for longtime Medford resident Bob Delfino on his recent passing.

1586
02:07:04,276 --> 02:07:09,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob served as a member of the Board of Assessors for many years here in the city of Medford.

1587
02:07:09,358 --> 02:07:10,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1588
02:07:10,798 --> 02:07:11,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1589
02:07:11,838 --> 02:07:17,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe everyone behind this reel and many residents of this community knew Bob Delfino.

1590
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:28,063
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a family man, someone that dedicated his life to his profession and also to improving the quality of life in this community.

1591
02:07:29,088 --> 02:07:31,629
[SPEAKER_08]: He will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1592
02:07:32,389 --> 02:07:37,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And at this point, I'd like to dedicate this meeting also in memory of Bob Delfino.

1593
02:07:39,051 --> 02:07:40,252
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion of Councilor Marks.

1594
02:07:40,412 --> 02:07:41,072
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1595
02:07:41,812 --> 02:07:42,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Those opposed?

1596
02:07:42,573 --> 02:07:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Please stand for a moment of silence.

1597
02:07:57,338 --> 02:07:57,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

1598
02:08:00,328 --> 02:08:20,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Upon reviewing our resolutions that we've had in the past, and I don't know, you know, where you go with this, I don't know who has a sense of priorities around here or not, but going back, I believe it's the first week in March, and this is now almost getting to the last week of April, those lights in Medford Square are still out.

1599
02:08:20,461 --> 02:08:29,487
[SPEAKER_12]: That public safety issue still is looming, and I don't know what it is that this administration doesn't see about the issue of public safety.

1600
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:37,213
[SPEAKER_12]: We heard the chief of police say that the biggest sense of priority and security for a business person is to have a light in front of his.

1601
02:08:37,433 --> 02:08:38,414
[SPEAKER_12]: There's eight of them out.

1602
02:08:38,514 --> 02:08:42,456
[SPEAKER_12]: There's eight of them out and all within the close proximity to each other.

1603
02:08:42,736 --> 02:08:44,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just doesn't make any sense.

1604
02:08:45,137 --> 02:08:52,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Beside not having any lights on the Route 16 parking lot, for which this is now the 16th time that we're talking about it.

1605
02:08:53,261 --> 02:08:56,023
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't understand why the mayor was getting out.

1606
02:08:56,663 --> 02:08:57,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I do understand.

1607
02:08:57,703 --> 02:08:58,984
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't want to deal with these issues.

1608
02:08:59,348 --> 02:09:01,009
[SPEAKER_12]: because he maybe doesn't know how to handle them.

1609
02:09:01,029 --> 02:09:06,732
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't know how to tell people to go down there and change the street light in a matter of public safety.

1610
02:09:06,972 --> 02:09:09,813
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's OK for us to talk about it and talk about it and talk about it.

1611
02:09:10,694 --> 02:09:19,498
[SPEAKER_12]: As you've acknowledged, Mr. Council President, when you were sitting on there, on the 13th time we talked about the lights on Route 16, and they're still not done.

1612
02:09:20,038 --> 02:09:24,060
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know what it's going to take.

1613
02:09:24,892 --> 02:09:38,461
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't even know if a new administration can make these changes unless there's a completely new attitude where it's directly people-oriented, not me, myself-oriented, people-oriented, taxpayer-oriented.

1614
02:09:39,162 --> 02:09:44,826
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we just spent—we increased our school—we increased our budget last year by over $2 million for the school department.

1615
02:09:45,526 --> 02:09:46,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And what did they do?

1616
02:09:46,087 --> 02:09:49,489
[SPEAKER_12]: They went out there and hired administrators, more administrators.

1617
02:09:50,442 --> 02:09:56,928
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're looking for quality education, sound education.

1618
02:09:57,549 --> 02:10:06,238
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at the herculean issue of Common Core, where it's going here in Massachusetts, and how it's affecting families, and the whole educational process.

1619
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:08,860
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we going to do this year when the budget comes in?

1620
02:10:09,221 --> 02:10:13,065
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't have that $2 million extra, where's the cut going to be?

1621
02:10:14,226 --> 02:10:14,426
[SPEAKER_12]: You know?

1622
02:10:15,173 --> 02:10:24,356
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, you know, lights are a very important issue to me because they signify public safety, you know, at a minimum.

1623
02:10:24,996 --> 02:10:28,237
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, this is now going on two months for those eight lights to be out.

1624
02:10:28,337 --> 02:10:30,918
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe the mayor didn't pay the electric bill this month.

1625
02:10:30,958 --> 02:10:31,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1626
02:10:32,038 --> 02:10:37,840
[SPEAKER_12]: He got his $2,500 ahead of time from Comcast, you know, for a golf tournament.

1627
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:39,180
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know when he's going to have that one.

1628
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:40,880
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I just don't know.

1629
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what goes through that guy's mind anymore.

1630
02:10:43,042 --> 02:10:50,787
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, maybe you do because you talk to him because he doesn't, you know, didn't he make one of the comments, the reason why he's getting out because he can't get along with the council.

1631
02:10:51,067 --> 02:10:52,248
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no communication.

1632
02:10:52,328 --> 02:10:55,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the reason why there's no communication, he doesn't want to talk to us.

1633
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:57,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be more than happy to talk to him anytime.

1634
02:10:57,752 --> 02:11:03,015
[SPEAKER_12]: If he came before this podium right now and indicated that I'm going to do that, I've been a little bit remiss.

1635
02:11:03,335 --> 02:11:03,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1636
02:11:03,656 --> 02:11:10,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Mayor, if he acknowledged that he made a mistake with the kiosk, I would be perfectly happy with that.

1637
02:11:10,706 --> 02:11:15,808
[SPEAKER_12]: If he turned around and says, okay, I've been a little dilatory on having public access, but this is what we're going to do.

1638
02:11:15,849 --> 02:11:16,209
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right.

1639
02:11:16,469 --> 02:11:17,189
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a real need.

1640
02:11:17,649 --> 02:11:19,610
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be okay with that, but we don't have that.

1641
02:11:20,231 --> 02:11:21,451
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have that.

1642
02:11:21,691 --> 02:11:22,632
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you thanking me for?

1643
02:11:22,652 --> 02:11:23,652
[SPEAKER_12]: You thanking me for my comments?

1644
02:11:23,932 --> 02:11:24,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1645
02:11:24,913 --> 02:11:29,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they're good comments, and they're made on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

1646
02:11:30,292 --> 02:11:31,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Councillor.
