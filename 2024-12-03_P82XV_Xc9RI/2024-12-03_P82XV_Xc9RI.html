href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=615.273s">So</a>  in the agenda for today, we're going to just talk about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=620.176s">Then</a>  we are going to introduce the plan that we have for the next year, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=623.498s">We're</a>  going to do an introduction about the Salem Street District Corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=631.924s">And</a>  then Emily is going to present the draft itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=637.587s">So</a>  the general changes to the Medford Zoning Ordinance and then the new district draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=644.489s">Um,</a>  so this comes from July 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=647.691s">We</a>  had a workshop here, um, with the city, uh, staff and the Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=657.61s">where</a>  we presented some analysis of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=660.813s">Then</a>  we presented just an outline of the corridors, Mystic Avenue and Salem Street together in August 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=670.66s">We</a>  have been working on Mystic Avenue the last month, and today we're going to present the Salem Street corridor draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=681.588s">Um,</a>  later on the next, uh, in December 11th, we will present with your comments from the City Council staff recommendations and any comment from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=695.531s">We</a>  will do those, integrate those comments in the draft and bring it again for a final review. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=704.879s">So</a>  starting with the plan for 2025, we just wanted to introduce an outline so also the public could see what things, topics, districts and geographical areas we're going to be talking about and analyzing during the next year from January to May. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=724.739s">So</a>  we're going to start in January with North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=727.945s">We're</a>  going to study and analyze the single-family districts one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=736.428s">And</a>  we are going to explore many topics, but mainly we're going to study the dimensionless standards, development standards, and housing topics about, different topics about housing, like the ADU, et cetera, topics that are important in these next months. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=757.31s">In</a>  February, we will talk about South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=760.133s">The</a>  districts will be apartment one, two, general residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=764.217s">And</a>  the topics are going to be very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=766.459s">And</a>  we will also introduce this idea of the neighborhood commercial, these neighborhood notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=772.064s">How</a>  can we approach those and study those? <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=776.169s">In</a>  March, we will talk about the Medford Square, mainly commercial one, and other districts that are related in these areas, in these locations, we will talk about standards, dimensional and developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=791.976s">And</a>  then in April, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=796.941s">And</a>  finally, in May, Wellington and Glenwood area, we will review office, district, industrial and the mixed use zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=808.041s">So</a>  that this is the big, big outline that we have prepared for the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=814.169s">And</a>  we will in the next meetings, we will be more specific with the topics and also the dates that the public meetings will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=826.873s">So</a>  just a little reminder, Medfair has done for, I think it was in 2022, started a comprehensive plan and it was released in January 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=840.345s">And</a>  we are building on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=844.548s">So</a>  all these zoning updates are not coming from anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=848.472s">This</a>  comes from the <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=849.913s">comprehensive</a>  plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=851.574s">And</a>  when we talk about the corridors and why Mystic or Salem Street, this comes from this study that was done years before. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=862.32s">So</a>  here we see the Salem Street, for example, and we have different strategies that comes with it, like, for example, the Vibrant Places 1.1.2, where it talks about mixed use in these village centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=878.169s">as</a>  a right in smaller nodes outside traditional commercial squares, such as in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=884.211s">So</a>  just wanted to introduce this with the idea that this comes from a bigger plan that was done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=893.113s">So</a>  we are just doing that update in the zoning from the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=899.122s">Where</a>  are we and what is the existing conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=904.005s">That's</a>  what I'm going to present now. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=907.046s">So</a>  we are in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=909.148s">This</a>  is where we are in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=913.25s">So</a>  what are the districts that are already there? <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=915.971s">And</a>  we have a little bit, quite a mix in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=919.393s">Mainly</a>  the lots that are abutting Salem Streets are apartment one. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=928.538s">The</a>  last part of it, the last piece, it's in commercial one, and then on the north of Salem Street, we have a general residential, and on the south, the single family two. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=943.084s">What</a>  does it mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=943.924s">In</a>  this table, what we show, and it's a lot of numbers, I'm not hoping that you will look at all of them, but this is exactly what you can do right now in those districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=957.697s">where</a>  are the minimum area, the minimum lot area, which <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=964.421s">By</a>  the way, in apartment one, a lot of non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=967.663s">We</a>  will have a lot of non-conforming because of the square footage, the minimum that is allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=975.046s">And</a>  then it tell us the heights and the stories, the setbacks, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=982.729s">So</a>  in here, there are all these different districts that apply in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=987.451s">This</a>  is exactly the conditions that what can be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=993.118s">This</a>  is what we proposed in a previous meeting, where we analyzed the area and we wanted to do this different districts, depending on the connection and how it related with the bigger services in the districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1014.592s">So</a>  we took this Hike Park or Morrison Park as important nodes. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1020.583s">also</a>  the school, to create two, and this is the reddish areas, two bigger nodes, commercial nodes with higher density, and that is in Parker Street, Salem Street, that is one of the nodes, and the other one is Felsway West at Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1043.706s">So</a>  the distinction that we do from that analysis, bringing also the districts that we have worked with in Mystic Avenue, we bring the mixed use one, mixed use two commercial, and we add one new one, which is the multi-unit residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1062.282s">And</a>  this works as a transition between the corridor and the existing residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1069.523s">Um,</a>  mixes one, it's very similar as we did for mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1075.631s">The</a>  different between mystic Avenue and Salem Street is it's a different character in this quarter, mystic Avenue is very citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1084.503s">So</a>  it should serve the city demands. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1088.046s">Salem</a>  Street does not have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1091.848s">It</a>  should not have that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1093.449s">This</a>  is more a neighborhood corridor, so it will serve the districts and the neighborhoods that are around Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1102.235s">So</a>  the density here is going to be less, and the heights are going to be less. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1106.938s">For</a>  example, Mixuse 3 that we used in Mystic Avenue, we are not going to see it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1112.762s">So</a>  we have mixed use one, this is active ground floor, three stories, and with incentive zoning, we bring that back, we can have four stories maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1125.885s">we</a>  are talking about a small, medium scale program. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1130.508s">In</a>  this notes that I was talking about that connects with the school and the parks, here we have mixed use too. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1136.812s">And</a>  this is active ground floor as well, 75%, four stories, and with incentive zoning, it can go up to six stories with a step back from the third floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1153.001s">In</a>  commercial here, this is the bright red, the darker red. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1158.043s">Here</a>  we have a bigger scale commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1160.083s">It's</a>  exactly what is existing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1162.584s">We</a>  will have different development standards than what is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1166.265s">The</a>  big target, for example, or the MBTA bus collection storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1173.827s">Um,</a>  but we want to have it a bit more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1177.55s">So</a>  here we can have from 3 to incentive zoning six maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1182.433s">This</a>  is really a more commercial program. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1185.135s">Um,</a>  gas station is permitted in this area, and then we have this transition, and this is the new one that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1191.74s">This</a>  is the multi unit residential, which is maximum three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1197.424s">Um,</a>  and these are multiple dwelling from 3 to 6 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1203.12s">So</a>  what is right now there? <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1208.8s">What</a>  we did is, if in these blocks we have a mix of commercial and a mix of residential, we keep it as a mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1217.786s">Only</a>  the blocks that are entire residential, we maintain it as it is, because we think that that character is part of the identity of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1228.513s">So</a>  we want to maintain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1229.854s">And</a>  at this moment, we don't see the necessity to do a complete commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1237.299s">ground</a>  floor in the in the corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1240.761s">So</a>  what you see is that we have some commercial, some multifamily already existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1248.287s">And</a>  what we are doing here is just we do a bit of densify a bit these commercial program and we introduce residential in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1260.215s">So</a>  we expect for a <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1262.396s">very</a>  open, active ground floor and then residential on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1271.142s">So</a>  what we have prepared is a bit of what is existing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1276.665s">Historical</a>  buildings we wanted to be preserved three stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1282.549s">And</a>  for example, gas stations to not have them in the corridor and only have them <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1289.58s">in</a>  the commercial area, so really near Felsway West. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1294.83s">That</a>  makes a lot more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1297.776s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1299.611s">Um,</a>  so we have in in a very few meters or feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1305.694s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1306.895s">We</a>  already encountered three gas stations, so that's something that we would like to avoid in this quarter, especially because we wanted to be more vibrant to be pedestrian focused to be more active. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1320.683s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1322.662s">So</a>  in, as you can see, really just a few feet away, we have three gas stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1333.228s">Then</a>  the residential that is already there, two and a half stories high, and also three stories high, that is exactly what we permit in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1342.793s">So</a>  these are pretty much staying, and we wanted to keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1349.496s">Um</a>  And then finishing with the most commercial part, which is already As existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1357.263s">This</a>  is exactly what is in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1359.244s">Now</a>  what is permitted in these areas? <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1362.467s">Um,</a>  this already is the commercial one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1367.391s">Um,</a>  and <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1368.972s">It</a>  is permitted buildings until six stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1372.293s">So</a>  you could have something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1376.375s">As</a>  you can see in the I don't know if you can see my cursor moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1379.115s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1382.237s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1382.477s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1384.537s">But,</a>  and with the <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1387.958s">dimensional</a>  standards with these step backs, this cannot happen with the new zoning in the Salem Street corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1396.924s">But</a>  because of what you have at this moment, it could happen, especially in the east part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1404.148s">It</a>  also has the hotel that can go up to 12 stories at the moment as existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1412.466s">Yes,</a>  so that's something that we want to avoid because we don't see that that can really happen in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1420.052s">So</a>  that's one thing that we need to look and that we have looked into is what is existing right now there, what is the character, and another one is what your zoning allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1430.34s">And</a>  so we want to make something that makes sense, taking both into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1438.366s">And</a>  I think that that is the introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1442.529s">So</a>  now I'm going to let if Madam Chair, if I can ask Emily to present the second part.</p>
