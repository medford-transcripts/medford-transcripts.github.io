[SPEAKER_14]: So we've had a busy past couple months.

56
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:09,743
[SPEAKER_14]: We have referred the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal to the CDB.

00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:11,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Same with Greenscore.

58
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are kind of in the middle of our discussions, kind of beginning

59
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:24,231
[SPEAKER_14]: middle of the beginning, beginning of the middle of our discussions about the zoning proposal for the Salem Street Corridor.

60
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:28,935
[SPEAKER_14]: We touched on that a little bit last time when Vice Chair Leming was presiding over the meeting.

61
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:38,543
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of tonight's meeting is to kind of recenter ourselves and where we are in the timeline of the zoning review project overall, where we are in the year.

62
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:48,382
[SPEAKER_14]: and place the Salem Street zoning proposal in the context of that, its next steps after the committee takes its time with it.

63
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:55,027
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're going to have an introduction to the Salem Street Corridor zoning proposal by NS Associates.

64
00:07:55,888 --> 00:08:07,258
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just the first time that the council and the committee is going to have a chance to kind of get a really solid comprehensive overview and start to get into the weeds on this zoning proposal.

65
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:16,587
[SPEAKER_14]: We've already started advertising for our next planning and permitting committee meeting where we'll be going over the Salem Street zoning proposal.

66
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,849
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be next week on Wednesday at our regular time.

67
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:31,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that in collaboration with Director Hunt and the mayor's office, we put out some promotional materials about this meeting today on social media, as well as a robocall just to make sure that we're really getting the word out.

68
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:36,040
[SPEAKER_14]: So the purpose of tonight is to introduce this proposal to councilors.

69
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:47,504
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we've had it in our packets since last week so that we can start to make those comments and ask those questions so that we can be kind of having more informed context for residents in the week between now and next week when we talk about it again.

70
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:55,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, invite residents to hear about the proposal and ask questions before the committee takes any further action on it.

71
00:08:55,928 --> 00:09:04,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, I'll turn it over unless Danielle or Alicia, if you have any comments that you want to make up top, I'd happily turn it over to Paola to begin her presentation.

72
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,025

[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Emily is also joined.

[SPEAKER_09]: She's virtual.

85
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I'm physically in the City Hall.

86
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:51,546
[SPEAKER_09]: It's me from Innis Associates, Paula Ramos and my colleague, Jimmy Rocha.

87
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:58,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and virtually Emily Innis that she will present also one part of the presentation today.

88
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to share my screen.

89
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:19,015
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the agenda for today, we're going to just talk about the timeline.

90
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:23,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we are going to introduce the plan that we have for the next year, 2025.

91
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:31,584
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do an introduction about the Salem Street District Corridor.

92
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:37,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Emily is going to present the draft itself.

93
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:42,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So the general changes to the Medford Zoning Ordinance and then the new district draft.

94
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:47,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so this comes from July 24th.

95
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:54,555
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a workshop here, um, with the city, uh, staff and the Councilors.

96
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,912
[SPEAKER_09]: where we presented some analysis of the area.

97
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:09,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we presented just an outline of the corridors, Mystic Avenue and Salem Street together in August 14th.

98
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:20,347
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been working on Mystic Avenue the last month, and today we're going to present the Salem Street corridor draft.

99
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:35,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, later on the next, uh, in December 11th, we will present with your comments from the City Council staff recommendations and any comment from the public.

100
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:41,873
[SPEAKER_09]: We will do those, integrate those comments in the draft and bring it again for a final review.

101
00:11:44,879 --> 00:12:04,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting with the plan for 2025, we just wanted to introduce an outline so also the public could see what things, topics, districts and geographical areas we're going to be talking about and analyzing during the next year from January to May.

102
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:07,925
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to start in January with North Medford.

103
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:15,418
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to study and analyze the single-family districts one and two.

104
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:35,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are going to explore many topics, but mainly we're going to study the dimensionless standards, development standards, and housing topics about, different topics about housing, like the ADU, et cetera, topics that are important in these next months.

105
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,732
[SPEAKER_09]: In February, we will talk about South Medford.

106
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,616
[SPEAKER_09]: The districts will be apartment one, two, general residential.

107
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And the topics are going to be very similar.

108
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:51,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will also introduce this idea of the neighborhood commercial, these neighborhood notes.

109
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,987
[SPEAKER_09]: How can we approach those and study those?

110
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:10,947
[SPEAKER_09]: In March, we will talk about the Medford Square, mainly commercial one, and other districts that are related in these areas, in these locations, we will talk about standards, dimensional and developments.

111
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in April, West Medford.

112
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:26,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, in May, Wellington and Glenwood area, we will review office, district, industrial and the mixed use zone.

113
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:33,829
[SPEAKER_09]: So that this is the big, big outline that we have prepared for the next year.

114
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:44,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will in the next meetings, we will be more specific with the topics and also the dates that the public meetings will be.

115
00:13:46,873 --> 00:14:00,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So just a little reminder, Medfair has done for, I think it was in 2022, started a comprehensive plan and it was released in January 2023.

116
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:04,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are building on that.

117
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:08,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So all these zoning updates are not coming from anywhere.

118
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,313
[SPEAKER_09]: This comes from the

119
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:10,974
[SPEAKER_09]: comprehensive plan.

120
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:21,500
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we talk about the corridors and why Mystic or Salem Street, this comes from this study that was done years before.

121
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:37,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we see the Salem Street, for example, and we have different strategies that comes with it, like, for example, the Vibrant Places 1.1.2, where it talks about mixed use in these village centers.

122
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,231
[SPEAKER_09]: as a right in smaller nodes outside traditional commercial squares, such as in Salem Street.

123
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:52,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So just wanted to introduce this with the idea that this comes from a bigger plan that was done before.

124
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:56,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are just doing that update in the zoning from the comprehensive plan.

125
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:02,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are we and what is the existing conditions?

126
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,726
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm going to present now.

127
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,907
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are in Salem Street.

128
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,429
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where we are in Medford.

129
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are the districts that are already there?

130
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:18,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a little bit, quite a mix in here.

131
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:27,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly the lots that are abutting Salem Streets are apartment one.

132
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:41,603
[SPEAKER_09]: The last part of it, the last piece, it's in commercial one, and then on the north of Salem Street, we have a general residential, and on the south, the single family two.

133
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:43,904
[SPEAKER_09]: What does it mean?

134
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:57,189
[SPEAKER_09]: In this table, what we show, and it's a lot of numbers, I'm not hoping that you will look at all of them, but this is exactly what you can do right now in those districts.

135
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:03,052
[SPEAKER_09]: where are the minimum area, the minimum lot area, which

136
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,162
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, in apartment one, a lot of non-conforming.

137
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:12,985
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have a lot of non-conforming because of the square footage, the minimum that is allowed.

138
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:22,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it tell us the heights and the stories, the setbacks, et cetera.

139
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:27,351
[SPEAKER_09]: So in here, there are all these different districts that apply in Salem Street.

140
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:31,113
[SPEAKER_09]: This is exactly the conditions that what can be done now.

141
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:53,972
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we proposed in a previous meeting, where we analyzed the area and we wanted to do this different districts, depending on the connection and how it related with the bigger services in the districts.

142
00:16:54,592 --> 00:17:00,076
[SPEAKER_09]: So we took this Hike Park or Morrison Park as important nodes.

143
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:19,754
[SPEAKER_09]: also the school, to create two, and this is the reddish areas, two bigger nodes, commercial nodes with higher density, and that is in Parker Street, Salem Street, that is one of the nodes, and the other one is Felsway West at Salem Street.

144
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:40,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So the distinction that we do from that analysis, bringing also the districts that we have worked with in Mystic Avenue, we bring the mixed use one, mixed use two commercial, and we add one new one, which is the multi-unit residential.

145
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:48,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And this works as a transition between the corridor and the existing residential neighborhoods.

146
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:54,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, mixes one, it's very similar as we did for mystic Avenue.

147
00:17:55,631 --> 00:18:03,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The different between mystic Avenue and Salem Street is it's a different character in this quarter, mystic Avenue is very citywide.

148
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:07,525
[SPEAKER_09]: So it should serve the city demands.

149
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Salem Street does not have that.

150
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,389
[SPEAKER_09]: It should not have that capacity.

151
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:21,215
[SPEAKER_09]: This is more a neighborhood corridor, so it will serve the districts and the neighborhoods that are around Salem.

152
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:26,878
[SPEAKER_09]: So the density here is going to be less, and the heights are going to be less.

153
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, Mixuse 3 that we used in Mystic Avenue, we are not going to see it here.

154
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:44,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have mixed use one, this is active ground floor, three stories, and with incentive zoning, we bring that back, we can have four stories maximum.

155
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,967
[SPEAKER_09]: we are talking about a small, medium scale program.

156
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:56,571
[SPEAKER_09]: In this notes that I was talking about that connects with the school and the parks, here we have mixed use too.

157
00:18:56,812 --> 00:19:11,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is active ground floor as well, 75%, four stories, and with incentive zoning, it can go up to six stories with a step back from the third floor.

158
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:17,402
[SPEAKER_09]: In commercial here, this is the bright red, the darker red.

159
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we have a bigger scale commercial.

160
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,484
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exactly what is existing now.

161
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:25,745
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have different development standards than what is there.

162
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:32,907
[SPEAKER_09]: The big target, for example, or the MBTA bus collection storage.

163
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:37,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but we want to have it a bit more density.

164
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we can have from 3 to incentive zoning six maximum.

165
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,495
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really a more commercial program.

166
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, gas station is permitted in this area, and then we have this transition, and this is the new one that we had.

167
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,143
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the multi unit residential, which is maximum three stories.

168
00:19:57,424 --> 00:20:00,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and these are multiple dwelling from 3 to 6 units.

169
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is right now there?

170
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:17,146
[SPEAKER_09]: What we did is, if in these blocks we have a mix of commercial and a mix of residential, we keep it as a mixed use.

171
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:28,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Only the blocks that are entire residential, we maintain it as it is, because we think that that character is part of the identity of the neighborhood.

172
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:29,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to maintain it.

173
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:36,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And at this moment, we don't see the necessity to do a complete commercial.

174
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,200
[SPEAKER_09]: ground floor in the in the corridor.

175
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:47,506
[SPEAKER_09]: So what you see is that we have some commercial, some multifamily already existing.

176
00:20:48,287 --> 00:21:00,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we are doing here is just we do a bit of densify a bit these commercial program and we introduce residential in this area.

177
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:01,736
[SPEAKER_09]: So we expect for a

178
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:08,800
[SPEAKER_09]: very open, active ground floor and then residential on top.

179
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:15,604
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we have prepared is a bit of what is existing there.

180
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:20,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Historical buildings we wanted to be preserved three stories high.

181
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:28,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And for example, gas stations to not have them in the corridor and only have them

182
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,229
[SPEAKER_09]: in the commercial area, so really near Felsway West.

183
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,413
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes a lot more sense.

184
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:38,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

185
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:45,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we have in in a very few meters or feet.

186
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:45,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

187
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:59,882
[SPEAKER_09]: We already encountered three gas stations, so that's something that we would like to avoid in this quarter, especially because we wanted to be more vibrant to be pedestrian focused to be more active.

188
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:00,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

189
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:09,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So in, as you can see, really just a few feet away, we have three gas stations.

190
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:22,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the residential that is already there, two and a half stories high, and also three stories high, that is exactly what we permit in here.

191
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:28,396
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are pretty much staying, and we wanted to keep them.

192
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:36,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Um And then finishing with the most commercial part, which is already As existing.

193
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:38,924
[SPEAKER_09]: This is exactly what is in here.

194
00:22:39,244 --> 00:22:41,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Now what is permitted in these areas?

195
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:46,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this already is the commercial one district.

196
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:48,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and

197
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:52,233
[SPEAKER_09]: It is permitted buildings until six stories high.

198
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could have something like this.

199
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,095
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see in the I don't know if you can see my cursor moving.

200
00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:01,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

201
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:02,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

202
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:03,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, perfect.

203
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:06,478
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and with the

204
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:16,303
[SPEAKER_09]: dimensional standards with these step backs, this cannot happen with the new zoning in the Salem Street corridor.

205
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:23,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But because of what you have at this moment, it could happen, especially in the east part of it.

206
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:30,873
[SPEAKER_09]: It also has the hotel that can go up to 12 stories at the moment as existing.

207
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:39,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so that's something that we want to avoid because we don't see that that can really happen in this.

208
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:49,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one thing that we need to look and that we have looked into is what is existing right now there, what is the character, and another one is what your zoning allows.

209
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we want to make something that makes sense, taking both into account.

210
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:02,429
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that is the introduction.

211
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:09,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm going to let if Madam Chair, if I can ask Emily to present the second part.

212
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:11,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

213
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Please go ahead, Emily.

214
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to ask you to allow me to unmute.

215
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:21,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

216
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:33,380
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to cover the changes to the overall general ordinance, zoning ordinance rather, and then the specific for Salem Street.

217
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,566
[SPEAKER_12]: So really the change to the existing zoning is just to include Salem Street as a district.

218
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:46,791
[SPEAKER_12]: We have already created all of the definitions that we need so far.

219
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:50,474
[SPEAKER_12]: We are continuing to think about one new definition

220
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:52,435
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's not in the current draft.

221
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:59,882
[SPEAKER_12]: We would amend the table of uses, we would amend the table of dimensional standards, and then we would have the zoning for Salem Street itself.

222
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:11,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Before I talk about the specifics though, I do want to continue with the context that Paola was setting in that we got to a geography with Mystic Avenue.

223
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:15,955
[SPEAKER_12]: We had been doing the more general changes at the beginning of the year but

224
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:25,759
[SPEAKER_12]: with the introduction of a geography, we're able to delve into what could be in terms of uses in a corridor.

225
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:29,181
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you think about a corridor and the different pieces of the corridor?

226
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:33,705
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you think about the relationship of the buildings and the building heights along the corridor?

227
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,687
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you think about the development standards?

228
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:40,571
[SPEAKER_12]: And we talked at our last meeting about the idea of

229
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:45,821
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to see some similarities at this point in terms of geography.

230
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:49,305
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we think about quarters, we're going to continue to think about.

231
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:58,789
[SPEAKER_12]: what happens along that entire stretch of the corridor, what happens when we go from what's going on in the corridor into the existing neighborhoods.

232
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:14,344
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to see similar development standards that when we come back at the end of this process, most of those are going to be removed from the individual corridors and put in a single place by themselves where we can refer to them.

233
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:20,549
[SPEAKER_12]: All of this is to say, when you look at the Salem Street zoning, you're going to see that it looks very familiar.

234
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like Mystic Avenue.

235
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:35,163
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's some important considerations, and one is that Mystic Avenue, as Paula said, it's a place that acts as both a citywide draw, perhaps a regional draw.

236
00:26:35,663 --> 00:27:02,963
[SPEAKER_12]: the zoning for mystic avenue is intended to be transformational for the area to take something that has a lot of good pieces to it but along the stretch of that corridor reinforce the idea of a pedestrian friendly more active area but at a higher scale with salem street as pala said we're working with an area that has existing neighborhood where we want to make

237
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:17,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Some enhancements to what's there already based on the function at the two corners at those nodes and we're going to see as we move into next year the idea of sort of neighborhood commercial nodes popping up again.

238
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you look at the zoning, you'll see that there's two color-coded pieces that are important.

239
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:31,105
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first is, and it starts off in the table of use regulations, you're going to see both colors appear.

240
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:41,549
[SPEAKER_12]: The first one is that multi-unit, which is, I think, in an earlier draft, may, depending on which one you've got in front of you, may be referred to as MF as well for

241
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:43,369
[SPEAKER_12]: the old multifamily.

242
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:48,830
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to see yellow and that indicates that this is a brand new district.

243
00:27:48,870 --> 00:28:04,373
[SPEAKER_12]: We are looking at this district for the very first time for Salem Street and this district as Paola said is intended to go from the corridor to be a transition point from the corridor itself into the lower scale of the adjacent neighborhoods.

244
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:11,514
[SPEAKER_12]: The second color you're going to see and this starts on the table of uses but it is throughout the proposed zoning

245
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:13,015
[SPEAKER_12]: is a bright blue.

246
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:21,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And that bright blue you will see in the existing districts, the ones, the mix one, the mix two, the commercial.

247
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:26,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the districts that we introduced in the Mystic Avenue.

248
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:33,477
[SPEAKER_12]: We're bringing them forward to Salem Street, but because Salem Street is a different type of neighborhood, a different corridor,

249
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:45,927
[SPEAKER_12]: lower scale, different mix of uses, those bright blue colors represent a change in Salem Street from the similar district that is in Mystic Avenue.

250
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:55,295
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're able to see with this how we can tailor the districts to be specific to the individual, in this case, corridors.

251
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:59,259
[SPEAKER_12]: When we look at squares, when we look at neighborhoods, you're going to see the same sort of thing.

252
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:09,210
[SPEAKER_12]: In many cases, what we're doing in this is in the multi-unit district, it's really all residential.

253
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:20,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're prohibiting a number of the uses that are commercial or industrial and really focusing on the residential or the municipal.

254
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:46,420
[SPEAKER_12]: um in the case so that's all the yellow in the case of the blue uses what we're doing is we're removing the industrial uses we're removing the adult uses that are only found in the commercial district in the mystic avenue we're removing paola mentioned the gas stations we're removing um uh the motor vehicle service sales etc from the commercial uses so

255
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,202
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of change to the commercial uses in Salem Street Corridor.

256
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:54,443
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little bit of a change to the Mix 2 uses.

257
00:29:54,943 --> 00:30:03,846
[SPEAKER_12]: We're removing the light manufacturing, the life science, the food production facility from the Mix 2 because those are less appropriate for Salem Street.

258
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:11,168
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing you'll see as you look through the zoning is the same thing is true of the dimensional standards.

259
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:15,969
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're adding the multi-unit, the dimensional standards for that.

260
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:27,951
[SPEAKER_12]: If you remember the non-conforming uses that we looked at or the non-conforming analyses we looked at, we're trying to represent or to build on what's there as much as possible.

261
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:32,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So making the things that are non-conforming under your current zoning,

262
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:37,093
[SPEAKER_12]: conforming so that people don't have to go for as many variances.

263
00:30:37,173 --> 00:30:40,554
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's the ability to reinvest in the existing properties.

264
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:57,500
[SPEAKER_12]: We're being very respectful of the maximum or the existing heights in the multi-unit and to many extent in the mix one and then on those nodes which are mixed to or mixed to adjacent to commercial going a little bit higher and deeper.

265
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:13,924
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll see again with the standards and almost done on this and with the incentives that they're very close to what you're looking at for Mystic Avenue but might be applied in a little bit of a different way.

266
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:27,328
[SPEAKER_12]: In some of the discussions we've had about Mystic Avenue where we've made some changes to the development standards or the incentives, we've already gone ahead and incorporated those changes into the drafts for Salem as we go.

267
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:36,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Eventually, those sections are going to be standalone sections of the zoning ordinance and will modify Mystic, Salem, and any other corridor to point to them.

268
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:43,474
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's the overall outline, the differences between the two that I really wanted to call out for you.

269
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:52,957
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy, I know Paola is also happy to answer any questions that you may have, but I also want to be respectful of your time because I know you have the 7 o'clock meeting

270
00:31:56,633 --> 00:32:07,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Emily and Paola for that overview really appreciate that appreciate you know the I was appreciate getting walked through the zoning proposals even reading them ahead of time.

271
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:11,466
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the same as having a professional zoning planner.

272
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:15,864
[SPEAKER_14]: define what we're looking at for me.

273
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:38,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate that, and especially since we've gone through the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning proposal already, I appreciate kind of the heads up about what we'll see in those sub-districts, where the sub-districts have the same name, but what they mean in Salem Street will be a little bit different, or maybe a lot different than what they mean for Mystic Ave, because Mystic Ave and Salem Street are so different, and what we want to do in those two districts is very different.

274
00:32:38,735 --> 00:32:44,580
[SPEAKER_14]: responsive to, you know, what they are and what they represent in the community and what people do there and what the neighbors want there.

275
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:51,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you so much for for calling that out kind of at the beginning of this conversation.

276
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:56,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we've had some time to look over this.

277
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:01,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, you know, for me, what stands out to me from the presentation so far is

278
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:10,632
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when I was looking at this prior to the presentation, looking at, you know, where do we have mixed one?

279
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do we have mixed two?

280
00:33:12,693 --> 00:33:14,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do we have commercial and why?

281
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:25,261
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a lot of sense to me to cluster mixed use close to those intersections that are already, you see a lot of foot traffic, you see a lot of all kinds of traffic.

282
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:27,402
[SPEAKER_14]: There's already really thriving businesses there.

283
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:31,845
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to enhance that thriving business character at those places.

284
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:39,690
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really appreciated seeing that some blocks are left mixed use one, we can keep that concentration on residential.

285
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:46,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciated kind of the thoughtfulness with first defining, you know, Salem Street is a really big neighborhood.

286
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:51,117
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not talking about Reno re sorry we're not talking about rezoning the neighborhood here.

287
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:55,180
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about rezoning this quarter so I appreciate the thought that was given to.

288
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:05,928
[SPEAKER_14]: How many parcels, you know, north and south of Salem are we really talking about when it comes to those key intersections what should be at those intersections and when does it taper off back into residential.

289
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:19,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And then what I think is really key and I think something that's really bothered a lot of residents for a lot of time is, what do we need to do to make Haines Square, more we want it to be and start using those big parcels in a way that will be more, more of an advantage.

290
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:25,662
[SPEAKER_14]: for the folks who live around there and shop there and just want to see more for the community in that space.

291
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:39,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, appreciate the thoughtfulness to the existing character, existing heights and trying to update the zoning to enhance the existing residential business character and make it more of what we want.

292
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:43,733
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go now to comments and questions from the City Council.

293
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:44,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

294
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,335
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do public presentation at the end.

295
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:46,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

296
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:49,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Comments from fellow city councilors.

297
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

298
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:56,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

299
00:34:59,344 --> 00:34:59,784
[SPEAKER_14]: President Paris.

300
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:02,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it do it?

301
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:29,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

302
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:38,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to say that I think this is a really great start to this proposal.

303
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:47,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate its responsiveness to the city's comprehensive plan and the thousands of residents who participated in that process.

304
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,771
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also just appreciate the thoughtful presentation from Innis Associates.

305
00:35:51,811 --> 00:36:10,302
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're looking at is an enhancement to the area to make it what we want it to be, which is more walkable, bring commercial in, and just make it a place for the neighborhood instead of just the cut through that many people experience it as now.

306
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:11,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really want to note

307
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:16,657
[SPEAKER_00]: the comment about the sprinkling of gas stations.

308
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:29,584
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not only is that from like a design perspective and an experience perspective, not great, but we've had a lot of problems with those stations over the years as a community being not great neighbors.

309
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to note.

310
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:40,711
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also going to see this become high frequency transit corridor with the T96 coming soon every 15 minutes.

311
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to, I think,

312
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:50,459
[SPEAKER_00]: really respond to that and make this a really improve some of the outstanding issues with the existing zoning.

313
00:36:50,959 --> 00:37:07,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Innis Associates for noting the residential blocks remaining residential, keeping historic buildings, as well as noting like the serious loopholes in the existing zoning that would allow like a 12-story hotel right now, which I think

314
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,350
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us, nobody wants that here.

315
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:20,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So correcting this to match more of the community character and identity while also enhancing it in exactly the ways that we want it to was the goal of the comprehensive plan.

316
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be the content of this draft.

317
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,795
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to discussing this next week.

318
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:34,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just want to thank the chair for working with the administration on the outreach plan, both for this meeting and for the meetings in the upcoming six month period.

319
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:35,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

320
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you so much, President Bears.

321
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll move up here so I can actually see my colleagues.

322
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:48,131
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go now to Councilor Scarpelli.

323
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:48,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I do it right this time?

324
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:55,957
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I did not.

325
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:56,518
[SPEAKER_14]: You're number eight.

326
00:37:56,558 --> 00:37:57,078
[SPEAKER_14]: My apologies.

327
00:37:57,098 --> 00:38:01,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

328
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate all your hard work.

329
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that presentation was great.

330
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:12,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I'm going to be the person that people call because they're nervous about what they hear.

331
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:23,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's good is that we're having meetings so we can express the rumors.

332
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that they're

333
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,302
[SPEAKER_03]: being permitted, we're going to look at zoning for 12 stories.

334
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to see that's not going to happen on Salem Street.

335
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:39,087
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate all your hard work with that and making sure that that message is out.

336
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that when we talk to residents from that corridor, the biggest concern they have, not just the people on the main drag, but on the budding streets, is making sure that we have parking, making sure that they're seeing different

337
00:38:55,802 --> 00:39:00,984
[SPEAKER_03]: different processes that are happening that are taking parking away from a business district.

338
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:19,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things there, you know, the business owners that I've talked to this weekend, they were really concerned about that because they're all small businesses and it's very important that, although we can hope that it's just gonna be a walkable transit, public transit corridor,

339
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:23,287
[SPEAKER_03]: the truth of the matter is that's not necessarily true.

340
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:46,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So having an open mind when we look at what the total community looks for, I appreciate my colleagues doing a better job, I think, and getting the word out, but I will share with you that there is still the need to put that comprehensive plan that we asked for in the RFP to go into the Salem Street neighborhood and have those neighbors that can't come here or join us on Zoom

341
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:50,312
[SPEAKER_03]: that want to really get involved and understand what happens in that quarter.

342
00:39:51,773 --> 00:40:11,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that you're seeing this, you're seeing fractions of the community right now where neighborhoods are rallying and creating neighborhood groups and getting attorneys and fighting zoning everywhere because the truth of the matter is there isn't enough, there is enough information that's out there.

343
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:15,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to say that there are people getting it,

344
00:40:16,411 --> 00:40:18,932
[SPEAKER_03]: there are a lot of people that aren't getting information on what's happening.

345
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:28,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I try to do my best and I'll share this information for the people that have reached out to me and said, George, we're concerned 12 stories on Salem Street.

346
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:29,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is easy.

347
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:32,016
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as 12 stories on Salem Street.

348
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:43,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but you know, it's nice to see that looking at pieces like the MBTA area where maybe redeveloping that area where

349
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:50,211
[SPEAKER_03]: it made Salem Street look like such an eyesore as a, you know, gateway to our community.

350
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:53,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that that's when you see successful zoning changes.

351
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You see neighbor communities really using the gateway.

352
00:40:57,476 --> 00:40:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So the communities is really enhancing that.

353
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:10,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we have some limitations for businesses that are there, but I'm glad to see that we're looking at, you know,

354
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:14,637
[SPEAKER_03]: being responsible to our neighbors and our residents.

355
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:22,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited to see a change on Salem Street where we have mixed-use areas and we're seeing more storefronts.

356
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:32,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing more families walking that corridor and looking at, you know, having little pockets of, you know, sitting areas with fountains and, you know, but I think that

357
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:39,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that we've seen it, and we know all the hard work that we put forward with this, is that really getting the true message out.

358
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:51,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I'm saying, because I'm saying that, you know, in other situations that we're seeing in the community, where there is concerns that they're going to an extreme, you're seeing some pretty extreme things happening.

359
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:59,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is so good and so new that I think we really have to find other avenues to reach

360
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:03,044
[SPEAKER_03]: more of our residents in that area.

361
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:06,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever we have to do, I know that, you know, I know Ms.

362
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Hunt you've explained and it's tough that other communities have big, big departments and we have a small department.

363
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:13,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

364
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:27,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why when we talked with the last council, we really stressed the fact that no matter what it took in the mayor's office for the city to put that into the RFP where our zoning partners can come in and bring teams in just like neighboring communities have done.

365
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:31,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, as we're moving forward, I love the clarity.

366
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it, but I think that there are a lot of people that don't see it.

367
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the biggest concern right now.

368
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:41,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's great if everybody rallies around this.

369
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes everything a lot smoother, believe me.

370
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:47,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate your work, so thank you.

371
00:42:49,673 --> 00:42:50,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Councilor Scarpelli.

372
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:52,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go to you next, Councilor Callahan.

373
00:42:53,634 --> 00:43:06,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's words, you know, really appreciate the collaboration to bring this out to the community and to kind of bring in all of the public engagement that's been done over the past several years into this process.

374
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's tough, you know, I think with every project that we do, it's like,

375
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,762
[SPEAKER_14]: that does involve collaboration with the public.

376
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:20,165
[SPEAKER_14]: There's always part of me that's like, no, it's really, let's take five years to do, let's take 10 years.

377
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:23,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk to everyone, let's canvas the neighborhood, talk to every single person.

378
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:26,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, this contract does not cover that.

379
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:31,273
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was taking some time to re-read over the RFP as I was looking over the presentation this past weekend.

380
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,835
[SPEAKER_14]: We know what we do have your support for.

381
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:43,264
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a new comprehensive plan for Salem Street, but we do have this bringing in what we know from the comprehensive plan of the three years that it took to put that together into this proposal.

382
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:51,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that in the RFP it mentioned as well, you know, a workshop in City Hall dealing with the neighborhood and we had kind of a

383
00:43:52,613 --> 00:44:03,781
[SPEAKER_14]: One version of that a few months ago with the zoning workshop before we got into the corridors in the neighborhoods and supplementing that with, you know, online meetings for the public for the benefit of the public, bringing the public into these meetings.

384
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:14,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know for myself as one Councilor, I've been really glad that Steve from the mayor's office was able to help us out with shoring up our communication strategy to make sure that we're using the robocalls to get this out over more channels.

385
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:21,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also going to hold myself accountable to do what I can on my own personal Councilor communication channels to make sure this tries to reach

386
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:35,721
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody that it can, and to keep doing that with every neighborhood and corridor that we do discuss over the next six months so really appreciate those comments and you know, let's do it we can behind the rail to supplement these coordinated public engagement strategies.

387
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:37,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for indulging me.

388
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:41,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

389
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:54,274
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, looking at this over the weekend with some of my volunteers like going like going through Google Maps and doing street view and looking very specifically like at an individual blocks like it's it's really impressive.

390
00:44:54,915 --> 00:45:03,019
[SPEAKER_06]: What you've done to sort of preserve the neighborhood as well as really help us get to the point where we are able to develop in a way that.

391
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,865
[SPEAKER_06]: that just amplifies what we have and doesn't overdo it.

392
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:10,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really appreciate your attention to detail.

393
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:19,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have one very tiny question that is sort of not specifically related to Salem Street Corridor.

394
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:41,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I'm curious because I noticed that there is co-living that is allowed, and I noticed this also in the Mystic Ave when it came through City Council to go to CDB, that co-living was disallowed on Mystic Ave, and here there's places where multiple dwelling is allowed and yet co-living is not allowed, like in Mixed Use 1 and Mixed Use 2.

395
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:59,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and perhaps this is a conversation I can have with someone, you know, maybe after the meeting, but, um, to, like, my understanding of co-living is that it is explicitly making it okay for people who are not related by family, um, to rent together.

396
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:04,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would be curious as to why we would have rental properties where that was disallowed.

397
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:09,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I, that's, maybe there's some nuance that I'm not understanding, um, and if,

398
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,528
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about it after is more appropriate, that's totally fine.

399
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was curious about that small detail.

400
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:17,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

401
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:25,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Chair, I can answer that or speak to that with your permission.

402
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for bringing that up.

403
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:33,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, Paula and I of course went back and forth on all uses.

404
00:46:33,912 --> 00:46:35,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going back and forth on co-living.

405
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:48,561
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we had been, or particularly I had been, don't want to pull Pamela in on this one, she may disagree, but I had been thinking of it more as people doing that within a single building.

406
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:58,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the scale of the Mix 1 and the Mix 2 was a little bit too large to allow for that, possibly on the Mix 1.

407
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:16,687
[SPEAKER_12]: If you and I are thinking about the definition of co-living in a slightly different way, I'd be happy to chat with you offline about that and make sure the definition is tweaked to get closer to your idea of how that would be.

408
00:47:16,707 --> 00:47:22,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I had been thinking of it as a building in which people were sharing common

409
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:30,083
[SPEAKER_12]: common spaces, common kitchens, and either bedrooms or smaller units.

410
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:35,125
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be that the way I was visualizing it did not match with the way you were visualizing it.

411
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,407
[SPEAKER_12]: So more than happy to discuss that offline.

412
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:39,388
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we have to make a tweak, we can do that.

413
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:48,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

414
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:49,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much.

415
00:47:49,189 --> 00:47:51,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I think talking afterwards is probably appropriate.

416
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:53,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just say co-housing.

417
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:55,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what I think co-housing is.

418
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:58,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think co-living, according to the definition that we wrote, is a little bit different.

419
00:47:58,073 --> 00:48:00,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about it after the meeting.

420
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:00,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

421
00:48:01,074 --> 00:48:01,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds perfect.

422
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:03,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

423
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:04,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Emily.

424
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:04,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Hillion.

425
00:48:05,176 --> 00:48:07,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, did you have a direct response to that?

426
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:08,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

427
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:10,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'll go to you, President Bears.

428
00:48:12,244 --> 00:48:19,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted two things is to, I'd like to join you guys to discuss it offline to knock out the details on it.

429
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:24,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we need to look at, I both wanted to flag for everybody.

430
00:48:24,912 --> 00:48:32,213
[SPEAKER_11]: that there is no change to parking ratios to any of this as to what we've had in park in the city throughout.

431
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:38,795
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were to do that, it would be a different meeting, it would be a different study, and it would be different noticing.

432
00:48:39,175 --> 00:48:42,475
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want anybody to think that we're doing anything with that.

433
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:48,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But that said, we need to look at, we have to fix the parking for congregate housing.

434
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:50,697
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not correct.

435
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:59,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do want to go through that and make sure that we have the right parking for the new housing types we have included.

436
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:08,693
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was one or two places where if anybody does look at this for parking with a fine-tooth comb, there was a typo of a Y in the parking column a few times.

437
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,714
[SPEAKER_11]: We just need to go back and clean those up.

438
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:13,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just, I'm making a note of some of those tonight.

439
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:16,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.

440
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:18,799
[SPEAKER_14]: President Bears, go ahead.

441
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

442
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:40,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to note also that when we redid the zoning with Mark Hrabowski, probably most of these discussions were two terms ago.

443
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:48,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court decisions don't allow like there were like family restrictions on renting units.

444
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:52,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are illegal and were removed like for three years ago.

445
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:54,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So those aren't in the zoning anymore.

446
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:59,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just also wanted to know, in terms of next steps on this proposal.

447
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we'll be coming back next week and having the meeting here.

448
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:11,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this will be referred to a council meeting to then be referred to a community development board meeting to then be referred back to a final council meeting.

449
00:50:11,903 --> 00:50:21,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be three public hearings after the public meeting next week, in addition to the meeting next week, although next week is a great opportunity for discussion.

450
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:22,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

451
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:24,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

452
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:26,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, President Bears.

453
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:27,486
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I think it's,

454
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:51,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I think to the extent that we can, you know, as soon as there are questions and comments, whether it's from Councilors, as we continue to look through the draft, as we look through the updated amended draft that we'll see next week, and as soon as there are questions and comments from constituents, whether it's at this meeting next Wednesday, in between the two, you want to contact any of the Councilors or myself as chair, and I can certainly

455
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,110
[SPEAKER_14]: ferry questions along to NS associates or the planning team.

456
00:50:55,171 --> 00:51:01,815
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's very okay and good to front loads those questions as much as possible so that they can be considered and incorporated earlier in the process.

457
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:11,843
[SPEAKER_14]: But the great thing about amending the zoning ordinance is that procedurally we have to have so many meetings on it, even after it gets referred out of committee where we'll have lots of like in the weeds conversations like this.

458
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,624
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for reminding us all about all the steps that come after this.

459
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:31,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So speaking of next steps in terms of potential changes that might be made on the zoning consultant side for next week, I heard that there's going to be some typos in the parking table that might be tweaked.

460
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:40,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we expect to see a more finalized version of the inclusion and the incentive zoning that might apply to next use one and two by next week as well?

461
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:41,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is that going to come later?

462
00:51:44,459 --> 00:52:13,264
[SPEAKER_12]: uh with your permission madam chair the incentive zoning i believe the last draft has been um updated to match what's in mystic avenue at this point we'll double check um but if it's if it's so if it's not updated to match that then we will fix that and send it over but if they're the same i think we'll leave it as is for discussion purposes and then can always review it afterwards okay great thank you for confirming

463
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:15,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

464
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:29,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So next week we can expect more discussion on this proposal to stay more finessed and some typos removed version of this Salem Street zoning proposal and that's next Wednesday 6pm our regular meeting time for this planning and permitting committee.

465
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:34,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to go to public participation unless there are any more questions or comments from councillors at this time.

466
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:44,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, we can start in person then I'll go on zoom so you can just walk up and form a line behind microphone and everybody has three minutes.

467
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:47,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

468
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:51,168
[SPEAKER_02]: My first name and address for the record, please.

469
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:53,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Lori 55 Garfield Avenue.

470
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:56,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm two doors in from Salem Street.

471
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:01,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to see any rezoning done on Salem Street at all.

472
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:04,920
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a hugely residential area.

473
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:18,947
[SPEAKER_13]: We have businesses, as Scarpelli said, that are struggling down in Haines Square because it's the one square that has not been kept up throughout my lifetime in Medford.

474
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:22,461
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking that there's no parking.

475
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:26,648
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking about communal living on Salem Street.

476
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:34,121
[SPEAKER_13]: What is that gonna do to our residential and our home values by doing all of that?

477
00:53:35,663 --> 00:53:41,788
[SPEAKER_13]: What's gonna happen to our backyards that we will no longer have sunshine because of stories high?

478
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:49,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And where did you come to the conclusion that Mystic Ave and Salem Street are corridors?

479
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:57,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see Mystic Ave because it is basically commercial zoning, but Salem Street is a residential district.

480
00:53:59,463 --> 00:54:01,145
[SPEAKER_13]: What about High Street corridor?

481
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:07,213
[SPEAKER_13]: You go right to a commuter rail down there if it's all about transportation.

482
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:27,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's many people who used to take a bus into Boston that got canceled at COVID, both in West Medford and off of Salem Street, which I might add was part of the big, deep contract because of our car bonds on Salem Street.

483
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,504
[SPEAKER_13]: And you took them away, why?

484
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:32,305
[SPEAKER_13]: For bike lanes that aren't even being used.

485
00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:36,679
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, now the traffic on Salem Street is tenfold.

486
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:45,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been in my house there 27 years and watched the traffic just every year get more and more and more.

487
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:50,826
[SPEAKER_13]: The last thing we need is to go up any stories on Salem Street.

488
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:53,307
[SPEAKER_13]: And at what point are you going to do this?

489
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:55,568
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole length of Salem Street?

490
00:54:59,805 --> 00:55:00,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your comments.

491
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to go point by point.

492
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:05,127
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you putting this all on the record.

493
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:17,653
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say, if you want to have a really close look at where certain heights are enabled and where other heights are enabled, the proposal that the consultant showed on the screen, that's available on the city council.

494
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:22,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, unfortunately, most of us work, so we can't get here for a six o'clock meeting.

495
00:55:22,475 --> 00:55:22,715
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

496
00:55:22,755 --> 00:55:23,896
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can go on your own time.

497
00:55:23,936 --> 00:55:26,418
[SPEAKER_14]: You can pull it up and you can take a really fine tooth comb and look at it.

498
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:31,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I will just say, I know that a lot of the potential heights, minimum heights, maximum heights are based on the heights that are already present.

499
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:39,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried to download all those documents while I was in work before I headed out and I got an error message every single time.

500
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:39,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.

501
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:42,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'd say this, feel free to send me an email.

502
00:55:42,768 --> 00:55:45,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I will download them and send them right back to you so that you can take a look.

503
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:50,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is Salem Street being considered a corridor?

504
00:55:52,412 --> 00:56:03,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that is because it's... Was it something that the residents in that area wanted, asked for?

505
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:14,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to go back and forth with you with the people who are waiting, but I will just say I think Salem Street matches the characteristics of other parts of the city that have this mix of residential, thriving businesses.

506
00:56:14,615 --> 00:56:15,735
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a main thoroughfare.

507
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:22,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of care is being taken to make sure that it preserves its residential character while supporting businesses and businesses that want to take root on that corridor.

508
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:31,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, if you go and talk to some of the businesses on Salem Street, what you have done already has made a mess of Salem Street.

509
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:40,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just a matter of time that someone's going to get hit and killed on Salem Street because of the major traffic that's going down there now.

510
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:46,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And the whole cluster of what you did down in Haines Square down by the bank area.

511
00:56:47,026 --> 00:56:47,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.

512
00:56:47,786 --> 00:56:48,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for your comments.

513
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:49,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

514
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:50,467
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to go to the next person now.

515
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:51,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

516
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:52,768
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

517
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:55,129
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to switch between podium and Zoom.

518
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:55,930
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for waiting.

519
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,031
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go first to Dave on Zoom.

520
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:00,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

521
00:57:04,107 --> 00:57:04,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, thank you.

522
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:13,177
[SPEAKER_08]: David McKenna I live at two vine street which is on the western edge of the map that we're looking at.

523
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:20,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really excited to see new development on Salem Street we desperately need more housing.

524
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:24,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm excited that, you know, this does allow for more housing.

525
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:26,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have to.

526
00:57:27,412 --> 00:57:29,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions, I don't know if they can be answered now.

527
00:57:30,716 --> 00:57:34,842
[SPEAKER_08]: The first was what does it take to get the incentive zoning.

528
00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:43,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And the second is the dark red part of the map where there's the target and it's zoned commercial.

529
00:57:44,557 --> 00:57:52,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Would any housing be allowed to be built on top of the commercial in that district in the present scenario?

530
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:57,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And if not, you know, I would advocate, you know, for that to allow housing on that.

531
00:57:57,901 --> 00:57:59,002
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very large parcel.

532
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:00,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

533
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:08,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you, Dave Peller Emily, could you quickly speak to the characteristics of the commercial if there's any.

534
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:13,654
[SPEAKER_14]: residential involved in commercial sub district in Salem.

535
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:28,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Chair, I have been answering the questions, but I'm going to just briefly interrupt for Paola who jumped up to say, I am transferring all answering of questions now over to Paola and my apologies, I have a planning board meeting that I have to jump to.

536
00:58:28,794 --> 00:58:33,856
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for the chance to be in front of you and I look forward to the discussion next week.

537
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:37,316
[SPEAKER_12]: pilot lawyers.

538
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:38,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

539
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:45,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so at the moment, we in in the commercial, we do not allow the residential.

540
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:56,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I'm open to research that and to talk to this week with the city staff if that is possible.

541
00:58:58,749 --> 00:58:58,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

542
00:58:59,149 --> 00:58:59,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Paula.

543
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:05,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And Dave, to your first question, I think that the incentive zoning, I believe, is already drafted.

544
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,491
[SPEAKER_14]: That was part of the Mystic Avenue corridor proposal.

545
00:59:07,531 --> 00:59:09,951
[SPEAKER_14]: So it looks like that's going to look pretty much the same.

546
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:13,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the characteristics-wise, it's just what that minimum and maximum height would be.

547
00:59:13,532 --> 00:59:14,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

548
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:22,494
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to see the incentive zoning, if you look at the agenda for this meeting tonight and you scroll through, it's 21 pages long.

549
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:24,674
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a table in the middle of it.

550
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:26,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And that table is the incentive zoning.

551
00:59:29,824 --> 00:59:30,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Page 15 and 16.

552
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:34,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it's about affordability.

553
00:59:34,706 --> 00:59:48,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, incentive zoning is if that development gives something back to the community, and in that table, it sets what they need to give, then you can build more density.

554
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:50,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, you have more height.

555
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:52,854
[SPEAKER_09]: You're allowed to have more height.

556
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:53,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you, Paolo.

557
00:59:53,974 --> 01:00:07,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, in short, it's kind of that exchange between what we're willing to say, hey, ordinarily you can't do this, but if you provide this great community benefit that we've decided is highly valuable and residents really want, then you're able to do a little bit more than developers ordinarily can.

558
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:13,881
[SPEAKER_14]: That's incentive zoning in a nutshell, and page 15 and 16 of tonight's agenda, if you want to take a closer look.

559
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:16,488
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go now to the podium.

560
01:00:16,528 --> 01:00:17,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

561
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:19,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette Vardabedian, Central Lab.

562
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:22,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I have just a couple of questions.

563
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:24,274
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, I want to say thank you, Paola.

564
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:27,116
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a really detailed well report.

565
01:00:27,497 --> 01:00:32,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, Zach, for saying no hotels on Salem Street, because it is inappropriate.

566
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have enough hotels in Medford.

567
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:40,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, George, for saying no 12-story buildings in Salem Street, because that is inappropriate as well.

568
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:48,677
[SPEAKER_07]: On the commercial side of Salem Street, where the Dunkin' Donuts is and things like that, there are several three-story buildings and such.

569
01:00:48,757 --> 01:00:51,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So my opinion is that would be OK.

570
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as four stories and up, I don't think that is appropriate in that area.

571
01:00:56,645 --> 01:01:04,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a question for Ann or something maybe to clarify afterwards about the living spaces, what you were talking about.

572
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:05,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really understand what that's going to be.

573
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:09,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that going to be like rooming house type things?

574
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be totally inappropriate.

575
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:16,472
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that is a major concern for me is the traffic.

576
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:19,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Has a traffic study been done on Salem Street?

577
01:01:20,703 --> 01:01:29,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Central Ave is parallel one block in from Salem Street, and they already use Central Ave as a cut-through street.

578
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:38,510
[SPEAKER_07]: In the past, there's been major accidents on the corners of Otis and Central, Dudley and Central.

579
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's four-way stops.

580
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:44,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I complained numerous times because no one stops, or I shouldn't say no one,

581
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:47,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Many, many people don't stop.

582
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:51,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So I requested to have the flashing yellow lights.

583
01:01:51,844 --> 01:01:53,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's a different discussion.

584
01:01:53,525 --> 01:02:05,355
[SPEAKER_07]: But my concern is that with the increased housing, which may or may not be needed, that it's going to increase the already overflowing traffic on Salem Street.

585
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,218
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nightmare to get out onto Salem Street.

586
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:13,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to really affect the traffic on Central Avenue.

587
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:18,157
[SPEAKER_07]: has a traffic study been done, and if so, it should be and when.

588
01:02:18,558 --> 01:02:18,938
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

589
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

590
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your comments.

591
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:22,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.

592
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:27,266
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to toggle back to Zoom.

593
01:02:29,848 --> 01:02:31,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Rebecca, name and address for the record.

594
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,651
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three minutes.

595
01:02:32,691 --> 01:02:32,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

596
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:36,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

597
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebecca Davidson, 101 Yeomans Ave.

598
01:02:40,075 --> 01:02:43,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a resident of this area.

599
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:51,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Medford in the hillside area, but have loved living in this area and plan to stay for many years to come.

600
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:55,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that the plan that was presented tonight really reflects

601
01:02:56,392 --> 01:03:03,037
[SPEAKER_01]: The great parts of the area and this plan builds upon those and also speaks to the potential in the neighborhood.

602
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:11,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that this plan will really improve walkability, which is incredibly important to me and something that I really appreciate about the area already.

603
01:03:12,425 --> 01:03:17,570
[SPEAKER_01]: The plan will increase the amount of housing, which is something that we desperately need in Medford.

604
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:23,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that a lot of the, a lot of the improvements that have already been made in the area.

605
01:03:23,957 --> 01:03:30,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to see more investment and more attention placed because I feel like there is a tremendous amount of potential.

606
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:32,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed the bike lanes.

607
01:03:33,006 --> 01:03:35,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're an important feature for Salem Street.

608
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:40,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that the plan speaks to the gas stations.

609
01:03:40,968 --> 01:03:49,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we don't need so many gas stations in such a small area, so I appreciated that there was some thoughtfulness put into that piece.

610
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:58,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say speaking to what other residents have also brought up that traffic calming measures are absolutely needed along Salem Street.

611
01:03:59,238 --> 01:04:10,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that was within the purview of this particular plan, but I will say that that's something that we desperately need and I look forward to conversations where we can talk about that.

612
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:17,289
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully have better signage and things that will lead to traffic calming in the area.

613
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:23,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall, very supportive of the plan and looking forward to seeing these changes come to fruition.

614
01:04:23,351 --> 01:04:23,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

615
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:27,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

616
01:04:27,253 --> 01:04:28,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your comments, Rebecca.

617
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:29,753
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll now return to the podium.

618
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:31,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

619
01:04:31,074 --> 01:04:31,614
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three minutes.

620
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Matarazzo, 25 Barber Lane.

621
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:42,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to applaud the council and the planning team in moving forward with amendments to Salem Street and this corridor.

622
01:04:42,164 --> 01:04:48,466
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really consistent with the comprehensive plan, visions of the community, its opportunities to increase housing,

623
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:49,026
[SPEAKER_04]: the city.

624
01:04:49,046 --> 01:04:56,428
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to continue to support our targeted new commercial development as well as provide a level of predictability for future investment in this square.

625
01:04:56,528 --> 01:05:02,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a resident of the city, I applaud the efforts of City Council and City staff.

626
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

627
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for your comments.

628
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:08,331
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go down back to zoom.

629
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:17,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any more?

630
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:18,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's back up.

631
01:05:19,068 --> 01:05:19,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Spoke too soon.

632
01:05:19,908 --> 01:05:21,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Jennifer, name and address for the record.

633
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:22,389
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three minutes.

634
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

635
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

636
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Jen Sullivan, 35 Washington Street.

637
01:05:29,352 --> 01:05:32,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebecca basically stole my thunder and said everything I was thinking.

638
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:42,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I, too, grew up in the hillside and recently purchased a condo in this area, the area that we're talking about tonight.

639
01:05:42,617 --> 01:05:44,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to say I second everything that she said.

640
01:05:44,617 --> 01:05:45,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking forward to

641
01:05:46,886 --> 01:05:49,730
[SPEAKER_10]: some changes in an area that has so much potential.

642
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:57,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate the work put into it and that we have some time to digest it after tonight and then come back and have another conversation.

643
01:05:57,382 --> 01:05:59,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you everybody that's involved.

644
01:06:02,165 --> 01:06:03,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for your comments.

645
01:06:03,465 --> 01:06:04,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Director Hunt, go ahead.

646
01:06:04,846 --> 01:06:05,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

647
01:06:05,906 --> 01:06:15,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to sort of add one thing that kind of addresses some of the stuff that we've heard tonight, that when I talk, I have been talking to people about the need for changing the zoning in the city.

648
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:27,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Salem Street's been one of my examples, because if you look at our current zoning right now, that neighborhood node at Park Street, the commercial stuff that's going on, all of it from 93

649
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:34,867
[SPEAKER_11]: up basically to Fiore d'Italia, just shy of Hanes Square, isn't actually allowed by our current zoning.

650
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:39,710
[SPEAKER_11]: And the multifamily buildings are absolutely allowed.

651
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:45,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in this area, three to six story, three story buildings are absolutely allowed, possibly six, I'd have to check.

652
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:55,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what we're trying to do is allow the commercial where it exists and we love it, not add it to the parts

653
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,847
[SPEAKER_11]: that don't have commercial right now.

654
01:06:57,948 --> 01:06:59,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep those as residential.

655
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,580
[SPEAKER_11]: but allow three family houses.

656
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know that there are three family houses are not allowed in our zoning in Medford right now?

657
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:11,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So sort of allowing a little bit like that and then having a real commercial note at the end.

658
01:07:11,186 --> 01:07:18,510
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just kind of wanted to bring that out is that a lot of these changes to the zoning are not changes to the street.

659
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:24,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's really helpful for people to understand just because it feels like it's a big change.

660
01:07:24,653 --> 01:07:27,135
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you say like, actually it's allowing

661
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:36,942
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much that's there that people come in and say, Oh, I'd like to put in a ground floor commercial and two apartments on top and we have to say that's not allowed you have to go to the zoning board for permission.

662
01:07:37,322 --> 01:07:38,723
[SPEAKER_11]: That just doesn't make any sense.

663
01:07:39,364 --> 01:07:48,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to make sure people heard that, and you can send comments to our office all week on comments received before Thursday are greatly appreciated.

664
01:07:49,051 --> 01:07:57,843
[SPEAKER_11]: because we're going to have a new final version in front or another version in front of the city council on Friday, preferably Thursday for your packets.

665
01:07:57,863 --> 01:08:03,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And that way we can incorporate things that we hear between now and then into it.

666
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:04,693
[SPEAKER_11]: So, great.

667
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:07,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Alicia, and thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.

668
01:08:07,892 --> 01:08:08,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a great reminder.

669
01:08:08,972 --> 01:08:24,018
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's something that I remind myself throughout this process, even though we've been talking in quite a lot of depth about zoning, you know, for more than a full calendar year now, is that zoning is counterintuitive because it seems like we're talking about what's going to happen when we're talking about what's going to be allowed.

670
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:31,781
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think Salem Street is a really great example, and there are examples all over Medford, but it's a great example of where what is currently there

671
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:44,785
[SPEAKER_14]: might be allowed under our current zoning, or maybe not, and we're having a conversation about what that's currently there, do we still want to be allowed, and we're done with this, but we'd not want to be allowed, like, I think there's broad consensus against the 12-story hotel, I think.

672
01:08:45,305 --> 01:08:46,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody's in favor of that.

673
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:56,388
[SPEAKER_14]: And what do we want to be allowed that isn't allowed currently, so that the businesses are there, are even more thriving, that the residences are there, it's an even cozier neighborhood for the folks that live there.

674
01:08:57,989 --> 01:08:58,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan.

675
01:09:02,145 --> 01:09:02,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

676
01:09:02,665 --> 01:09:06,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one incredibly short for anyone who heard us talk about co-living.

677
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I want people to be reassured.

678
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:15,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-living literally does not mean anything outside of a normal rental apartment being rented by people who are not related to each other.

679
01:09:15,754 --> 01:09:16,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's literally it.

680
01:09:16,574 --> 01:09:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not congregate housing.

681
01:09:18,055 --> 01:09:19,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not any of those things.

682
01:09:19,376 --> 01:09:20,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredibly simple.

683
01:09:20,637 --> 01:09:22,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really adding nothing.

684
01:09:23,099 --> 01:09:28,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want me to explain to you why we are putting it in the zoning, I'm happy to explain.

685
01:09:28,482 --> 01:09:31,504
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, why we're trying to differentiate between that and other kinds of housing.

686
01:09:31,524 --> 01:09:36,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's nothing changing, nothing new in that particular definition.

687
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:36,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

688
01:09:37,428 --> 01:09:39,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for that clarification, Councilor Galleon.

689
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:48,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing no further public participation on Zoom or in person and no further questions or comments from Councilors, we do have a regular meeting to get started.

690
01:09:48,735 --> 01:09:55,038
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to once again restate our next steps, we're going to be talking about this exact zoning proposal again next Wednesday at 6 p.m.

691
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:05,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Please feel free to help us in spreading the word and we're glad to have the collaboration of the mayor's office and spreading the word on social media and through robo calls to residents.

692
01:10:06,304 --> 01:10:14,609
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this process has been informed by the past several years of public participation on what they like and what they want to see for Salem Street and other areas around the city.

693
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:20,631
[SPEAKER_14]: and these conversations, you know, in the here and now have to be informed by all of our voices as well.

694
01:10:21,071 --> 01:10:21,772
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for being here.

695
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:24,413
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to see this 6 p.m.

696
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:32,076
[SPEAKER_14]: next Wednesday, whenever it gets referred out to the City Council, it will then be referred to the Community Development Board, and then it will be referred back to the City Council.

697
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:39,599
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just say that over and over again every meeting to remind you of all of the opportunities that we welcome you to be a part of this process.

698
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,440
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

699
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,561
[SPEAKER_14]: 7-12, do we have a motion?

700
01:10:47,421 --> 01:10:50,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to adjourn by President Bearsar, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

701
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:51,708
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

702
01:10:51,728 --> 01:10:51,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

703
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:53,451
[SPEAKER_14]: All opposed?

704
01:10:54,232 --> 01:10:54,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

705
01:10:54,873 --> 01:10:55,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Meeting is adjourned.

706
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:56,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Please stick around for the regular meeting.

707
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:59,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Innocent Associates, Danielle, and Alicia.
