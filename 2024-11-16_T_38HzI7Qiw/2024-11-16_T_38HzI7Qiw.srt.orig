1
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:37,581
[SPEAKER_01]: All is well, as you like to say.

2
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,061
th th

3
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:23,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

4
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:23,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

5
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:01,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's fine.

6
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,320
Yeah.

7
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I know when we set the date.

8
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,415
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all inverted exactly in this one.

9
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We had two guests.

10
00:07:59,443 --> 00:07:59,923
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on.

11
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:05,208
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use this to adjust the focus, but I kind of don't.

12
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:08,211
I think there may be a use for it in the word section.

13
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,489
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all there is.

14
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:24,077
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the newest New York, not just New York.

15
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Way over there, yeah.

16
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,560
[SPEAKER_01]: stay around for long enough to learn how to tune in.

17
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:32,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all of this work to keep that from happening to everybody else to show nothing happens.

18
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:51,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sorry.

19
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

20
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:39,555
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

21
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:48,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our November edition of the live monthly presentation of Fresh Friday's Words and Music.

22
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We are rebranded.

23
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,304
[SPEAKER_01]: and moving smoothly along through the village.

24
00:13:53,904 --> 00:14:07,419
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back to the business of senior club gatherings, after school shenanigans, and a bunch of other things that keep us active and excited here at 111 Arlington Street.

25
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:16,512
[SPEAKER_01]: This program is possible in part thanks to the assistance of the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

26
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:23,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also grateful for the ongoing partnership of Medford Community Media.

27
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:41,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So as fall starts to usher in colder temperatures and friskier germs, we want to remind you that COVID and RSV and the flu are still out there, and we are trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

28
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:45,339
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want a mask, you're welcome to do that, but you're not required to.

29
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,223
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got test kits and masks available for anybody that might need them.

30
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,085
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always drop by and grab them up.

31
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:59,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, we're just happy to be here sponsoring live programming at the center.

32
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,014
[SPEAKER_01]: We're glad to see our neighbors, our friends and supporters coming through those doors.

33
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much for being here.

34
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:08,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks also.

35
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:28,546
[SPEAKER_01]: to Kevin Harrington and Mark Davidson from the aforementioned Medford Community Media for consistently guiding us as we broadcast you via Medford Community Media channels, nine for Comcast, 47 for Verizon, as well as on the MCM YouTube channel.

36
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:36,130
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're out there watching on your electronic devices or on any kind of a screen, welcome to the show.

37
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:43,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So my pastor always used to say, it's a sorry frog that won't praise his own pond.

38
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:51,521
[SPEAKER_01]: So tonight's words portion of the program is the There's No Place Like Home edition.

39
00:15:52,361 --> 00:16:05,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to put in a plug for the work that's being done here at the WMCC, and there's no one better for me to chat with than our own highly esteemed executive director, Lisa Crossman.

40
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

41
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:26,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Lisa is certainly not new to Medford anymore, but she has already made a significant and positive impression on everyone who has crossed her path.

42
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:26,899
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been

43
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:42,297
[SPEAKER_01]: tirelessly committed to restoring the luster to WMCC, fighting through the worst of our COVID slowdown, and advancing the programs, partnerships, and reputation of this venerable institution.

44
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:51,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa is passionate about creating and strengthening community partnerships and advancing the mission of social impact organizations.

45
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:58,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten to know her a little bit over the past few years, and I can attest to the fact that she's great with people.

46
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:16,620
[SPEAKER_01]: She's very smart, dedicated, and not afraid, and this is important, to do a lot of the heavy lifting that comes with running an agency that doesn't have all the resources and advantages that many other community-based organizations do.

47
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:20,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, once again, please give Lisa a warm welcome.

48
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:31,939
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the center's leadership changed abruptly at the West Memphis Community Center back in March of 2022, Lisa really stepped right up.

49
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:40,787
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a member of the board at the time, but she came with many years of experience working in community nonprofits.

50
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:52,214
[SPEAKER_01]: young men and young women's programs, the Y programs, and advocating for education and human resources, human services.

51
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:59,039
[SPEAKER_01]: She stepped into an interim role and there was no interruption in service whatsoever.

52
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:07,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So having long since been confirmed as the permanent executive director, Lisa has helped us to continue to steer through the pandemic

53
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:13,646
[SPEAKER_01]: tight finances, many new programs, and new partnerships.

54
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:27,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So Grant Phillips, who is not with us, he's probably in the office right now playing on the computer, her now eight-year-old son is still her constant companion.

55
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,930
[SPEAKER_01]: She's highly motivated by him and for him.

56
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,911
[SPEAKER_01]: He's her sidekick, her shadow, so to speak.

57
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,312
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the great loves of her life.

58
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,593
[SPEAKER_01]: He's currently a tall second grader at St.

59
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:45,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Raphael's Parish School and a fixture in our own after-school program.

60
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we want to give a little shout-out to Grant Phillips.

61
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, he's part of the organization.

62
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:56,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as is my custom in introducing these evenings as a

63
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:05,887
[SPEAKER_01]: former Poet Laureate of Medford and Poet Laureate Emeritus, I like to share a little bit of poetry just to kind of get us in the mood.

64
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:15,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So this piece, and I'm sure Lisa will dive into one or two of the topics in it, is called Picket Fences.

65
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:21,842
[SPEAKER_01]: The modern day home makeover moguls and real estate robber barons keep coming.

66
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:27,902
[SPEAKER_01]: We buy ugly houses, signs plastered telephone poles and fence posts.

67
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:36,074
[SPEAKER_01]: The contractor trucks and dumpsters sit ready beside the port-a-parties and pallets of bricks, boards, and broken promises.

68
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Digsafe has mocked out the gas and power lines.

69
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:46,279
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has issued all the permits, the banks approved the financing, and the harried homeowner has headed south.

70
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,221
[SPEAKER_01]: North Carolina, Georgia, maybe Tennessee, somewhere warmer where their new money would grant them acreage.

71
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Three full bathrooms, lots of bedrooms, and a serious man cave.

72
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:23,375
[SPEAKER_01]: The old house on Jerome or Lincoln or Arlington was supposed to be the inheritance built by their daddy's daddy or just beyond the red lines and purchased for that 10,000 GI bill bucks that seemed like a million back then, back when the wink and the nod between the moneylenders and the city founders defined the boundaries of a white man's privilege.

73
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:25,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that heritage is fading.

74
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:47,690
[SPEAKER_01]: What used to be that remarkable black neighborhood with the legacy of legends, war heroes, doctors, shop owners, athletes, artists, is losing its bronze-hued luster, losing its proud patina to the new shine of subway-tiled bathroom spas, barnwood beams, butler's pantries, and his-and-hers beamers.

75
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,753
[SPEAKER_01]: The new residents don't care much about the history.

76
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:55,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Henry's Little Store and Faucina's Beauty Salon and such

77
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:02,596
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do love the basketball courts, and they laud the city's haste to redo the tennis courts and such.

78
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:08,521
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the green grass and backyard barbecues and the walking trails along the river, too.

79
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:13,506
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the Bloody Mary mornings and Merlot meetups and the Margarita midnights.

80
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:17,869
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel instantly entitled, and they let the old folks know it.

81
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, the developers keep calling those elders and their grown-up kin.

82
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:24,874
[SPEAKER_01]: We buy ugly houses.

83
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay cash, any condition.

84
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:35,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Half a mil sounds like a lot when you had a devil of a time getting a $10,000 mortgage for your little piece of the American dream.

85
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, you hang on.

86
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You really love this old place.

87
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,906
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember when a black man was the postmaster.

88
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:48,134
[SPEAKER_01]: and when the first Negro woman was elected to the school committee.

89
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:55,617
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember how great Charlie Booker was at hockey and how good Rudy Smith looked in the PD's dress blues.

90
00:21:56,317 --> 00:22:05,461
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember the letting the little kids get on those yellow school buses to leave the comforts of the Hervey and go integrate the wait, the Gleason, and the Dame.

91
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:17,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember when the neighborhood was a tight-knit community of Doc Count's date lines, and OG's shallow sermons, and Humpty's homeboy haircuts, and Vonnie Carter's sand-finished ceilings.

92
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:21,875
[SPEAKER_01]: You fix your face, because you know God don't like ugly.

93
00:22:22,456 --> 00:22:24,298
[SPEAKER_01]: You wave and smile politely.

94
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they smile back, sometimes they don't.

95
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:30,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

96
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,534
[SPEAKER_01]: All the while, you're reminiscing about back in the day.

97
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:52,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're hearing Alan Dawson playing with Dave Brubeck on that old stereo console, or Conrad and Levi singing Peace Be Still on the corner of Houghton and Bower, or the doo-woppers on J Street and Harvard Ave reminiscing about the neighborhood back in the day when the Ville had a soundtrack all its own.

98
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Truth is, you never actually wanted a white picket fence.

99
00:22:57,554 --> 00:23:00,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite the statement you were trying to make way back then.

100
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:04,040
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted respect more than assimilation.

101
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:06,723
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted community more than acceptance.

102
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:10,246
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted the familiar, the faithful, and the first love.

103
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:14,911
[SPEAKER_01]: All the while, you wished that the kids would have stayed and tried to make a go of it here.

104
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:22,107
[SPEAKER_01]: But the developers kept calling, so did Atlanta and Raleigh Durham in their own American dreams.

105
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:25,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess home is where the heart is, but.

106
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:38,284
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already tired of the condo culture and bedroom convenience of professional dog walkers, commuter rail parking spot bandits, snooty au pairs, and the 9-1-1 dialing Karens.

107
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:47,849
[SPEAKER_01]: How could the dregs of the city, given up so grudgingly, seated so strategically, now be the jewel in the mystic kingdom's crown?

108
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:55,033
[SPEAKER_01]: The modern day home makeover moguls and real estate robber barons keep coming.

109
00:23:56,232 --> 00:24:01,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugly houses signs plastered the telephone poles and fence posts.

110
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:05,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Newsflash, ain't too many ugly houses left.

111
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, ain't too many left.

112
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be a doo-wopper's refrain from that J Street corner back in the day.

113
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout it out, my brother.

114
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:17,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Ain't too many ugly houses left.

115
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:19,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, ain't too many left.

116
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:21,107
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

117
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:22,909
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

118
00:24:28,678 --> 00:24:35,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's have a friendly chat with Lisa Crossman.

119
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:54,906
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lisa, in making the transition from the board, where you kind of first came in the door, to the executive director's chair, what immediately struck you about the community center?

120
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:00,214
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

121
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:04,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a tough question.

122
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,763
[SPEAKER_00]: What immediately struck me was,

123
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:28,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the silence, hearing so much about the community center, all the stories, all the programs, and then coming in for the first time during this transition, and it's quiet, and the phone's not ringing, and no one's in the building, and nothing's going on.

124
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:37,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really struck me as kind of, okay, this is the state of the organization, this is where our starting point is.

125
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right, yeah.

126
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:53,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, and it's funny because you were obviously coming in during a time when, you know, just because of the nature of the COVID beast, things were gonna be somewhat quieter.

127
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:53,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

128
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,589
[SPEAKER_01]: But even still.

129
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:08,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Even still, so yes, the pandemic, I was working up until a few months in, I was a commuter, I was on the train and I had a hiatus during the pandemic, which was wonderful for me, kind of like a sabbatical.

130
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:14,819
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got my rest, I got my peace while others had to kind of push through.

131
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,941
[SPEAKER_00]: But on top of that,

132
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just searching for the best words.

133
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:40,056
[SPEAKER_00]: The executive that was here, I don't think she saw the value in the organization and it seemed as though she saw it as a burden and began to treat the board that way, began to treat members that way.

134
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:48,019
[SPEAKER_00]: and really ended up making the executive director's office kind of like a fortress.

135
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,299
[SPEAKER_00]: No one could speak to the executive.

136
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:51,820
[SPEAKER_00]: No one could see the executive.

137
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,381
[SPEAKER_00]: No one came out to say hello.

138
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:58,262
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really was a disservice to the organization.

139
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt relationships we had in the community.

140
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:03,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt relationships we had with members.

141
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:08,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had, we, all of us had to do a lot of

142
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:10,127
[SPEAKER_00]: digging out after that.

143
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:15,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it really hurt us, even though it was a short time span, it hurt our organization.

144
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.

145
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just goes to show you that it doesn't take very long to build up those walls.

146
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:25,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot longer to start to break them down and get back to

147
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:29,815
[SPEAKER_01]: the business of doing business in the community.

148
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:45,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did you know about Medford, coming here from, you were from Malden in the short, but you were from like Western Massachusetts, Central Massachusetts in the long.

149
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before Western, the limits of Fitchburg area is where I grew up.

150
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:56,365
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent my whole life there, had a good life there, but always felt like, oh, I'm a big fish in a small pond.

151
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:01,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to come out here and really see if my skills have scratch.

152
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:04,550
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was going to college at

153
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:17,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Fitchburg State College at the time, now Fitchburg University, and met my now best friend, Danielle Coleman, who lived just a stone's throw from here, Fletcher Coleman's daughter.

154
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:30,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, she started bringing us out here on the weekends, we would go to the basketball court, the tournaments, and at night, she'd be like, okay, you know, it's getting dark, let's go take a walk around the neighborhood.

155
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:34,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me and to Choma, it's like, there's no sidewalks really all the time.

156
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:41,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a walk isn't always the best idea late at night, but it was like, see who's out, see who's on the porch.

157
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,863
[SPEAKER_00]: They're checking to see if you're out on the porch.

158
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:45,945
[SPEAKER_00]: You're finding out what everybody's getting into.

159
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:51,090
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just black families everywhere in this neighborhood and everybody's saying hello.

160
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,471
[SPEAKER_00]: getting together, and I've just always had such a wonderful time.

161
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Her family really has embraced me.

162
00:28:57,852 --> 00:28:59,172
[SPEAKER_00]: They are my second family.

163
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:00,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

164
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:03,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Fletcher introduced me to so many people.

165
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:05,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard so many stories.

166
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:13,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that began over 20 years ago that I started coming out and getting to know Medford in that type of way.

167
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:20,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because you kind of came in on the tail end of the golden era of the neighborhood.

168
00:29:20,438 --> 00:29:21,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

169
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:31,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had spent, you know, my entire childhood, obviously, in those very streets that you used to, you know, walk around in at night.

170
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:38,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was part of the beauty of the neighborhood is up to a certain point, you know, because when the streetlights came on, all bets were off.

171
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:38,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But

172
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:47,949
[SPEAKER_01]: for the kids anyways, but there was a point in time in this neighborhood, and I guess at least to a certain extent still, where folks felt comfortable like that.

173
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:53,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you don't worry about anything except somebody might try to holler at you, get your number.

174
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:54,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Holler at you.

175
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:56,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's about it.

176
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was just looking out for everyone.

177
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,778
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was really great, yes.

178
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:07,942
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I arrived now after the pandemic, after all these years, and I'm looking around like,

179
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:09,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is everybody?

180
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,425
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?

181
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:12,186
[SPEAKER_00]: What has changed?

182
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:25,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a learning curve for me to learn history, where we're at, what's going on, the dynamics in the city, learning about the racial rights at the high school and how that's impacted culture.

183
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it was a lot to learn to come to.

184
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:32,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we are today.

185
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,346
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very brand new.

186
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very much so, very much so.

187
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:45,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I have talked a lot about the change in the dynamics of the neighborhood from where we were coming up to where we are now.

188
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:52,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're two years in to your tenure as executive director.

189
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,185
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen a lot, obviously.

190
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,585
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've done a lot, too.

191
00:30:58,246 --> 00:31:10,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So what types of initiatives are either in process or on the horizon that are positioning the community center for further success?

192
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,250
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're celebrating our 90th year.

193
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,053
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2025, we'll be celebrating our 90th year.

194
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:24,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are planning a big celebration for that Memorial Day weekend.

195
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:28,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have a fundraising campaign for that as well.

196
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:35,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Our newest initiative is the Circles USA program, which is a poverty reduction program.

197
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:45,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We were lucky to get a grant with the city through what they call the Resiliency Hub, and you can find all this information online at the city's website.

198
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:48,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a pilot program.

199
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:55,613
[SPEAKER_00]: The former executive was in communications regarding these dollars.

200
00:31:56,154 --> 00:32:00,736
[SPEAKER_00]: And as she transitioned out, we weren't aware that there was dollars on the table.

201
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:06,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had probably a few days to figure out what we wanted to do.

202
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:13,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had been doing some research, Arlington Eats had,

203
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:30,153
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the program, I had done the research, so I felt like, okay, this is the time, this is something that will reinvigorate our organization and give us kind of that pivotal program that will take us another 90 years.

204
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:35,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Because before there was the Medford Family Network, there was the West Medford Community Center.

205
00:32:36,296 --> 00:32:40,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Before there was a lot of these other organizations, there was the West Medford Community Center.

206
00:32:42,299 --> 00:33:02,948
[SPEAKER_00]: through years and not really understanding maybe what it takes for an organization like this to thrive and move forward and grow, we lost opportunities, different things happened, some things were mishandled, which left us with just the two programs, the after school program, which was dwindled, and the senior program.

207
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:05,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I say all that to say,

208
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:09,971
[SPEAKER_00]: This poverty reduction program, it's a national program.

209
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,233
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over 80 chapters.

210
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:14,774
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few in Canada.

211
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:32,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of support there from kind of our mother organization, but it's a way for us to work with our community that's coming in, who's in this upper to middle income bracket, and to work with those in our community who are experiencing poverty.

212
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:48,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And to bring those two communities together, but also fill the gap in Medford that we see, you know, we've got food programs, we've got to help with drug addiction, we've got to help with childcare,

213
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:55,575
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got help with English as a second language, and this program kind of threads the needle for all of them.

214
00:33:55,655 --> 00:34:09,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, let's get people the supports they need, the social networks they need, and move them out of poverty, changing that in our community so that the goal is to reduce poverty by 10% in our community in 10 years.

215
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:19,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's ambitious, but it's doable, especially if we get the partnerships and getting the folks on board with it.

216
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:32,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to take you back just a second and talk a little bit about a 90th anniversary celebration, because I think a lot of people

217
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:41,105
[SPEAKER_01]: They recognize that the community center has been here, and that this is the second building on the site, and so on and so forth.

218
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:52,494
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that the breadth and length of the duration of the community center's existence is clear to a lot of folks.

219
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:56,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So 90 years is really, really very significant.

220
00:34:56,497 --> 00:35:09,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's huge for any business, I think, to to be in business 90 years to have only one full time employee that only started maybe five, six years ago that there was a full time employee.

221
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:18,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's pretty dynamic to be relying on community volunteer support and to exist for this long.

222
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,299
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty amazing.

223
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:20,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

224
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:22,200
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of transitions.

225
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:31,392
[SPEAKER_01]: two buildings at one time, the old army barracks into this much nicer, newer space.

226
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:43,500
[SPEAKER_01]: At one time, we were a charter agency of the United Way, and they kind of footed the bill for virtually everything that we did, but it hasn't been like that for a very long time.

227
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:49,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really, really one of the key areas that I know you've had to really, really dig into.

228
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:53,566
[SPEAKER_01]: is how do we keep ourselves afloat financially?

229
00:35:53,586 --> 00:36:00,649
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanna talk about grant writing and any of that kind of stuff?

230
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:06,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I mean, it's honestly, what we did when I came in is

231
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:10,273
[SPEAKER_00]: really pull back and take a look at the organization, right?

232
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:28,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand how this organization works, what it needs to be successful, shore up our foundation so that we can stand the Circles program on it and we can stand other things on it and it will grow no matter who sits at the board.

233
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:32,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So this board has really been great.

234
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:46,681
[SPEAKER_00]: with Melinda, Melinda Regan, we have Brian Collins, Michael Bergman, David Kilpatrick, and we have Phil Davis.

235
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:51,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And our board emeritus, Rachel Tanner.

236
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:54,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll catch you back if I don't mention her.

237
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:58,550
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've really been great to kind of

238
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:08,999
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen, to absorb, give feedback and participate because being on this board is a hands on job.

239
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:15,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really looked at what we need to do, where we need to go and now how we're going to get there.

240
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:21,871
[SPEAKER_00]: We were blessed to work with Janelle Coleman, who is

241
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,793
[SPEAKER_00]: a fund development person.

242
00:37:24,813 --> 00:37:25,554
[SPEAKER_00]: She worked for St.

243
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:28,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis House for years, raised millions of dollars.

244
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:33,819
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's helping us part-time to put together our fund development plan.

245
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:40,663
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be excited to roll out in January a bunch of our sponsorship packages.

246
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:43,665
[SPEAKER_00]: our fundraising plan for the 90th.

247
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:43,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

248
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:47,166
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really getting all of that lined up.

249
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:50,308
[SPEAKER_00]: We realize, you know, we cannot rely on grants.

250
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:52,409
[SPEAKER_00]: We no longer are going to rely on grants.

251
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

252
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And the board is willing to do their their part.

253
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,712
[SPEAKER_00]: So but we've done really well with grants as well.

254
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:04,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some very, very generous supporters as well.

255
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:08,435
[SPEAKER_00]: The donations have always been right on time.

256
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:08,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm hmm.

257
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:09,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.

258
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:38,892
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're approaching a really, you know, whatever side of the political spectrum you might sit on, and I don't wanna dishonor or disregard anybody who's, you know, who voted and got the result that we got, but it's a perilous time, and there are some definite dangers for agencies like ours, agencies that have declared that we stand for equity

259
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:46,236
[SPEAKER_01]: and civil rights and social justice and advocacy for marginalized communities.

260
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:51,299
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people right now are fearful and fretful.

261
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,361
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important time for the community center.

262
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:55,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

263
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:57,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very hopeful.

264
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:06,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the Circles program, we're poised to do well with the new administration, I believe.

265
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:15,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we were talking earlier, I feel like a lot of philanthropists will end up stepping up during this era.

266
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:17,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

267
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're poised to do well there.

268
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:23,053
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of justice happening in the side of grants.

269
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:28,456
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things happening, restorative justice right now.

270
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:32,398
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a key time right now while the funding is available.

271
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:32,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

272
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:36,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're applying for a few of those grants that are longer term.

273
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe with our history, with the wonderful people who have come through here and have gone on to be very successful,

274
00:39:46,425 --> 00:40:04,411
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability that this community center has been kind of the key and the linchpin to the community growing and thriving to then gain equity and move on, it shows what this community is able to do, aka the community center.

275
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:09,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us a lot of skin in the game as we apply to things.

276
00:40:09,193 --> 00:40:10,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

277
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:21,957
[SPEAKER_01]: significant that we've also had a growing position in the arts community here in Medford as well.

278
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:39,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, this program is one of, you know, part of our arts programming, but, you know, the Medford Jazz Festival, having been housed here, and us having been, you know, kind of a focal point in terms of West Medford Open Studios and helping them to run their program,

279
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:43,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's kind of a unique place for us as well.

280
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:52,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, I'm thrilled to have arts and culture as something I can say that I do.

281
00:40:54,055 --> 00:41:00,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not artistic, I'm not a singer, I don't do any of that, but I very much enjoy it.

282
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:06,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always done the team work and workforce development, which is great, but can be boring.

283
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:15,433
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exciting to have this piece to work with artists to be able to provide jobs and pay for artists.

284
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:15,933
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

285
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty amazing to not compromise.

286
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

287
00:41:18,195 --> 00:41:20,818
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want you to be artists to take a short.

288
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:25,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we do well trying to pay artists their value.

289
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,005
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been really exciting.

290
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:34,687
[SPEAKER_00]: With Melinda's help, we've really been able to partner well in the community, I think.

291
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:39,509
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Medford Jazz Festival, with our Mothers Out Front group for the Pumpkin Splash.

292
00:41:40,169 --> 00:41:42,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been very exciting, the Hoops and Hope group.

293
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,091
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very exciting.

294
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:50,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of exciting initiatives that have taken place just in the last several months.

295
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:53,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a busy, it's been a very, very busy year.

296
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:06,350
[SPEAKER_01]: What, as you look at the past two years of your practice here, what things are you most proud of?

297
00:42:07,998 --> 00:42:08,839
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.

298
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm most proud of the black entrepreneurs piece.

299
00:42:16,344 --> 00:42:29,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I think us being able to use our platform to help these smaller businesses gain new customers, get a surge in income, especially right before the holidays.

300
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:32,716
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing when everyone gets together.

301
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:40,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are our personal friends who we introduced to the community and now they're friends and it's pretty awesome.

302
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great.

303
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:49,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Also my son, I think having him come here, he's very good friends with the senior group.

304
00:42:52,527 --> 00:43:01,097
[SPEAKER_00]: He's everybody's boyfriend He is like he's pretty amazing and I'm lucky to have him and he's just so great.

305
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:06,343
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know when we go places The first thing he's doing is talking to the seniors.

306
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:06,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

307
00:43:06,924 --> 00:43:11,449
[SPEAKER_00]: He's having he's meeting them and spending time getting to know them He's getting the scoop on everybody

308
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:20,315
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he's also with the youth groups and so it builds trust with the kids, they feel more comfortable.

309
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:25,558
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever the last kid here, he's always with them and so it's just been so wonderful.

310
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:34,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm thinking back to this summer and last summer as well, the Lego group that was here.

311
00:43:34,223 --> 00:43:34,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.

312
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:39,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And what an amazing time that was for all of the kids

313
00:43:40,146 --> 00:43:45,832
[SPEAKER_01]: that came through, but also for Grant, who basically, you know, was a little bit of a boss.

314
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:49,656
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a little bit of a boss amongst all those kids.

315
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:59,627
[SPEAKER_01]: But programs like that, I really think, you know, have helped continue to establish the community center as a viable partner for outside organizations.

316
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

317
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:08,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, what people are beginning to recognize is that we we know the value of our organization.

318
00:44:08,786 --> 00:44:09,146
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

319
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:15,830
[SPEAKER_00]: We might need to put a little paint, a little lipstick on her, but we know the value of our organization.

320
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,432
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's it's beyond aesthetics.

321
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:23,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have something that cannot be replicated.

322
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:25,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be captured or bottled.

323
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:26,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Many try.

324
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:32,020
[SPEAKER_00]: but they cannot do what is done here at the West Medford Community Center.

325
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,840
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, that's right.

326
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:53,167
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think the things that you did coming up in Central Massachusetts and working with the Ys and working with the various youth groups and such kind of prepared you for what you're dealing with these days?

327
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:57,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good taste in Central Mass.

328
00:44:57,674 --> 00:45:00,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a grassroots organization called Luck Inc.

329
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:03,817
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did some group homework.

330
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:07,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not homework, but group homes.

331
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:09,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah.

332
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:09,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And

333
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:13,500
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just happened to stumble in it.

334
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,121
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy who was the executive director was just starting.

335
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:19,102
[SPEAKER_00]: He happened to be a friend of my father's.

336
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:22,303
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a hippie, a true hippie, and his wife.

337
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:25,564
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned so much from them.

338
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:29,648
[SPEAKER_00]: and that piece in meeting the community, knowing the community.

339
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:45,226
[SPEAKER_00]: My job core work, I got to learn about the workforce development world, partnerships, getting those higher level partnerships, kind of making deals in how we're gonna give service for service.

340
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:53,416
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Y, it's just their values, they're very values-based, and that really speaks to me.

341
00:45:53,536 --> 00:46:01,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to do my work and speak on Christian values, but without having a penalty was just a boon to my work.

342
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:04,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grew my passion.

343
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:08,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also my family had a business.

344
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,054
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a liquor store for 20 years.

345
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:15,096
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up in the business.

346
00:46:15,177 --> 00:46:27,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 16 in there sweeping floors, dusting things, and then eventually was behind the cash register doing scheduling, doing the banking stuff, or doing orders, carrying 30 packs.

347
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:30,731
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dad never took it easy on me.

348
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,293
[SPEAKER_00]: He always wanted me to learn things

349
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:36,515
[SPEAKER_00]: to eventually take over the business.

350
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:44,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not know about me in my grandfather was a mayor of Lemonster, Massachusetts for many, many years.

351
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:44,921
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

352
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:50,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And after he had retired for some time, they came back to him and asked him to come back.

353
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And he served for many, many more years.

354
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:55,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was very loved in the community.

355
00:46:56,207 --> 00:47:00,229
[SPEAKER_00]: After he passed, the new incoming mayors would talk to my father.

356
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:03,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Our family was very involved in community.

357
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:06,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from my father, my grandfather.

358
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:11,915
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time I left Fitchburg, which I had worked in for many years, they were calling me the mayor.

359
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:13,616
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor of Fitchburg.

360
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:17,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I didn't want that.

361
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:20,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to be handed what my future was.

362
00:47:21,462 --> 00:47:24,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And I broke off to say, I'm going to make it on my own.

363
00:47:24,865 --> 00:47:28,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do, if I have to struggle, if I have to, I'm going to.

364
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:29,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it on my own.

365
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:38,171
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really my motivating driving force is to to show my father that I can be successful in this business.

366
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:39,652
[SPEAKER_00]: My ideas are good ideas.

367
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I can execute these ideas.

368
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:46,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I can bring people together to do good in the world beyond just turning a dollar.

369
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:57,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all of your ancestors and your living relatives, they must be proud of you, if they know about the work that you're doing.

370
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they do, they're great.

371
00:47:58,264 --> 00:48:03,086
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a small family by now, but yes, they are absolutely great.

372
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:04,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and your late mom as well.

373
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yep.

374
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:08,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, God rest her generous soul.

375
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:15,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about your philosophy as a community advocate?

376
00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:20,036
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.

377
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:25,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my philosophy is to make the time.

378
00:48:25,758 --> 00:48:40,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very easy to, especially in today's society, in my role to say, well, I'm the executive director, I gotta meeting, I gotta get to, I don't have the time to talk.

379
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:45,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Members are going through things, community members are going through things.

380
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have deadlines, I have meetings.

381
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:56,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes these people, they don't understand that someone just walked through the door and they're in crisis.

382
00:48:56,793 --> 00:49:00,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone walked through the door and they lost a relative.

383
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:03,317
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I make the time.

384
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:13,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I make the time no matter the sacrifice because I feel like in the end that's why I was sent to show up today.

385
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:19,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been my philosophy this time around here.

386
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:27,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned in the past to talk to community members and get to know them and share my life and share my life with them.

387
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:38,394
[SPEAKER_00]: But this time around, I put down the pressure, I put down the deadlines, keep the door open, keep my ears open, keep my heart open and just make time for people.

388
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:54,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as I as I said at the beginning, and I really wasn't trying to blow any smoke, you know, that that really I think that's really one of your gifts as you know, as a director here is that you do have a heart for the people and you do make time for everybody.

389
00:49:54,201 --> 00:50:05,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's been recognized and it's also in many instances the favorite part of somebody's day when you come in the room and you spend a little time chatting, finding out what's going on.

390
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:07,607
[SPEAKER_01]: with our folks.

391
00:50:07,707 --> 00:50:14,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I have talked about this a number of times, the most difficult thing that we experience here is losing people.

392
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:16,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, yeah.

393
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's tough.

394
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:20,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not going to stop, you know.

395
00:50:20,703 --> 00:50:21,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

396
00:50:21,123 --> 00:50:36,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other piece that oftentimes people don't look at, especially in human services, is that, you know, you're dealing with people who are going through things who might be at the end of their rope, their their bottle is ready to pop.

397
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:40,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes we receive that other end of it.

398
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,917
[SPEAKER_00]: We receive the outburst.

399
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:43,237
[SPEAKER_00]: We receive the anger.

400
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:45,058
[SPEAKER_00]: We receive that quick

401
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:53,184
[SPEAKER_00]: outbursts without, and I apologize, and we take it, we process, and we move on because we love these people.

402
00:50:53,304 --> 00:50:55,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do, we do, we do.

403
00:50:55,826 --> 00:51:03,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I credit you for some really, really wonderful things that have happened since you've come on board.

404
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:09,516
[SPEAKER_01]: The reinvigoration of the Martin Luther King Jr.

405
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:10,337
[SPEAKER_01]: celebration,

406
00:51:11,418 --> 00:51:13,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the celebration that we had at St.

407
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:21,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray's last year and the one that we're looking forward to this year was really, really a high watermark.

408
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:25,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was an exceptional celebration.

409
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:34,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things like making sure that the seniors can continue to have their barbecue every year.

410
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:40,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though to hear them talk, they done, they done, we finished, that's it, no more.

411
00:51:41,305 --> 00:51:44,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a labor of love, that one.

412
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:51,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really, really making it known that we're open for business.

413
00:51:52,513 --> 00:52:11,628
[SPEAKER_01]: in that we really want to make sure that the community center is seen as an institution for everybody in the community, no matter where they came from, no matter how long they've been here, black, white, or whatever, our doors are open and we want to have you as part of the team.

414
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.

415
00:52:13,751 --> 00:52:15,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is welcome here.

416
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:26,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, one of the things, and this is something I've been lamenting over recently, is that, you know, being in existence for 90 years, you develop a personality.

417
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:29,398
[SPEAKER_00]: We have programming, we have things going on.

418
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,339
[SPEAKER_00]: And although our neighborhood is changing,

419
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:38,120
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cannot pivot in that way to dump what we have going on to take in, right?

420
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're limited by capacity.

421
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:45,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And until financially that changes, we're not going to abandon our key programs.

422
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:49,923
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have some lovely neighbors, some lovely families.

423
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:53,123
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking to add some events to bring them in.

424
00:52:53,163 --> 00:52:56,324
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of young families in Medford that are just really great.

425
00:52:57,224 --> 00:53:01,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And we love having them because when people come here, they get to know their neighbor.

426
00:53:02,568 --> 00:53:07,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's guard is down, and it's really the true sense of community.

427
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we've been, you know, for the past several years, we've been a good landlord.

428
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:24,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've had, between Petit Boots, who was the French nursery that was here several years ago, and now, for the past several years, General Dragon, we've been a good landlord.

429
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:26,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

430
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:30,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Our tenants like us a lot.

431
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we got a few minutes left.

432
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:36,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you play a quick game of word association with me?

433
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:36,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

434
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:42,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm gonna give you a word and just give me a few sentences on what that word means to you, okay?

435
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:45,253
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so community.

436
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:51,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Community, that's a good one.

437
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,872
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good one, because I'm limited here.

438
00:53:56,653 --> 00:54:11,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Community to me is authentic, transparent, understanding, hopeful.

439
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:14,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I'll leave it there.

440
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,892
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, that's cool, that's cool.

441
00:54:17,312 --> 00:54:18,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Philanthropy.

442
00:54:19,234 --> 00:54:20,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Philanthropy is wonderful.

443
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:24,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on and on about this topic, but I'll keep it short.

444
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:28,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that philanthropy is a lost art.

445
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:37,175
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our young folks don't understand about giving, why it's important to give, kind of what you get from giving.

446
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:37,736
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

447
00:54:37,996 --> 00:54:38,276
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

448
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:44,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see a shift in culture, and that's something we hope to kind of work towards.

449
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,521
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think giving is great.

450
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:49,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving is what we're meant to do.

451
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:51,622
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just borrowers of everything that's here.

452
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:53,063
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us, we don't own anything.

453
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't take it with us.

454
00:54:56,184 --> 00:55:00,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think give when you can and give often and give more.

455
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:03,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart.

456
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:06,548
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, heart.

457
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:13,214
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tough one, Terry.

458
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:17,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grading on a curve, so.

459
00:55:20,796 --> 00:55:30,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart, I think it's important that you share your heart, you share your heart, and that you lay your burdens down.

460
00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:40,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been on both the giving and receiving end of that here, so it's just, your heart lies in community.

461
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, they do.

462
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,500
[SPEAKER_01]: They go together for sure, for sure.

463
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you one more, courage.

464
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:52,003
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me think of the Cowardly Lion.

465
00:55:54,583 --> 00:56:00,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So courage for me, I would say I do all things with him who strengthens me.

466
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:02,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any courage on my own.

467
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:07,807
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hadn't been for God, I wouldn't be sitting here and I wouldn't have any courage.

468
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:12,668
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day I turn to him for more and hope that he keeps me holding on.

469
00:56:14,848 --> 00:56:17,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been better for it.

470
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:19,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Our organization has been better for it.

471
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:27,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm following in the footsteps of many that have come before me in this organization, which is why we have found so much success.

472
00:56:28,072 --> 00:56:29,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, big shoulders.

473
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:36,234
[SPEAKER_01]: We have big, huge shoulders that we both stand on, but that we also have to make an account to.

474
00:56:36,454 --> 00:56:36,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

475
00:56:36,975 --> 00:56:39,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a challenge.

476
00:56:40,115 --> 00:56:41,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So five years from now,

477
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:55,173
[SPEAKER_01]: What will you want the people of Medford, and particularly the folks from West Medford who've been here and done some things, to know about the community center in your stewardship of this organization?

478
00:56:56,784 --> 00:57:00,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is a good one, because just a quick short story.

479
00:57:00,386 --> 00:57:02,927
[SPEAKER_00]: In our attic, we have a bunch of files.

480
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's no organization to the files.

481
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:17,254
[SPEAKER_00]: But in looking through the files, which is how you understand an organization, there's many handwritten notes, typed types on a typewriter notes.

482
00:57:18,094 --> 00:57:21,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to read a lot of annual reports.

483
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:30,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it was like, kind of, I hope you know that I tried my best and God was with me this whole time.

484
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:31,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I get it, guy.

485
00:57:32,227 --> 00:57:33,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what you're going through.

486
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,771
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like them to know is that I

487
00:57:40,848 --> 00:57:47,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I oftentimes, before I came here, I couldn't understand what my next move is, why am I here, what am I doing?

488
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:51,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And what stood out to me was Restorer of the Breach.

489
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:53,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I like it.

490
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Restorer of the Breach.

491
00:57:54,455 --> 00:58:02,458
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope that in my time that those that hold a grudge are able to let that grudge go.

492
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:02,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it, yes.

493
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:12,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that, I don't see it as a changing of the guard, I see it as a repository as we've talked about.

494
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:18,722
[SPEAKER_00]: We plan to take on as many events, organizations, and things that

495
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:22,785
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in West Medford for the longevity.

496
00:58:22,845 --> 00:58:29,089
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to encompass that and carry it forward for the lifetime of our organization.

497
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:32,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope to bring in our new neighbors.

498
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,913
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to continue that West Medford spirit.

499
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:38,995
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are we if we don't welcome our neighbors?

500
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:48,802
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't embrace them if we don't teach them the history, because it is everything that these people learn that are on these walls that made them great.

501
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:53,503
[SPEAKER_00]: made them great in their field is why we still talk about them.

502
00:58:53,803 --> 00:59:09,827
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think about Buddy and Cecil and how they've influenced me and that influence on me now influences the kids in our after-school programs who then we help our board members and community members who are the philanthropists that come back

503
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:25,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I hope to carry on the legacy and do it well and carry on the spirit and do it well and set up this organization on a pathway for success that needs not one of us to continue on.

504
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:29,578
[SPEAKER_00]: It would continue on through the engine of community spirit.

505
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:30,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

506
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:31,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

507
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:31,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

508
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to let that be the last word, ladies and gentlemen.

509
00:59:37,923 --> 00:59:39,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

510
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:58,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important for us to come back to the table on a periodic basis and just check in and talk about what's going on, what's being done, what's anticipated, and what the future looks like.

511
00:59:58,484 --> 01:00:02,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lisa, thank you so much for stepping in.

512
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:03,049
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

513
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:14,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just say really quickly, this is a wonderful opportunity because, as some of you know, my day-to-day is checking the bathrooms.

514
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,703
[SPEAKER_00]: The plumbing, the IT, the HVAC, the bills, Ian, a lot of the day to day.

515
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:24,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to pull back and talk high level is really wonderful.

516
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:29,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And to spend time with Terry just talking with you all has been wonderful.

517
01:00:29,568 --> 01:00:30,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Terry.

518
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:30,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

519
01:00:30,809 --> 01:00:31,289
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.

520
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:32,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

521
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,210
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

522
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:33,751
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

523
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:34,131
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

524
01:00:34,451 --> 01:00:37,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a pause for the cause.

525
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:43,036
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to break down the set and get ready for something really, really

526
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:47,037
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful and awesome on the musical side of the ledger.

527
01:00:47,457 --> 01:01:00,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to get up and move around and chat a little bit and so forth, do that, but don't go too far from your seats because you're not going to want to miss a minute of what we have coming up.

528
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:08,180
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come back, we'll do some quick commercials, and then we'll have our musical guest join us.

529
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,041
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?

530
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:10,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

531
01:03:54,846 --> 01:04:05,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we're getting very much more efficient at our transitions, so there's not as much time for chitty chatting as there used to be.

532
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:09,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody can take your seats.

533
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:12,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

534
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:27,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an old adage, and part of it, I'm not going to state all of it, but part of it is keep your friends close.

535
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:30,053
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know the rest of it.

536
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:42,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, what I've come to really, really appreciate in the circle of friends that I have is dependability.

537
01:04:43,281 --> 01:05:00,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is having the kinds of friends that when you call them for whatever you call them for, if there's any way in the world they can do it, they can make it happen, they can be on your side and available to you, they do.

538
01:05:01,552 --> 01:05:08,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best among them literally jump at the opportunity to help you because that's their spirit.

539
01:05:09,556 --> 01:05:17,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lisa and I have certainly come to anticipate and expect that among our friends here at the community center.

540
01:05:18,562 --> 01:05:27,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those friends have come from friendships that she's had before the community center and friendships that I've had before the community center.

541
01:05:28,067 --> 01:05:50,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I say all that to introduce a really, really wonderful friend who I've known since our undergraduate days, me on my way in, her on her way out, at Fisk University of Nashville, Tennessee, where she was a Jubilee singer and a budding diva.

542
01:05:51,757 --> 01:05:56,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that in the best of ways, okay?

543
01:05:56,539 --> 01:05:59,860
[SPEAKER_01]: In any case, Donna McElroy has been here before.

544
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,021
[SPEAKER_01]: She's engaged us and entertained us.

545
01:06:03,561 --> 01:06:07,723
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a raconteur and a storyteller.

546
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:10,244
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a music historian.

547
01:06:11,484 --> 01:06:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a vocal teacher who has been a professor and a department chair at Berklee College of Music.

548
01:06:20,968 --> 01:06:23,890
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been an international recording artist.

549
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:28,655
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got credentials up the wazoo and the yin yang.

550
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:32,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to belabor it.

551
01:06:33,319 --> 01:06:36,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing about her is she is my friend.

552
01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:39,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I call her, if she's available, she comes.

553
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:43,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have been the beneficiary before.

554
01:06:43,909 --> 01:06:46,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And tonight, you're going to be the beneficiary again.

555
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:57,359
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to welcome back and reintroduce to some my friend, the inimitable, the inestimable Donna McElroy.

556
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:13,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got that one, that's right.

557
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:13,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

558
01:07:16,175 --> 01:07:17,516
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everybody doing?

559
01:07:20,638 --> 01:07:22,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's see.

560
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:27,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to get everybody to join me in a hum.

561
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:30,106
[SPEAKER_04]: A hum?

562
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:31,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hum?

563
01:07:33,129 --> 01:07:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start kind of low.

564
01:07:35,814 --> 01:07:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So now when you do this next one, I want you to do it like you would be resisting laughing.

565
01:07:51,205 --> 01:07:58,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So until you run out of air, OK?

566
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:58,310
[SPEAKER_04]: 1, 2, 3, go.

567
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:13,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now let's move up a third.

568
01:08:13,938 --> 01:08:18,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and in the back of your throat, go ee, but you keep your mouth closed.

569
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:42,225
[SPEAKER_05]: okay now somebody's looking kind of what does that mean she's got the mouth closed and she's saying e okay so i'm going to do it for you can you hear in the back of my throat i am forming vowels okay so

570
01:08:50,327 --> 01:09:17,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, my suggestion to everyone, I do this every morning, to warm not my voice up, but to get my breathing apparatus practiced and running and up and ready and, you know, before I get on that elliptical, I like to feel I'm not going to completely shock my heart, my cardiovascular system.

571
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the bed, I'm going to,

572
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:34,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Now when I do this one.

573
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So you push and you crescendo and you back off and you decrescendo and you let it, the air just do what it's gonna do.

574
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:43,858
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it gave out on me.

575
01:09:44,438 --> 01:09:51,782
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I'm warmed up, that air can help me last a long time and my warmup,

576
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:59,674
[SPEAKER_04]: My message to you, my verbal message to you is warm yourself up for challenges.

577
01:10:01,154 --> 01:10:03,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day is a challenge.

578
01:10:04,936 --> 01:10:05,877
[SPEAKER_04]: When you wake up,

579
01:10:06,789 --> 01:10:13,353
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're doing your stretches, and you're in the bed, and you're pulling your knees up, and you're doing all of the stuff on the way, you should be humming.

580
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:32,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be warming up your vocal apparatus, and your breathing apparatus, and your abdominal apparatus for handling it, stepping out, and being on top of life, instead of trying to, oh God, I hope I make it.

581
01:10:33,326 --> 01:10:35,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I am definitely gonna make it, and when I get there,

582
01:10:36,991 --> 01:10:39,312
[SPEAKER_04]: They gonna know I was in the building.

583
01:10:41,413 --> 01:10:44,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all the preaching I have for you tonight.

584
01:10:49,617 --> 01:11:02,423
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a sweet, sweet spirit in this place.

585
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:21,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it is the spirit of the Lord.

586
01:11:25,346 --> 01:11:26,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get an amen?

587
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:43,818
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a sweet expression on each face.

588
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:51,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it is the Spirit.

589
01:11:54,668 --> 01:12:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: of love.

590
01:12:02,213 --> 01:12:14,680

592
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:49,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna lift our voice in praise.

593
01:12:49,394 --> 01:12:50,674
[SPEAKER_04]: You know this, sing it with me.

594
01:12:51,014 --> 01:13:10,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived when we have left this place.

595
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:15,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Give yourselves a round of applause.

596
01:13:19,515 --> 01:13:21,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:05,700

[SPEAKER_04]: Glad I got my religion in time.

01:17:40,107 --> 01:17:40,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

624
01:17:43,385 --> 01:17:50,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever I do this, I'm gifted that I can sing without accompaniment.

625
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:55,313
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not prepared to hear what I can do with an actual pianist.

626
01:17:56,574 --> 01:17:56,894
[SPEAKER_04]: OK?

627
01:17:58,295 --> 01:17:59,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't even show up.

628
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:00,517
[SPEAKER_04]: OK?

629
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:07,482
[SPEAKER_04]: The keyboard players are like, all right, she went there.

630
01:18:07,562 --> 01:18:08,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going with her.

631
01:18:08,423 --> 01:18:10,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I very seldom rehearse.

632
01:18:12,631 --> 01:18:17,919
[SPEAKER_04]: especially on songs that are old, and most musicians know how to play.

633
01:18:18,219 --> 01:18:19,802
[SPEAKER_04]: This next one especially.

634
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:27,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you grown up, I heard this song for the first time when I was three years old, and I'll be 69 in two weeks.

635
01:18:29,358 --> 01:18:51,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know these songs, and they're in your heart, and you come in with a seasoned player who hasn't been just listening to the bumpity, bumpity, bump, and the modern stuff, and the rhythm section stuff, and they know a couple of hymns, maybe five or six, 60 or 70, 80 hymns.

636
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:57,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The foundation, the edifice of our faith is in the hymns.

637
01:18:58,737 --> 01:18:59,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of mine.

638
01:18:59,838 --> 01:19:20,654
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandmother used to, you heard me talk about my grandmother in the kitchen snapping beans and putting on the fat back and putting it in the water and boiling that piece of meat and then adding her green beans or her turnip greens or her kales or her collards to it.

639
01:19:21,315 --> 01:19:23,016
[SPEAKER_04]: A mixture of all of the above.

640
01:19:23,036 --> 01:19:27,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And making her cornbread batter.

641
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:31,722
[SPEAKER_04]: and leaving it in the refrigerator for when she comes back from the church.

642
01:19:32,862 --> 01:19:34,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So she can stick it in the oven.

643
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:35,884
[SPEAKER_04]: You know about that.

644
01:19:36,804 --> 01:19:37,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody from the South?

645
01:19:39,505 --> 01:19:40,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan.

646
01:19:42,587 --> 01:19:48,169
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are from Michigan and you had a family like that, they came from probably the South.

647
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:49,870
[SPEAKER_04]: They came from Georgia.

648
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:50,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm from Kentucky.

649
01:19:52,816 --> 01:19:54,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes.

650
01:19:54,676 --> 01:20:00,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a tradition that we are losing as a race and a culture.

651
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:05,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reason why I try to talk about it as much as I can wherever I go.

652
01:20:06,638 --> 01:20:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's how I grew up with my grandmother in the kitchen.

653
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:14,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd wake up and I'd smell that whatever, what is that mom is cooking today?

654
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,740
[SPEAKER_04]: We called her mom.

655
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:22,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Honey, and my little butterball self, I was jumping up, ready to eat something.

656
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:24,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be simple.

657
01:20:25,526 --> 01:20:26,527
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it would be simple.

658
01:20:26,747 --> 01:20:28,128
[SPEAKER_04]: We were lucky to get a ham.

659
01:20:28,668 --> 01:20:36,796
[SPEAKER_04]: She was lucky if the white woman that she was working for gave her a little five-pound ham.

660
01:20:37,436 --> 01:20:44,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'd bring that home, and she'd feed me and my brothers and sisters and her daughter and her son and a couple of church members.

661
01:20:44,763 --> 01:20:46,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'd slice thin, baby, thin.

662
01:20:48,086 --> 01:20:48,667
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear me?

663
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:53,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'd take that skin and she'd fry it up and make that crackling.

664
01:20:54,212 --> 01:21:00,899
[SPEAKER_04]: She, you know, we would make, the pig was well digested.

665
01:21:03,122 --> 01:21:09,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd wake up and she'd be snapping those beans and she'd say, I am thine, oh Lord.

666
01:21:10,684 --> 01:21:20,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard thy voice and it told thy love to me.

667
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:35,480
[SPEAKER_04]: But I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee.

668
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:37,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Draw me near.

669
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:52,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where Thou hast died.

670
01:21:52,864 --> 01:22:01,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

671
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:11,636
[SPEAKER_04]: to thy precious bleeding side.

672
01:22:11,656 --> 01:22:12,559
[SPEAKER_04]: You know this, don't you?

673
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:26,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord, by the power of grace divine.

674
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:40,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, and my will be lost in thine.

675
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:42,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Draw me near.

676
01:22:43,746 --> 01:22:56,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where Thou hast died.

677
01:22:56,634 --> 01:23:08,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

678
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:19,521
[SPEAKER_04]: to thy precious bleeding side.

679
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:24,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, every now and then you hear somebody sing an old hymn that you thought you forgot.

680
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:26,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of those.

681
01:23:26,426 --> 01:23:28,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I always love to hear like an old lady.

682
01:23:29,488 --> 01:23:37,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like I'm all that old, but I must be, because these hymns are not being sung in the churches anymore.

683
01:23:40,188 --> 01:23:42,349
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm going to get into preacher mode.

684
01:23:42,389 --> 01:23:45,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do it.

685
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:59,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where thou hast died.

686
01:24:00,538 --> 01:24:09,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord.

687
01:24:11,331 --> 01:24:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: to thy precious bleeding side.

688
01:24:20,314 --> 01:24:21,895
[SPEAKER_04]: About that time, I'd be downstairs.

689
01:24:21,955 --> 01:24:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say, Ma, what's for breakfast?

690
01:24:25,256 --> 01:24:32,259
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, girl, go on, sit down somewhere, you silly self.

691
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:34,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

692
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:34,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

693
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

694
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:49,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one was a, my Lord, what a morning.

695
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:57,725
[SPEAKER_04]: My Lord, what a morning.

696
01:24:57,745 --> 01:25:06,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my Lord, what a morning.

697
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:15,757
[SPEAKER_04]: When the stars refuse to shine.

698
01:25:16,564 --> 01:25:30,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You will hear the trumpet sound to wake the nations underground.

699
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:38,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, looking to my God's right hand,

700
01:25:39,196 --> 01:26:03,363
[SPEAKER_04]: When the sun refused to shine, when the stars began to fall, when the Lord takes all away, my Lord,

701
01:26:09,793 --> 01:26:12,935
[SPEAKER_04]: What a morning.

702
01:26:15,256 --> 01:26:19,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my Lord.

703
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: What a morning.

704
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my Lord.

705
01:26:28,343 --> 01:26:32,745
[SPEAKER_04]: What a morning.

706
01:26:33,766 --> 01:26:36,027
[SPEAKER_04]: When the stars

707
01:26:37,153 --> 01:26:38,094
[SPEAKER_04]: begin to fall.

708
01:26:38,114 --> 01:26:42,197
[SPEAKER_04]: When the stars begin to fall.

709
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:44,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

710
01:27:11,513 --> 01:27:12,113
[SPEAKER_04]: You said what?

711
01:27:13,454 --> 01:27:14,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Little jazz?

712
01:27:14,414 --> 01:27:15,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you said, little jazz?

713
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:19,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so interestingly coincidental that you said that.

714
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:27,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me see.

715
01:27:27,818 --> 01:27:31,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the next song is a jazz classic.

716
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:38,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to think in my head, can I put it in a key where I can not hurt myself?

717
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:44,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

718
01:27:50,184 --> 01:27:50,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Snap with me.

719
01:27:55,048 --> 01:28:01,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Them that's got shall get.

720
01:28:03,155 --> 01:28:05,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Them that's not shall lose.

721
01:28:07,085 --> 01:28:26,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Bible says, and it still is news, mama may have, papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own.

722
01:28:26,257 --> 01:28:28,879
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got his own.

723
01:28:34,016 --> 01:28:41,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Will the strong get more while it seems the weak ones fade?

724
01:28:42,122 --> 01:28:49,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Empty pockets don't ever make the grade.

725
01:28:49,548 --> 01:28:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Mama may have.

726
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Papa may have.

727
01:28:55,453 --> 01:29:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But God bless the child that's got his own that's

728
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:11,908
[SPEAKER_04]: got his own money.

729
01:29:11,928 --> 01:29:23,496
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got lots of friends crowding around your door.

730
01:29:23,536 --> 01:29:24,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the ones.

731
01:29:25,871 --> 01:29:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: When the money's gone and spending ends, they're all so busy.

732
01:29:33,614 --> 01:29:36,775
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't come around no more.

733
01:29:37,235 --> 01:29:44,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you know rich relations, they want to give you a crust of bread and such.

734
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:46,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, come on, honey, help yourself.

735
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait, baby.

736
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:51,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You take too much.

737
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Mama may have.

738
01:29:55,117 --> 01:30:10,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own.

739
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm just going to take a little break right here.

740
01:30:12,767 --> 01:30:17,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's act like the band is playing and the drummer's taking a solo.

741
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:20,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have the volume up on that thing?

742
01:30:20,892 --> 01:30:22,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have the volume up?

743
01:30:25,418 --> 01:30:33,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think the last time I came, I did not have the volume up because I turned it down so it wouldn't ring all over the room.

744
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:36,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got home and I was like, jamming, man.

745
01:30:36,062 --> 01:30:37,763
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no music.

746
01:30:40,664 --> 01:30:41,584
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how to do that?

747
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:43,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it on?

748
01:30:43,565 --> 01:30:45,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be all the way up.

749
01:30:45,285 --> 01:30:45,325
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

750
01:30:45,365 --> 01:30:45,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

751
01:30:47,766 --> 01:30:48,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do the bridge.

752
01:30:48,907 --> 01:30:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

753
01:30:53,291 --> 01:31:19,131
[SPEAKER_04]: money you've got lots of friends they all crowd around your door but when your money's gone and the speed it is they don't come around nowhere no more listen here

754
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:28,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Rich relations may give you a little crust of bread and such, they say.

755
01:31:28,757 --> 01:31:31,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Help yourself, honey.

756
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:32,540
[SPEAKER_04]: But wait a minute.

757
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take too much.

758
01:31:36,443 --> 01:31:39,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Mama may have.

759
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:43,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Papa may have.

760
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:51,754
[SPEAKER_04]: But God bless the child that's got his own.

761
01:31:51,834 --> 01:31:52,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Hallelujah.

762
01:31:54,315 --> 01:31:56,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got his own.

763
01:32:04,664 --> 01:32:12,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I made him get tech-minded.

764
01:32:12,165 --> 01:32:13,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me see what happened.

765
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me see.

766
01:32:14,606 --> 01:32:14,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

767
01:32:14,886 --> 01:32:17,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

768
01:32:17,846 --> 01:32:19,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

769
01:32:19,587 --> 01:32:21,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

770
01:32:21,587 --> 01:32:22,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

771
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:25,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go back here.

772
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:34,463
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll get this to you in the dance.

773
01:32:34,663 --> 01:32:35,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go.

774
01:32:35,845 --> 01:32:36,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect, thank you.

775
01:32:37,226 --> 01:32:39,408
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

776
01:32:39,909 --> 01:32:44,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Now sing some more before I get in trouble.

777
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:46,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sing some more while I get in trouble.

778
01:32:46,455 --> 01:32:47,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, and how am I doing?

779
01:32:53,530 --> 01:33:07,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just know that even if a person is seasoned and well-oiled, they still need encouragement and a little goose every now and then.

780
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:11,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get lazy, and I'm sitting on my couch, and I'm watching Perry Mason.

781
01:33:12,421 --> 01:33:16,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't watch Perry Mason?

782
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:20,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be laughing at me now, I ain't that young.

783
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:23,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I watch Perry Mason and Andy Griffith.

784
01:33:25,618 --> 01:33:32,541
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am from Kentucky, so Andy, and Barney, and Opie, and B, and Goober, and Gomer.

785
01:33:33,282 --> 01:33:34,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Shazam!

786
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:36,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me.

787
01:33:37,003 --> 01:33:38,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me.

788
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:39,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

789
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:42,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting at home, and I'm looking at my emails.

790
01:33:42,986 --> 01:33:43,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Terry Carter.

791
01:33:53,631 --> 01:33:54,932
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding, baby.

792
01:33:55,712 --> 01:33:57,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I see your name, I'm like, yes.

793
01:33:58,993 --> 01:33:59,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

794
01:33:59,793 --> 01:34:05,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Fisk, our alma mater.

795
01:34:06,315 --> 01:34:06,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

796
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:10,157
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so where'd I stop?

797
01:34:10,897 --> 01:34:11,757
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless the child.

798
01:34:13,338 --> 01:34:14,238
[SPEAKER_04]: How long do I have?

799
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have 20 minutes?

800
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have 20 minutes?

801
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:40,783
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I'm going to do one that is a little bit more modern, but it has a real prophetic message.

802
01:34:43,092 --> 01:34:52,857
[SPEAKER_04]: the group that put this out didn't get all the play that they were deserving of because it was a really lovely, a really lovely tune.

803
01:34:53,138 --> 01:34:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is called Wake Up Everybody.

804
01:34:57,975 --> 01:35:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: okay i'm hearing the intro in my head but i don't know what key i'm gonna start in though so i'm just doing the rhythm section and the

805
01:35:18,667 --> 01:35:20,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Wake up everybody.

806
01:35:20,689 --> 01:35:23,212
[SPEAKER_04]: No more sleeping in bed.

807
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: No more backward thinking.

808
01:35:25,834 --> 01:35:28,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Time for thinking ahead.

809
01:35:28,977 --> 01:35:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The world has changed so very much from what it used to be.

810
01:35:34,182 --> 01:35:38,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much hatred, war, and poverty.

811
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Calls.

812
01:36:11,284 --> 01:36:18,949
[SPEAKER_04]: The world won't get no better if we just let it be.

813
01:36:18,969 --> 01:36:21,050
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

814
01:36:21,611 --> 01:36:25,413
[SPEAKER_04]: The world won't get no better.

01:36:25,473 --> 01:36:30,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to change it, girl, just you and me.

01:36:30,797 --> 01:36:35,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Hoo, hoo, hoo.

01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm breathing.

818
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:36,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Hoo.

819
01:36:39,102 --> 01:36:43,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well.

820
01:36:44,385 --> 01:36:48,848
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the ones who's suffering and catching all the hell.

821
01:36:49,128 --> 01:36:54,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't have so very long before the judgment day.

822
01:36:54,331 --> 01:37:01,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So won't you make them happy before they pass away?

823
01:37:01,075 --> 01:37:01,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, nah, nah.

824
01:37:07,519 --> 01:37:09,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Wake up all the builders.

825
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:12,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to build a new land.

826
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we can do it if we all in the hand.

827
01:37:17,602 --> 01:37:22,344
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing we have to do is put it in our minds.

828
01:37:22,664 --> 01:37:24,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely we will work it out.

829
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:30,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We do it every time.

830
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:39,682
[SPEAKER_04]: The world won't get no better if we just let it be.

831
01:37:39,742 --> 01:37:41,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

832
01:37:42,343 --> 01:37:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The world won't get no better.

833
01:37:46,105 --> 01:37:51,487
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to change the girl, just you and me.

834
01:37:53,788 --> 01:37:57,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to change the children from inside out.

835
01:37:59,019 --> 01:38:02,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to change the world and show them what we're talking about.

836
01:38:04,102 --> 01:38:08,745
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to walk in faith and not in discouragement.

837
01:38:09,225 --> 01:38:13,568
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to walk in courage and show them what we mean.

838
01:38:14,408 --> 01:38:17,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to wake up everybody.

839
01:38:19,611 --> 01:38:23,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, wake up everybody.

840
01:38:24,754 --> 01:38:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, wake up everybody.

841
01:38:30,273 --> 01:38:32,775

01:38:43,421 --> 01:38:45,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Wake up, everybody.

847
01:38:49,045 --> 01:38:51,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, give yourselves a round.

848
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, there's a song.

849
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:06,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to sing it.

850
01:39:06,682 --> 01:39:08,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to go ahead and sing it.

851
01:39:08,202 --> 01:39:15,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been torn between the version of it that I learned when I was like maybe, oh gosh, I think I might have been 17.

852
01:39:15,884 --> 01:39:17,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember the Hebrew boys?

853
01:39:21,005 --> 01:39:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: The recording artists who were part of the Edwin Hawkins chorus.

854
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:35,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And he picked three fabulously talented, harmonically very, very attentive guys.

855
01:39:35,763 --> 01:39:38,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And he put out a record called The Hebrew Boys.

856
01:39:39,968 --> 01:39:46,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did old arrangements of traditional hymns.

857
01:39:47,808 --> 01:39:52,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this one, it has a very, it's like jazz.

858
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they had to have ears to hear it.

859
01:39:55,116 --> 01:39:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up.

860
01:39:56,477 --> 01:39:57,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hebrew Boys.

861
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,282
[SPEAKER_04]: When We All Get to Heaven.

862
01:40:00,682 --> 01:40:05,147
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can hear that song, it'll probably open up the whole album.

863
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:08,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an absolutely amazing album.

864
01:40:09,285 --> 01:40:13,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, okay, Edwin Hawkins, the whole happy day.

865
01:40:14,329 --> 01:40:17,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That was back in the time when that song came out.

866
01:40:17,052 --> 01:40:17,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 1963, 64.

867
01:40:20,755 --> 01:40:24,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came in singing that song and my mother said, girl, you better hush that mess up.

868
01:40:24,878 --> 01:40:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you bring all that stuff in my house.

869
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:28,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to hear all of that mess.

870
01:40:29,342 --> 01:40:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there was drums.

871
01:40:31,144 --> 01:40:32,465
[SPEAKER_04]: She wouldn't let me play the record.

872
01:40:33,789 --> 01:40:36,211
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, I don't want to hear that mess in my house.

873
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:41,095
[SPEAKER_04]: She was a Tennessee Ernie Ford fan, George Beverly Shea.

874
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:44,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You see what I'm saying?

875
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So she did not want to hear all the whooping and hollering in her house.

876
01:40:52,702 --> 01:40:58,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a little turntable, 45, and I'd have it down the lowest, lowest, lowest.

877
01:40:59,327 --> 01:41:02,689
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd be walking past my room, and she'd say, what's that you playing in there?

878
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn that mess off.

879
01:41:04,551 --> 01:41:05,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to hear all that mess.

880
01:41:08,174 --> 01:41:19,619
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hebrew boys, if you ever get to hear them, you will absolutely be mesmerized by the harmonies and the reharmonizations of these traditional old hymns.

881
01:41:19,959 --> 01:41:21,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of them.

882
01:41:21,559 --> 01:41:24,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to remember how this sounds when I sing it.

883
01:41:25,101 --> 01:41:33,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you go look for the song, the Hebrew boys, When We All Get to Heaven, you will be amazed.

884
01:41:33,744 --> 01:41:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?

885
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:36,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know this one, When We All Get to Heaven?

886
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang it.

887
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:42,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was going to pick an old hymn nobody knew.

888
01:41:42,508 --> 01:41:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

889
01:41:43,368 --> 01:41:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

890
01:41:43,888 --> 01:41:45,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

891
01:41:50,451 --> 01:41:51,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

892
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:54,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bottle of it over there somewhere.

893
01:41:57,794 --> 01:41:58,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It's under my coat.

894
01:42:04,597 --> 01:42:05,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Terry.

895
01:42:07,219 --> 01:42:07,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

896
01:42:19,446 --> 01:42:26,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing the wondrous love of Jesus.

897
01:42:27,493 --> 01:42:34,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing his mercy and his grace.

898
01:42:36,261 --> 01:42:43,007
[SPEAKER_04]: In the mansions bright and blessed,

899
01:42:45,397 --> 01:43:04,285
[SPEAKER_04]: prepare for us a place when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all

900
01:43:10,954 --> 01:43:18,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus will sing and shout the victory.

901
01:43:22,389 --> 01:43:36,314
[SPEAKER_04]: While we walk the pilgrim pathway, clouds will overspread the sky.

902
01:43:36,334 --> 01:43:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: When the traveling days are over, not a shadow, not a sigh,

903
01:43:51,019 --> 01:44:07,292
[SPEAKER_03]: when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all

904
01:44:09,941 --> 01:44:31,009
[SPEAKER_04]: see Jesus will sing and shout the victory onward to the prize before us soon his beauty will

905
01:44:31,309 --> 01:44:57,113
[SPEAKER_04]: behold soon the pearly gates will open and we will tread the streets of gold when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all

906
01:44:58,985 --> 01:45:15,916
[SPEAKER_04]: See Jesus will sing and shout, sing and shout, sing and shout the victory.

907
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:18,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Hallelujah.

908
01:45:21,259 --> 01:45:21,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

909
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:22,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

910
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

911
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:27,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you get me started up now.

912
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:34,571
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let me see.

913
01:45:35,932 --> 01:45:36,732
[SPEAKER_04]: How much time I got?

914
01:45:38,053 --> 01:45:38,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you need.

915
01:45:38,633 --> 01:45:40,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever I need.

916
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:41,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come get you.

917
01:45:41,534 --> 01:45:46,876
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

918
01:45:46,896 --> 01:45:49,818
[SPEAKER_04]: This takes a lot of emotion out of me.

919
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:52,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I get really emotional with this song right here.

920
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So y'all bear with me if I cry.

921
01:45:59,281 --> 01:46:08,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been so many places in my life and time.

922
01:46:10,483 --> 01:46:13,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I've sung a lot of songs.

923
01:46:13,244 --> 01:46:18,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I've made some bad rhymes.

924
01:46:19,785 --> 01:46:24,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I've acted out my life in stages with 10,000 people watching.

925
01:46:29,755 --> 01:46:37,801
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.

926
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:46,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I know your image of me is what I hope to be.

927
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:54,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I treated you unkindly, but darling, can't you see?

928
01:46:56,937 --> 01:47:00,401
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no one more important to me.

929
01:47:01,442 --> 01:47:07,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby, can't you see through me?

930
01:47:07,169 --> 01:47:13,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.

931
01:47:17,031 --> 01:47:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing you came out in front and I was hiding but now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together just listen to my melody cause my love

932
01:48:05,015 --> 01:48:13,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you in a place where there's no space or time.

933
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:16,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you for my life.

934
01:48:18,174 --> 01:48:22,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a friend of mine.

935
01:48:22,716 --> 01:48:30,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And when my life is over, remember when we were together.

936
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:34,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We were alone.

937
01:48:35,862 --> 01:48:44,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was singing a song, whispering in your ear.

938
01:48:45,126 --> 01:48:46,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I was singing a song, baby.

939
01:48:53,141 --> 01:49:01,005
[SPEAKER_08]: For you.

940
01:49:01,926 --> 01:49:07,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

941
01:49:07,909 --> 01:49:08,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

942
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:09,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

943
01:49:09,811 --> 01:49:10,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss my mama.

944
01:49:11,071 --> 01:49:12,632
[SPEAKER_04]: When I sing that song, I miss my mama.

945
01:49:16,414 --> 01:49:17,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss my mama.

946
01:49:22,717 --> 01:49:24,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss my mama and my little sister.

947
01:49:25,438 --> 01:49:26,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I talk to them every day.

948
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:31,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

949
01:49:31,641 --> 01:49:32,461
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk back.

950
01:49:34,242 --> 01:49:36,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I never forget what my mama taught me.

951
01:49:37,183 --> 01:49:38,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Never, ever, ever.

952
01:49:41,545 --> 01:49:43,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So y'all forgive me for cracking on that.

953
01:49:49,946 --> 01:49:51,407
[SPEAKER_05]: quality control in the back.

954
01:49:51,447 --> 01:49:52,769
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, you did.

955
01:49:53,549 --> 01:49:54,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You went flat, lady.

956
01:50:00,175 --> 01:50:04,940
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I have one more, and then I'm going to stop.

957
01:50:07,522 --> 01:50:15,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is my hope, that you take this home

958
01:50:16,829 --> 01:50:35,355
[SPEAKER_04]: and know that there are people of like mind and kindred spirit who may sing the gospel or they may sing another style of music, but the message is always very rich and very deep and thrives in the hearts and minds of all of us.

959
01:50:35,555 --> 01:50:38,236
[SPEAKER_04]: This is called If I Ruled the World.

960
01:50:39,016 --> 01:50:40,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know If I Ruled the World?

961
01:50:41,257 --> 01:50:41,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony Bennett?

962
01:50:44,775 --> 01:50:51,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's, I learned it from Tony Bennett, but everybody's, I think James Brown did a version of this, didn't he?

963
01:50:52,367 --> 01:50:53,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

964
01:50:57,310 --> 01:51:08,699
[SPEAKER_04]: If I ruled the world, every day would be the first day of spring.

965
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:15,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Every heart would have a new song to sing.

966
01:51:16,546 --> 01:51:22,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring.

967
01:51:25,643 --> 01:51:38,927
[SPEAKER_04]: If I ruled the world, every man would have as free as a bird.

968
01:51:39,627 --> 01:51:45,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Every voice would be a voice to be heard.

969
01:51:46,449 --> 01:51:52,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Take my word, we would treasure each morning

970
01:51:56,041 --> 01:52:01,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, let me sing that verse over.

971
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:04,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to do that because I don't have a band behind me.

972
01:52:05,738 --> 01:52:11,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Every man would be as free as a bird.

973
01:52:11,282 --> 01:52:14,404
[SPEAKER_04]: My mama would say, girl, you need to shut up and sit down.

974
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:21,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Every voice would be a voice to be heard.

975
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Take my word, we would treasure each and all day, day that a plan, that a, I don't know why I mess up on that line.

976
01:52:34,355 --> 01:52:36,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You think I'm doing it on purpose, don't you?

977
01:52:37,818 --> 01:52:39,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my comedy background.

978
01:52:41,721 --> 01:52:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Take my word, we would treasure each day that occurred.

979
01:52:50,187 --> 01:52:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: My world would be a beautiful place where we would weave such wonderful dreams.

980
01:53:02,335 --> 01:53:11,637
[SPEAKER_04]: My world would wear a smile on its face like the man in the moonbeams.

981
01:53:12,257 --> 01:53:28,401
[SPEAKER_04]: When the moon beams, if I ruled the world, every man would say the world was his friend.

982
01:53:31,499 --> 01:53:32,864
[SPEAKER_04]: There be happiness.

983
01:53:34,329 --> 01:53:37,671
[SPEAKER_04]: that no man could end.

984
01:53:38,552 --> 01:53:48,939
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my friend, not if I rule the world.

985
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:55,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Every head would be held up high.

986
01:53:56,104 --> 01:53:59,106
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be sunshine in everyone's sky.

987
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:21,939
[SPEAKER_08]: if the day ever dawned when I ruled the world.

988
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:24,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

989
01:54:24,561 --> 01:54:27,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

990
01:54:29,343 --> 01:54:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

991
01:54:31,943 --> 01:54:33,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so, so much.

992
01:54:33,504 --> 01:54:35,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now I'm going to leave you with this one.

993
01:54:35,084 --> 01:54:35,725
[SPEAKER_04]: You sing with me.

994
01:54:36,205 --> 01:54:42,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, I shall not, I shall not be moved.

995
01:54:44,409 --> 01:54:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I shall not, I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water.

996
01:54:56,214 --> 01:54:58,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I shall not,

997
01:54:59,468 --> 01:55:01,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Be moved.

998
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:02,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hum it with me.

999
01:55:03,911 --> 01:55:11,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like a tree that's planted by the water.

1000
01:55:32,407 --> 01:55:33,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the faith.

1001
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:40,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let what's outside mess with you inside.

1002
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:44,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a commitment to smile and be nice to everyone.

1003
01:55:46,752 --> 01:55:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't benefit anyone but you and God.

1004
01:55:50,093 --> 01:55:53,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Many times no one gets it, but you get it.

1005
01:55:54,409 --> 01:55:58,873
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a blessing to know that you're serving a higher power than what you see.

1006
01:56:00,355 --> 01:56:01,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get an amen?

1007
01:56:01,616 --> 01:56:04,779
[SPEAKER_04]: One last amen, and I'll talk to y'all next time I come.

1008
01:56:05,019 --> 01:56:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1009
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1010
01:56:09,704 --> 01:56:10,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1011
01:56:10,444 --> 01:56:11,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You did great.

1012
01:56:11,866 --> 01:56:12,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1013
01:56:19,853 --> 01:56:20,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I love coming here, too.

1014
01:56:20,994 --> 01:56:22,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all don't know.

1015
01:56:23,675 --> 01:56:27,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I see him call, and I say, oh, God.

1016
01:56:28,917 --> 01:56:33,339
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's because I have to spend so, I have to use, I have to get so much energy.

1017
01:56:33,379 --> 01:56:34,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to get ready.

1018
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:35,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to get ready.

1019
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:42,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Energy, and get ready, and do this, and be, I mean, I've done it all my life, but it's just like, what do I sing to these people?

1020
01:56:42,143 --> 01:56:44,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Donna, why are you trying to complicate it?

1021
01:56:45,085 --> 01:56:46,686
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a science project.

1022
01:56:47,326 --> 01:56:48,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Be you, girl.

1023
01:56:51,745 --> 01:56:53,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, Donna McElroy.

1024
01:56:53,526 --> 01:57:06,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, before we fade to black, let me just remind you about some of the things that are going on at the community center.

1030
01:57:48,704 --> 01:57:57,146
[SPEAKER_01]: we will be having our holiday Black Vendor Fair, and it is going to be a blockbuster.

1031
01:57:57,686 --> 01:58:04,108
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have at least 20 vendors in the building, downstairs, upstairs.

1032
01:58:04,788 --> 01:58:14,691
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be all kinds of things to browse and to spend your hard-earned dollars on, and you know you'll be helping some local entrepreneurs

1033
01:58:15,572 --> 01:58:16,994
[SPEAKER_01]: make their holiday nugget.

1036
01:58:23,504 --> 01:58:26,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a great event here at the community center.

1037
01:58:28,812 --> 01:58:29,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what else?

1038
01:58:32,458 --> 01:58:34,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't think of it, so it don't matter.

1039
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:36,901
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so how you can help us.

1040

1046
01:59:06,317 --> 01:59:08,598
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another way that you can certainly help us.

1047
01:59:09,238 --> 01:59:28,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, as always, to the great sponsors of WMCC Fresh Fridays, the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, and our good friends at Medford Community Media, represented by Kevin and Mark this evening.

1048
01:59:29,019 --> 01:59:32,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate them very much.

[SPEAKER_01]: We have a good time.

1052
01:59:48,361 --> 01:59:50,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to apologize for that.

1053
01:59:50,562 --> 01:59:56,366
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why you want to have great community-based organizations like the West Medford Community Center.

1054
01:59:56,386 --> 02:00:01,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, everybody, for coming out, for joining us this evening.

1055
02:00:01,269 --> 02:00:06,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to say, I hope, because I know you enjoyed yourselves.

1056
02:00:06,793 --> 02:00:11,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And join us again in December when we'll take it through a whole different door.

1057
02:00:13,236 --> 02:00:17,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And Donna will certainly be back at an appointed hour, as they say.

1058
02:00:18,499 --> 02:00:24,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So hallelujah, have a great time, be safe out there, and have a good evening.
