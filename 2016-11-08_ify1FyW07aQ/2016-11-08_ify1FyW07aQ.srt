[SPEAKER_09]: All please rise and salute our flag.

15
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:27,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation,

00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:32,135

[SPEAKER_09]: Committee of the whole, capital plan minutes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

42
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:11,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, would you like to present?

43
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:24,638
[SPEAKER_12]: place on October 24th and was called to order by myself at 645.

44
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:30,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Present were Erinda Benedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mastone, Robert Scurry, and myself.

45
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:33,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Five school committee members present, two absent.

46
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:45,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Also present was Superintendent Belson, Headmaster Perella, Vocational Principal Director Heidi Riccio, Director of Buildings and Grounds John McLaughlin, and parent Cheryl Rodriguez.

47
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,394
[SPEAKER_12]: After saluting the flag,

48
00:01:48,145 --> 00:02:02,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And after the purpose of the meeting was stated, which was to review the high school vocational school elements of the proposed capital plan and to do a selected tour of the facility, I called on Superintendent Belson for an overview of the evening's meeting.

49
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:10,664
[SPEAKER_12]: The superintendent handed out additional copies of the capital plan and a prepared document proposal from the vocational school, which is attached to this report.

50
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:14,748
[SPEAKER_12]: The superintendent stated that it would not be possible to view the entire high school

51
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:23,994
[SPEAKER_12]: or vocational school in one evening, but that the headmaster and vocational principal, along with Director McLaughlin, would identify priority sites for viewing.

52
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:31,977
[SPEAKER_12]: The topic of overall technology upgrades would be referred to a subsequent session, since this was a major topic with system-wide implications.

53
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:36,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Major systems like the roof and HVAC must be part of our overall planning as well.

54
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,840
[SPEAKER_12]: We have done a roof study and will have a recommendation in the near future.

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,962
[SPEAKER_12]: The superintendent then explained that capital planning must be focused on major projects,

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,543
[SPEAKER_12]: general maintenance upgrades for the most part belonging in an enhanced operational budget.

57
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:54,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, that school system capital needs would be part of a larger citywide initiative.

58
00:02:54,828 --> 00:03:05,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Further, it is important that we view capital plan issues not only as upgrades to facilities, but also as part of a long-term vision for the development of school system capacity and educational opportunities.

59
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:09,400
[SPEAKER_12]: He went on to say, as we recapture certain

60
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:20,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of district payments, we must reinvest into our programs in a strategic manner and anticipate the future, not just to upgrade the present facility bit by bit.

61
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:26,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Committee members recognized the capital mission, but wanted the administration to plan for greater maintenance investment going forward.

62
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:34,210
[SPEAKER_12]: The committee then began a tour of selected sites led by headmaster and vocational principal director and buildings and grounds director.

63
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,843
[SPEAKER_12]: First, we went to the library.

64
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:42,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Perella focused on the ways the library has been altered from its original design over the past 45 years.

65
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:50,333
[SPEAKER_12]: He noted that natural lighting has been lost to the addition of several office spaces and also that the general condition of the library has deteriorated.

66
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:57,338
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be his plan to redesign the library into an open space media center reflecting upon the advance of technology.

67
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:04,743
[SPEAKER_12]: The library would flow into the courtyard and be a multipurpose epicenter for students and faculty exploration and utilization.

68
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:11,765
[SPEAKER_12]: He explained that the initial design and planning had already begun as a result of the XQ Project Academy of the Possible.

69
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:18,232
[SPEAKER_12]: The tour of the library ended with an agreement to formalize the design by utilizing the expertise of an architect engineer.

70
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,216
[SPEAKER_12]: The next tour moved to the vocational school.

71
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:26,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Director Riccio explained that her number one priority was the relocation of the culinary arts

72
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,732
[SPEAKER_12]: and hospitality program to an accessible location for the general public.

73
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,874
[SPEAKER_12]: The director reviewed the draft floor plan and explained how the current programs would be moved.

74
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:41,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford will pursue a state capital skills grant, but it will require matching funds for construction.

75
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:48,620
[SPEAKER_12]: This would include gas and water lines, electricity, flooring, lighting, doors, ADA accessibility.

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,522
[SPEAKER_12]: This grant is now being released by the Commonwealth with applications due in December.

77
00:04:54,219 --> 00:05:03,723
[SPEAKER_12]: The total revamp of the vocational school beyond the culinary arts hospitality project will involve the development of an academy model that groups the various offerings into like clusters.

78
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:10,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Long-term development should be pursued in conjunction with MSBA to the extent possible under their priorities and guidelines.

79
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:15,128
[SPEAKER_12]: The committee then reconvened in the conference room to recap their tour.

80
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:21,291
[SPEAKER_12]: The superintendent indicated that it will be necessary to consider the relocation of certain programs such as early childhood,

81
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:24,554
[SPEAKER_12]: and office space to free up areas for program development.

82
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:29,917
[SPEAKER_12]: The committee will await follow-up materials to continue its capital planning for the complex.

83
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,140
[SPEAKER_12]: The meeting was adjourned at 8.45 p.m.

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I could just add, the tour and the vision that we were presented with at the

85
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,176
[SPEAKER_12]: was truly inspirational and very exciting.

86
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:57,460
[SPEAKER_12]: And you take the step back and you realize you're not just looking at the smaller pieces of maintenance, which of course are extremely necessary, but kind of a bigger vision and a plan into the future.

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

88
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, Ms.

89
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Van der Kloot.

90
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:00,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

91
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno, are you blinking?

92
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:02,822
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

93
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:10,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a motion to receive this report and place on file and keep it with the rest of the capital plans that we've looked at at other schools.

94
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:13,516
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

95
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:13,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

96
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:14,857
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

97
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:15,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

98
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Community participation?

99
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,423
[SPEAKER_09]: None, Mr. Superintendent.

100
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:23,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Suspension of rules?

101
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:28,298
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to request the suspension of the rules by Ms.

102
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

103
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:30,939
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

104
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:31,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

105
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,299
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

106
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Suspension is granted.

107
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz, you'd like to provide an update on a report item.

109
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:40,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

110
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:41,803
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to provide an update on the crossing guide.

111
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:42,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy, is it?

112
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:42,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

113
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:42,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, am I?

114
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:43,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, can you hear me?

115
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:43,464
[SPEAKER_16]: No, she's good.

116
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:43,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you're better.

117
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:44,204
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, sorry.

118
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,004
[SPEAKER_16]: I was blocking it.

119
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:54,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so I'm going to provide an update on the crossing guide on the corner of Fulton Street and Fellsway and Park and the Fellsway.

120
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:02,162
[SPEAKER_16]: The road is a state road, so we have to contact the state and the DCR office.

121
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:12,887
[SPEAKER_16]: What I've done since our last meeting is I've attended the police neighborhood meeting in my neighborhood, along with Mayor and John Falco, and a lot of the other community.

122
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,888
[SPEAKER_16]: And another person there was Sheriff Rodriguez.

123
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:22,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And the community, parents, police, and students expressed the need for a crossing guide.

124
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:24,532
[SPEAKER_16]: So I reached out to state,

125
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:33,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Pat Jalen's office and spoke to Matt Hartman, and he let me know that the DCR was in touch.

126
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:41,055
[SPEAKER_16]: The DCR is going to send out some Rangers this week to monitor the crosswalks at Park Street and Fellsway.

127
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:48,957
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, yeah, Park Street and Fellsway and Fulton Street and Fellsway to determine if they can put crossing guards there.

128
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:53,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Matt will stay in touch with the DCR on the progress and the findings.

129
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:54,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally,

130
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:04,758
[SPEAKER_16]: they made a request with the engineering department at the DCR to ask them if they can change the timing on the pedestrian crosswalk.

131
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:18,888
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't know the outcome of this request, but they will continue to stay in touch with the DCR to see if there's anything they can do to improve the Fellsway crossing and make it safer for all residents in the neighborhood.

132
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, I received a call from State Rep.

133
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Paul Donato's office

134
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:30,325
[SPEAKER_16]: And he let me know that his folks have also been in touch with the DCR and State Senator Jalen's office.

135
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,386
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're both on target.

136
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:33,947
[SPEAKER_16]: They've both been in touch.

137
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,567
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're just waiting.

138
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,669
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess the funds are limited.

139
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:40,930
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're going to do an evaluation.

140
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Another concern that Ms.

141
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:48,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Rodriguez brought up was the timing of the evaluation that they're doing is this week.

142
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:50,955
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are two days with no school.

143
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:57,917
[SPEAKER_16]: I did reach back to them and let them know that, you know, would they possibly be able to do another evaluation next week.

144
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:00,037
[SPEAKER_16]: That request was put in.

145
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:09,960
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not too sure if that's something that they can do, but we did ask if they can send the ranges out there next week and do another evaluation of that section.

146
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,181
[SPEAKER_16]: So, that was the update.

147
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:17,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll continue to monitor this with both offices and provide any new updates that I get.

148
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,523
[SPEAKER_16]: And, Cheryl, did you want to say anything?

149
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address, please.

150
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

151
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 281 Park Street.

152
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for following up on that with the DCR.

153
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:40,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I just spoke to Matt myself this morning and expressed my concerns that the evaluation is happening when there are two no-school days.

154
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:46,576
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also happening with the Veterans Day holidays, so the commuters will probably be less likely to be crossing the street.

155
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also mid-November.

156
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:48,777
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cold.

157
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:55,098
[SPEAKER_11]: The crossing guards at our school know that a lot more cars are driven to school during these months because it is cold.

158
00:09:55,838 --> 00:10:03,540
[SPEAKER_11]: And many families that I have spoken to, and myself included, tend to not walk... What was I going to say?

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I just lost my train of thought.

160
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I just dropped it.

161
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,001
[SPEAKER_11]: They tend to not cross that street because it is dangerous.

162
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:13,102
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter's best friend lives on the other side of that street, and I wouldn't walk her if I...

163
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:17,865
[SPEAKER_11]: If my car broke down, I wouldn't walk across that street because it's unsafe.

164
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:25,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure that an evaluation to determine if there is a high volume of pedestrians would really yield the appropriate

165
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:30,467
[SPEAKER_11]: action because there are less pedestrians because they don't feel safe crossing there.

166
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:38,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Even when we had our walking Wednesdays, they made sure that they walked down to the lights, but they had to hustle at that Fulton and Fellsway because the light is timed at 14 seconds.

167
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,131
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a five-lane road.

168
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty impossible.

169
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:48,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that John Falco had mentioned at the school committee meeting that he himself has to pick up the pace in order to make it across the street.

170
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,916
[SPEAKER_11]: during that 14 second interval.

171
00:10:51,317 --> 00:11:06,088
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hopeful that Matt had suggested perhaps this body could write a letter to send to them with our concerns that they are valid, that there will be less pedestrians, that it is a vacation week, and that people are avoiding the road because it is

172
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,390
[SPEAKER_11]: less safe.

173
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:08,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

174
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:09,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

175
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:09,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

176
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:13,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I also just want to comment that we've been in touch with commissioner Roy of the DCR as well.

177
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:25,659
[SPEAKER_09]: In this matter, we heard the calls from the community meeting as well as the city council, the city school committee actually mentioned it, I think a few weeks ago, Mr. Superintendent, and it's on a report request due as well.

178
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have already voted to send a letter to the DCR and to pursue it through our state delegation.

179
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:35,343
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is taking place and we will keep continue to monitor it.

180
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:37,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry.

181
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:41,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to applaud my colleague Kathy Kreatz for her diligence.

182
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:50,685
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a problem that we've had with DCI for over two years and finally we're making some headway and hopefully we can come to a conclusion that parents and students are happy with.

183
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:56,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they will see the need that is there and get somebody there as soon as possible.

184
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:57,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

185
00:11:59,736 --> 00:11:59,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

186
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Cugno.

187
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:09,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know that we, you just mentioned too, that we have the letter that we were going to send out and I just want to make sure that when we send out the letter that we also amendment with the

188
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:30,643
[SPEAKER_06]: with the consideration that even though the Rangers are coming out to test and to evaluate what's going on, that it would make sense that they would do it during the school time while there are children crossing and adults crossing and that there's full-fledged type of traffic going on, not on a holiday and not on a professional day.

189
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:32,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

190
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:39,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So I find it more effective sometimes to talk directly to the people because you can cover the subject.

191
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:40,025
[SPEAKER_14]: The letter is a

192
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,128
[SPEAKER_14]: paragraph or two.

193
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:49,933
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the things that did take place in the last week or so, which I think is encouraging, is the fact that the revenue from the state has gone up.

194
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:55,796
[SPEAKER_14]: And because the revenue has gone up, I'm sure a lot of the agencies were sitting there saying, I can't spend any money because I'm going to get cut.

195
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:56,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Or hired.

196
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:57,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't hire anybody.

197
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:07,483
[SPEAKER_14]: So if revenue continues to be solid at the state, if we can see another bump, I suspect that maybe something like DCR might say, well, OK, I can take this chance.

198
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,704
[SPEAKER_14]: But a lot of these agencies are concerned

199
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:14,104
[SPEAKER_14]: that, you know, they hire, and then all of a sudden, or they've been told not to hire.

200
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:19,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And what happens is that they are in a situation where they're going to then scramble for money.

201
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:26,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So as the fiscal situation stabilizes, the governor has pulled back in his request to start 9C cuts.

202
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,369
[SPEAKER_14]: The legislature asked him to hold back on that request.

203
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,410
[SPEAKER_14]: The revenue projections for this month were a lot stronger.

204
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,451
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, they're meeting their targets right now.

205
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:38,392
[SPEAKER_14]: They're a few dollars under, but they should expect another rush in this next little while.

206
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:44,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all encouraging, because that's in the background of why an agency will hire or not hire.

207
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they were in a freeze pattern.

208
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,276
[SPEAKER_14]: They were in a freeze pattern.

209
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:48,357
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's probably part of the answer.

210
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:50,658
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully, we hit it at the right time.

211
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:51,659
[SPEAKER_14]: We say, look, you're stable.

212
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:53,420
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that's necessary.

213
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we mock Mr. Benedetto in attendance, please?

214
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:58,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Secretary?

215
00:13:59,079 --> 00:13:59,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

217
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:02,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for being late.

218
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:15,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to follow up with the phone calls, what I find that really helps, sorry, that's Lint, that I do the phone call and I do a follow-up email so there's a paper trail.

219
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:23,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I feel like once you really put it in paper, that they have a trail, like they've requested this 20 times.

220
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know we've talked about this in years past.

221
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:28,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little late coming in tonight.

222
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:41,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can say consistently for the last three years, our community has requested this, and we have these emails to prove it, or this paper trail to prove it, that they'll take it serious.

223
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the little pest that keeps poking you until you do what they want them to do.

224
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:48,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to see a paper trail with this.

225
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:48,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

226
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:58,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Also as a comment to on the requested reports, if we could go back to adding the dates requested on that, on that, that would be helpful because we were doing that for a while.

227
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:03,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, that would be helpful for me too.

228
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:05,527
[SPEAKER_08]: And for our committee as well.

229
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:09,369
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I, I appreciate the phone calls, Mr. Bellson.

230
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that that personal touch really comes with a lot of clout from you.

231
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:18,208
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the follow-up email sends a little bit like, we're documenting, pay attention.

232
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:18,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

233
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

234
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,997
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion just to follow up on the letter.

235
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:27,599
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

236
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:28,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

237
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,980
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

238
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:29,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

239
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

240
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:33,978
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

241
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:34,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

242
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,339
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

243
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Reports of superintendent.

244
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on Italian scholarship winners.

245
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:40,781
[SPEAKER_09]: This evening we have Ms.

246
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,982
[SPEAKER_09]: DiCarlo, the Director of Foreign Language with us.

247
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:48,585
[SPEAKER_09]: She would like to provide details on two scholarships that were recently awarded to Medford High School students.

248
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:49,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

249
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:49,905
[SPEAKER_09]: DiCarlo.

250
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:51,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

251
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Rita DiCarlo, Foreign Language Director.

252
00:15:54,412 --> 00:16:10,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, two Medford High School students from AP Italian class each received a $1,000 scholarship from an Italian organization known as Federazione Associazione Abruzzese USA, or for short, FAA USA.

253
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:15,818
[SPEAKER_01]: The scholarships were made possible by the generosity of Joe Pace in memory of his mother.

254
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:22,560
[SPEAKER_01]: The two students who are here tonight are Joshua Crespo and Lina Zian.

255
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:32,655
[SPEAKER_01]: They were selected to receive the scholarships based on their grades and an essay that they each wrote on how Italian has impacted their lives.

256
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:38,558
[SPEAKER_01]: The awards were given at a gala celebration at Filippo's Restaurant at the north end of Boston.

257
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:48,423
[SPEAKER_01]: The two students were accompanied to the festa by family members and Italian teachers from Medford High School, including myself, Ms.

258
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:50,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicole Chalafo, and Ms.

259
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:52,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Bianca Hoffman, who are also here tonight.

260
00:16:54,318 --> 00:17:03,821
[SPEAKER_01]: That evening, first Joshua and then Lena impressed about 150 guests at Filippo's restaurant with their speeches in Italian.

261
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:15,764
[SPEAKER_01]: This was evident by the enthusiastic applauses they each received, especially when each student made reference to a particular Italian soccer team by the name of Juventus.

262
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:30,384
[SPEAKER_01]: We at Medford High School are very proud of Lena and Joshua, and I would be amiss if I didn't mention my appreciation for the level of instructions that these students received in Italian before they got to the AP level.

263
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of these teachers are here tonight in support of the students.

264
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:35,526
[SPEAKER_01]: They are Ms.

265
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:40,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicole Schellifel, as I mentioned before, who was Lena's teacher last year, and Ms.

266
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:43,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Bianca Hoffman, who was Joshua's teacher last year.

267
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:46,432
[SPEAKER_01]: These two teachers are a sample of

268
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:54,723
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers that we, the type of teachers that we have in our department and in our schools who are very dedicated to their students.

269
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Just their presence here tonight is a testament to that.

270
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,328
[SPEAKER_01]: They're here to support their students.

271
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:02,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

272
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. Carlo.

273
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:09,275
[SPEAKER_09]: If the teachers that are present this evening as well as the students could step forward, we'd like to present these awards.

274
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:34,155
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Lena Zian for her achievement in the study of Italian and recipient of FAA USA scholarship 2016.

275
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:34,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

276
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:35,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

277
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Joshua Crespo for the achievement in the study of Italian as well.

278
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:47,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Joshua, congratulations.

279
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:47,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

280
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:53,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert, do you want to say a few words, maybe in Italian?

281
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Lina, would you like to say a few words, possibly in Italian and English?

282
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:00,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Either one.

283
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:01,815
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

284
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,629
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll say it in English first.

285
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:09,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks a lot for the award.

286
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:12,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do like Italian.

287
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:21,902
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of my favorite subjects in school, and it's one of the subjects where I'm really motivated to go in and learn, and also to learn outside of school.

288
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:28,368
[SPEAKER_13]: So, grazie mille, e voglio ringraziare le mie professoresse.

289
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Grazie.

290
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:29,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

291
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

292
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

293
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful job all of you.

294
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:39,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

295
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:13,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Anne-Marie, Anne-Marie, chow?

296
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive the report in place on file, Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

297
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:45,356
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

298
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:46,476
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

299
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

300
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Financial report.

301
00:20:50,677 --> 00:21:00,040
[SPEAKER_14]: So Madam Chairperson, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, maiden appearance tonight of our new Director of Finance Administration, Christine Patterson.

302
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Mr. Patterson.

303
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

304
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

305
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:10,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Mayor, members of the community and school committee, included in your packet is the financial report as of November 2nd.

306
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:15,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to answer any specific questions regarding it.

307
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, I would just like to highlight some areas with regard to the transition between the prior director of finance and myself.

308
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a smooth transition.

309
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:40,177
[SPEAKER_02]: As we go forward and review the budget, it is notable to identify that there were certain areas and subaccounts within our budget process that are more reflective of the DESI chart of accounts and reporting that's required at the state level.

310
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:44,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is indicated in the overall appropriation and budget line items.

311
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:55,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So although there may be some areas that look a mess, we are reviewing each of these and are working to contain those.

312
00:21:55,781 --> 00:22:08,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also notable to indicate that the new FACTS online payment plan has been quite a success with its first year implementation, including

313
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: collections of 1.4 million estimated for fiscal year 2017.

314
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:23,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, one of the categories that is always an area to monitor and watch are the utilities, energy consumption.

315
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:25,839
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter heating has not yet begun.

316
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:36,867
[SPEAKER_02]: The invoices have not started for the cooler temperatures, but we will be monitoring and watching those accounts very closely in the upcoming months to indicate if there are any

317
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,753
[SPEAKER_02]: areas for savings and or liquidation among certain accounts.

318
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:43,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

319
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:45,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any questions from the committee?

320
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry?

321
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:46,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Through you to Ms.

322
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:47,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson.

323
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great report.

324
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it's pages, but it's good.

325
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:53,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And one other thing, Ms.

326
00:22:53,402 --> 00:23:02,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson, I recently had the opportunity to attend open house at the high school, and a few of our student entrepreneurial groups had a problem.

327
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:06,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents wanted to buy merchandise and et cetera with a credit card.

328
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,464
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're unable to take credit cards.

329
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:24,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any way we can look into the possibility of trying to get the vocational school and the high school kids to be able to take credit cards if somebody wants to purchase, you know, a souvenir or their t-shirts or what have you in the school, in the store, the school store.

330
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a strong advocate for all online services payments as well.

331
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,941
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that has been, um,

332
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:36,089
[SPEAKER_02]: requested and addressed through our partnership at city hall.

333
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:37,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working on that.

334
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:37,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

335
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

336
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

337
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:40,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you ma'am.

338
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:41,512
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

339
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:42,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

340
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:43,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

341
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:44,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your first report.

342
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job.

343
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:46,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it very much.

344
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a question.

345
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:55,260
[SPEAKER_08]: The 1.4 million that we brought in, um, through the new tracking system and new payment programs.

346
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

347
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there an increase in revenue because,

348
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,856
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting more money in.

349
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:05,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we getting more money in because we're using the system?

350
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy to collect.

351
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And is this different from last year's amount?

352
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:10,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

353
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:13,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that this is more of the accurate tracking of it.

354
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:21,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much overall increased revenue, but it's much more contained and ease of payment plans.

355
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:26,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's much easier to reach out to families if there's a concern or if, um,

356
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:30,850
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a delinquency, we're able to track that and move on that more quickly.

357
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

358
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:45,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And my, my second question is more towards the superintendent and you're new, so you might not realize this, but I believe last year we had a motion that the community schools budget would be presented to us in a quarterly basis.

359
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:49,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time as this financial report, this is monthly.

360
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,317
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a monthly report.

361
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:55,638
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, we've had a lot of transitions.

362
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:57,018
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, Christine is,

363
00:24:57,552 --> 00:25:03,557
[SPEAKER_14]: been on board for a short period of time, and there's new people at City Hall, and there's new people in other roles.

364
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:08,702
[SPEAKER_14]: So the key thing for us is to get all that stuff together, but you'll have one certainly very soon.

365
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,744
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just putting it together.

366
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:12,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you add that to the requested reports?

367
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

368
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:16,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we haven't had one since last year.

369
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:19,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand the transition.

370
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:24,136
[SPEAKER_14]: They're working on that now, but she's trying to get her feet on the ground with some of the other pieces.

371
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:26,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just so we don't forget.

372
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:31,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And from the city side, the new CEO is also closing the books on June 30th.

373
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:35,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So until she physically hits the button to close, it's hard to get the carryover.

374
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:37,248
[SPEAKER_09]: The community schools is a carryover account.

375
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:37,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

376
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:38,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's revolving.

377
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything sort of rolls over.

378
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an idea when we'd see?

379
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,532
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say sometime in December we'll start to see this stuff.

380
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:46,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll do it regularly.

381
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

382
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:48,313
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

383
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:49,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't want to forget.

384
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:51,216
[SPEAKER_09]: This month it should happen.

385
00:25:51,356 --> 00:25:52,597
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you very much.

386
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,477
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great news.

387
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:53,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you.

388
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:54,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, trustee.

389
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:57,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Pollack, did you have a question on this?

390
00:25:58,298 --> 00:25:59,198
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not at this time.

391
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to accept the file.

392
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to accept the report and place on file.

393
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Ms.

394
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno.

395
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,980
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

396
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

397
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

398
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:09,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Report is placed on file.

399
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on professional development day.

400
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:12,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

401
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:15,963
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll call upon our deputy superintendent to provide this report.

402
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:19,394
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually gonna call on our team.

403
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:24,816
[SPEAKER_15]: This was very much a team effort, Diane Caldwell and Rocco Grover Silvestri.

404
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:30,698
[SPEAKER_15]: As all of you know, our professional, our full day of mandated professional development is tomorrow.

405
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:35,059
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it's for teachers and paraprofessionals.

406
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:46,482
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no school for students tomorrow and all teachers will report to Medford High School for their activities and the paraprofessionals will be at the McGlynn Middle School.

407
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:52,924
[SPEAKER_15]: This year's program represents a collaborative effort between administrators and faculty.

408
00:26:53,504 --> 00:27:03,147
[SPEAKER_15]: The new teacher's contract called for the establishment of a professional development committee that was comprised of six educators, six teachers, and six administrators.

409
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,388
[SPEAKER_15]: And that team has been hard at work since this spring.

410
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:15,770
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee's mission in the contract is to advise central administration on what teachers would like to see for professional development

411
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:24,463
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, we have had teacher surveys that the committee put together and collated, and two things, two themes emerged.

412
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:34,186
[SPEAKER_15]: One of those themes was that teachers wanted more choice in what they were selecting for professional development, and they wanted continuity.

413
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:45,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we've had so little mandated time until this contract for PD, we usually have a day, and then kind of the day people want to come to different things is on a voluntary basis.

414
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,565
[SPEAKER_15]: but now we have more mandated time.

415
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:56,888
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, with the committee taking the survey, the teachers identified three main areas that they would like our PD to focus on.

416
00:27:57,628 --> 00:28:05,410
[SPEAKER_15]: One of those areas is special education, a second is at-risk students, and a third is social-emotional learning.

417
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:15,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Our workshops tomorrow will focus on these topics, and we're gonna rotate all the teachers, K through 12, through a workshop

418
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:18,174
[SPEAKER_15]: each on each of these topics.

419
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:28,501
[SPEAKER_15]: The goal is that they will, after tomorrow, select one of them, one of the themes to follow through with for the remainder of the school year.

420
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:36,587
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll have that continuity to the professional development that, you know, basically follows the teacher's interest through the school year.

421
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:43,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, planning for this day has been a lot of effort, a lot of commitment.

422
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:48,078
[SPEAKER_15]: We've asked teachers to step up and our teachers are actually, we're really excited tomorrow.

423
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:57,181
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really, you know, it's been a lot of work and a lot of sometimes, a lot of details, but we're very excited because our teachers are going to deliver those workshops tomorrow to their peers.

424
00:28:57,281 --> 00:29:01,102
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's very, very exciting for us and they've been very committed to that process.

425
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:06,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to turn this over to Rocco because he has been so instrumental.

426
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:11,025
[SPEAKER_15]: He's there every step of the way with Diane and myself and Bernadette and all the administrators.

427
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,406
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say this too, all the administrators have stepped up.

428
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:16,632
[SPEAKER_15]: They are assisting in presenting these workshops.

429
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:19,754
[SPEAKER_15]: While the teachers, we've given them some compensation.

430
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:23,216
[SPEAKER_15]: The administrators have been doing this on their own time, and it's been a lot of extra work.

431
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,636
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank them.

432
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:25,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank our teachers.

433
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:29,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank our secretaries, who also have been attending to the details.

434
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:36,522
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that Jeannie Gliona and Michelle Bissell went around putting up signs for tomorrow, so all the teachers will know where to go.

435
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:41,245
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I'm going to turn it over to Rocco, because he's the linchpin to all this.

436
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:41,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

437
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,528
[SPEAKER_15]: And his family's watching him on TV.

438
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:48,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

439
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:49,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

440
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:50,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocco Grover Silvestri.

441
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:58,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the assistant principal at the Brooks, and in a way a de facto chairperson of the Professional Development Committee.

442
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:06,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could, I would have to start by saying that this was not just me.

443
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,568
[SPEAKER_00]: We came to this point because of the composition of the group.

444
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:16,430
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we worked together from the beginning, it was really what led us to this point.

445
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,872
[SPEAKER_00]: So, questions or if I could expand further?

446
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:24,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

447
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:24,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Kreatz.

448
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:29,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very interested in the topics that you selected.

449
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,869
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very interested in hearing about it.

450
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,010
[SPEAKER_16]: It just sounds wonderful.

451
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:43,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything, including working with at-risk students, identification intervention, safer spaces, positive attitudes.

452
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:52,536
[SPEAKER_16]: This is similar to what we had in my work, where the police department came in to just talk about

453
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:56,518
[SPEAKER_16]: safe space, walking in safe areas, just very interesting.

454
00:30:57,018 --> 00:31:00,258
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very similar to something I recently went to myself.

455
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:01,959
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds great.

456
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:02,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

457
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:03,799
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome to drop by.

458
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, it sounds like.

459
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:13,401
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically what we did is we, the teachers selected these themes, the professional development committee based on the surveys.

460
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:18,082
[SPEAKER_15]: And so again, the teachers had a hand in what they wanted to hear more about.

461
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:25,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And then what we did is we had one big meeting, and we divided them into elementary, middle, and high school.

462
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:31,874
[SPEAKER_15]: So there'll be an elementary workshop on social and emotional, a middle school workshop, and we're rotating the teachers during high school.

463
00:31:32,534 --> 00:31:37,675
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, people pretty much came up with their own topics within these main topics.

464
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:44,137
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you have one of the subsequent handouts, some of the names of some of the workshops.

465
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:45,718
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're quite excited.

466
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:55,033
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it would be a great day, and everybody was really coming together of everyone that made this possible, so we're kind of excited.

467
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:58,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Iraq was not excited.

468
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, a little, if I could, a little background.

469
00:32:00,737 --> 00:32:16,167
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, we poured over a lot of research, and we sought to build something from the ground up to look at what were the elements of the most effective, sustainable, impactful professional development models out there, and one of the elements that

470
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:24,075
[SPEAKER_00]: that became one of the core elements that we distilled from the literature was that it was teacher-led, teacher-driven.

471
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:35,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the impetus for distributing or administering this survey, which we were proud to say we got, you know, a significant majority of staff to respond back.

472
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:38,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And these three topics were the three most

473
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:48,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, it fits into that mold that we wanted to create and having this be relevant to what teachers actually wanted.

474
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:54,564
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we have a lot of expertise, just with our own teachers.

475
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,785
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the teachers really stepped up.

476
00:32:57,265 --> 00:33:00,387
[SPEAKER_17]: They had administrators maybe doing some of the copying for them, but that's okay.

477
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:01,307
[SPEAKER_17]: We all work together.

478
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,629
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a team effort, I believe.

479
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:12,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that teachers and administrators are going to get more out of it because we're such a collaborative unit on this.

480
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

481
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:13,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

482
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:14,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Van der Kloot.

483
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:15,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

484
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:16,823
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of different things.

485
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:19,945
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, it looks like it's going to be an interesting and exciting program.

486
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:27,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you guys know, I just attended the school committee

487
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:36,336
[SPEAKER_12]: conference down at the Cape this past couple of days last week and it was all centered on social emotional learning.

488
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:46,487
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the truly exceptional parts that we heard about was from a woman who made just an incredible presentation and I would like to tell my colleagues more about it at a different point.

489
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,609
[SPEAKER_12]: However, it looks great.

490
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,251
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of different things.

491
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:50,772
[SPEAKER_12]: I am

492
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:54,754
[SPEAKER_12]: extremely happy to see that there is a workshop for the paraprofessionals.

493
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:55,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's terrific.

494
00:33:56,695 --> 00:34:17,868
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I read the letter that was put out to faculty, and I realized that this had been something that I had caught at one point and then forgot about it, but it would seem to me that next year I would like that rather than teachers having to bring their own bag lunch that we could supply, the Medford Public Schools could supply lunch for our teachers.

495
00:34:18,318 --> 00:34:30,107
[SPEAKER_12]: as a thank you, because somehow or another it strikes me when we're doing a day of professional development for our valued teachers that the least we could do is to say, hey, lunch is on us.

496
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:39,454
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I could put it in the form of a motion that next year at a professional development day, or if it comes later this day, that the Medford Public Schools would be

497
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:44,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I would provide lunch for our teachers.

498
00:34:45,611 --> 00:34:46,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think it would be a wonderful thing.

499
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:48,172
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I could make that motion.

500
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:49,953
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

501
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:50,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Ms.

502
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:52,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Villanueva, seconded by Ms.

503
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:53,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Disceri, and Ms.

504
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:54,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno.

505
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:55,215
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

506
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:56,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

507
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:56,956
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

508
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:58,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

509
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,377
[SPEAKER_12]: So write it down.

510
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:01,358
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

511
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:04,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry we couldn't do it this year, but at least next year it should happen.

512
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.

513
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it works out and it's a beautiful day for you guys.

514
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

515
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:14,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive this report and place on file.

516
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:15,144
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

517
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:16,325
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

518
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

519
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:20,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on college fair, Mr. Superintendent.

520
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:24,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, the college fair was held on October 26.

521
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:30,270
[SPEAKER_14]: There were 88 different colleges and institutions represented.

522
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,731
[SPEAKER_14]: The place was packed.

523
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,731
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people participated.

524
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:35,952
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of work goes into it.

525
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:48,755
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been going on for many, many years, and it's really critical that our young people get a good start to find out what their options are, to talk to the different representatives about financial aid, what they can do.

526
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,326
[SPEAKER_14]: to move forward.

527
00:35:50,346 --> 00:36:04,572
[SPEAKER_14]: There was also a presentation by Jan Hollenbeck and Charlotte Hyam with regard to special needs students who would like to go to higher education and accommodation plans and how to access those as well.

528
00:36:05,572 --> 00:36:08,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Alice Beth Fitzpatrick from the Voc Guidance Department.

529
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I did a piece on transition to college.

530
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:16,191
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of other pieces that go into it besides just simply the booths.

531
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:26,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's one of the most successful nights we run because people really participate, they really learn a lot, and they come away with a better sense of what they have to do to prepare for college.

532
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:27,603
[SPEAKER_14]: College is not cheap.

533
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:32,143
[SPEAKER_14]: So you've got to make the right decisions, things that are going to work for you, and you've got to plan well ahead.

534
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:33,966
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this is a great night.

535
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:40,015
[SPEAKER_14]: It was another good example of people at work, and Amelia and her staff did a great job.

536
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:40,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

537
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:41,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

538
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:42,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno, on this paper?

539
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

540
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say thank you to everyone who does participate in this.

541
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there's a lot of work behind this.

542
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:54,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And each and every year, it just seems like it gets more successful each and every year.

543
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:57,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does take a lot of work for everyone to do this.

544
00:36:58,163 --> 00:37:09,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess one of the things that I never asked, but I guess I'm curious and knowing is, if there's a way next year when we put it on, is as kids are walking in, maybe have a list of,

545
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:15,914
[SPEAKER_06]: what school they go to, what year they're in, because I know that it is open to all schools.

546
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:17,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just Medford High School students.

547
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm curious in knowing what other schools do attend our college night.

548
00:37:23,062 --> 00:37:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a curiosity, because I know a lot of the parochial schools, and I know children that are going to charter schools also come to that college fair.

549
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there are people other than our own students who come.

550
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

551
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

552
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:34,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

553
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And even our own students just to know what, I don't need names.

554
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:40,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to know what year they're in and what schools they go to.

555
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:41,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

556
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:46,066
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to seconded by Mr. Skerry.

557
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:46,847
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

558
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:48,187
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

559
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:51,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes and motion to plate receive in place on file.

560
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,430
[SPEAKER_09]: This report offered by Ms.

561
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno seconded by Mr. Skerry.

562
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,871
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

563
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:57,331
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

564
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:58,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

565
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:58,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

566
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:01,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on TV forum and testing session.

567
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:05,977
[SPEAKER_14]: So we gave a previous report on this, and I just want to get you the follow up.

568
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:07,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony Vento was here.

569
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:10,161
[SPEAKER_14]: She did a great job getting this in place.

570
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:13,223
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the report in front of you, so you don't have to go in great detail.

571
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:18,187
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was successful in getting most of the students and most of the people who were identified.

572
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:21,009
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there were only three people that did not.

573
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:21,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony, come on up.

574
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven didn't.

575
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:25,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Something of that small number.

576
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:26,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Three were absent.

577
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:28,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And there may be some follow ups on that as well.

578
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,612
[SPEAKER_14]: But we had a good forum with parents in the auditorium.

579
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:39,837
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't hugely attended, probably 25 people, but people asked a lot of good questions and a lot of good answers came up.

580
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:43,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead, Tonya.

581
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,703
[SPEAKER_18]: We did very well with the program and all the follow-up.

582
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:56,488
[SPEAKER_18]: The day of the testing, we went through about, let's see, we tested about almost 200

583
00:38:57,645 --> 00:38:58,025
[SPEAKER_18]: students.

584
00:38:58,065 --> 00:39:00,988
[SPEAKER_18]: We were collecting skin tests from pediatricians.

585
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:03,429
[SPEAKER_18]: We drew blood at the high school.

586
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,312
[SPEAKER_18]: The day went off without a hitch.

587
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:11,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, all the students and faculty returned to their classrooms without incident.

588
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:22,564
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to acknowledge the work of the high school nurses, because they were instrumental in developing a testing schedule, and they had maintained integrity to that testing schedule.

589
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:23,845
[SPEAKER_18]: We finished ahead of time.

590
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:30,263
[SPEAKER_18]: They also collected and organized and documented a lot of test results and medical information.

591
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:36,144
[SPEAKER_18]: So they were really very well appreciated on that day and through this event.

592
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:44,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Our challenges are just following up with faculty and students who have not either submitted testing or who did not get tested.

593
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:49,128
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have whittled that down to about 19 people.

594
00:39:50,783 --> 00:40:00,986
[SPEAKER_18]: that we are reaching out to either find out if they've been to their primary care physician or if they need to get tested and we'll facilitate that testing.

595
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:06,367
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where we are now, but overall it was a successful event.

596
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:09,128
[SPEAKER_18]: We were really pleased it went off without any problems.

597
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,051
[SPEAKER_09]: When will we get the results from the tests?

598
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:14,193
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of the results have come in.

599
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:20,437
[SPEAKER_18]: We have taken the responsibility to mailing home any negative results.

600
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:28,463
[SPEAKER_18]: The Department of Public Health, they will handle anybody who has a positive result and needs further evaluation.

601
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:33,306
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're dealing with that's a very small number of people.

602
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:36,803
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also just want to thank the city nurses as well.

603
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:37,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

604
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:41,526
[SPEAKER_09]: 33 absolutely performed by the city hall nurse.

605
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:45,068
[SPEAKER_18]: And Janet Leahy has come up to the high school to place some tests.

606
00:40:45,408 --> 00:40:48,630
[SPEAKER_18]: So we were very happy to have her be involved with us.

607
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,032
[SPEAKER_09]: It's truly a collaborative between school and state.

608
00:40:52,312 --> 00:40:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for all your work.

609
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:54,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

610
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:55,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Important matter.

611
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:56,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Ms.

612
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:58,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Vandekloot, do you have a question on this paper?

613
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:00,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

614
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:02,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file.

615
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:06,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto, thank you.

616
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:28,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a comment because I got a lot of positive feedback about communication that the the school Really reached out not only to the school community, but to the whole community and kept them informed all along So we do we have any other active cases in our high school just so that people can hear that on camera.

617
00:41:28,537 --> 00:41:29,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not

618
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:33,816
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good, that's what really we need to say out loud so that way everybody knows where we're at.

619
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:34,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

620
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:51,788
[SPEAKER_18]: And this testing will be repeated again in January because it's difficult to know if any results that were determined now were because of exposure to this one student or because of another inadvertent exposure.

621
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:57,792
[SPEAKER_18]: So it all gets repeated in January and we'll take it from there and see where that leads.

622
00:41:58,361 --> 00:41:58,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

623
00:41:59,082 --> 00:41:59,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

624
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:05,488
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Mr. Scurry, seconded by Ms.

[SPEAKER_14]: So Madam Mayor, we're going to call upon our Director or Principal of the Vocational School to update us on this report.

632
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:26,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke and Superintendent Belson, District Committee.

633

[SPEAKER_07]: On October 25, 2016, Medford Technical High School hosted their annual fall advisory board meeting for each of the 20 career and technical education programs.

634
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:46,011
[SPEAKER_07]: With over 150 members in attendance, the intention of this meeting was to bring industry and education together in one forum.

635
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:58,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Held each fall and spring, the advisory boards play a significant role in the curriculum, development, and equipment necessary to train the students for jobs in the current and future workforce.

636
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:09,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Mara Russell from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education was in attendance to approve the programming and web development program.

637
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:21,793
[SPEAKER_07]: She was impressed by the number of professionals that came, the space provided for the new program, and the work that has been done to improve existing programs and increase career and technical opportunities for students of Medford.

638
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:37,156
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to this, Medford Vocational Technical High School would also like to seek approval to attend the fall state leaderships in November, which is an overnight event held each year.

639
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:39,857
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be our fourth year going to this event.

640
00:43:39,977 --> 00:43:41,798
[SPEAKER_07]: It is held in Marlborough, Massachusetts.

641
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:45,059
[SPEAKER_07]: There are four students and one advisor in attendance.

642
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:02,979
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion that the school committee approves sending the students to the conference in Marvel, when is it?

643
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:03,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

644
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:04,861
[SPEAKER_09]: When is it?

645
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:06,863
[SPEAKER_07]: It's November 20th, 21st and 22nd.

646
00:44:15,262 --> 00:44:25,505
[SPEAKER_04]: made of plastic these days, and I think that would really be beneficial for the students.

647
00:44:43,152 --> 00:44:50,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We find out in the next two weeks if we're awarded an auto collision repair, um, national grant, it's a makeover grant.

648
00:44:50,316 --> 00:44:52,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll let you know if we need additional funds.

649
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we do receive that, it would be one of the items that's purchased.

650
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:55,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

651
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

652
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

653
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:57,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

654
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:02,063
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion that we approve the student's attendance in the next few weeks.

655

656
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:03,765

00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:07,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Kreatz, Ms.

659
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:08,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustone, Mr. Skerry.

660
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:08,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

661
00:45:08,868 --> 00:45:08,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

662
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:09,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Vander Kloop.

663
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:12,406
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

664
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:13,269
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

665
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:14,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck out there.

666
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

667
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:16,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

668
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:26,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we go into potentially an executive session for negotiations and legal matters, I just wanted to make an announcement that obviously tomorrow is election day.

669
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So please, if you didn't have an opportunity to early vote, the city hit 20% in our early voting cycle.

670
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really proud of that number.

671
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:39,763
[SPEAKER_09]: The city clerk's office and the registrar's office worked really, really hard over the past couple of weeks.

672
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:41,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people participated.

673
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,444
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you didn't, please get out there tomorrow.

674
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:46,405
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a report in here on the mock

675
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:50,409
[SPEAKER_09]: mock presidential debate that the students at Medford High School had.

676
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend this year.

677
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:56,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I did go for their primary mock debate, but it's interesting on the questions.

678
00:45:56,756 --> 00:46:02,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't read who they voted for in the presidential race, but the question one was a no, 137 votes to 66.

679
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:09,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Question two was a no, 169 to 37 votes.

680
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:13,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Question three, a no, 78 to 24.

681
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:18,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And question four was a yes, 150 to 70 in the affirmative.

682
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:22,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So very interesting results, and we'll see how they play out tomorrow.

683
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:23,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

684
00:46:23,256 --> 00:46:23,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Van der Kloot.

685
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:36,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, myself and school committee member Kathy Kreatz were able to attend the wonderful mock presidential debate and it was so much fun and our students just did such a great job.

686
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:40,903
[SPEAKER_12]: They did a particularly good job in really trying to develop

687
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:49,648
[SPEAKER_12]: really some understanding of what the candidates were putting forth for policy, which, as we all know, has sometimes been difficult this year.

688
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:52,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So, anyway, it was just, knock your socks off, great.

689
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:54,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only the issues, but the persona of the candidates.

690
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, the personas were just stunning.

691
00:46:57,512 --> 00:47:07,377
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the same handout, I just wanted to bring attention that the media students at MHS have developed a special video which takes a stand against domestic violence.

692
00:47:08,597 --> 00:47:11,240
[SPEAKER_12]: and because October was Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

693
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:27,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Jack Dempsey, the media teacher, submitted a copy to the video to the MIAA, and though we didn't win this year, but remember we won last year, so someone else has to have a turn, they were so impressed with it, and that it's going to be used, be presented,

694
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,183
[SPEAKER_12]: for their wellness educators workshop being held on December 5th.

695
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Prior to the meeting tonight, I took a minute to go online and take a look at it.

696
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:37,207
[SPEAKER_12]: It is just great.

697
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:43,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just, it was really, it just really pulled at you emotionally.

698
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:47,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's simple, it's direct, it's just wonderful.

699
00:47:47,113 --> 00:47:52,697
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to make sure I mentioned that and congratulated the students and Mr. Dempsey for their work.

700
00:47:53,197 --> 00:47:56,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like our Attorney General is going to link it up with her site as well.

701
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:58,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So kudos to the kids on that accomplishment.

702
00:47:59,018 --> 00:47:59,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Great video.

703
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:01,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ms.

704
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:02,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz, you're blinking.

705
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:07,800
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to say it was a great job at the debate.

706
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,420
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was really fun.

707
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:14,441
[SPEAKER_16]: The same thing that Paulette said was the students did a great job.

708
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,422
[SPEAKER_16]: It was entertaining.

709
00:48:15,902 --> 00:48:16,802
[SPEAKER_16]: It was informative.

710
00:48:16,882 --> 00:48:18,402
[SPEAKER_16]: It was real life.

711
00:48:18,722 --> 00:48:19,722
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really fun.

712
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:21,063
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so glad it could be a game.

713
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:23,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

714
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:24,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

715
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say congratulations to the students that, not only the students, but the video that Ms.

716
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:36,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot was just talking about, the Just Say No video, is really well done.

717
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:38,437
[SPEAKER_06]: It was done professionally.

718
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It was done with heart and soul.

719
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I was able to see it, and I was able to actually share it with a lot of people.

720
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:49,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you haven't seen it, to really take that moment to look it up.

721
00:48:50,178 --> 00:49:01,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll not only impress you by what the message is all about, but also impress you of who our kids are and the high school students that we are developing and the

722
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:11,269
[SPEAKER_06]: the community part of that, too, because it's not just students, but it's everyone from administration to teachers to our custodians to police officers.

723
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:16,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a community video and I was very, very impressed by that.

724
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:29,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Second of all, I do want to say, since you did bring up the voting for tomorrow, I want to say thank you to my colleague, Paulette Van der Kloot, who's really been going around advocating for just for question two,

725
00:49:30,753 --> 00:49:34,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully people will vote no on that.

726
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:41,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say that I would be really remiss if I don't say it because it's just really frustrated me a lot.

727
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,263
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is listening to our governor's commercial.

728
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:53,046
[SPEAKER_06]: As a parent, as a school committee member, I have to say,

729
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:58,196
[SPEAKER_09]: We're close to a line here on speaking about a question.

730
00:49:58,236 --> 00:50:15,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel that if someone in that position comes out and says, you know, this is a different choice if your district is failing, I just have to say, whether it's political or not, shame on the person who's saying that, because under that person's watch, not one district should be failing.

731
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:17,070
[SPEAKER_06]: We're crossing the line.

732
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but it's very important.

733
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:18,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

734
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:19,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

735
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:20,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

736
00:50:21,294 --> 00:50:22,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Changing the subject.

737
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:23,715
Thank you.

738
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:31,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a call this afternoon, and I just wanted to bring it forward because the gentleman on the phone thought it was important to bring forward.

739
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:42,872
[SPEAKER_08]: He had heard that other communities give children time to pray at school throughout the school day, and asked if we were in any way doing that in any of our schools.

740
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:44,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

741
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:47,474
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we don't do that.

742
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:51,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if people want to take a little quiet time and meditate, they can, you know, but we don't

743
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:53,813
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't ask anyone to pray.

744
00:50:53,953 --> 00:50:55,114
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't make this specific.

745
00:50:55,154 --> 00:50:58,697
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not us asking, but allowing children time to pray during school.

746
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:02,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Beginning of the school day, if a youngster wants to put his head down and do something, that's fine.

747
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:05,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, but I don't think, there's nothing formal from us.

748
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,362
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good because this person was concerned of keeping state and church things separate.

749
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:19,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And just wanted it to be on the record this evening, and I would express that I would ask you the question so he could publicly see that.

750
00:51:20,905 --> 00:51:21,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

751
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:21,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

752
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:22,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

753
00:51:23,386 --> 00:51:25,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Item seven, negotiations and legal matters.

754
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:27,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to go into executive session?

755
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:29,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed by Ms.

756
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:31,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

757
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:33,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

758
00:51:40,614 --> 00:51:42,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

759
00:51:42,775 --> 00:51:44,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We will now enter executive session.

760
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:46,957
[SPEAKER_09]: We will adjourn from that.

761
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:49,278
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll come out of executive session briefly and adjourn.
