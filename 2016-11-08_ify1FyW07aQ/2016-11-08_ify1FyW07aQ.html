    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=79.795s">place</a>  on October 24th and was called to order by myself at 645. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=84.919s">Present</a>  were Erinda Benedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mastone, Robert Scurry, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=90.843s">Five</a>  school committee members present, two absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=93.605s">Also</a>  present was Superintendent Belson, Headmaster Perella, Vocational Principal Director Heidi Riccio, Director of Buildings and Grounds John McLaughlin, and parent Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=106.353s">After</a>  saluting the flag, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=108.145s">And</a>  after the purpose of the meeting was stated, which was to review the high school vocational school elements of the proposed capital plan and to do a selected tour of the facility, I called on Superintendent Belson for an overview of the evening's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=122.597s">The</a>  superintendent handed out additional copies of the capital plan and a prepared document proposal from the vocational school, which is attached to this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=131.345s">The</a>  superintendent stated that it would not be possible to view the entire high school <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=135.33s">or</a>  vocational school in one evening, but that the headmaster and vocational principal, along with Director McLaughlin, would identify priority sites for viewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=144.574s">The</a>  topic of overall technology upgrades would be referred to a subsequent session, since this was a major topic with system-wide implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=152.797s">Major</a>  systems like the roof and HVAC must be part of our overall planning as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=156.899s">We</a>  have done a roof study and will have a recommendation in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=161.02s">The</a>  superintendent then explained that capital planning must be focused on major projects, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=165.5s">general</a>  maintenance upgrades for the most part belonging in an enhanced operational budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=170.144s">Also,</a>  that school system capital needs would be part of a larger citywide initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=174.828s">Further,</a>  it is important that we view capital plan issues not only as upgrades to facilities, but also as part of a long-term vision for the development of school system capacity and educational opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=187.518s">He</a>  went on to say, as we recapture certain <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=190.321s">Out</a>  of district payments, we must reinvest into our programs in a strategic manner and anticipate the future, not just to upgrade the present facility bit by bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=200.645s">Committee</a>  members recognized the capital mission, but wanted the administration to plan for greater maintenance investment going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=207.347s">The</a>  committee then began a tour of selected sites led by headmaster and vocational principal director and buildings and grounds director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=215.382s">First,</a>  we went to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=217.284s">Dr.</a>  Perella focused on the ways the library has been altered from its original design over the past 45 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=222.908s">He</a>  noted that natural lighting has been lost to the addition of several office spaces and also that the general condition of the library has deteriorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=231.634s">It</a>  would be his plan to redesign the library into an open space media center reflecting upon the advance of technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=238.038s">The</a>  library would flow into the courtyard and be a multipurpose epicenter for students and faculty exploration and utilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=245.298s">He</a>  explained that the initial design and planning had already begun as a result of the XQ Project Academy of the Possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=252.646s">The</a>  tour of the library ended with an agreement to formalize the design by utilizing the expertise of an architect engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=259.234s">The</a>  next tour moved to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=262.237s">Director</a>  Riccio explained that her number one priority was the relocation of the culinary arts <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=267.29s">and</a>  hospitality program to an accessible location for the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=271.292s">The</a>  director reviewed the draft floor plan and explained how the current programs would be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=277.034s">Medford</a>  will pursue a state capital skills grant, but it will require matching funds for construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=282.357s">This</a>  would include gas and water lines, electricity, flooring, lighting, doors, ADA accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=288.92s">This</a>  grant is now being released by the Commonwealth with applications due in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=294.219s">The</a>  total revamp of the vocational school beyond the culinary arts hospitality project will involve the development of an academy model that groups the various offerings into like clusters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=304.404s">Long-term</a>  development should be pursued in conjunction with MSBA to the extent possible under their priorities and guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=311.627s">The</a>  committee then reconvened in the conference room to recap their tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=315.388s">The</a>  superintendent indicated that it will be necessary to consider the relocation of certain programs such as early childhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=321.712s">and</a>  office space to free up areas for program development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=325.214s">The</a>  committee will await follow-up materials to continue its capital planning for the complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=330.238s">The</a>  meeting was adjourned at 8.45 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=334.24s">And</a>  if I could just add, the tour and the vision that we were presented with at the <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=341.675s">was</a>  truly inspirational and very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=344.816s">And</a>  you take the step back and you realize you're not just looking at the smaller pieces of maintenance, which of course are extremely necessary, but kind of a bigger vision and a plan into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=358.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=358.741s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=359.561s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=360.561s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=360.661s">Cugno,</a>  are you blinking?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=363.706s">It's</a>  a motion to receive this report and place on file and keep it with the rest of the capital plans that we've looked at at other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=371.614s">On</a>  the motion for approval, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=373.776s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=391.339s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=391.639s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=392.66s">Suspension</a>  is granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=393.54s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=393.72s">Kreatz,</a>  you'd like to provide an update on a report item.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=400.242s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=400.482s">I'd</a>  like to provide an update on the crossing guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=401.823s">Kathy,</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=402.183s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=402.463s">Oh,</a>  am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=402.643s">Oh,</a>  can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=403.023s">No,</a>  she's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=403.484s">Now</a>  you're better.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=403.984s">OK,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=404.384s">I</a>  was blocking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=405.844s">Yeah,</a>  so I'm going to provide an update on the crossing guide on the corner of Fulton Street and Felsway and Park and the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=416.259s">The</a>  road is a state road, so we have to contact the state and the DCR office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=422.942s">What</a>  I've done since our last meeting is I've attended the police neighborhood meeting in my neighborhood, along with Mayor and John Falco, and a lot of the other community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=433.407s">And</a>  another person there was Sheriff Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=436.448s">And</a>  the community, parents, police, and students expressed the need for a crossing guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=443.271s">So</a>  I reached out to state, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=445.672s">Pat</a>  Jalen's office and spoke to Matt Hartman, and he let me know that the DCR was in touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=454.214s">The</a>  DCR is going to send out some Rangers this week to monitor the crosswalks at Park Street and Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=461.075s">I'm</a>  sorry, yeah, Park Street and Felsway and Fulton Street and Felsway to determine if they can put crossing guards there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=470.797s">Matt</a>  will stay in touch with the DCR on the progress and the findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=474.318s">Additionally,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=475.671s">they</a>  made a request with the engineering department at the DCR to ask them if they can change the timing on the pedestrian crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=485.398s">They</a>  don't know the outcome of this request, but they will continue to stay in touch with the DCR to see if there's anything they can do to improve the Felsway crossing and make it safer for all residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=499.709s">Additionally,</a>  I received a call from State Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=503.031s">Paul</a>  Donato's office <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=504.542s">And</a>  he let me know that his folks have also been in touch with the DCR and State Senator Jalen's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=510.845s">And</a>  they're both on target. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=512.426s">They've</a>  both been in touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=514.147s">And</a>  we're just waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=516.048s">I</a>  guess the funds are limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=519.189s">And</a>  they're going to do an evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=521.85s">Another</a>  concern that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=523.211s">Rodriguez</a>  brought up was the timing of the evaluation that they're doing is this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=529.174s">And</a>  there are two days with no school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=531.855s">I</a>  did reach back to them and let them know that, you know, would they possibly be able to do another evaluation next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=538.737s">That</a>  request was put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=540.398s">We're</a>  not too sure if that's something that they can do, but we did ask if they can send the ranges out there next week and do another evaluation of that section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=550.76s">So,</a>  that was the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=552.921s">I'll</a>  continue to monitor this with both offices and provide any new updates that I get. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=558.163s">And,</a>  Cheryl, did you want to say anything?</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=562.228s">Name</a>  and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=564.109s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=565.369s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=567.69s">Thank</a>  you for following up on that with the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=571.951s">I</a>  just spoke to Matt myself this morning and expressed my concerns that the evaluation is happening when there are two no-school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=580.234s">It's</a>  also happening with the Veterans Day holidays, so the commuters will probably be less likely to be crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=587.116s">It's</a>  also mid-November. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=588.336s">It's</a>  cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=589.997s">The</a>  crossing guards at our school know that a lot more cars are driven to school during these months because it is cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=595.838s">And</a>  many families that I have spoken to, and myself included, tend to not walk... What was I going to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=604.32s">I</a>  just lost my train of thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=605.38s">I</a>  just dropped it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=607.161s">They</a>  tend to not cross that street because it is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=610.081s">My</a>  daughter's best friend lives on the other side of that street, and I wouldn't walk her if I... <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=614.142s">If</a>  my car broke down, I wouldn't walk across that street because it's unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=618.305s">So</a>  I'm not sure that an evaluation to determine if there is a high volume of pedestrians would really yield the appropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=626.605s">action</a>  because there are less pedestrians because they don't feel safe crossing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=630.527s">Even</a>  when we had our walking Wednesdays, they made sure that they walked down to the lights, but they had to hustle at that Fulton and Felsway because the light is timed at 14 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=638.95s">It's</a>  a five-lane road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=640.711s">So</a>  that's pretty impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=642.732s">I</a>  know that John Falco had mentioned at the school committee meeting that he himself has to pick up the pace in order to make it across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=649.275s">during</a>  that 14 second interval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=651.317s">So</a>  I'm hopeful that Matt had suggested perhaps this body could write a letter to send to them with our concerns that they are valid, that there will be less pedestrians, that it is a vacation week, and that people are avoiding the road because it is <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=666.91s">less</a>  safe.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=668.151s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=668.591s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=669.351s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=669.771s">I</a>  also just want to comment that we've been in touch with commissioner Roy of the DCR as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=674.013s">In</a>  this matter, we heard the calls from the community meeting as well as the city council, the city school committee actually mentioned it, I think a few weeks ago, Mr. Superintendent, and it's on a report request due as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=685.759s">So</a>  we have already voted to send a letter to the DCR and to pursue it through our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=691.321s">So</a>  that is taking place and we will keep continue to monitor it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=696.752s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=697.593s">I'd</a>  like to applaud my colleague Kathy Kreatz for her diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=701.276s">This</a>  is a problem that we've had with DCI for over two years and finally we're making some headway and hopefully we can come to a conclusion that parents and students are happy with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=710.765s">I</a>  hope they will see the need that is there and get somebody there as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=716.751s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=719.736s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=719.916s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=720.657s">Yes,</a>  I know that we, you just mentioned too, that we have the letter that we were going to send out and I just want to make sure that when we send out the letter that we also amendment with the <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=731.079s">with</a>  the consideration that even though the Rangers are coming out to test and to evaluate what's going on, that it would make sense that they would do it during the school time while there are children crossing and adults crossing and that there's full-fledged type of traffic going on, not on a holiday and not on a professional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=751.983s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=753.184s">So</a>  I find it more effective sometimes to talk directly to the people because you can cover the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=759.445s">The</a>  letter is a <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=760.388s">paragraph</a>  or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=761.969s">And</a>  one of the things that did take place in the last week or so, which I think is encouraging, is the fact that the revenue from the state has gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=770.453s">And</a>  because the revenue has gone up, I'm sure a lot of the agencies were sitting there saying, I can't spend any money because I'm going to get cut.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=776.057s">Or</a>  hired.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=776.937s">I</a>  can't hire anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=778.418s">So</a>  if revenue continues to be solid at the state, if we can see another bump, I suspect that maybe something like DCR might say, well, OK, I can take this chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=788.023s">But</a>  a lot of these agencies are concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=790.283s">that,</a>  you know, they hire, and then all of a sudden, or they've been told not to hire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=794.644s">And</a>  what happens is that they are in a situation where they're going to then scramble for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=799.506s">So</a>  as the fiscal situation stabilizes, the governor has pulled back in his request to start 9C cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=806.848s">The</a>  legislature asked him to hold back on that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=810.189s">The</a>  revenue projections for this month were a lot stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=812.93s">In</a>  fact, they're meeting their targets right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=814.471s">They're</a>  a few dollars under, but they should expect another rush in this next little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=818.913s">So</a>  that's all encouraging, because that's in the background of why an agency will hire or not hire.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=824.275s">Well,</a>  they were in a freeze pattern.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=825.416s">They</a>  were in a freeze pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=826.296s">So</a>  that's probably part of the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=828.397s">So</a>  hopefully, we hit it at the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=830.698s">We</a>  say, look, you're stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=832.219s">This</a>  is something that's necessary.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=834.98s">Could</a>  we mock Mr. Benedetto in attendance, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=837.402s">Mr.</a>  Secretary? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=839.079s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=840.2s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=841.381s">I</a>  apologize for being late. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=843.643s">Just</a>  to follow up with the phone calls, what I find that really helps, sorry, that's Lint, that I do the phone call and I do a follow-up email so there's a paper trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=855.152s">Because</a>  I feel like once you really put it in paper, that they have a trail, like they've requested this 20 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=864.159s">Now,</a>  I know we've talked about this in years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=867.022s">I</a>  was a little late coming in tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=868.943s">So</a>  if we can say consistently for the last three years, our community has requested this, and we have these emails to prove it, or this paper trail to prove it, that they'll take it serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=881.333s">It's</a>  like the little pest that keeps poking you until you do what they want them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=885.997s">So</a>  I would like to see a paper trail with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=888.518s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=888.779s">Also</a>  as a comment to on the requested reports, if we could go back to adding the dates requested on that, on that, that would be helpful because we were doing that for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=899.404s">And</a>  then, um, that would be helpful for me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=903.966s">And</a>  for our committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=906.047s">So,</a>  um, I, I appreciate the phone calls, Mr. Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=909.409s">And</a>  I know that that personal touch really comes with a lot of clout from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=913.602s">But</a>  I think the follow-up email sends a little bit like, we're documenting, pay attention.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=918.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[ACxsV5H4ehA_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=950.526s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=951.306s">Rita</a>  DiCarlo, Foreign Language Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=954.412s">Recently,</a>  two Medford High School students from AP Italian class each received a $1,000 scholarship from an Italian organization known as Federazione Associazione Abruzzese USA, or for short, FAA USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=971.017s">The</a>  scholarships were made possible by the generosity of Joe Pace in memory of his mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=976.478s">The</a>  two students who are here tonight are Joshua Crespo and Lina Zian. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=983.65s">They</a>  were selected to receive the scholarships based on their grades and an essay that they each wrote on how Italian has impacted their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=993.295s">The</a>  awards were given at a gala celebration at Filippo's Restaurant at the north end of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=999.338s">The</a>  two students were accompanied to the festa by family members and Italian teachers from Medford High School, including myself, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1008.463s">Nicole</a>  Chalafo, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1010.063s">Bianca</a>  Hoffman, who are also here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1014.318s">That</a>  evening, first Joshua and then Lena impressed about 150 guests at Filippo's restaurant with their speeches in Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1024.641s">This</a>  was evident by the enthusiastic applauses they each received, especially when each student made reference to a particular Italian soccer team by the name of Juventus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1036.857s">We</a>  at Medford High School are very proud of Lena and Joshua, and I would be amiss if I didn't mention my appreciation for the level of instructions that these students received in Italian before they got to the AP level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1051.484s">Two</a>  of these teachers are here tonight in support of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1055.006s">They</a>  are Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1055.586s">Nicole</a>  Schellifel, as I mentioned before, who was Lena's teacher last year, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1060.729s">Bianca</a>  Hoffman, who was Joshua's teacher last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1064.071s">These</a>  two teachers are a sample of <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1067.617s">teachers</a>  that we, the type of teachers that we have in our department and in our schools who are very dedicated to their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1075.363s">Just</a>  their presence here tonight is a testament to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1079.867s">They're</a>  here to support their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1081.849s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1082.729s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Carlo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1084.431s">If</a>  the teachers that are present this evening as well as the students could step forward, we'd like to present these awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1106.511s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Lena Zian for her achievement in the study of Italian and recipient of FAA USA scholarship 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1114.235s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1115.095s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1121.02s">And</a>  the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Joshua Crespo for the achievement in the study of Italian as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1126.404s">Joshua,</a>  congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1127.605s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1127.865s">Robert,</a>  do you want to say a few words, maybe in Italian? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1133.429s">Lina,</a>  would you like to say a few words, possibly in Italian and English? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1139.834s">Either</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1141.575s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[FmrA4M646Vo_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1145.228s">I'll</a>  say it in English first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1148.431s">Thanks</a>  a lot for the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1149.972s">I</a>  really do like Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1152.054s">It's</a>  one of my favorite subjects in school, and it's one of the subjects where I'm really motivated to go in and learn, and also to learn outside of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1162.443s">So,</a>  grazie mille, e voglio ringraziare le mie professoresse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1168.468s">Grazie.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1169.629s">Wonderful.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1250.677s">So</a>  Madam Chairperson, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, maiden appearance tonight of our new Director of Finance Administration, Christine Patterson.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1260.66s">Hello,</a>  Mr. Patterson. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1261.3s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1261.68s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1262.64s">Madam</a>  Mayor, members of the community and school committee, included in your packet is the financial report as of November 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1271.048s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any specific questions regarding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1275.789s">As</a>  such, I would just like to highlight some areas with regard to the transition between the prior director of finance and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1283.952s">That</a>  was a smooth transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1285.913s">As</a>  we go forward and review the budget, it is notable to identify that there were certain areas and subaccounts within our budget process that are more reflective of the DESI chart of accounts and reporting that's required at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1301.277s">And</a>  it is indicated in the overall appropriation and budget line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1305.558s">So</a>  although there may be some areas that look a mess, we are reviewing each of these and are working to contain those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1315.781s">It's</a>  also notable to indicate that the new FACTS online payment plan has been quite a success with its first year implementation, including <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1329.548s">collections</a>  of 1.4 million estimated for fiscal year 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1335.092s">Additionally,</a>  one of the categories that is always an area to monitor and watch are the utilities, energy consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1344.078s">The</a>  winter heating has not yet begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1345.879s">The</a>  invoices have not started for the cooler temperatures, but we will be monitoring and watching those accounts very closely in the upcoming months to indicate if there are any <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1357.91s">areas</a>  for savings and or liquidation among certain accounts.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1363.174s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1363.775s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1365.416s">Mr.</a>  Skerry?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1366.037s">Through</a>  you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1366.757s">Patterson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1368.158s">It's</a>  a great report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1369.719s">Usually</a>  it's pages, but it's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1372.541s">And</a>  one other thing, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1373.402s">Patterson,</a>  I recently had the opportunity to attend open house at the high school, and a few of our student entrepreneurial groups had a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1382.469s">Parents</a>  wanted to buy merchandise and et cetera with a credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1386.743s">and</a>  they're unable to take credit cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1388.484s">Is</a>  there any way we can look into the possibility of trying to get the vocational school and the high school kids to be able to take credit cards if somebody wants to purchase, you know, a souvenir or their t-shirts or what have you in the school, in the store, the school store.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1405.496s">I'm</a>  a strong advocate for all online services payments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1410.42s">That</a>  is something that has been, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1412.947s">requested</a>  and addressed through our partnership at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1416.429s">So</a>  we are working on that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1417.67s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1417.93s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1418.45s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1420.051s">Thank</a>  you ma'am.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1421.052s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1421.672s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1422.753s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1423.273s">Thank</a>  you for your first report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1424.714s">Great</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1425.535s">I</a>  appreciate it very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1427.256s">I</a>  just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1428.596s">The</a>  1.4 million that we brought in, um, through the new tracking system and new payment programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1435.28s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1436.061s">Is</a>  there an increase in revenue because, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1440.274s">We're</a>  getting more money in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1443.017s">Are</a>  we getting more money in because we're using the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1445.379s">It's</a>  easy to collect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1446.7s">And</a>  is this different from last year's amount?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1449.763s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1450.123s">I</a>  would say that this is more of the accurate tracking of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1454.287s">Not</a>  so much overall increased revenue, but it's much more contained and ease of payment plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1461.933s">So</a>  it's much easier to reach out to families if there's a concern or if, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1467.349s">there's</a>  a delinquency, we're able to track that and move on that more quickly.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1471.21s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1472.351s">And</a>  my, my second question is more towards the superintendent and you're new, so you might not realize this, but I believe last year we had a motion that the community schools budget would be presented to us in a quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1485.795s">And</a>  at the same time as this financial report, this is monthly.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1490.856s">This</a>  is a monthly report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1493.857s">As</a>  you know, we've had a lot of transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1495.678s">So,</a>  uh, Christine is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1497.552s">been</a>  on board for a short period of time, and there's new people at City Hall, and there's new people in other roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1503.617s">So</a>  the key thing for us is to get all that stuff together, but you'll have one certainly very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1508.722s">They're</a>  just putting it together.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1510.764s">Would</a>  you add that to the requested reports?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1513.366s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1514.467s">Because</a>  we haven't had one since last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1516.249s">And</a>  I understand the transition.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1519.111s">They're</a>  working on that now, but she's trying to get her feet on the ground with some of the other pieces.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1524.562s">Yeah,</a>  just so we don't forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1526.523s">And</a>  from the city side, the new CEO is also closing the books on June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1531.585s">So</a>  until she physically hits the button to close, it's hard to get the carryover. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1535.487s">The</a>  community schools is a carryover account.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1537.468s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1537.788s">It's</a>  revolving.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1539.029s">Everything</a>  sort of rolls over.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1540.59s">Do</a>  you have an idea when we'd see?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1543.071s">I</a>  would say sometime in December we'll start to see this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1545.592s">And</a>  then we'll do it regularly.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1546.833s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1547.873s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1548.353s">I</a>  just didn't want to forget.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1550.276s">This</a>  month it should happen.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1551.356s">All</a>  right, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1552.717s">That's</a>  great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1553.557s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1553.997s">Thank</a>  you, trustee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1556.478s">Pollack,</a>  did you have a question on this?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1558.298s">No,</a>  not at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1559.759s">Motion</a>  to accept the file.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1562.059s">Motion</a>  to accept the report and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1564.06s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1564.66s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1565.26s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1566.0s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1566.72s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1567.801s">Report</a>  is placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1569.441s">Report</a>  on professional development day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1571.222s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1572.262s">So</a>  I'll call upon our deputy superintendent to provide this report.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1577.894s">I'm</a>  actually gonna call on our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1579.454s">This</a>  was very much a team effort, Diane Caldwell and Rocco Grover Silvestri. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1585.816s">As</a>  all of you know, our professional, our full day of mandated professional development is tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1592.078s">And</a>  again, it's for teachers and paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1595.899s">There</a>  is no school for students tomorrow and all teachers will report to Medford High School for their activities and the paraprofessionals will be at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1607.783s">This</a>  year's program represents a collaborative effort between administrators and faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1613.504s">The</a>  new teacher's contract called for the establishment of a professional development committee that was comprised of six educators, six teachers, and six administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1623.707s">And</a>  that team has been hard at work since this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1627.588s">The</a>  committee's mission in the contract is to advise central administration on what teachers would like to see for professional development <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1636.52s">And</a>  again, we have had teacher surveys that the committee put together and collated, and two things, two themes emerged. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1645.203s">One</a>  of those themes was that teachers wanted more choice in what they were selecting for professional development, and they wanted continuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1654.806s">Because</a>  we've had so little mandated time until this contract for PD, we usually have a day, and then kind of the day people want to come to different things is on a voluntary basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1665.965s">but</a>  now we have more mandated time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1668.186s">So</a>  again, with the committee taking the survey, the teachers identified three main areas that they would like our PD to focus on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1677.628s">One</a>  of those areas is special education, a second is at-risk students, and a third is social-emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1686.63s">Our</a>  workshops tomorrow will focus on these topics, and we're gonna rotate all the teachers, K through 12, through a workshop <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1696.473s">each</a>  on each of these topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1698.915s">The</a>  goal is that they will, after tomorrow, select one of them, one of the themes to follow through with for the remainder of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1708.821s">So</a>  we'll have that continuity to the professional development that, you know, basically follows the teacher's interest through the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1718.968s">Again,</a>  planning for this day has been a lot of effort, a lot of commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1723.616s">We've</a>  asked teachers to step up and our teachers are actually, we're really excited tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1728.098s">It's</a>  really, you know, it's been a lot of work and a lot of sometimes, a lot of details, but we're very excited because our teachers are going to deliver those workshops tomorrow to their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1737.281s">And</a>  so that's very, very exciting for us and they've been very committed to that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1741.582s">I'm</a>  going to turn this over to Rocco because he has been so instrumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1746.043s">He's</a>  there every step of the way with Diane and myself and Bernadette and all the administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1751.065s">I</a>  want to say this too, all the administrators have stepped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1753.971s">They</a>  are assisting in presenting these workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1757.293s">While</a>  the teachers, we've given them some compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1759.794s">The</a>  administrators have been doing this on their own time, and it's been a lot of extra work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1763.256s">So</a>  I thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1764.656s">I</a>  thank our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1765.977s">I</a>  thank our secretaries, who also have been attending to the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1769.859s">I</a>  know that Jeannie Gliona and Michelle Bissell went around putting up signs for tomorrow, so all the teachers will know where to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1776.542s">And</a>  again, I'm going to turn it over to Rocco, because he's the linchpin to all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1781.285s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1783.067s">And</a>  his family's watching him on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1788.29s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[FmrA4M646Vo_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1788.871s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1789.691s">Rocco</a>  Grover Silvestri. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1790.732s">I'm</a>  the assistant principal at the Brooks, and in a way a de facto chairperson of the Professional Development Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1799.965s">So</a>  if I could, I would have to start by saying that this was not just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1806.847s">We</a>  came to this point because of the composition of the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1810.848s">The</a>  way that we worked together from the beginning, it was really what led us to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1818.39s">So,</a>  questions or if I could expand further? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1823.912s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1824.372s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1826.087s">I'm</a>  very interested in the topics that you selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1830.408s">I'm</a>  very interested in hearing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1833.73s">It</a>  just sounds wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1835.73s">Everything,</a>  including working with at-risk students, identification intervention, safer spaces, positive attitudes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1844.793s">This</a>  is similar to what we had in my work, where the police department came in to just talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1853.097s">safe</a>  space, walking in safe areas, just very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1857.018s">It's</a>  very similar to something I recently went to myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1860.979s">It</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1862.279s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1862.659s">You're</a>  welcome to drop by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1864.159s">I</a>  know, it sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1865.379s">And</a>  basically what we did is we, the teachers selected these themes, the professional development committee based on the surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1874.141s">And</a>  so again, the teachers had a hand in what they wanted to hear more about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1878.63s">And</a>  then what we did is we had one big meeting, and we divided them into elementary, middle, and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1885.572s">So</a>  there'll be an elementary workshop on social and emotional, a middle school workshop, and we're rotating the teachers during high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1892.534s">And</a>  again, people pretty much came up with their own topics within these main topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1898.316s">And</a>  so you have one of the subsequent handouts, some of the names of some of the workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1904.557s">So</a>  we're quite excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1907.148s">You</a>  know, it would be a great day, and everybody was really coming together of everyone that made this possible, so we're kind of excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1916.074s">Iraq</a>  was not excited.</p>

    <p>[FmrA4M646Vo_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1918.616s">Well,</a>  you know, a little, if I could, a little background. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1920.737s">We,</a>  you know, we poured over a lot of research, and we sought to build something from the ground up to look at what were the elements of the most effective, sustainable, impactful professional development models out there, and one of the elements that <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1938.27s">that</a>  became one of the core elements that we distilled from the literature was that it was teacher-led, teacher-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1944.496s">And</a>  so that was the impetus for distributing or administering this survey, which we were proud to say we got, you know, a significant majority of staff to respond back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1956.107s">And</a>  these three topics were the three most <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1960.138s">And</a>  so, again, it fits into that mold that we wanted to create and having this be relevant to what teachers actually wanted.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1970.943s">So,</a>  we have a lot of expertise, just with our own teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1974.644s">So,</a>  the teachers really stepped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1977.265s">They</a>  had administrators maybe doing some of the copying for them, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1980.427s">We</a>  all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1981.747s">It</a>  was a team effort, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1986.275s">I</a>  think that teachers and administrators are going to get more out of it because we're such a collaborative unit on this.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1992.98s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1993.641s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1993.761s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1995.222s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1995.522s">A</a>  couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1996.903s">First</a>  of all, it looks like it's going to be an interesting and exciting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2000.466s">And</a>  as you guys know, I just attended the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2009.428s">conference</a>  down at the Cape this past couple of days last week and it was all centered on social emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2016.756s">One</a>  of the truly exceptional parts that we heard about was from a woman who made just an incredible presentation and I would like to tell my colleagues more about it at a different point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2027.568s">However,</a>  it looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2028.91s">A</a>  couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2030.491s">I</a>  am <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2031.292s">extremely</a>  happy to see that there is a workshop for the paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2034.814s">I</a>  think that's terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2036.695s">And</a>  as I read the letter that was put out to faculty, and I realized that this had been something that I had caught at one point and then forgot about it, but it would seem to me that next year I would like that rather than teachers having to bring their own bag lunch that we could supply, the Medford Public Schools could supply lunch for our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2058.318s">as</a>  a thank you, because somehow or another it strikes me when we're doing a day of professional development for our valued teachers that the least we could do is to say, hey, lunch is on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2071.608s">So</a>  if I could put it in the form of a motion that next year at a professional development day, or if it comes later this day, that the Medford Public Schools would be <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2080.809s">I</a>  would provide lunch for our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2085.611s">I</a>  just think it would be a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2086.932s">So</a>  if I could make that motion.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2089.373s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2089.973s">Offered</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2090.974s">Villanueva,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2092.234s">Disceri,</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2093.495s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2094.355s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2095.235s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2096.256s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2097.657s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2121.228s">Madam</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, the college fair was held on October 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2124.749s">There</a>  were 88 different colleges and institutions represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2130.81s">The</a>  place was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2132.471s">A</a>  lot of people participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2134.751s">A</a>  lot of work goes into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2136.572s">This</a>  has been going on for many, many years, and it's really critical that our young people get a good start to find out what their options are, to talk to the different representatives about financial aid, what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2149.666s">to</a>  move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2150.346s">There</a>  was also a presentation by Jan Hollenbeck and Charlotte Hyam with regard to special needs students who would like to go to higher education and accommodation plans and how to access those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2165.572s">Alice</a>  Beth Fitzpatrick from the Voc Guidance Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2168.903s">I</a>  did a piece on transition to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2171.766s">And</a>  there's a lot of other pieces that go into it besides just simply the booths. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2176.691s">And</a>  I think it's one of the most successful nights we run because people really participate, they really learn a lot, and they come away with a better sense of what they have to do to prepare for college. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2186.702s">College</a>  is not cheap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2188.117s">So</a>  you've got to make the right decisions, things that are going to work for you, and you've got to plan well ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2192.724s">So</a>  I think this is a great night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2194.587s">It</a>  was another good example of people at work, and Amelia and her staff did a great job.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2200.598s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2201.318s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2201.498s">Cuno,</a>  on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2202.839s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2204.219s">I</a>  just want to say thank you to everyone who does participate in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2207.1s">I</a>  know that there's a lot of work behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2209.381s">And</a>  each and every year, it just seems like it gets more successful each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2214.842s">And</a>  it does take a lot of work for everyone to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2218.163s">I</a>  guess one of the things that I never asked, but I guess I'm curious and knowing is, if there's a way next year when we put it on, is as kids are walking in, maybe have a list of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2230.407s">what</a>  school they go to, what year they're in, because I know that it is open to all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2235.974s">It's</a>  not just Medford High School students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2238.236s">So</a>  I'm curious in knowing what other schools do attend our college night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2243.062s">Just</a>  a curiosity, because I know a lot of the parochial schools, and I know children that are going to charter schools also come to that college fair.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2250.119s">I</a>  know there are people other than our own students who come.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2252.4s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2253.1s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2253.681s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2255.101s">And</a>  even our own students just to know what, I don't need names. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2257.702s">I</a>  just want to know what year they're in and what schools they go to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2261.344s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2261.924s">On</a>  the motion to seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2266.106s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2267.447s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2268.247s">Motion</a>  passes and motion to plate receive in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2271.949s">This</a>  report offered by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2273.47s">Cuno</a>  seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2275.15s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2276.651s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2277.391s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2278.152s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2279.252s">Report</a>  on TV forum and testing session.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2281.874s">So</a>  we gave a previous report on this, and I just want to get you the follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2286.278s">Tony</a>  Vento was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2287.238s">She</a>  did a great job getting this in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2290.661s">You</a>  have the report in front of you, so you don't have to go in great detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2293.263s">But</a>  it was successful in getting most of the students and most of the people who were identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2298.207s">I</a>  think there were only three people that did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2301.189s">Tony,</a>  come on up.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2301.75s">Seven</a>  didn't.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2304.191s">Something</a>  of that small number.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2305.532s">Three</a>  were absent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2306.153s">And</a>  there may be some follow ups on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2309.65s">But</a>  we had a good forum with parents in the auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2312.632s">It</a>  wasn't hugely attended, probably 25 people, but people asked a lot of good questions and a lot of good answers came up.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2320.398s">Go</a>  ahead, Tonya. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2323.4s">We</a>  did very well with the program and all the follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2328.083s">The</a>  day of the testing, we went through about, let's see, we tested about almost 200 <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2337.645s">students.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2338.065s">We</a>  were collecting skin tests from pediatricians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2341.028s">We</a>  drew blood at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2344.11s">The</a>  day went off without a hitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2346.412s">I</a>  mean, all the students and faculty returned to their classrooms without incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2352.276s">I</a>  have to acknowledge the work of the high school nurses, because they were instrumental in developing a testing schedule, and they had maintained integrity to that testing schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2362.604s">We</a>  finished ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2364.781s">They</a>  also collected and organized and documented a lot of test results and medical information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2370.383s">So</a>  they were really very well appreciated on that day and through this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2377.244s">Our</a>  challenges are just following up with faculty and students who have not either submitted testing or who did not get tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2384.747s">And</a>  we have whittled that down to about 19 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2390.783s">that</a>  we are reaching out to either find out if they've been to their primary care physician or if they need to get tested and we'll facilitate that testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2402.386s">So</a>  that's where we are now, but overall it was a successful event. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2406.687s">We</a>  were really pleased it went off without any problems.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2410.05s">When</a>  will we get the results from the tests?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2412.852s">A</a>  lot of the results have come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2415.314s">We</a>  have taken the responsibility to mailing home any negative results. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2420.877s">The</a>  Department of Public Health, they will handle anybody who has a positive result and needs further evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2428.543s">So</a>  they're dealing with that's a very small number of people.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2434.222s">And</a>  I also just want to thank the city nurses as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2437.004s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2438.104s">33</a>  absolutely performed by the city hall nurse.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2441.646s">And</a>  Janet Leahy has come up to the high school to place some tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2445.408s">So</a>  we were very happy to have her be involved with us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2448.65s">It's</a>  truly a collaborative between school and state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2452.312s">So</a>  thank you for all your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2453.733s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2455.033s">Important</a>  matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2456.434s">I</a>  believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2457.035s">Vandekloot,</a>  do you have a question on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2460.096s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2460.997s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2465.216s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2467.178s">I</a>  just had a comment because I got a lot of positive feedback about communication that the the school Really reached out not only to the school community, but to the whole community and kept them informed all along So we do we have any other active cases in our high school just so that people can hear that on camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2488.537s">We</a>  do not <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2489.333s">That's</a>  good, that's what really we need to say out loud so that way everybody knows where we're at.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2494.056s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2494.777s">And</a>  this testing will be repeated again in January because it's difficult to know if any results that were determined now were because of exposure to this one student or because of another inadvertent exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2511.908s">So</a>  it all gets repeated in January and we'll take it from there and see where that leads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2518.361s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2519.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2711.182s">7</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2712.426s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2713.891s">Good</a>  luck out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2714.795s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2715.758s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2718.138s">Before</a>  we go into potentially an executive session for negotiations and legal matters, I just wanted to make an announcement that obviously tomorrow is election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2727.28s">So</a>  please, if you didn't have an opportunity to early vote, the city hit 20% in our early voting cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2733.442s">So</a>  we're really proud of that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2734.942s">The</a>  city clerk's office and the registrar's office worked really, really hard over the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2739.923s">And</a>  a lot of people participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2741.864s">But</a>  if you didn't, please get out there tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2744.945s">We</a>  have a report in here on the mock <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2747.465s">mock</a>  presidential debate that the students at Medford High School had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2750.449s">Unfortunately,</a>  I wasn't able to attend this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2752.852s">I</a>  did go for their primary mock debate, but it's interesting on the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2756.756s">I</a>  won't read who they voted for in the presidential race, but the question one was a no, 137 votes to 66. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2765.323s">Question</a>  two was a no, 169 to 37 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2769.968s">Question</a>  three, a no, 78 to 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2773.833s">And</a>  question four was a yes, 150 to 70 in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2779.379s">So</a>  very interesting results, and we'll see how they play out tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2783.096s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2783.256s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2783.896s">Madam</a>  Mayor, myself and school committee member Kathy Kreatz were able to attend the wonderful mock presidential debate and it was so much fun and our students just did such a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2797.562s">They</a>  did a particularly good job in really trying to develop <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2802.464s">really</a>  some understanding of what the candidates were putting forth for policy, which, as we all know, has sometimes been difficult this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2809.728s">So,</a>  anyway, it was just, knock your socks off, great.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2812.529s">Not</a>  only the issues, but the persona of the candidates.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2814.63s">Oh,</a>  well, the personas were just stunning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2817.512s">But</a>  in the same handout, I just wanted to bring attention that the media students at MHS have developed a special video which takes a stand against domestic violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2828.597s">and</a>  because October was Domestic Violence Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2832.021s">Mr.</a>  Jack Dempsey, the media teacher, submitted a copy to the video to the MIAA, and though we didn't win this year, but remember we won last year, so someone else has to have a turn, they were so impressed with it, and that it's going to be used, be presented, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2847.82s">for</a>  their wellness educators workshop being held on December 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2851.723s">Prior</a>  to the meeting tonight, I took a minute to go online and take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2855.605s">It</a>  is just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2857.887s">And</a>  it was just, it was really, it just really pulled at you emotionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2863.491s">And</a>  it's simple, it's direct, it's just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2867.113s">So</a>  I wanted to make sure I mentioned that and congratulated the students and Mr. Dempsey for their work.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2873.197s">And</a>  it sounds like our Attorney General is going to link it up with her site as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2876.358s">So</a>  kudos to the kids on that accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2879.018s">Great</a>  video. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2881.099s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2881.819s">Kreatz,</a>  you're blinking.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2883.699s">I</a>  just wanted to say it was a great job at the debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2887.88s">And</a>  it was really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2890.661s">The</a>  same thing that Paulette said was the students did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2894.501s">It</a>  was entertaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2895.902s">It</a>  was informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2896.882s">It</a>  was real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2898.722s">It</a>  was really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2900.042s">I'm</a>  so glad it could be a game.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2903.769s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2903.969s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2904.85s">I</a>  just wanted to say congratulations to the students that, not only the students, but the video that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2910.413s">Van</a>  der Kloot was just talking about, the Just Say No video, is really well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2917.136s">It</a>  was done professionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2918.457s">It</a>  was done with heart and soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2920.478s">I</a>  was able to see it, and I was able to actually share it with a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2925.875s">And</a>  if you haven't seen it, to really take that moment to look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2930.178s">It'll</a>  not only impress you by what the message is all about, but also impress you of who our kids are and the high school students that we are developing and the <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2941.865s">the</a>  community part of that, too, because it's not just students, but it's everyone from administration to teachers to our custodians to police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2951.529s">It's</a>  really a community video and I was very, very impressed by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2956.711s">Second</a>  of all, I do want to say, since you did bring up the voting for tomorrow, I want to say thank you to my colleague, Paulette Van der Kloot, who's really been going around advocating for just for question two, <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2970.753s">And</a>  hopefully people will vote no on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2975.836s">I</a>  have to say that I would be really remiss if I don't say it because it's just really frustrated me a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2982.5s">And</a>  that is listening to our governor's commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2988.343s">As</a>  a parent, as a school committee member, I have to say,</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2994.693s">We're</a>  close to a line here on speaking about a question.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2998.236s">I</a>  just feel that if someone in that position comes out and says, you know, this is a different choice if your district is failing, I just have to say, whether it's political or not, shame on the person who's saying that, because under that person's watch, not one district should be failing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3015.369s">We're</a>  crossing the line.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3017.09s">I</a>  know, but it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3018.331s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3018.972s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3020.113s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3021.294s">Changing</a>  the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3025.046s">I</a>  got a call this afternoon, and I just wanted to bring it forward because the gentleman on the phone thought it was important to bring forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3033.029s">He</a>  had heard that other communities give children time to pray at school throughout the school day, and asked if we were in any way doing that in any of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3043.792s">You're</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3045.673s">No,</a>  we don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3047.594s">I</a>  mean, if people want to take a little quiet time and meditate, they can, you know, but we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3052.452s">We</a>  don't ask anyone to pray. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3053.953s">We</a>  don't make this specific.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3055.154s">No,</a>  no, not us asking, but allowing children time to pray during school.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3058.717s">Beginning</a>  of the school day, if a youngster wants to put his head down and do something, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3062.641s">I</a>  mean, you know, but I don't think, there's nothing formal from us.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3066.56s">That's</a>  good because this person was concerned of keeping state and church things separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3073.282s">And</a>  just wanted it to be on the record this evening, and I would express that I would ask you the question so he could publicly see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3080.905s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3081.445s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3082.045s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3083.386s">Item</a>  seven, negotiations and legal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3085.646s">Is</a>  there a motion to go into executive session? <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3088.507s">Opposed</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3089.207s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3092.468s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3100.614s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3102.775s">We</a>  will now enter executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3105.776s">We</a>  will adjourn from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3107.117s">We'll</a>  come out of executive session briefly and adjourn.</p>
