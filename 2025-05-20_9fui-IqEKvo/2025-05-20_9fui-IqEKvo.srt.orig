1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,834
[SPEAKER_05]: actively utilize physical spaces, provide transportation and offer specialized services to students.

2
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:18,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas the city of Medford is undergoing re-evaluation of zoning and residential areas, be it resolved that the district administration shall undertake a review of potential solutions to alleviate issues of overcrowding and associated inequities.

3
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:29,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I am going to turn it over to Dr Lucy to do a run through of the report that responds to this resolution.

4
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:34,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a little bit later in the agenda, there'll be some time for.

5
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:40,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the committee to ask questions as well as I see there's a bunch of people who have joined us.

6
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have some dedicated time for all of you as well.

7
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:46,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,520
[SPEAKER_05]: then we'll wrap up.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dr. Pelosi, why don't you take it away?

10
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:51,622
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

11
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:52,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

12
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:53,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everybody.

13
00:00:54,543 --> 00:01:10,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So as member Graham mentioned, the following presentation is in response to the resolution to take a closer look a little bit at enrollment across the elementary schools and areas in which there are definitely some, you know,

14
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:13,652
[SPEAKER_09]: overcrowding areas of constraint.

15
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:20,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we kind of chunked a little bit of this presentation by data sets.

16
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:27,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So you may see this slide again when we're breaking up how the data is going to be presented.

17
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:46,050
[SPEAKER_09]: This first piece is going to show you some data around enrollment in general education, as well as specialized programs over the last three years, average class sizes, and projected student population in some of the out years.

18
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:57,955
[SPEAKER_09]: So this first one, you can see that this is enrollment in general education, as well as specialized programs, special education, and English learner programming.

19
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:07,903
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important to note that what you are viewing here is data that was reflective of the October 1 SIMS data that we have to report to the Department of Education each year.

20
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:28,602
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said, there are definitely some fluctuations in all of this data probably as students are identified in need of special education throughout the year and enrollment fluctuates both in coming into the district and leaving the district throughout the year.

21
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:36,388
[SPEAKER_09]: But this was data that is reflective of the reporting that we do, so it's standard across all of our reporting areas.

22
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:47,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important to also note that the first column gives the total enrollment for the past three years in all four elementary schools.

23
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:57,021
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows you what the general education population is, and the special education includes all students on IEPs.

24
00:02:57,522 --> 00:03:02,004
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is student, which is an individualized education program.

25
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,424
[SPEAKER_09]: for students.

26
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:15,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is reflective of students that are both in receiving special education services in general ed, as well as students that are in our sub-separate programming.

27
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:19,968
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the same for the information here for English learner.

28
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:30,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So the numbers here are reflective of all students receiving EL services, both in general education as well as in the newcomer programs.

29
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:35,049
[SPEAKER_09]: which are present at the McGlynn Elementary and the Missittuck Elementary.

30
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:52,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just some key pieces here are just, if we're focusing on this school year, we do see some wide variation between the spectrum of the Roberts, which is at 586 as of October 1.

31
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:57,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know that we're closer to the 610 number right about now.

32
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:00,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Missituck at 418, those are

33
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:08,353
[SPEAKER_09]: really like the two ends of the spectrum in terms of total enrollment for the district.

34
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:20,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can also see that though there's a newcomer program at the Missituck and at the McGlynn, there's about a hundred student difference in EL numbers from the McGlynn to the Missituck.

35
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:42,702
[SPEAKER_09]: The next slide just gets into a little bit more detail for special education services, and it just presents the data in a different way, so you can also see the overall population of special education and English learners in the total enrollment of all four elementary schools.

36
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:51,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the things for us that we are digging deeper, so I think it's important to note that

37
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,821
[SPEAKER_09]: This resolution was very important.

38
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:08,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It was conversations that not only I heard in the listening sessions that I did at all four elementary schools for caregivers, but it was also conversation that I heard in the listening sessions that I had with staff.

39
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:14,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also conversations that we're having as an administrative team internally.

40
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:22,260
[SPEAKER_09]: We worked hard to get this data, but we also are having ongoing conversations to dig deeper with this data.

41
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,822
[SPEAKER_09]: The conversations are just beginning, I feel like.

42
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

43
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:40,591
[SPEAKER_09]: But some of the things that we are looking into is just making sure that we're responding to some of the numbers and digging deeper a little bit so that we can see

44
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:48,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess if I go back to, we can see that the data looks to be somewhat historical.

45
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:57,388
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing that's earth shattering that we are seeing that we say, whoa, this is an anomaly in the data that we have to dig deeper.

46
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can kind of see the trends that are happening in our enrollment.

47
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:07,796
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the things we might want to look into is our special education and making sure what

48
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:16,981
[SPEAKER_09]: is happening in terms of how we're identifying students, because there may be some shifts in the numbers.

49
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:32,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the things that's, you know, the Roberts has the highest enrollment, but yet the lowest percentage of students on an IEP, whereas the Missituck has the lowest enrollment, but the highest percentage of students on an IEP.

50
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:33,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are ways in which

51
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:43,456
[SPEAKER_09]: we need to do a little bit further digging as to what these numbers are really reflecting and how we're getting there.

52
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:55,621
[SPEAKER_09]: This graph just shows the average, just an average for elementary class size throughout the district for the past three years.

53
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, again,

54
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:15,736
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts has the highest enrollment, but our class average sizes are pretty similar across the district, and for the most part have been, I think we can be in the end for me that would be that we are.

55
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:20,599
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting the need in terms of the enrollment by adding additional sections.

56
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:36,528
[SPEAKER_09]: We did collapse some sections at the Missituck, and I think that's also reflected in the average class size for this school year as opposed to what it was last school year and in fiscal year 23.

57
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:44,272
[SPEAKER_09]: This just has some data based on projected student population.

58
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:53,658
[SPEAKER_09]: For the bulk of our data, it is reflective of October 1 reporting again for the Department of Ed.

59
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,760
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking at birth data.

60
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking at consensus data that we get through the city.

61
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:06,706
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is important to note, and it is on our radar, that we know of, you know,

62
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:13,579
[SPEAKER_09]: at least three projected housing developments in the city of Medford that will contribute.

63
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:32,292
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some of that information where we know how many units and what the projections may be to affect Medford public schools, but we don't have some of that drilled down data, at least for what is somewhat projected for the Salem Street.

64
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:34,994
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no concrete plans, so it's hard to determine

65
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:39,878
[SPEAKER_09]: what impact that may have on the Roberts right now at this specific time.

66
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:46,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas some of the other developments, we know a little bit about the number of affordable housing units.

67
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: We know a little bit information about what those units look like in terms of how many bedrooms.

68
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can make some assumptions about what that would mean to the schools and the type of people that would be moving into those areas.

69
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:03,142
[SPEAKER_09]: But we still don't have a lot of data on the Salem Street one.

70
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:07,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Blue Sea, can I just clarify real quick before you move on?

71
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:07,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

72
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:08,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

73
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to go back?

74
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:09,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

75
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:12,791
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think that matters tremendously.

76
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:23,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But the difference between what Salem Street and some of the other developments is that Salem Street is not actually a project.

77
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Salem Street is a zoning effort to allow projects in the future.

78
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is no project.

79
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:39,289
[SPEAKER_05]: That I'm aware of that is, like, in the same kind of development phase that, like.

80
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Projects in Medford square are with the new announcement of the project there.

81
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:47,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a project.

82
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a number of units.

83
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:55,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Salem street is not that Salem street is zoning that allows.

84
00:09:57,782 --> 00:10:03,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Owners of property to do things to their property that that is the only thing that's happening.

85
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:07,205
[SPEAKER_05]: That zoning effort is happening across the entire city.

86
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:09,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it is not just Salem street.

87
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:19,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there is, there are rezoning efforts happening city wide, and they are being looked at neighborhood to neighborhood, but none of those efforts equals.

88
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,510
[SPEAKER_05]: A project in the same way that, like.

89
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The project on the Felsway is a project with a number of units, et cetera.

90
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:33,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So not to say that that can't come, but that is one of the key differences in my mind.

91
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:37,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that can get sort of muddled in the conversation.

92
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to clarify that before we moved on.

93
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:42,263
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I appreciate that.

94
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:46,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that clarification, and I'm sure people listening will appreciate that clarification.

95
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of grateful to hear that right now.

96
00:10:52,144 --> 00:11:02,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think the other thing that we may want to share eventually is some of the rationale around the enrollment study that we just finished for Medford high.

97
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a lot of discussion there about.

98
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:21,365
[SPEAKER_05]: what housing development really does to student enrollment and the data does not show that it changes student enrollment in any drastic way with a few exceptions in terms of the types of housing.

99
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:29,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so we can make that available, um, as well in a little bit more of a connected way.

100
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:36,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, because that, that enrollment study I thought was like enlightening and interesting in terms of like what we were,

101
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:54,102
[SPEAKER_05]: How they looked at our enrollment and how we had to do some digging in a couple of places where we felt like specific plans developments were going to do something different to our enrollment than we were, than the sort of normal numbers would bare metal.

102
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:57,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you for that.

103
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:08,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so this, the next slide is going to talk about space and staffing across the four elementary schools.

104
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:24,858
[SPEAKER_09]: It is important to note that a lot of this information that is presented here came about from ongoing conversations that we've been having specifically with me and the principals.

105
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:34,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think what was important to really just get a handle on is that space is very different across the elementary schools.

106
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:37,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would say that while

107
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:42,427
[SPEAKER_09]: After the Roberts, the Brooks School has the highest enrollment.

108
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:46,908
[SPEAKER_09]: But the McGlynn does experience a lot of space constraints.

109
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:55,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think just on the face, the McGlynn Elementary School has only three floors, where the other four elementary schools have four floors.

110
00:12:56,252 --> 00:13:01,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So it does reduce the amount of classrooms.

111
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:06,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the spaces that, quite honestly,

112
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:20,548
[SPEAKER_09]: newcomer classrooms are in are not full classrooms, because some of the spaces were originally built to be more of support spaces and smaller group spaces.

113
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:27,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So the McGlynn, though their enrollment might not be at full capacity, there are some space constraints for them.

114
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:42,356
[SPEAKER_09]: at present do not house any MEEP classrooms, but for next year, well, the special education sub-separate program that the McGlynn houses is the access program.

115
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:51,281
[SPEAKER_09]: That program is growing, and so next year they're going to need an additional classroom for the access program.

116
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:59,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, we could condense one of the double sections of the newcomer classrooms, and so

117
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,758
[SPEAKER_09]: We're able to kind of figure that out for next year.

118
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,399
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just think that's just an important piece for people to be aware of for the McGlynn.

119
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:20,983
[SPEAKER_09]: The McGlynn enrollment, because they are not at the level of capacity that the Brooks and the Roberts are, run each year with a fluctuation of either three or four sections per grade level.

120
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Brooks and the Roberts are running on average four to five sections each year per grade level based on enrollment.

121
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,682
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts school houses the special education sub

122
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:42,470
[SPEAKER_09]: separate program for connections, and they have five classrooms currently with two MEEP, which is preschool programs.

123
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,373
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a total of five classrooms.

124
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:53,820
[SPEAKER_09]: As opposed to the McGlynn, they have newcomer, so that is five classrooms plus access is six.

125
00:14:54,621 --> 00:15:11,146
[SPEAKER_09]: The Brooks School houses the language-based program, as well as the learning group program for their special education subseparate programmings, each for two classrooms, as well as two preschool classrooms for a total of six additional classrooms.

126
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:15,728
[SPEAKER_09]: The Missituck does not have space constraints at this time.

127
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:22,410
[SPEAKER_09]: They run, based on enrollment, an average of three sections per grade level.

128
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:29,539
[SPEAKER_09]: some there was one year where they needed four sections of kindergarten.

129
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:34,234
[SPEAKER_09]: But this year, they needed two sections for second grade.

130
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:38,075
[SPEAKER_09]: So enrollment does fluctuate there as well.

131
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,176
[SPEAKER_09]: They house the newcomer.

132
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:41,737
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is for grades one through five.

133
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:44,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Just as the McGlynn, that's five classrooms.

134
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:52,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And they house the therapeutic learning program for their special education subseparate program.

135
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:56,044
[SPEAKER_09]: They have three classrooms in use for that.

136
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:58,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And they house three MEEP classrooms.

137
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:10,313
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also important to note that the Missituck is the only elementary school that is able to provide a dedicated classroom space for the after-school program.

138
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:17,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So some staffing constraints really are

139
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:24,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tied to enrollment, but it is also tied to the specialized programming that's in the buildings.

140
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:40,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think part of, I hate to use the word constraint, but part of the constraint at the Roberts and the Brooks is that currently their special education sub-separate programming is the largest in terms of enrollment.

141
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:47,091
[SPEAKER_09]: The access programming at the McGlynn and the therapeutic learning program at the Mississauga

142
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,883
[SPEAKER_09]: have the lower enrollment, there's only.

143
00:16:51,748 --> 00:17:01,931
[SPEAKER_09]: one to three classrooms, whereas the Roberts and the Brooks have six plus, and that's part of it.

144
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:07,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And with the need for those classrooms, there's also the need for additional staff.

145
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:18,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of additional related services need to be given to the Brooks and the Roberts in order to meet the needs of the students within the building.

146
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:28,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of that additional staffing constraint is really to just ensure that the needs are met for the students and the growing enrollment.

147
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:40,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And each year so far since I left school leadership and have been up here since the pandemic, the Roberts has needed an additional fifth kindergarten every year.

148
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:43,834
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't say that for the other buildings.

149
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:45,055
[SPEAKER_09]: The Brooks is right behind.

150
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:49,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It's most of the years, maybe not all, but the Roberts, it's been every single year.

151
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also say just as a side note that

152
00:17:58,454 --> 00:18:13,273
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts, because of the increased enrollment and because of their programming, could use some additional support, some additional behavioral support, whether that's through a BCBA board-certified behavior analyst or a behaviorist.

153
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,578
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in need of some additional support in that area.

154
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:30,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next section of the resolution talks about the average number of intra-district approvals and the impact that sibling preference may have on that.

155
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:36,116
[SPEAKER_09]: So before I advance the slide to show the data, I do want to just frame what that means.

156
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:48,865
[SPEAKER_09]: So intra-district approvals are situations in which students have been given permission to attend a school outside of their residential zoned school.

157
00:18:49,645 --> 00:19:00,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, students that are in need of services, so students that may need newcomer, they are going to receive transportation to attend the McGlynn or the Missituck.

158
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:14,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And students that, through the team decision and the needs of their IEP, if they need a special education subseparate program, then they're going to receive transportation to go there.

159
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:16,213
[SPEAKER_09]: There has been a

160
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:29,858
[SPEAKER_09]: There has been a longstanding practice at one of the schools that there is sibling preference to allow students that attend either the learning group or the language-based programming

161
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,982
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Brooks, that their siblings can go to the Brooks as well.

162
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:49,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if we just go to that FAR column, we don't see that level of sibling preference at the other three schools.

163
00:19:50,785 --> 00:20:03,894
[SPEAKER_09]: For this current school year, there are nine students at the Brooks that do not live in the Brooks area, but their sibling is part of the language-based or the learning group, and so their siblings have attended.

164
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:19,104
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not something that I am necessarily managing or approving, whereas if we look to the first two columns, since I came up here in 2020,

165
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And to get a little, well, let me back up.

166
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:25,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

167
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:42,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Prior to 2020, there were, as we can see, 22 students attending the Brooks that did not live in the Brooks area, four students attending the McGlynn that did not live in the McGlynn area, two at the Missituck, four at the Roberts.

168
00:20:45,188 --> 00:21:06,404
[SPEAKER_09]: In order to get a better handle on this, I started working with the superintendent at the time, Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent, as well as Megan Fiddler-Carrie, our director for family and community engagement that also has a role in the registration office, to try and start tracking this data.

169
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:13,850
[SPEAKER_09]: At the time, for intra-district approvals prior to 2020, we actually were providing transportation

170
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:20,159
[SPEAKER_09]: to families in other parts of the city to bring them to the Brooks.

171
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And that stopped around 2021.

172
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:31,969
[SPEAKER_09]: And we began really looking at the needs for inter-district approvals.

173
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, which dovetails to our conversation at last night's school committee meeting, in an effort to where we

174
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:51,269
[SPEAKER_09]: there was some after-school need, and we weren't really able to meet all families' needs to provide after-school care.

175
00:21:52,409 --> 00:22:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: We developed an internal inter-district approval process, and that process was having conversations with families around their hardship and their request to attend a school outside of their residential area.

176
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:11,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Those conversations really

177
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:34,112
[SPEAKER_09]: the approvals were given just for the hardship of afterschool care, or family situations that were delicate, and they had care or transportation that otherwise needed to be handled in a different zoned area.

178
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:37,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those approvals were given.

179
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Those approvals did not include transportation.

180
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:47,577
[SPEAKER_09]: They did not include any sort of enrollment on the wait list of afterschool programming.

181
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:57,139
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see since 2020, really 2022, 2023, these numbers that are highlighted in yellow reflect the approvals that I have approved.

182
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:09,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to also balance some of the enrollment and the needs of the families.

183
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you want me to pause here on this slide or just keep going.

184
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:17,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Question.

185
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:18,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

186
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:24,455
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the, where they're transferring in?

187
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:28,877
[SPEAKER_08]: In most cases.

188
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:29,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're going.

189
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:30,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're going.

190
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:48,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, these are students that upon, let's say upon enrollment, they are zoned for the Brooks, but they have a caretaker in the McGlynn area.

191
00:23:49,044 --> 00:24:00,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And for various hardship reasons, I approve the student to attend the McGlynn outside of their zoned area for the Brooks.

192
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:22,148
[SPEAKER_09]: There are situations in here which may involve other delicate situations, such as where the Department of Children and Families are involved, DCF, or situations of bullying or discord, things of that nature.

193
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:25,209
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not all strictly enrollment.

194
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,211
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can only speak to what's in yellow.

195
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:37,384
[SPEAKER_09]: The numbers that are in brown, I don't have data on how that came to be.

196
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

197
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:44,847
[SPEAKER_09]: OK to proceed?

198
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:46,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

199
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:47,068
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

200
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:52,547
[SPEAKER_09]: This last piece is on transportation.

201
00:24:52,567 --> 00:25:04,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And this, just so that we're aware, I already spoke about how we were providing transportation, which did result in an additional two to three buses.

202
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,211
[SPEAKER_09]: That no longer happens.

203
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:13,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are the rationales here on the left, which I already spoke about.

204
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:22,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think it's important just in one year to see the difference in transportation costs when we look at what the yellow bus is at the top.

205
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:26,659
[SPEAKER_09]: You almost feel like we're getting a deal that it only went up by $15.

206
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,043
[SPEAKER_09]: But the daily rate for one bus this year is $475.

207
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:39,407
[SPEAKER_09]: We currently have 16 buses running, so we will maintain that.

208
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:44,330
[SPEAKER_09]: We are in the middle of updating the contract for our yellow bus.

209
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:55,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the exact cost of what fiscal year 26 will look like, but I think it's very reasonable to assume that it's going to be a little bit north of $475.

210
00:25:55,704 --> 00:26:04,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the most drastic change here is in specialized transportation, which is our vans.

211
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,331
[SPEAKER_09]: There are several reasons why we need van transportation.

212
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:10,892
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see that we have it here for

213
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:15,794
[SPEAKER_09]: MEEP, we have it for special education needs.

214
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:19,995
[SPEAKER_09]: We run it in the summer for extended school year for special education.

215
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:29,458
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have some vans that run for our EL students and for our homeless students under McKinney-Vento.

216
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,780
[SPEAKER_09]: So we right now, you can see the difference.

217
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year it was about 25

218
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:41,783
[SPEAKER_09]: ish dollars a day and now it's $75 a day.

219
00:26:42,564 --> 00:26:43,865
[SPEAKER_09]: The vans run, and Ms.

220
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:55,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen could probably speak to this a little bit more articulately than I because this is part of her daily existence, but they're based on seats.

221
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:01,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the number of seats on a bus or on a van.

222
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:14,076
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our vans only hold eight students, but if there are car seats or a monitor on it, then that will reduce the number of students that we can have on a van.

223
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:19,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically there's six to eight students, and it depends on

224
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:27,104
[SPEAKER_02]: With me, we have morning and afternoon sessions, so we run, we have 2 separate runs going at that time.

225
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:37,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, yeah, so we need to make sure that the students are safe on the bands that they, if they have a harness or a buddy buckle as well as car seats for our younger students.

226
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So, did you have a question I see your hand up.

227
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:47,452
[SPEAKER_01]: You did, um, is there any, um.

228
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:52,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't see a total here, but that's fine, not required.

229
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:55,688
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a point where we just don't just buy our own vans?

230
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:01,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I know at Shore, we've just reordered a bunch of vans.

231
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:04,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't know the cost analysis on that.

232
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:08,897
[SPEAKER_01]: But I suppose somebody has to drive them is the other catch.

233
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:12,740
[SPEAKER_01]: At Shore, I believe the staff drive the vans.

234
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be very different.

235
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:23,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Just something to think about, I mean, but those numbers per day probably don't come up.

236
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:28,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it isn't to say that we can't have staff drive the vans either, by the way.

237
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:41,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it happens at shore, we'd obviously have to negotiate that with our bargaining partners, but I guess there are plenty of people who would be capable of it and who would be open to the additional compensation.

238
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:45,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something to think about, because these numbers,

239
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,961
[SPEAKER_01]: like all transportation costs are going just up and up and up and up.

240
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:53,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a thought.

241
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:56,224
[SPEAKER_09]: They are.

242
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

243
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:08,711
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so the last piece is just a little bit of a summary and some of the things that we've talked about internally.

244
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:13,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think very first and foremost, there were some major takeaways in

245
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:20,159
[SPEAKER_09]: running all of this data and that we just want to make sure that we, you know, punctuate right here.

246
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's definite variation in enrollment across the district.

247
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:30,708
[SPEAKER_09]: After Medford High School, the Roberts School has the highest enrollment in the city, which is primarily due to its location.

248
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:36,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that is the piece a little bit about the data seemed to be mostly historical.

249
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:44,316
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts is situated in a part of the city that has a lot of multifamily homes.

250
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think we've seen a lot of family turnover in South Medford, where the Missituck is situated, as much as we have at the Roberts.

251
00:29:56,684 --> 00:30:00,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Space constraints are felt at three of the four elementary schools.

252
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:04,617
[SPEAKER_09]: which I've already kind of talked about.

253
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:11,724
[SPEAKER_09]: The MSITUC is able to provide dedicated space for the after-school program in ways that the other three schools are unable to do at this time.

254
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:28,018
[SPEAKER_09]: The special education sub-separate programming space also varies, as we said in this presentation, due to the enrollment and the individual student needs of the programs, which definitely guides and impacts the level of staffing required.

255
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:34,499
[SPEAKER_09]: We do feel that additional conversation is needed to review the inter-district protocol.

256
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not a policy at this time.

257
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I would welcome further conversation about that at the Rules and Policy Subcommittee.

258
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:52,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And just as we talked about, there's definitely an increase in transportation costs overall that are a big impact.

259
00:30:54,316 --> 00:31:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of the things we engaged in conversation about, which is not what we're necessarily bringing forward tonight, but I do want it to be known that we really had a lot of conversation.

260
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:15,705
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of the conversations was reassigning incoming Roberts enrollment at kindergarten.

261
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:22,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And once they hit the capacity per the teacher contract saying,

262
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:31,856
[SPEAKER_09]: In essence, the Roberts is closed, and anyone else that enrolls in the Roberts Kindergarten would have to be transported to, let's say, the Missituck.

263
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:40,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just kind of go through them and then tell you why we really didn't settle on these.

264
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:54,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Another solution we talked about was taking all kindergarten enrollment and bringing it to a weighted lottery system so that we would, in essence, be maybe moving away from community-based schools.

265
00:31:54,801 --> 00:32:00,407
[SPEAKER_09]: But the weighted part would, of course, be that families that have

266
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:10,080
[SPEAKER_09]: siblings already in the school would have a higher weight or maybe need, would have a higher weight, but that was one thing we did talk about.

267
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:23,588
[SPEAKER_09]: We also did talk about conducting a feasibility study on the use of the MISATUC, because there is great difference in the enrollment of the Roberts versus the enrollment of the MISATUC.

268
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,870
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, those are the two ends of the spectrum.

269
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:30,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And so are there different ways that we could actually just leverage or use the MISATUC?

270
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:48,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of that conversation led to this next bullet, which would be like a restructuring of all grade spans, potentially, meaning that one way is we could look at the elementary and have the elementaries all service pre-K to grade four.

271
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:54,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We could have a middle school take grades five, six, and another middle school take grade seven, eight.

272
00:32:55,394 --> 00:33:00,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We could also use the MISA Tuck as an early learning center and house all of pre-K

273
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:13,519
[SPEAKER_09]: through and kindergarten and grade one at the Missituck and then look at our other elementary schools to service different grade spans, maybe grades two through four or two through five.

274
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:30,705
[SPEAKER_09]: We also discussed reviewing the placement of our elementary subseparate programs that we have housed throughout the district because the highest enrollment of those programs is at the Brooks and the Missituck.

275
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:42,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also talked about engaging in discussions in partnership with school committee for the process of redistricting.

276
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:45,861
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of these things were discussed.

277
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:50,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them are much longer term projects.

278
00:33:51,962 --> 00:34:01,431
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it doesn't feel good to say that we are going to stop families from enrolling if they live in that neighborhood.

279
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:12,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It also would create a hardship financially, possibly, to be adding additional transportation mechanisms in order to educate students.

280
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:15,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And we see the price of transportation increasing.

281
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:35,820
[SPEAKER_09]: It also doesn't feel great to say that families wouldn't know, entering kindergarten, which school their child was going to and what other additional hardships that may cause or how we would kind of have conversations around after school.

282
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,102
[SPEAKER_09]: So all that being said,

283
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:51,145
[SPEAKER_09]: there are some short-term solutions that we have been much more, I guess I could say, kind of like serious about.

284
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:59,370
[SPEAKER_09]: One would be to relocate the preschool MEEP programs from the Roberts to the Missituck for next school year.

285
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:03,589
[SPEAKER_09]: We are still looking into what that might look like.

286
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:13,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be a small uptick in transportation costs, but we don't 100% know that number yet, which is why we're still kind of looking into that analysis.

287
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:19,432
[SPEAKER_09]: But that would free up classroom space at the Roberts.

288
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:30,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are looking, the Roberts is feeling some additional constraints in just how their schedule runs in the school.

289
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:34,596
[SPEAKER_09]: And so one of those areas is their specialist schedule.

290
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:46,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And Principal Kroll is an amazing leader that is focused on equity and inclusion for all of her students.

291
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:51,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And so every student at the Roberts School participates in specials.

292
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:58,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And so for the Connections students, some of those students are able to really

293
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:08,204
[SPEAKER_09]: engage in the opportunity of going to specialist classes in the gen ed setting in a true inclusive manner.

294
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:18,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And some students based on their need and based on their disability, that is something that they struggle with.

295
00:36:19,507 --> 00:36:20,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And so Ms.

296
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:28,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Kroll has been able to provide a more sheltered specialist experience for her students.

297
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't wanna see that

298
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:54,325
[SPEAKER_09]: stop, but one of the ways we could alleviate for next year the pressure of that is to say that we are providing additional staffing to the Roberts so that the specialist schedule isn't so constrained and that we can really actually provide all of her students with the specialist experiences that they deserve.

299
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other thing is that we are

300
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:08,030
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to do a space utilization study of all four elementary schools and the two middle schools this summer.

301
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:09,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to start July 1.

302
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:15,673
[SPEAKER_09]: We have contracted with HMFH Architects.

303
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:17,193
[SPEAKER_09]: They are going to do the study.

304
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:27,997
[SPEAKER_09]: They are really going to be able to go into all six of those schools and give us the information about how we're using our space.

305
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:38,687
[SPEAKER_09]: how space was intended upon when the buildings were first opened, and give us a little bit deeper of an understanding about

306
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,931
[SPEAKER_09]: how we can leverage our spaces better and what we're able to do.

307
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:58,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this information would also inform if we are entertaining, reorganizing our structure at all, this kind of study is going to be needed to engage in those conversations about restructuring.

308
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:05,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And... Member Rousseau, did you have a question?

309
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:07,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

310
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you want to say thank you?

311
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you go back to slide 21?

312
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, let me try to do that.

313
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, see, it's just going to advance me.

314
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:20,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on one minute.

315
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:23,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't mind my templates here.

316
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason, I'm covered.

317
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:34,285
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an arrow right next to the 24 to the left of it.

318
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but for some reason, I have a...

319
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:38,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's in the way.

320
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:39,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

321
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:40,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

322
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.

323
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:44,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, what's on there?

324
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Your keyboard arrow do it.

325
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, try the keyboard.

326
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Try the keyboard arrow.

327
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:48,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Keyboard.

328
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:51,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, brilliant.

329
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:52,201
[SPEAKER_08]: One more.

330
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:52,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Brilliant.

331
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:54,342
[SPEAKER_08]: One more?

332
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:55,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

333
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:56,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

334
00:38:57,763 --> 00:38:58,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on one second.

335
00:38:58,943 --> 00:38:59,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoopsie, look at.

336
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:01,204
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

337
00:39:01,844 --> 00:39:03,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So, nope.

338
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:05,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Other direction.

339
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is it, right, sorry.

340
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,981
[SPEAKER_01]: The number went away, so I stopped paying attention.

341
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:18,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the redistricting is always a challenge in every district that's ever existed.

342
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:23,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not afraid of a challenge.

343
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:26,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid of political fallout.

344
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:29,379
[SPEAKER_01]: that will occur, 100% will occur.

345
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:33,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a house right next to the school, and now you're telling me my kid has to go to school all the way across the city.

346
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:41,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel for folks in that situation, I mean, how would you know that we're having this meeting right now?

347
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:45,271
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't even had a kid yet, or you have your first child.

348
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,652
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not paying attention to this meeting.

349
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:52,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all manageable.

350
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:55,738
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also, in my mind,

351
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,081
[SPEAKER_01]: never-ending cycle.

352
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:04,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if we just redistrict, then it's just a temporary band-aid.

353
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:11,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I live practically as far away from the Missittook, which is where my kids went.

354
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could walk to the Brooks in the blink of an eye.

355
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:19,135
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the Missittook had to be stretched all over the place.

356
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:20,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And

357
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:25,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't know what school my kids were going to go to, so I didn't care.

358
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:42,195
[SPEAKER_01]: But my point is just like, if you told me that if I moved two houses over, it would have been the Brooks, and I just glanced at those stupid school rating websites not knowing that they're garbage, I'd be like, oh, I guess I'll buy the house two doors down.

359
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:48,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will just, I mean, folks will continue to do that.

360
00:40:51,900 --> 00:41:04,130
[SPEAKER_01]: not to generalize about who lives in Medford, but you know, the folks that are buying single family homes that are in predominantly West Medford and are Brooks zoned, like they're doing the research for that.

361
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:14,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be, and I'm not saying others aren't, but it's just going to be a problem that we just have to keep revisiting.

362
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, we're 20,

363
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:22,490
[SPEAKER_01]: five years now since we've been in the new schools, the old new schools.

364
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:29,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has been a couple of, at least one redistricting, which was sort of just school committee wasn't involved.

365
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:35,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the superintendent took the map out and moved the streets around is my understanding.

366
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:44,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not a fan of redistricting and not when I see all these other options.

367
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:55,065
[SPEAKER_01]: If these other options were totally ridiculous and just could not work for zillions of reasons, then redistricting it is.

368
00:41:55,385 --> 00:41:58,667
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the tool in our toolbox.

369
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:13,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Two options, the pre-K to four, and then the two middle schools is one I know I've talked about with some of you all before.

370
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:20,826
[SPEAKER_01]: The pre-K to one, and then, I mean, I hadn't thought of that one, and I think that's very interesting.

371
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:28,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of talk about continuity in a school.

372
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:33,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the middle school,

373
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:44,532
[SPEAKER_01]: lottery process, to me, has shown me that people really want continuity with their student cohort.

374
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:51,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rare to get the same teacher one year after the next, unless there's a reorg and you get really lucky.

375
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:55,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, you'll have different specialists.

376
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:00,761
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have different food service workers and the different secretary if you're in a different school.

377
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:03,362
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want to be with your classmates.

378
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:18,032
[SPEAKER_01]: both of those options listed there very much interest me much, much more than redistricting because I just feel like we're just kicking the can down the road now.

379
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:34,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, like the pre-k to one, like some years that'll be a lot more pre-k to one, some years it'll be a lot less or not a lot, but the fluctuation that occurs will not be impacting

380
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:38,883
[SPEAKER_01]: other schools, it'll be centralized.

381
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:40,724
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be, in my mind, easier to manage.

382
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:52,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And so will the space study, they're going to see all these options, or are they going to just provide data, and then we're going to think about them?

383
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:53,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a question.

384
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:54,788
[SPEAKER_08]: The latter.

385
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:56,608
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.

386
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,569
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well.

387
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:05,074
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to have to do the thinking on this, then all that talking I just did was for nothing.

388
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:14,717
[SPEAKER_01]: The weighted system, by the way, I'm actually a fan of the weighted system for a few reasons.

389
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:20,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think families are a fan of such a system, to be clear.

390
00:44:20,998 --> 00:44:21,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But

391
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,721
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the mixing of our students across the city.

392
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:29,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're one city.

393
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:31,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't when I grew up.

394
00:44:31,943 --> 00:44:35,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't grow up around here, but I grew up in a place where there were no neighbors.

395
00:44:36,444 --> 00:44:46,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the neighborhoods that people, many of the people who live in Medford still remember were, you know, they were all the kids on the street and we all knew each other and we walked to school and all.

396
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:54,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wish we could go back to that, but I know most kids are not roaming the streets at all.

397
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,787
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just shocking to how few kids you ever see on the streets.

398
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:22,233
[SPEAKER_01]: This notion that your friends that you go to school with have to be the friends that live next door isn't one that I like it, but I think that's the thing that's gone that is never coming back unless we can literally stop having cell phones and game systems.

399
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that day.

400
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:28,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I would too, but I think we all have to continue to mourn it and move on.

401
00:45:30,402 --> 00:45:40,448
[SPEAKER_01]: So mixing kids across neighborhoods and, frankly, socioeconomics and all the other things, I think, is a great idea.

402
00:45:41,828 --> 00:45:49,913
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if there is one system on this list that will cause an endless political firestorm, it is the weighted system.

403
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:56,516
[SPEAKER_01]: The family who buys a house next to, pick your school, and then it's told they're going to the school on the other side of the city.

404
00:45:58,157 --> 00:45:59,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those people will be

405
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:05,819
[SPEAKER_01]: screaming at us at school committee, and then if we don't have enough time for that, they'll go to city council.

406
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And- Yeah.

407
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:24,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do have to say the one thing that I appreciate so much that's so wonderful about the Missituck is it's also the only elementary school that truly represents the population of Medford in one elementary school.

408
00:46:27,115 --> 00:46:27,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And- Yes.

409
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:48,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I loved the school and I, you know, I don't, my kids didn't go to the other schools, so I can't comment on those schools, but the cultural aspects, the, you know, there was a, at least before the pandemic ruined everything, we had the

410
00:46:50,573 --> 00:47:00,198
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, it wasn't Thanksgiving, but it was like a big thing with lots of food and all the different backgrounds of folks in the community that sent their kids there came.

411
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:04,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was clearly a fire code violation.

412
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,521
[SPEAKER_01]: There were so many people every single year.

413
00:47:07,402 --> 00:47:08,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful.

414
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:11,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do agree with that.

415
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:13,145
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think

416
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:19,332
[SPEAKER_01]: the weighted system is like a pretty nasty surprise for families.

417
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:24,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that once we get full, you're going to have to do that for now.

418
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:31,857
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would be a big fan of what is it going to take, what's it going to cost to do one of those restructurings.

419
00:47:32,337 --> 00:47:37,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean for 2027, like at the school year 2020, fall of 2026 or something, like there may end up, you know,

420
00:47:46,495 --> 00:48:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at these numbers, I know that there's, you know, if we moved like a bunch of kindergartners or preschool kids into the middle schools and to Andrews, that we would run into like, the bathrooms are wrong and all this other stuff that's very expensive.

421
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:05,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just super.

422
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:08,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

423
00:48:09,651 --> 00:48:11,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that's important to note too is that

424
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:20,360
[SPEAKER_09]: in order to do the work for this resolution and to get the data and have some initial conversations.

425
00:48:21,562 --> 00:48:26,186
[SPEAKER_09]: This process to lead us to this subcommittee meeting has been pretty insular.

426
00:48:27,787 --> 00:48:37,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not engaged in conversation around solutions with staff members or with caregivers.

427
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:48,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is one of the things that I'm happy that we're here at this subcommittee meeting to also just extend the conversation.

428
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:54,566
[SPEAKER_09]: our list of solutions based on the data as a preliminary.

429
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:56,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Attempt.

430
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:11,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, as I've been looking at this list as well, like, the other thing that sort of strikes me that is a conundrum is when you look at the placement.

431
00:49:12,594 --> 00:49:18,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Of relative to the placement of all the other schools geographically.

432
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:23,907
[SPEAKER_05]: It does create a challenge because it's in the corner of the city.

433
00:49:24,648 --> 00:49:31,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's, there's not a 360 degree realm around the talk.

434
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:33,792
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just like, you know, sort of half of that, right?

435
00:49:33,812 --> 00:49:34,172
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 180 degrees.

436
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:47,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Of houses available, and I'm not a space planning expert, nor am I a redistricting expert, but I've looked at the maps several times and just sort of.

437
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:53,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotten to the conclusion that, like, we would have to pick kids up next to the McGlynn.

438
00:49:54,210 --> 00:50:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: and send them to the Missituck or we'd have to pick them up next door to the Brooks and send them to the Missituck because there's no other way you could like scoop up another 150 kids because of the placement of that school.

439
00:50:08,764 --> 00:50:15,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does make me wonder whether the placement of that school does mean it shouldn't

440
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:27,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Be used quite the same way as the other schools that have, like, an actual radius around them in terms of, like, pulling students into a place.

441
00:50:27,028 --> 00:50:31,993
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not too too far away so that we can have more walkers to school and all of that.

442
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:36,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I think is valuable for all kinds of reasons.

443
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:38,780
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've often thought about, like.

444
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:50,247
[SPEAKER_05]: What could be actually, like, the early didn't sort of come to my mind, but I was really thinking, like, we've invested all this money in the McGlynn playground.

445
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Could the McGlynn become a much bigger.

446
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Elementary school and the take on.

447
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,643
[SPEAKER_05]: something else like a 5-6 or something like that.

448
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:11,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do think this like study would be a really important place to sort of get some additional data about where we go from here.

449
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:24,973
[SPEAKER_05]: The other concern that I have though is like what do we need to do for August to alleviate what's happening at the Roberts?

450
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:26,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Like do we need to

451
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:35,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask incoming kindergarten parents if there are volunteers to be redistricted over to miss a tuck.

452
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:41,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do we, it just seems like there is 610 students is too many students for that building.

453
00:51:41,317 --> 00:51:42,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So what.

454
00:51:43,638 --> 00:51:47,401
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we need to do in the short term?

455
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:51,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I think is my question that could alleviate the right now.

456
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:11,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for me, and I do open up that question to beyond myself, I know we have Michelle Kroll on the call, Joan Bowen, there's caregivers, there's other admin on the call.

457
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:22,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the only thing that I would say, and again, this is something that we've only been talking about since January.

458
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:32,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there hasn't been a lot of time to message to kind of have a little bit more intent on that.

459
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:43,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to overburden the Roberts, but I think this is why we are tracking the kindergarten enrollment every week.

460
00:52:44,317 --> 00:52:47,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I share with school leaders where we are and what that looks like.

461
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:58,995
[SPEAKER_09]: At the very least, I think relocating the two preschool programs will free up some space for Ms.

462
00:52:59,035 --> 00:52:59,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Kroll.

463
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:10,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Hiring an additional teacher will free up the pressure that's currently in the specialist schedule.

464
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are band-aids for 25, 26.

465
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I am completely open to

466
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:28,579
[SPEAKER_09]: to your point about reaching out to incoming kindergarten families and seeing what is there.

467
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:36,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime someone reaches out with inter-district approval for the Roberts, I pretty much have been approving it, but it's not much.

468
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:42,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am definitely open to those questions.

469
00:53:43,426 --> 00:53:49,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have a sense for like, and maybe this is a next step, like if we relocated the MEEP,

470
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Programs.

471
00:53:52,492 --> 00:54:02,101
[SPEAKER_05]: How big could the kindergarten class get before like, we have to ring the bell again at like, could could you take if you relocated those 2 classrooms?

472
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:04,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you take a 5th class at the next year?

473
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Michelle can speak to the specifics of this.

474
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:11,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's not.

475
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,011
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been living with five kindergarten classrooms.

476
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:18,692
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not the matter of, do we have a fifth kindergarten classroom?

477
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:20,553
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that additional section.

478
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:21,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

479
00:54:22,353 --> 00:54:23,634
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think that's what I mean.

480
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:32,957
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have those two MEEP classes, could you add a section knowing how the rest of your sections in the other grades are going to fall out?

481
00:54:38,014 --> 00:54:41,537
[SPEAKER_05]: We needed 6 right now.

482
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:41,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

483
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:49,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right now, like, Dr Lucy just said, I currently have 5 case, so that would be fine.

484
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that my worry is right now.

485
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:55,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to add a section of 4th grade and.

486
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:16,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, if approved, I'm going to have to add another section of grade two, because I currently have grade, I have five first grades with, I have 90 kiddos that will be moving on to grade two, which would require five.

487
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:23,177
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it gets tricky for me, because I don't now have another classroom.

488
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:34,359
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I opened, if the two MEAPs left and went to the MISATUC, I would be able to make a couple shifts, because those two MEAP classrooms are downstairs on the first floor.

489
00:55:34,379 --> 00:55:46,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I could relocate my Connections classrooms that are upstairs on third floor to come down, which would give me the classroom space for the other grade levels.

490
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would actually,

491
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,381
[SPEAKER_00]: It would open up a lot of doors for me at the Roberts if that were to occur.

492
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:58,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if we move those to meet classes.

493
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have the right number of classrooms 1 to 5.

494
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:11,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could again support 5 kindergartens if necessary.

495
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:12,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

496
00:56:12,653 --> 00:56:12,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

497
00:56:13,294 --> 00:56:14,895
[SPEAKER_05]: That I think that.

498
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:19,345
[SPEAKER_05]: With additional with the additional right.

499
00:56:19,905 --> 00:56:27,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my next question is whether the additional staff that the Roberts needs are in the budget yet, or if we need to, you know.

500
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:28,830
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not yet.

501
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:29,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

502
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:35,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have to find a way to support.

503
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:39,955
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 additional 2.

504
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:43,477
[SPEAKER_09]: 2, I believe.

505
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,555
[SPEAKER_09]: The additional fourth is in the budget.

506
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:49,757
[SPEAKER_09]: The additional second is not.

507
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:52,479
[SPEAKER_09]: And the specialist teacher is not.

508
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,520
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

509
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:56,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would be two more FTEs.

510
00:56:57,884 --> 00:57:01,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And does the budget include five kindergarten or four?

511
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:03,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Five.

512
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:04,289
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

513
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:05,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

514
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:10,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's net two extra that we need to find a home for in the budget.

515
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:11,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

516
00:57:12,316 --> 00:57:12,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

517
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:26,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the, so the space study, my other question, um, is whether the space, the space that he only basically is going to give us the data of like, here's what you could consider doing with this space.

518
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they're not going to engage in like the public.

519
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:35,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Conversation that's for the district.

520
00:57:35,925 --> 00:57:38,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a member.

521
00:57:40,452 --> 00:57:40,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

522
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:41,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

523
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:42,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for all this.

524
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that pulling it together was was a lot.

525
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:46,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to everyone who's on this call.

526
00:57:47,494 --> 00:57:53,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I'm going back a little bit to some of the questions about the previous slide.

527
00:57:53,796 --> 00:57:58,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm really intrigued by the early childhood.

528
00:57:58,077 --> 00:58:02,398
[SPEAKER_07]: As member Russo said, I've heard the five, six, seven, eight floated.

529
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I hadn't seen anything around the.

530
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:13,515
[SPEAKER_07]: restructuring at the elementary level, would that open up more pre-K programming to families in Medford?

531
00:58:13,635 --> 00:58:26,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's not as cutthroat as some of the after-school lottery, but I do hear people feeling really, really lucky to have a preschool space in the public schools.

532
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:29,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So does it affect that at all?

533
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:31,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it could.

534
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:38,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Joan Bowen's on the call, but I would say yes, but go ahead, Joan.

535
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:39,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

536
00:58:39,986 --> 00:58:42,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could definitely open up more classrooms.

537
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:44,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

538
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:47,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're talking here tonight, space is an issue.

539
00:58:48,928 --> 00:58:55,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have pretty good enrollment in our pre K programs and I would like to expand it.

540
00:58:55,772 --> 00:59:02,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something we talked about to with the new high school, having an early childhood set an early education center.

541
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:10,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of thing so I think this could definitely open more opportunities and I was going to ask how it interfaces with the.

542
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:14,887
[SPEAKER_07]: MSBA proposal to bring more early childhood into.

543
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:18,049
[SPEAKER_07]: The high school, I don't know if there's more to say there.

544
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:21,572
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I can give a brief update.

545
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:22,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what.

546
00:59:23,155 --> 00:59:37,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we currently have some early childhood programming in the high school and because previously it was all there, there is a willingness on the part of the MSBA to allow that to be in scope.

547
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:47,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is in scope to explore a universal-ish pre-K model.

548
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,104
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be housed in the new building, whatever that new building looks like.

549
00:59:54,765 --> 01:00:01,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the reimbursement structures a little bit different on the Pre K side than it is on the typical.

550
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:06,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, like, 9 to 12 side, but there is reimbursement there particularly.

551
01:00:06,975 --> 01:00:09,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I think and it will change, of course, as the state.

552
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:17,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Assuming the state continues to push on the idea of universal pre-K and prioritize and spend accordingly.

553
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:30,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think of this effort as something that we have to do to create some slack in the system to get us to that place.

554
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:36,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And then potentially be able to extract from this

555
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:40,975
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger picture, the pre-K and put it at the high school.

556
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So we should sort of be thinking about that when we're thinking about solutions so that we're not like yo-yoing, so to speak, back and forth.

557
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:58,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think until we have the data about what's possible, you know, that will be tough.

558
01:00:58,384 --> 01:01:06,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, again, in my mind, like, I sort of feel like put 5-6 at the Missittuck and

559
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:15,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the fact that it is that it doesn't have a radius around it and it's in the corner of the city not matter because everyone's going to go there.

560
01:01:17,193 --> 01:01:25,980
[SPEAKER_05]: versus trying to maintain it as the same as the other elementary schools, who knows if that's actually possible or feasible.

561
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:36,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So I look forward to the study results so that we then can say, OK, with all of this, what really do we have to do and when?

562
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:45,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And frankly, how does it line up with what will happen at the high school and particularly as the feasibility study there advances?

563
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:50,447
[SPEAKER_05]: the pre-K piece comes into focus.

564
01:01:51,548 --> 01:01:59,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's helpful because then I was thinking, well, if you've got pre-K at the high school, are we considering a K-2 model in

565
01:02:01,157 --> 01:02:03,239
[SPEAKER_07]: K-2 schools and 3-5 schools.

566
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are a lot of possibilities.

567
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree, we have to understand what is possible.

568
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:13,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know there are some challenges around retrofitting what was built for middle school students, for elementary.

569
01:02:14,506 --> 01:02:29,517
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also think we have some inequities at the middle school level in terms of service provided and students in both schools needing things and either having to double staff particular services or concentrating certain student populations in a single school.

570
01:02:29,857 --> 01:02:33,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really interested in the restructuring for that.

571
01:02:33,068 --> 01:02:35,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this conversation is really around elementary school, but.

572
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: to the sense that some of this can solve some of the challenges we're seeing at other grades, I think is really important.

573
01:02:44,776 --> 01:02:50,658
[SPEAKER_07]: The weighted lottery system, I think the potential and the critiques are all really valid.

574
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:55,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate your explaining what that meant, because I read this and I went, oh, weighted.

575
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you are within a certain geographic radius, you go there and that gets into the 360, 180.

576
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:12,051
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever it is, because I have a personal interest in increasing alternative transportation around walking and biking.

577
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:18,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if you're not busing around a certain radius, anyone who's living within that radius.

578
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:25,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think there are certain areas of the city that are going to need busing or vehicle transportation either way.

579
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:28,685
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if that's weighted

580
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:39,324
[SPEAKER_07]: enrollment or if it's actually a redistricting because you kind of say, all right, if people are all the way up in the heights, they're going to be bused no matter what.

581
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:41,208
[SPEAKER_07]: So does it make sense?

582
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:45,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have to be bused to the Roberts?

583
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:47,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I know traffic in the city, 93.

584
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:49,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's awful.

585
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:54,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in one of those places where if I walk five minutes, I could go to it.

586
01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:57,520
[SPEAKER_07]: My kids would go to any of the four elementary schools.

587
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So I see the traffic.

588
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:06,326
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what I was wondering around Weighted Lottery to do a geographic radius.

589
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there are neighborhoods that need busing either way,

590
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:15,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think I would be busing to the school that is closest to them.

591
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:19,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are there more opportunities to rethink where folks are going?

592
01:04:20,997 --> 01:04:22,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I think more opportunities.

593
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:24,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the weighted does not have to be one criteria.

594
01:04:25,682 --> 01:04:33,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I think their geographical location, as well as maybe siblings that are already in the school.

595
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:33,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there are

596
01:04:37,038 --> 01:04:52,027
[SPEAKER_09]: There are several ways to construct a weighted lottery that we would have to have lots of conversation if that was one of the ways that we were thinking of going, that we would have to craft that as a community.

597
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:55,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that could be true for redistricting as well.

598
01:04:55,795 --> 01:05:11,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there are much more formal processes that apparently Medford hasn't engaged in before, but there is some common sense logic that is not always applied to the mapping of things, namely that this is my backyard and I could walk here.

599
01:05:11,306 --> 01:05:16,289
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's also, you know, I know I've said it before, but

600
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:25,429
[SPEAKER_09]: in terms of like the restructuring conversation, I have not brought teachers into that conversation either.

601
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a very big conversation.

602
01:05:28,431 --> 01:05:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

603
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:33,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the last thing I was going to mention.

604
01:05:33,132 --> 01:05:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will step back and let other people add thoughts to the conversation.

605
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, thank you.

606
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:56,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, I felt I have some thoughts about next steps, but before we do that, I did want to find out if there was anybody who has joined us who had a question or a comment for us.

607
01:05:57,878 --> 01:06:01,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can just use the raise hand feature and we will be able to unmute you.

608
01:06:20,965 --> 01:06:22,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to say thank you to Ms.

609
01:06:22,526 --> 01:06:28,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Kroll and Mr. DiClemente for being here as well.

610
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a full day and all that good stuff.

611
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:33,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for being here.

612
01:06:33,714 --> 01:06:34,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see Ms.

613
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:35,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Demos as well.

614
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:37,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say that.

615
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:37,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you as well.

616
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:41,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see caregivers as well.

617
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:42,720
[SPEAKER_07]: We see you, everybody.

618
01:06:44,881 --> 01:06:45,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big conversation.

619
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:59,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see a lot of parents who I know have lots of things to say, generally speaking.

620
01:06:59,845 --> 01:07:03,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you sure there's nothing you want to add to the conversation?

621
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot to take in, but it really was.

622
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of thoughts and questions.

623
01:07:08,188 --> 01:07:13,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And given that this is kind of the first public conversation we're having about this.

624
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:15,812
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a hand.

625
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:18,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Christina McGordy.

626
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going to

627
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Mute you, I think.

628
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:28,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I think that worked.

629
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:29,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

630
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you give me your name and address for the record?

631
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:37,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Christina McGordy, 24 North Street, Medford.

632
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:49,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I had a lot of thoughts, but a lot of this is so theoretical that, like, I will say that I'm glad that this conversation is happening though.

633
01:07:50,055 --> 01:07:53,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for all the people are here, I guess, just because I think.

634
01:07:54,697 --> 01:08:03,021
[SPEAKER_03]: like Jenny was saying, the focus like right now is more on like what happens for this August, right?

635
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:08,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a lot of like research and planning to like think about the good long-term solution.

636
01:08:08,944 --> 01:08:20,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want, just because there was so much info, I just wanted to go over the, so if the two, it's two MEEP classes that are proposed to like maybe move to Mississippi.

637
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,890
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

638
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:22,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

639
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

640
01:08:23,131 --> 01:08:23,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think

641
01:08:25,152 --> 01:08:31,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have what I can think of as three empty classrooms.

642
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just like envisioning how this could impact other things.

643
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:41,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm envisioning like the after school and this other room would probably.

644
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:43,199
[SPEAKER_03]: be taken from me.

645
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:49,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're supposed to get back a second grade that we really need.

646
01:08:49,144 --> 01:08:51,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the city year room this year.

647
01:08:51,386 --> 01:09:07,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm just wondering, like, I know the kindergarten piece was sort of like unknown yet, but it sounded like potentially there could be like kindergarteners sent to Mississippi if the Roberts needs more space.

648
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:10,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just wondering about the numbers and like,

649
01:09:10,797 --> 01:09:15,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, how will like keep an eye on, cause I don't, I don't know that there's another room.

650
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:24,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they had to open a fourth kindergarten, um, Like that might not be able to have to work, um, out.

651
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:26,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

652
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:36,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was curious about like, if we'll just keep, you know, keep an eye on that and what those K numbers look like, just to make sure that those don't get too big.

653
01:09:36,073 --> 01:09:39,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you just redid the numbers too, with like the new contract.

654
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:39,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think.

655
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:44,633
[SPEAKER_03]: They are all a little bit more close to realistic.

656
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:46,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I just wanted to ask about that.

657
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:50,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for that question.

658
01:09:50,137 --> 01:09:57,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I heard, and maybe Dr can confirm is that to meet classes, then we would.

659
01:09:58,783 --> 01:10:03,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We would not have a need to also relocate kind of partners this year.

660
01:10:03,226 --> 01:10:04,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

661
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:04,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

662
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:10,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I was trying to follow and I know it sounded like they had to add some other classes and I, I didn't.

663
01:10:12,597 --> 01:10:16,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow exactly where it landed, so it would sound it sounds like you wouldn't need to.

664
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:17,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

665
01:10:17,799 --> 01:10:23,761
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my 1 concern question for for this year.

666
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:29,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the other concern I had is about space, but it sounds like you're doing a space study.

667
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:36,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause part of me wonders like if all this, like what the actual size is and then number of classrooms are at each school.

668
01:10:37,183 --> 01:10:44,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And if like they each could really hold like, you know, more students or whatever.

669
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:46,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad that space study is happening.

670
01:10:46,968 --> 01:10:47,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

671
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:49,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for that, Christina.

672
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that's important.

673
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:54,480
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the key piece of the space utilization study.

674
01:10:57,101 --> 01:11:10,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Sherman Hudson would be involved clearly in assigning all of this, but I do know myself that there are some spaces in the Missituck that could be used in a different way if needed.

675
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:11,727
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that they've

676
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:18,690
[SPEAKER_09]: had the fortunate ability to use space a little bit more creatively.

677
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:24,653
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't worry so much about the space because I do think that Ms.

678
01:11:24,693 --> 01:11:27,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Sherman-Hudson will be able to account for that.

679
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

680
01:11:32,858 --> 01:11:36,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Rebecca Gutland with a hand.

681
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Rebecca, can you unmute or do you need me to do it?

682
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:42,979
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

683
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:43,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got it.

684
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

685
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:48,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really glad this conversation is finally happening.

686
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:51,546
[SPEAKER_04]: This is give me your name and address.

687
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:57,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, this is Rebecca Gutwin and 47 Morrison Street in Medford.

688
01:11:58,071 --> 01:11:58,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

689
01:11:59,473 --> 01:12:01,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm glad this conversation is finally happening.

690
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:04,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I know at the Roberts, we've seen it coming for like five years.

691
01:12:04,897 --> 01:12:08,540
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a little surprising to find out that there were like no

692
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:12,616
[SPEAKER_04]: lands in motion because we were really bursting at the seams.

693
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:24,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing that I see in some of these plans, and I know we're talking about the MEEP classrooms leaving the Roberts, and I think that's probably the best plan right now.

694
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:28,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely trust Ms.

695
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:32,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Kroll's guidance on that, is losing some of that community.

696
01:12:33,568 --> 01:12:41,330
[SPEAKER_04]: If all of a sudden, your preschooler can't go to school with their older siblings and things like that, you do start to lose community.

697
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:43,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would only lose that at one school.

698
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:47,756
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to continue down that path too far.

699
01:12:47,776 --> 01:12:55,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would just be a loss for our community in a whole to not be able to offer that.

700
01:12:56,788 --> 01:13:02,931
[SPEAKER_04]: But beyond that, I love the idea of the 5, 6, 7, 8.

701
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:11,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that could lead to some like really developmentally appropriate places for teens and tweens as they make those transitions.

702
01:13:12,076 --> 01:13:13,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be awesome.

703
01:13:14,197 --> 01:13:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a lot of the anxiety out like this time of year.

704
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:18,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of anxiety.

705
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:24,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm talking, you know, parents down from the ledge about kids who are going to middle school with their friends.

706
01:13:24,585 --> 01:13:27,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we would lose, we wouldn't have to have that.

707
01:13:27,087 --> 01:13:29,249
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't have to have those panicking moments.

708
01:13:29,269 --> 01:13:29,890
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

709
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:37,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really dislike the K-1 to Early Learning Center, especially if we're looking at the Missituck.

710
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:50,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I like those first days of people trying to send their kids on buses, especially when they're kindergarten and first graders, are also super anxiety-producing days.

711
01:13:51,082 --> 01:14:03,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to end up with like, just like, like logistically, the traffic of dropping off at the Missatuck from all over the city, because you don't want to put your kindergartener on a bus without their older siblings.

712
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:06,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think that there are some real, like,

713
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:12,354
[SPEAKER_04]: like community-based hurdles that would need to be overcome with that system.

714
01:14:12,935 --> 01:14:22,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of needing to go to, you know, like three STEM nights because you have a first grader and a fourth grader and a seventh grader is like,

715
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:32,608
[SPEAKER_04]: We already have, you know, it's so difficult already to make sure that we're not, like, elementaries aren't, you know, double scheduling with what's happening at middle schools and things like that.

716
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:37,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I think adding to that complexity would be really challenging.

717
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:50,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So while I think splitting some things would be awesome, splitting it too far starts to, like, create other hurdles that I don't know if we can completely predict, or at least we need to look deeply into.

718
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:59,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that was my initial reaction because there's just, there's a lot, there's a lot of moving pieces.

719
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

720
01:15:01,681 --> 01:15:02,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Rebecca.

721
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:05,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else?

722
01:15:09,106 --> 01:15:10,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I add something?

723
01:15:11,928 --> 01:15:12,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you, Rebecca.

724
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:16,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually really appreciated that, you know, the scenario of

725
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:22,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Not two schools, but three schools, plus the high school.

726
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:26,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have kids all over the place, I think is a real concern.

727
01:15:26,552 --> 01:15:37,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when I hear your concerns, which when my kids were little, they were two years apart, so would have been plenty of opportunity for two schools.

728
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:45,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our challenge, I mean, the challenge has been explained, I think, pretty succinctly.

729
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:49,350
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, none of us here would build the Missatuck where it is.

730
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:50,552
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like the answer.

731
01:15:52,676 --> 01:15:54,679
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean,

732
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,801
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't make those other schools any bigger.

733
01:15:58,142 --> 01:16:05,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's no ideal solution because, I mean, frankly, because of where that building is.

734
01:16:06,907 --> 01:16:13,831
[SPEAKER_01]: There were plenty of other elementary schools when we built those schools that we could have used, but I wasn't around for that.

735
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:19,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think we're gonna end up, whatever solution we come up with is going to be

736
01:16:21,549 --> 01:16:26,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Constrained I, I think that's a word that's okay to use superintendent doesn't like it.

737
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,690
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be constrained.

738
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,111
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be constrained by.

739
01:16:29,611 --> 01:16:35,652
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, the laws of physics on, like, how many people we can put in a building and I know that you understand that Rebecca.

740
01:16:35,672 --> 01:16:38,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not suggesting you don't, but.

741
01:16:39,473 --> 01:16:41,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we may end up with.

742
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:47,475
[SPEAKER_01]: With, I mean, I think about there are plenty of other school districts that.

743
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in Somerville that have.

744
01:16:51,446 --> 01:16:58,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always thought it was odd that we had such a consistent set of, I mean, great, I didn't think it was odd in a bad way, I thought it was great.

745
01:16:58,471 --> 01:17:15,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you hear about these other school districts, Somerville, obviously Boston, you know, there's K-1, there's 2-3, 4, there's, you know, but then there's also like 1 through 5s, they're like all these different kinds of configurations, which to me sounds

746
01:17:16,784 --> 01:17:21,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounded like a nightmare, but I sort of feel like I'm understanding why that is.

747
01:17:23,585 --> 01:17:28,347
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that it's not a nightmare, it's that it's the only dream we're gonna be able to have.

748
01:17:29,428 --> 01:17:40,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I think transportation costs are definitely going to be a major issue because any of these other options will require significantly more transportation.

749
01:17:42,155 --> 01:17:46,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did the math on the current number, it's $1.4 million for 180 days of school.

750
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:52,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only transporting the kids we do transport.

751
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we looking at doubling that?

752
01:17:56,303 --> 01:18:00,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we'll know more once we have the space study and we have ideas.

753
01:18:01,106 --> 01:18:04,868
[SPEAKER_01]: We can probably play that out to say, what will it actually cost?

754
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:09,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe it will double the transportation cost.

755
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:14,975
[SPEAKER_01]: But an additional $1.4 million a year is nothing compared to

756
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:26,699
[SPEAKER_01]: adding some stories to a building or all the other, you know, physical structure options that frankly are outside the realm of possible at this time.

757
01:18:27,612 --> 01:18:42,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate putting the lens on those scenarios, which we did hear plenty when we had the middle school, when we went to the middle school lottery, but this is obviously a lot more complicated because the middle schools are beside each other.

758
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:51,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit like, yeah, you can drive the extra 12 feet or whatever, but driving across the entire city is a much bigger ask.

759
01:18:56,821 --> 01:19:00,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Else other questions comments.

760
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:09,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Christina.

761
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:18,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I had another question because I was thinking about the meat.

762
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it I know, like, when we.

763
01:19:23,728 --> 01:19:28,069
[SPEAKER_03]: had MEEP come before and we had an extra kindergarten.

764
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:32,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So the kindergarten moved so that the MEEP could have a bathroom.

765
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:39,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, do the MEEPs, are they required to have like their own bathroom and like changing table?

766
01:19:39,392 --> 01:19:40,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like thinking.

767
01:19:40,772 --> 01:19:45,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be like, they probably probably have kindergarten rooms.

768
01:19:51,038 --> 01:19:51,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

769
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:53,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know, Joan, if you were chiming in.

770
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:59,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think those are all conversations that we would have to have.

771
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:09,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that if we are prioritizing, I would say that the MEEP classrooms need bathrooms more than kindergarten classrooms do.

772
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:19,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, when we have to add that fifth section of kindergarten, mostly at the Brooks and the Roberts, but it has happened at the McGlynn as well,

773
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:24,991
[SPEAKER_09]: there aren't, that fifth section does not have a bathroom in that kindergarten classroom.

774
01:20:26,533 --> 01:20:28,374
[SPEAKER_09]: The need, right, the need is different.

775
01:20:28,474 --> 01:20:31,137
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would say that that's the prioritization for sure.

776
01:20:32,157 --> 01:20:32,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.

777
01:20:32,978 --> 01:20:38,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just, I'm trying to stay concrete on the things we know versus like all the theoretical.

778
01:20:38,383 --> 01:20:39,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

779
01:20:39,744 --> 01:20:40,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

780
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:40,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

781
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:41,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

782
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:51,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, Mr Sherman Hudson will be involved in all of those conversations in terms of what happens in her building.

783
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:59,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I think, you know, I do think it's very interesting, like, to just point out that what people think of as, like.

784
01:20:59,877 --> 01:21:04,461
[SPEAKER_05]: A thing that happens in their school and how it.

785
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:11,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Would be different or change, like, chances are that change is happening, like, every single day somewhere else.

786
01:21:11,248 --> 01:21:16,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, Rebecca said, oh, I go to 2 stem nights and I was like, we didn't have stem night.

787
01:21:16,892 --> 01:21:22,996
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's just all kinds of differences across the schools that get operationalized and really, really different ways.

788
01:21:23,096 --> 01:21:26,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So the good news is we're not creating.

789
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:29,133
[SPEAKER_05]: New things that we haven't done before.

790
01:21:29,213 --> 01:21:36,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that we have to look in buildings different than perhaps we're used to, like, solving like, building based problems.

791
01:21:36,298 --> 01:21:42,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that's good because we have done this in kindergarten in many places for.

792
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:50,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Years now, and I will say, I get a lot of emails about a lot of things and the lack of a bathroom in a kindergarten is 1.

793
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:51,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not received so.

794
01:21:52,996 --> 01:22:02,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'll take that as a win, but I think it's good that we have a lot of options across, um, you know, across the.

795
01:22:02,945 --> 01:22:05,688
[SPEAKER_05]: The district to learn from, um, so that's great.

796
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:09,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Christina is your hand up on purpose.

797
01:22:09,712 --> 01:22:17,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just want to say I wasn't saying I wasn't.

798
01:22:18,914 --> 01:22:21,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ask that because of the K not having a bathroom.

799
01:22:21,995 --> 01:22:25,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to map out the changes in my brain.

800
01:22:27,577 --> 01:22:36,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had K without bathroom before because they actually moved.

801
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't want people to think I was complaining about that.

802
01:22:38,761 --> 01:22:40,581
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

803
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these things are different.

804
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:47,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all change and you have to work your way through that.

805
01:22:48,725 --> 01:22:52,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in whatever way it is needed, so it's okay.

806
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I'm, I'm glad that.

807
01:22:55,452 --> 01:22:59,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The principles are not, like, also having to be space planners in their spare time.

808
01:22:59,817 --> 01:23:05,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they can talk to each other and hear about how they, how these things have been operationalized real time, which is great.

809
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:21,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few thoughts in terms of next steps around what we might report out to the school committee and just so that they have a sense of what we talked about here.

810
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So there may need to be a brief presentation at our next school committee meeting.

811
01:23:29,798 --> 01:23:45,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was thinking that we might want to report out this committee recommending that those need classes move recommending that the budget addition of 2 occur and then potentially.

812
01:23:46,012 --> 01:23:50,516
[SPEAKER_05]: The formation of some sort of caregiver team that.

813
01:23:53,521 --> 01:24:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: will work with us on the space, I don't know what to call it, the strategic space planning team or something like that.

814
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:16,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Namely, maybe a small group of people who can help support community engagement, which will have to start to happen in the fall once that initial study is done.

815
01:24:16,478 --> 01:24:21,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the three things I was thinking about in terms of what comes next.

816
01:24:23,047 --> 01:24:31,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if my colleagues agree with that and want to make motion so that we can vote those out or have other thoughts.

817
01:24:34,252 --> 01:24:35,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So moved if you're writing it down.

818
01:24:36,713 --> 01:24:41,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to add I would just want to would like to add staff to the.

819
01:24:42,315 --> 01:24:43,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Space utilization team.

820
01:24:44,616 --> 01:24:47,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

821
01:24:48,757 --> 01:24:49,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so.

822
01:24:50,722 --> 01:25:01,471
[SPEAKER_05]: The first motion is to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the miss a tuck starting in August of 2025 by members.

823
01:25:01,491 --> 01:25:02,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So seconded by.

824
01:25:03,813 --> 01:25:07,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I can 2nd, but I did have a question from his crawl to Rebecca's point.

825
01:25:07,476 --> 01:25:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we do we know how many families.

826
01:25:09,758 --> 01:25:14,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Are are going to be affected in terms of.

827
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:19,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we don't know who the incoming preschoolers are unless we happen to know a parent.

828
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:23,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, I don't have incoming MEAP numbers right now.

829
01:25:23,106 --> 01:25:27,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I only just have my, what I have so far for my incoming kindergarten.

830
01:25:30,908 --> 01:25:32,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where, oh, sorry.

831
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:33,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, go ahead, go ahead.

832
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:41,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on collecting those numbers and I think we'll do a deeper dive on if they're in the Roberts community.

833
01:25:41,452 --> 01:25:48,274
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some students that are outside of the Roberts community based on the specific MEAP

834
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:53,434
[SPEAKER_02]: program that they require if it's a half day, full day, that sort of thing.

835
01:25:54,635 --> 01:25:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do provide transportation to meet students.

836
01:25:57,857 --> 01:26:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would also be provided to parents.

837
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:08,644
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll take a deeper dive actually to where their address is and how that will impact them attending the Missituck school.

838
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:15,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, in particular, but to Rebecca's point around whether they're being separated from their

839
01:26:18,515 --> 01:26:19,336
[SPEAKER_07]: their siblings.

840
01:26:21,057 --> 01:26:28,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because I was going to ask if there's any way to have one Meep classroom so we can prioritize people whose families are already in the system.

841
01:26:28,103 --> 01:26:30,304
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounds like we need both those classrooms.

842
01:26:31,926 --> 01:26:33,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need both classrooms.

843
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:33,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

844
01:26:36,209 --> 01:26:40,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, yeah, I would want, I think we can also find the data.

845
01:26:40,092 --> 01:26:43,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the McGlynn does not have a preschool program right now.

846
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:44,836
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no Meep at the McGlynn.

847
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:49,866
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the way that the MEEP is structured is it's

848
01:26:51,287 --> 01:26:56,709
[SPEAKER_09]: there's not always the luxury of like, it's not always a community-based program.

849
01:26:56,729 --> 01:27:01,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I know a family who has students at Roberts Brooks.

850
01:27:02,611 --> 01:27:03,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, correct.

851
01:27:04,312 --> 01:27:05,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this happens.

852
01:27:05,492 --> 01:27:06,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not minimizing anything.

853
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:10,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying that it's presently not at the McGlynn.

854
01:27:10,794 --> 01:27:16,296
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have the future goal of cohabitating all of the preschool programs together.

855
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:20,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can find that data exactly about

856
01:27:20,898 --> 01:27:23,042
[SPEAKER_09]: The makeup in terms of neighborhood families.

857
01:27:25,346 --> 01:27:32,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I think that might be worth including in messaging around the shift, obviously, that the priority is.

858
01:27:33,723 --> 01:27:58,684
[SPEAKER_07]: freeing up the space for the Roberts now, but also to remind people that this is part of the long-term thinking, that it's being considered both in these space utilization studies, but also in the new high school, because we have the rare opportunity, unlike other cities, to co-locate that kind of programming in a high school.

859
01:27:59,144 --> 01:27:59,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

860
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:01,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

861
01:28:03,662 --> 01:28:20,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have a motion to recommend that these two MEEP classrooms move from the Roberts to the Misituc starting in August 2025 by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

862
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll call the roll.

863
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

864
01:28:24,851 --> 01:28:25,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld?

865
01:28:25,852 --> 01:28:26,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sorry.

866
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:34,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, 3, 0, motion passes the 2nd motion by members.

867
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:45,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So, was to request the addition of 2 to the Robert school budget beginning in August of 2025 is there a 2nd.

868
01:28:47,133 --> 01:28:51,614
[SPEAKER_05]: 2nd, so the motion is by members.

869
01:28:51,634 --> 01:28:54,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So, seconded by member Reinfeldt.

870
01:28:54,515 --> 01:28:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll call the role members.

871
01:28:55,935 --> 01:28:56,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes.

872
01:28:57,515 --> 01:28:58,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt?

873
01:28:58,615 --> 01:28:58,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

874
01:28:59,276 --> 01:28:59,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

875
01:28:59,936 --> 01:29:00,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

876
01:29:00,956 --> 01:29:02,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes 3-0.

877
01:29:03,857 --> 01:29:10,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And the third motion as amended would be to create a strategic space planning

878
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:23,257
[SPEAKER_05]: task force of staff and caregivers to discuss and prepare for community engagement once the space needs study is complete.

879
01:29:23,737 --> 01:29:25,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved or seconded whichever you need me to do.

880
01:29:26,738 --> 01:29:29,819
[SPEAKER_05]: By member Rousseau, seconded by member Reinfeld, so I'll call the roll.

881
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:30,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

882
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:31,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

883
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld?

884
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:33,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

885
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:35,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Graham?

886
01:29:35,442 --> 01:29:37,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is motion passes 3-0.

887
01:29:40,114 --> 01:29:44,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need to authorize the space study or that's already engaged and ready to go?

888
01:29:45,878 --> 01:29:47,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Already engaged and ready to go.

889
01:29:47,419 --> 01:29:49,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

890
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And along with FY26 budget?

891
01:29:55,124 --> 01:29:57,526
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't believe so.

892
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:58,066
[SPEAKER_09]: No, 25.

893
01:29:59,948 --> 01:30:03,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I can double check, but I'm... That's separate from the recommissioning.

894
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:04,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

895
01:30:08,725 --> 01:30:10,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

896
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:30,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think as part of the moving, once I think, once the full committee is able to provide, approves, I suppose it's possible that they won't, but the relocation of the MEAP classrooms, I think communication needs to go out as soon as possible.

897
01:30:31,015 --> 01:30:33,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we've had challenges in the past,

898
01:30:34,933 --> 01:30:42,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, by last, what appears to be a last minute change and an inability to plan for an upcoming school year.

899
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:48,159
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, um, we don't have the authority anyways.

900
01:30:48,199 --> 01:30:50,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a CYA, uh, vote.

901
01:30:52,360 --> 01:31:03,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, I mean, I, I think the superintendent should begin the planning efforts regardless of, I mean, if the school committee voted no, that'd be unfortunate, but.

902
01:31:13,184 --> 01:31:17,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then, I don't know, I think the sooner we can communicate with families, the better is my point.

903
01:31:18,965 --> 01:31:19,405
[SPEAKER_08]: We agree.

904
01:31:19,425 --> 01:31:23,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

905
01:31:23,806 --> 01:31:26,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other questions from the committee?

906
01:31:26,787 --> 01:31:27,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments?

907
01:31:28,207 --> 01:31:29,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions to adjourn?

908
01:31:30,288 --> 01:31:32,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to say thank you for doing this.

909
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:36,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I was kind of beating down your door even as you were in the process of transitioning.

910
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:40,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate the turnaround on this.

911
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:44,572
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's important work that has to get done.

912
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:50,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it feels, as somebody said, five years too late, but I'm glad it's happening.

913
01:31:50,736 --> 01:31:51,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad it's moving.

914
01:31:51,696 --> 01:32:00,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to all the staff and caregivers who signed on to learn more and raise issues.

915
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:02,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

916
01:32:03,845 --> 01:32:04,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

917
01:32:05,466 --> 01:32:06,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

918
01:32:06,286 --> 01:32:07,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

919
01:32:08,027 --> 01:32:08,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

920
01:32:09,168 --> 01:32:10,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by member Rousseau.

921
01:32:10,349 --> 01:32:11,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call the roll.

922
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

923
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
