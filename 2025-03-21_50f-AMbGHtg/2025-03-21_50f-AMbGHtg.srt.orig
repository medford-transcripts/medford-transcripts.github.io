[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

22
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:50,153
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make a motion to take paper

33
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:19,288
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can take

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Paper one, under motions, orders, and resolutions, paper 15-497.

00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of order, please.

00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:36,703

[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please mark Councilor Knight as present.

41
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:43,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

42
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:44,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as president.

43
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:45,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

44
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:51,434
[SPEAKER_07]: 15497, offered by Vice President Longo Kern and Councilor Marks.

45
00:01:51,534 --> 00:02:03,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city administration report back to the council with regards to what, if anything, has been done regarding the flight patterns from Logan Airport.

46
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:12,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it further resolved that Massport representative with Medford's appointment to the Massport Community Advisory Board appear before the Medford City Council.

47
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:15,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President, is any of this related to the

48
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:18,624
[SPEAKER_07]: buzzing of method we've had from the Blue Angels today.

49
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:19,424
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not today.

50
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:19,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

51
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

52
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:39,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, myself and actually Council Marks put this on the agenda because the entire council, I believe has been getting a number of, um, complaints from residents who are hearing the airplanes coming from Logan airport above their heads, whether their windows are open or not.

53
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it's disturbing sleep.

54
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,512
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disturbing quality of life.

55
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:45,829
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of it's going on.

56
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,452
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear complaints from West Medford and from the Medford Heights.

57
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:53,114
[SPEAKER_12]: And we actually have a resident here to speak tonight.

58
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:59,539
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I would like her to come up and explain what's going on in her neighborhood, which is actually close to my neighborhood.

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanted to bring it up because it is hard to get answers from Massport.

60
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,947
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to know exactly what our administration is doing with regards to these complaints.

61
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:27,335
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the people need answers, and I think we need, whether it's a number of studies that can be done, analysis, analyzing the situation to make sure that we try to get some resolve for our residents.

62
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:30,237
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Somerville brought up the issue recently.

63
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:38,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, May 7th is the article that I read from Somerville, actually forwarded to me by somebody else who was complaining in the West Medford area.

64
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:40,162
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Board of Aldermen's

65
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:44,064
[SPEAKER_12]: sought answers to aircraft noise issues.

66
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:57,506
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually are researching flight patterns, or asking that it be researched, flight patterns and the number of residents affected be analyzed and be compared with other runways and communities.

67
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:58,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I read it further.

68
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I did some research online.

69
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:09,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that an article was in the Medford Patch last year, 2014, at which time Massport stated they were going to do a one-year study.

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,984
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to, you know, further amend my resolve and ask that we get any results from that Massport study.

71
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:35,938
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if Council Member Marks has anything else to add, but it seems like the flight patterns have doubled, and there's also an issue with the lane, the certain, it's hard to understand, but the lane that was opened, which is,

72
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:40,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Logan's runway 33 left, or R33L.

73
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:53,376
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the airport's last major runway to receive RNAV, and planes that take off are using this new runway to fly over areas such as East Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford.

74
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:59,819
[SPEAKER_12]: So that opened June 2013, and I think that's the beginning of when the complaints started here.

75
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:04,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, around this time, is when we started to get the complaints.

76
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:05,447
[SPEAKER_12]: They kind of die off.

77
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:09,430
[SPEAKER_12]: When all the windows close, people start going inside their homes.

78
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,152
[SPEAKER_12]: So for November, December, they start dying off.

79
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, all of a sudden, we're getting the complaints again.

80
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're getting people who can't enjoy their backyards.

81
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:22,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Or they can't even watch TV with their windows open, because these flights are happening every two minutes.

82
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,061
[SPEAKER_12]: At least you're seeing your plane fly over.

83
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,543
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to join in on what

84
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:31,730
[SPEAKER_12]: the city of Somerville is trying to do.

85
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:45,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's no reason why Medford can't analyze and strategize and draft their own recommendations to mass board or ask for answers so that we can, you know, figure out if there's a way that we can lessen the inconvenience to our residents.

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,502
[SPEAKER_07]: A madam vice president, council Marks.

89
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:51,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

90
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:57,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank council Longo current for, uh, her resolution and, uh, her comments she just made.

91
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:01,457
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been an ongoing issue for a number of years in the community.

92
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:18,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's been several resolutions before this council asking the administration to look into why the increase of air traffic over our community, what can be done on behalf of the many residents and the many different neighborhoods.

93
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:27,778
[SPEAKER_11]: You would think that it only impacts certain areas of the city, but the complaints I'm receiving go from South Method to North Method to Wellington to West Method.

94
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:34,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It really covers the entire city, and the disturbance is citywide.

95
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:45,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to go on to the Massport website, and they list noise disturbance by community for each year.

96
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:55,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And this year, which is year to date, January to April, there was 71 complaints from Method residents and 29 callers.

97
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:58,275
[SPEAKER_11]: that called up.

98
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:17,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So the numbers, you know, I think speak volume to having someone go find the number to call, first of all, because it's such a concern and impacting their daily life that we really, as a community, need to act upon this, Mr. President.

99
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:23,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I also took the liberty, because the Community Advisory Committee

100
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,666
[SPEAKER_11]: which is a committee that was created some years back.

101
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:42,294
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not under the auspice of Massport, but it's a separate body comprised of a resident from each of the impacted areas in a certain radius from Logan Airport.

102
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:48,797
[SPEAKER_11]: And our representative that was appointed by the mayor, she's been on a number of years.

103
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:52,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Her name is Yelena, and I'll spell the last name.

104
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:55,369
[SPEAKER_11]: It's S-H-U-L-K-I-N-A.

105
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:56,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Shokina.

106
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:03,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And she is the Meffitt CAC, Community Advisory Committee member.

107
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:21,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to give out her email address, Mr. President, because I think residents that have concerns should know who they can talk to, who is the representative from our community that is representing every resident in this community when these board meetings take place.

108
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:35,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're the ones that have impact, that sit down with Massport and sit down with the FAA and are able to affect change on flight patents, on noise from planes, and a host of issues.

109
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:45,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And her email address is lzlatsman at yahoo.com.

110
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't have access to email, a phone number is 781.

111
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:53,806
[SPEAKER_11]: 395-1471.

112
00:08:56,968 --> 00:09:02,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, Yelena is our community person on the community advisory committee.

113
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:20,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's only appropriate that residents that have concern, I think it was a couple of years ago, Mr. President, I offered a resolution requesting that Yelena appear before the council and update us on anything that was taking place within the advisory board.

114
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't get any response, nor did Jelena ever appear before this council.

115
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:32,199
[SPEAKER_11]: The president of CAC, the Community Advisory Committee, is a woman by the name of Ms.

116
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Sandra Kuntz, K-U-N-Z.

117
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:40,306
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's the president of this, I believe, 30-member board that makes recommendations.

118
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:47,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And her email address is skunz at verizon.net.

119
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's the president of the board.

120
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:59,058
[SPEAKER_11]: and I guess was instrumental in putting together the Citizen Advisory Board back some years ago because of the issues she had in her home community.

121
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:09,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to touch upon what Councilor Lungo-Kern mentioned about what's taking place with the Boston Logan Airport noise study.

122
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,901
[SPEAKER_11]: They refer to it as BLANS, B-L-A-N-S.

123
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:19,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was supposedly a three-phase approach to addressing some of the concerns

124
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,295
[SPEAKER_11]: that have been mentioned by area communities.

125
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:31,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I could, off the website, it says this is the largest FAA-funded noise study in the nation.

126
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:37,421
[SPEAKER_11]: The total dollar value for the study is approximately $8.3 million.

127
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,542
[SPEAKER_11]: 80%, 6.6 million, is funded by airport improvement program grants.

128
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:47,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the remaining is 1.7 million

129
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:49,853
[SPEAKER_11]: which is funded by Massport.

130
00:10:50,354 --> 00:11:04,765
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first phase of the project was culminated in October 2007 with an environmental report done and given to FAA with recommendations.

131
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:09,248
[SPEAKER_11]: The second phase was called the Boston Logan Airport Noise Study.

132
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,951
[SPEAKER_11]: It began in 2007 and was completed in December 2012 with final results documented.

133
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:20,459
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what Councilor Lungo-Kern just mentioned, that she'd like to get a copy.

134
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went on the website.

135
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find it.

136
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:26,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find it anywhere, the final recommendations.

137
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:40,877
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd also like to make as part of the report, Mr. President, that we can find out what input our community representative had or what offerings our community representative had, if any, towards this particular report.

138
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:54,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And the third phase, which began in July 2013, will identify and evaluate potential runway use measures to be included in a runway use program to replace the preferential runway advisory system.

139
00:11:56,192 --> 00:12:05,338
[SPEAKER_11]: The vote CAC took was in 2012, and this was to abate runway noise.

140
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:11,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think if we can get some feedback from the advisory committee member,

141
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,711
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be very helpful.

142
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:23,559
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also, I believe a couple years back, asked representatives from Massport to appear before the council, maybe because we're not in the immediate vicinity, like Revere and Winthrop.

143
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,881
[SPEAKER_11]: They pay no attention to us.

144
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:31,445
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is an issue that this council has been behind from day one.

145
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:38,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to see the administration take a more active role in this issue, because it does impact.

146
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I know in Wellington, when I'm standing in my driveway,

147
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,192
[SPEAKER_11]: and I can read the numbers on the bottom of the belly of the airplane, you know they're low.

148
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:47,213
[SPEAKER_11]: You have good eyes.

149
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: No, these planes are low.

150
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:50,296
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not my eyes.

151
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:51,116
[SPEAKER_11]: They're low.

152
00:12:51,737 --> 00:13:02,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when your home shakes, when they go over, you tend to say to yourself, what are the requirements that would put us in an issue where maybe we could get some mitigation?

153
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:03,685
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you need?

154
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,968
[SPEAKER_11]: When my home shakes, is that enough?

155
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,430
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm not sure.

156
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:19,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I was told that they have noise detectors throughout our community and that we don't reach the FAA requirements to have mitigation.

157
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:22,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe those standards could be lowered.

158
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:29,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's about time we look at other areas that are being impacted and see where these particular devices are located.

159
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:32,765
[SPEAKER_11]: But in my opinion, Mr. President, something needs to be done.

160
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:39,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Massport did a mitigation project several years ago, maybe within the past four years,

161
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,381
[SPEAKER_07]: of window replacement in Chelsea and East Boston.

162
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:42,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

163
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:58,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we may not be at that level, but we were close to a level where, um, I was told also that they were looking at other routes to go over the mystic and, and, and take the planes in a different area rather than over our neighborhoods.

164
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:06,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I, I believe that that was taking place, but, uh, I haven't seen much in regards to that because

165
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:11,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I still on Sunday mornings, you can, you can almost set your watch by it.

166
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:15,676
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when they're coming overhead at six 30 in the morning, you know, it's going to last three hours.

167
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:19,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Then certain nights you'll hear him, uh, you know, at six, seven o'clock at night.

168
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, it's like I said, it's throughout the community.

169
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:28,125
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I want to thank, uh, council a lungo for bringing this up and the residents.

170
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a resident that wants to speak.

171
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:36,310
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of residents that have been sending emails to this council and to this administration, uh, to help, uh,

172
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:40,195
[SPEAKER_11]: resolve this important quality of life issue, Mr. President.

173
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:41,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

174
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:51,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilors Lungo and Marks as amended by both Councilors Lungo and Marks, Madam Vice President.

175
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:51,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

176
00:14:52,181 --> 00:15:00,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Briefly, if we could, if we could actually ask the Medford's rep to come again, I know maybe send her an email or a letter in the mail.

177
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:08,204
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's probably, getting somebody from the board, we're going to learn a lot more that way than trying to do our research and ask the administration.

178
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:11,686
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we could ask again, that would be helpful.

179
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:24,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know back in 2013, Logan Airport adopted a straight line way of approaching the airport, which they used to do a roundabout way, which is one of the reasons why planes are flying lower.

180
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,612
[SPEAKER_12]: The Federal Aviation Administration, which uses radar approach points,

181
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:37,869
[SPEAKER_12]: allow planes to fly within the last two years shorter distances, which reduce fuel usage and carbon emissions.

182
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,009
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a reason why.

183
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Planes are definitely flying low.

184
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,511
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a reason why we're getting these complaints.

185
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:51,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And therefore, there's a reason for the study and the money being spent to make sure the decibels are within normal ranges.

186
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:59,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if you're researching online, too, a lot of things that I found today and yesterday that were popping up were health risks.

187
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:04,445
[SPEAKER_12]: detrimental effects that this noise level can have on a human being.

188
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:15,074
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to obviously get that report on that one-year study and definitely see if we can get any report on any other studies that are having to do with any of the noise levels.

189
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:16,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

190
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

191
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:18,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

192
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:20,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

193
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:24,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President, Councilor Mox, thank you very much for your remarks on this topic as well.

194
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:36,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all well and good that we can bring a member of the CAC in here to discuss the flight patents, but Massport also has an Office of Community Relations, and they also have an Office of Government Affairs.

195
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:48,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to amend the resolution to ask that Jose Maceo, who would be the Community Relations Director, and Nancy Donahue, the Assistant Director of Government Affairs, also be invited to our meeting to discuss the flight patents, Mr. President.

196
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be very productive to have all parties involved.

197
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,430
[SPEAKER_07]: The President.

198
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:51,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

199
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:59,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Lombo-Kern and Councilor Marks, as amended by both, and Councilor Knight.

200
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:01,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir, you wish to speak on this matter.

201
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

202
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:03,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

203
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.

204
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,080
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

205
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,662
[SPEAKER_13]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

206
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,607
[SPEAKER_13]: As Councilor Lombo-Kern mentioned,

207
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:21,117
[SPEAKER_13]: With the installation of the virtual runway 33L, when there is a northwest heading wind in Logan, we can receive up to two flights every minute.

208
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:25,740
[SPEAKER_13]: The flights are heaviest often at night when there is a northwest wind into Boston.

209
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,983
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a number of different groups that are involved.

210
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:34,967
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the information that I'm reading right now, just to give people a heads up that are listening at home,

211
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:49,097
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go to bostonwestfairskies.com, there's a number of listing of information about the flight paths.

212
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:55,360
[SPEAKER_13]: As a father of a nine-month-old baby, I can tell you it can be pretty extreme living.

213
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And we live at the convergence.

214
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford is the convergence of five different paths.

215
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:04,524
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not that there are just so many more people flying into Boston.

216
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,244
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that the people that are flying to Boston are going on fewer and fewer paths, and they're all converging on to Medford.

217
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:11,745
[SPEAKER_13]: So, thank you.

218
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:13,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

219
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:14,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Camuso.

220
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:19,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, and I can certainly understand the frustrations.

221
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:29,820
[SPEAKER_17]: My home is right underneath one of the paths, and it seems like every weekend it's coming from the Winchester line right over the large Memorial Hospital into Logan.

222
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,081
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is...

223
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:35,116
[SPEAKER_17]: It's louder some days than others.

224
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:44,062
[SPEAKER_17]: When the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes.

225
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:49,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there.

226
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:58,490
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport.

227
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:01,252
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can.

228
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,436
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is a catch-22, this situation.

229
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:14,300
[SPEAKER_17]: For the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else.

230
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:19,683
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say.

231
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:22,864
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago.

232
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:24,905
[SPEAKER_17]: He was on the front page of the Boston Herald.

233
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,706
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor?

234
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,327
[SPEAKER_17]: With this very particular matter.

235
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:41,287
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations.

236
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:51,832
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes.

237
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:58,515
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston.

238
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:12,047
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I said, unfortunately, I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly.

239
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:16,768
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that

240
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,414
[SPEAKER_17]: It is seven miles from Boston, and this is one thing that we have to expect.

241
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:29,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe not with the volume, but Boston, it's an international airport.

242
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:34,419
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport where you get flights every so often.

243
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,160
[SPEAKER_17]: We're an international airport.

244
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,681
[SPEAKER_17]: You look at these planes, and they are low.

245
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:42,203
[SPEAKER_17]: You can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature.

246
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:45,245
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm more concerned about the safety.

247
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:55,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York.

248
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:59,892
[SPEAKER_17]: And it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature.

249
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:10,396
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was, in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature.

250
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:14,618
[SPEAKER_17]: So as I understand it, and the other thing is too,

251
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:25,572
[SPEAKER_17]: As the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up web pages said so eloquently, he alluded to the fact of the winds.

252
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:31,494
[SPEAKER_17]: The planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground.

253
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:40,137
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too.

254
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,978
[SPEAKER_17]: But I certainly do agree with the studies.

255
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,742
[SPEAKER_17]: that Council Marks brought up years ago, and Council Lungo Kern again this evening.

256
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:48,664
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do support this.

257
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:52,947
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the wheel.

258
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:58,931
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda.

259
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:10,099
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem Mass, I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston.

260
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,421
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was one of the setbacks.

261
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:15,303
[SPEAKER_17]: But I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.

262
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:16,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

263
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:17,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Karafiello.

264
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:18,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

265
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:25,711
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, now that the nice weather's out and everyone's out and the yards and the windows are open, you're hearing the noise a lot more than you did over the winter.

266
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:33,757
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't know how many people know, but over the next two to three years, there's going to be 11 more international airlines flying into Logan Airport.

267
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:36,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're flying in with those bigger planes.

268
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So the problem is only going to get worse.

269
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,122
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to get better.

270
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:43,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's time that we do get

271
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,415
[SPEAKER_10]: get the study out there and get somebody in there.

272
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: As I said, the problem is just going to continue to grow.

273
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:50,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

274
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:53,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

275
00:22:54,578 --> 00:23:01,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Ann Donati, 29 Gaston Street, D-O-N-A-T-I.

276
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:05,146
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

277
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:12,872
[SPEAKER_15]: So last summer, I thought all the airplane noise was in my head, that I was just imagining all the noise.

278
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,954
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I saw the front page of the transcript, residents hear the roar.

279
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I read that.

280
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:26,901
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I saw a few news segments on Channel 5 and some of the news stations about the airplane noise.

281
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So I said, it's not in my head.

282
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:31,364
[SPEAKER_15]: So I started to file complaints with Massport.

283
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,766
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they send you these little notices

284
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:44,512
[SPEAKER_15]: which basically are useless and say, yes, you are affected by the noise, which I don't think is very helpful, as opposed to saying, we'll try to do this, we'll try to do that.

285
00:23:44,732 --> 00:24:01,560
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, when it started up this, the beginning of May, that's when I started emailing the city council, filing more complaints with Massport, and I've been keeping a log of all the noise, and it started on April 30th,

286
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:03,582
[SPEAKER_15]: and it's 10 p.m.

287
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,202
[SPEAKER_15]: to midnight.

288
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:05,983
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 5.30 a.m.

289
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:09,226
[SPEAKER_15]: May 19th, it was 12.30 a.m.

290
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,448
[SPEAKER_15]: to 1.30 a.m.

291
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:16,451
[SPEAKER_15]: This noise has to stop, especially at these hours.

292
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:27,800
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, people have to get up to go to work, and I cannot have these jetliners literally right over my house,

293
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,006
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how close they are.

294
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:34,350
[SPEAKER_15]: They are right over my house at all these hours at night.

295
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,753
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, it's, I feel like the bomb's going to drop.

296
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:43,378
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a night picture, but it's, I'm beside myself.

297
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I have new windows in my house.

298
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:48,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to have my windows open.

299
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that, you know, um,

300
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:58,728
[SPEAKER_15]: When we had winter storms, you know, they used to come fly over the houses, you know, to avoid the ocean.

301
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:02,871
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand all that, but this on a regular basis has to stop.

302
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:06,014
[SPEAKER_15]: It's insane.

303
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:11,498
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know what else to do, but I'm glad that everybody is

304
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:16,645
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, paying attention to it, trying to nip it in the bud.

305
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:27,017
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think the resolution to give people new windows is going to help because, like you said, it's just going to get worse.

306
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:28,979
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to nip this in the bud.

307
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:38,426
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anybody wants to hear, I have recordings of these jetliners over our houses.

308
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:39,607
[SPEAKER_15]: One of my neighbors is here.

309
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,889
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just crazy.

310
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:45,810
[SPEAKER_15]: And like you said, you hear it too.

311
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,252
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can read the names of the planes.

312
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:50,913
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just crazy.

313
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,815
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm very upset.

314
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:56,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been a resident.

315
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:08,457
[SPEAKER_15]: in Medford since 1998, and again, I'm used to the plane noise, but last summer and this summer, it's, I can't live like this.

316
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:18,442
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I ever put my house on the market because of this noise, and a prospective buyer wanted to come in and look at it, and this noise is going over, they'd run like the wind.

317
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:19,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Who would want to move here?

318
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:27,247
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's, I'm very nervous, but thanks for listening.

319
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for coming.

320
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody wants to hear my recordings, but all right, I'll do one.

321
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:39,883
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

322
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:43,484
[SPEAKER_15]: May 7.

323
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,088
[SPEAKER_15]: That was at the beginning of May.

324
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,091
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a cheapie.

325
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:05,413
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a, that's yes.

326
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:07,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, let's see.

327
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:08,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a whole bunch of them.

328
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:12,017
[SPEAKER_15]: This one I think was during, what did it say?

329
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:12,937
[SPEAKER_15]: April 30th.

330
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:14,618
[SPEAKER_15]: This was 10 PM to midnight.

331
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a whole slew of them.

332
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,783
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, this is a cheapie, but I think, did you hear it a little bit?

333
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:28,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, all right, I'll do one more and then I'll let my neighbor speak.

334
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:30,966
[SPEAKER_15]: This one is the one at 1230.

335
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:32,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Tuesday, 1230 AM, May 19.

336
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:57,159
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is at 1230 AM.

337
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,941
[SPEAKER_14]: It's insane.

338
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:01,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

339
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:03,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how else to describe this.

340
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,866
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

341
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:12,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for coming.

342
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:19,410
[SPEAKER_15]: And you all have my email, so please feel free to contact me if you need me to support our cause.

343
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:20,831
Thank you.

344
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:21,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

345
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:22,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

346
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:24,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

347
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

348
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:27,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris.

349
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:28,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at 35 Gaston street.

350
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:30,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

351
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:45,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've, I've been, uh, I was born in this city and I've been a resident for 43 years and I bought my house based on the quiet of the neighborhood.

352
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could, I could literally throw a rock from my backyard to the house I grew up in.

353
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:59,330
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's where I wanted to raise my children and because it was a nice place to live.

354
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:10,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I just, it's, now I can't sleep at night, you know, and it's ridiculous, you know.

355
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:19,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why they can't, at nighttime at least, come out, come over the ocean.

356
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's living out there, you know.

357
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:32,192
[SPEAKER_02]: For real, I mean, I pay more and more taxes, and my quality of life is going down and down and down.

358
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:34,874
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

359
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:44,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't even sit out in the backyard and have a conversation with my brothers and sisters with one of these things coming over.

360
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:46,641
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

361
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:48,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous.

362
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:53,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know what you guys can do.

363
00:29:54,551 --> 00:30:12,258
[SPEAKER_02]: if anything, but any help you can give us would be very much appreciated, very, very much appreciated, because this is really, really getting tough.

364
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you all.

365
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming down tonight.

366
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Vice President Longo Kern and Councilor Marks,

367
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,870
[SPEAKER_07]: as amended by the same and Councilor Knight.

368
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,051
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

369
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:28,993
[SPEAKER_07]: A roll call vote has been requested.

370
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:31,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, could you please call the roll?

371
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:40,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso?

372
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:41,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

373
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:42,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello?

374
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,166
Yes.

375
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:44,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

376
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:44,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

377
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:45,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Lungo-Kern?

378
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:45,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

379
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:47,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

380
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

381
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta?

382
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:48,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

383
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:49,775
[SPEAKER_07]: President DelaRusso.

384
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:50,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

385
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And the vote is seven in the affirmative, none negative.

386
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:54,378
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion is passed and so ordered.

387
00:30:57,841 --> 00:30:58,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

388
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:02,085
[SPEAKER_08]: While we're still on the suspension of the rules, can we take 15.495 please?

389
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:07,249
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Penta to take paper out of order, 15.495.

390
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:08,090
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

391
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,311
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

392
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Carries.

393
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: 15.495 offered by Councilor Penta.

394
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the problem of a Medford businesswoman

395
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: be addressed, Councilor Pinto.

396
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:23,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, members of the Council, there is a lady out in the audience.

397
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe she's going to address the Council.

398
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:46,640
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another ongoing saga of what Republic, the parking company, has been doing in the city, the consternation it's been causing to business merchants within the community, and the fact that, if you can come up, the fact that this business is, and she'll be able to tell you herself, it's becoming less and less, it's almost to the point it's going to put her out of business.

399
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:48,437
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll let her speak for herself.

400
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:50,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

401
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:52,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

402
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,081
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you all know why I'm here.

403
00:31:55,161 --> 00:32:03,166
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just 337 people that do not want the kiosk in the square, or any part of Medford, for that fact.

404
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:07,048
[SPEAKER_16]: I see people out there every day.

405
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,349
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't even know what to do.

406
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,093
[SPEAKER_16]: The sunshine, and they can't see what to do there.

407
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:15,734
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're standing out there.

408
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,435
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very frustrating.

409
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:22,836
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, I'm working three days a week now.

410
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,116
[SPEAKER_16]: It's down to that.

411
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:29,717
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't feel like I'm going to be staying in business much longer.

412
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:31,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not the only one.

413
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:37,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody I spoke to in Medford Square, they're all unhappy, very unhappy.

414
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:42,140
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think there should have been another way.

415
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Why didn't they put cops on the beach?

416
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:51,274
[SPEAKER_16]: And for the ones that are there all day and park their cars to go into Boston, those are the ones they should have went after.

417
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:54,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I hear this, oh, there's plenty of parking.

418
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:55,355
[SPEAKER_16]: You know why?

419
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,196
[SPEAKER_16]: They're boycotting.

420
00:32:57,356 --> 00:32:58,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody's boycotting.

421
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,176
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't want to pay.

422
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,297
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the principle of it.

423
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:02,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't blame them.

424
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:05,878
[SPEAKER_16]: What have you got in Medford Square?

425
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Salons and restaurants.

426
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:10,599
[SPEAKER_16]: What else are they going to come for?

427
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:16,518
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm afraid Medford Square is just going to die right out.

428
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:24,245
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say, but this is just 337 people and it's still going in my shot.

429
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:25,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

430
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,507
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to add that to the record.

431
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:38,977
[SPEAKER_07]: If you would give that to the city messenger and he'll present to the clerk to be affixed to the permanent record of the city of Medford.

432
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Councilor Panto want to address?

433
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:45,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Pinto's going to have the floor.

434
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, could you come to that?

435
00:33:52,104 --> 00:33:53,946
[SPEAKER_08]: How long have you been doing business in Medford Square?

436
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:54,326
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 years.

437
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,086
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 years.

438
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:58,028
[SPEAKER_16]: And I still want to continue working, because I love it.

439
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank you for coming forward and presenting the signatures of individuals.

440
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:10,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the complaints that you just talked about is something that Councilor Caviello mentioned way back when, that nobody can read the screen.

441
00:34:10,437 --> 00:34:11,658
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the blur of the sun.

442
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:13,013
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever it might be.

443
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:21,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this past week, over and beyond your situation, two more people, one in particular, and I have pictures right here.

444
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:27,765
[SPEAKER_08]: They still have kiosks in High Street in front of residential homes that were supposed to have been taken out months ago.

445
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,647
[SPEAKER_08]: The snow has been gone for a long period of time.

446
00:34:30,947 --> 00:34:37,312
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still there, and people crazily are trying to put money into a machine in front of a two-filming house that they shouldn't have to.

447
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:39,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the same time,

448
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:48,664
[SPEAKER_08]: co-worker, a co-business friend of yours in the West Method area, a girl had to get off the chair with her rollers in her hair to go and put money in the meter.

449
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:51,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And she couldn't even put the money in the same meter.

450
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:52,326
[SPEAKER_08]: She had to find another spot.

451
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:53,887
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how crazy this whole system is.

452
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:57,468
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think it's Mr. Ruggieri, he's still out there.

453
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:02,351
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been very helpful on this, on dissecting and getting into the contract, as well as myself.

454
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:06,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that there's approximately nine infractions that they have committed.

455
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, the city has enacted upon it.

456
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:09,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Why, I don't know.

457
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:12,310
[SPEAKER_08]: But all I can tell you is this.

458
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:17,014
[SPEAKER_08]: As a candidate for mayor, that's going to be the first thing I am going to address.

459
00:35:17,354 --> 00:35:22,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Those kiosks and the damage that it's doing here to the merchants and the entire city of Medford.

460
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank you for bringing that forward.

461
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:25,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll be much appreciated.

462
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:26,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

463
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:30,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Knight.

464
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:32,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

465
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:42,455
[SPEAKER_04]: woman's gone through extensive lengths to get these signatures and to take them and place them on file with the city clerk might not be the best approach.

466
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:50,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe we should send these signatures over to the traffic commission to let the traffic commission know how much opposition there is out there in the community with the governing board.

467
00:35:51,422 --> 00:36:00,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, can we take that as a resolution that this petition be forwarded

468
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:03,676
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Medford Traffic Commission.

469
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So, on the motion of Council and I, all those in favor?

470
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,219
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the original motion?

471
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:15,920
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no motion.

472
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just discussed.

473
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:23,982
[SPEAKER_04]: The signatures, right, yes.

474
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,823
[SPEAKER_07]: On that, all those in favor?

475
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call has been requested by Councilor Penta.

476
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:46,457

[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Long-Kern?

483
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:51,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

484
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Mox?

485
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

486
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,361

00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:54,721
Yes.

00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:56,562

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

490
00:36:57,575 --> 00:36:59,816
[SPEAKER_07]: A vote of seven, the affirmative, none negative.

491
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:01,756
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion carries.

00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:07,358
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion of Councilor Camuso to resort back to the regular order of business.

493
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:08,198
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

494
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,819
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_07]: 15-488, location of poles, attachments of fixtures in underground conduits.

532
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:10,367

533
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Utilize is subjective.

534

560

[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, Councilor Marks brought this forward.

561
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:21,397
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a lengthy discussion over fixing the bathrooms, and if I'm not mistaken, $10,000 was allocated to fix the bathrooms, and all we ever got was a couple of faucets changed over there.

562
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:36,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Over the weekend, I was home doing some yard work and I was home doing some yard work and outside and a neighbor came by and says, I went to the library last week with my grandson.

563
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:40,295
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, the library was so bad, the bathroom was so bad, he says, I wouldn't let him go to the bathroom in there.

564
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:45,897
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, what happened to the money that you guys allocated for the repairing of it?

565
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:49,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this point, Mr. President, I'd like to have the mayor's office provide

566
00:44:50,766 --> 00:44:57,428
[SPEAKER_10]: an explanation of where the $10,000 that we authorized for the bathrooms have gone.

567
00:44:58,288 --> 00:44:59,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And this guy was a plumber.

568
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:02,190
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, if you want, he says, I'll do the work in there.

569
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:03,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Some licensed plumber.

570
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:04,910
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, just buy the stock.

571
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:08,912
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, I'm sure we can get other volunteers to do the work.

572
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:14,974
[SPEAKER_10]: But at this point, the library is going down and down every year.

573
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:19,415
[SPEAKER_10]: There's less funds being allocated to it.

574
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:30,876
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, at least we could have some clean, decent bathroom facilities for the children to use there, because with the new children's librarian, you're seeing an upturn in kids going there.

575
00:45:31,497 --> 00:45:35,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they've gone in the bathrooms there, they have their councilmarches ready when they're deplorable.

576
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:37,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

577
00:45:38,379 --> 00:45:39,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

578
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Caviello, Councilor Knight.

579
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

580
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:48,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe this council has on multiple occasions requested

581
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:56,358
[SPEAKER_05]: the capital needs of all the buildings that are underneath the control and jurisdiction of the city government, but also specifically the library.

582
00:45:56,779 --> 00:46:02,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that this information will be very helpful, Mr. President, as we begin our preparations for the budget debates.

583
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:13,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Presently, if you take a look at the Medford transcript, you'll see a great article by Mr. Ruppenthal that speaks about the funding shortages at the library.

584
00:46:14,323 --> 00:46:19,544
[SPEAKER_05]: and the risk that the city has been in, in losing its certification from the state.

585
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:36,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks right now that, you know, based upon the figures that I read, we're about a quarter of a million dollars short in fully funding the library to make ourselves in a position where we would not require a state waiver and enable the ability to maintain certification, Mr. President.

586
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:43,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of stuff that's going on at the library right now that really needs to be looked at, or else we're going to be in a position where we might actually lose this asset

587
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:45,632
[SPEAKER_05]: The building is in rough shape.

588
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:54,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I know over the winter there was a significant amount of snow buildup that resulted in some leaks and some ice dams that have damaged some books in the children's section.

589
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,241
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the issue with the bathroom as well.

590
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:04,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the discussions that we've had in the past about expanding and making a media center on the second floor of the library and building up the library.

591
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think now is an important time to take a look at what's going on there in terms of the capital side of things, Mr. President, and as we begin our debates for the budget, determine whether or not

592
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:15,867
[SPEAKER_05]: the library is being funded at a level that's appropriate.

593
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:17,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

594
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Pinto.

595
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:28,193
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the issues that are equally of a concerning matter is the fact that the locality of the Method Public Library is the only public library in the city.

596
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:31,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Many, many years ago, you had community-based area libraries.

597
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:35,376
[SPEAKER_08]: The high school library is closed on the weekends and nighttime.

598
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:38,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only library that you really have left is the Method Public Library.

599
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:45,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And for years, they had cut back hours on their employees, which cut back the hours of operations, if I think a few folks remember.

600
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:50,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the days and the hours at night and on the weekends were cut back.

601
00:47:51,058 --> 00:48:00,244
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things I forgot to mention when the last lady was up here speaking, I did get a complaint from a lady who went to the Method Public Library to return a book, to run in and to run out.

602
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:03,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And she got a $25 ticket to bring her book.

603
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:07,329
[SPEAKER_08]: And this takes us right back to what you had addressed a long time ago, Counselor Marks.

604
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:08,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, where is this?

605
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:15,471
[SPEAKER_08]: 30-minute, supposedly, free time you have when you pull up and getting ready to use these meters and what have you.

606
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:17,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's taking the Traffic Commission so long.

607
00:48:17,952 --> 00:48:23,254
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, it was just as bad as putting it in front of the church when they first started this thing and they had to take them out.

608
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:28,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you put something in front of a public library, an educational building, a community building?

609
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't make any sense.

610
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,658
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the topic itself, it just makes-.

611
00:48:32,678 --> 00:48:34,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Mr. President.

612
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:36,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

613
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:38,080
[SPEAKER_17]: The library has a parking lot.

614
00:48:39,331 --> 00:48:47,655
[SPEAKER_17]: directly adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly, there's always available spots in there.

615
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:49,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a point of information.

616
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:51,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Counselor.

617
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:58,659
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact of the matter is this lady just pulled up in the front of the house to go in and just drop off a book, and she didn't need to get a $25 certificate, I mean, ticket.

618
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:02,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we all remember a few months ago, when there was a funeral going on at St.

619
00:49:02,721 --> 00:49:06,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph's Church, quite a few people got tickets there, and they had to be retaken back.

620
00:49:06,787 --> 00:49:12,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, it's just part of the whole program that really needs to be revisited, if not completely dumped.

621
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:16,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, Madam Vice President.

622
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:18,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

623
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:29,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to go on the record in support of Councilor Carviello's resolve, along with your amendment, to get a list, a breakdown of what was spent on the bathrooms last year.

624
00:49:29,817 --> 00:49:36,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's something we don't know, and I think that's something we all would challenge, that $10,000 was actually put into the bathrooms.

625
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:43,523
[SPEAKER_12]: It's upsetting because it's a public building where your children are going to, you know, read and take out books from the library.

626
00:49:44,003 --> 00:49:47,146
[SPEAKER_12]: They should at least be able to have a place to go to the bathroom.

627
00:49:47,766 --> 00:50:01,257
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it correlates with a resolution you had on the agenda last week or the week before, councillor Penta, with regards to jobs just being $90,000 jobs being created and people getting raises of $20,000.

628
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:02,457
[SPEAKER_12]: We heard recently of a 5% raise

629
00:50:07,443 --> 00:50:18,550
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, took place, and it just makes you stop and think, like, maybe we should take care and maintain the buildings we have before we go hire additional personnel to work in them.

630
00:50:20,491 --> 00:50:36,202
[SPEAKER_12]: We, in the council, fight year after year, project after project, for maintenance accounts, maintenance fees, and we, Councilor Marks, you know, fought hard, you know, with our help, obviously, to get $10,000 for the bathrooms to be replaced, and we spoke about it last year,

631
00:50:37,028 --> 00:50:38,428
[SPEAKER_12]: There are people that would volunteer.

632
00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:40,189
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, it is upsetting.

633
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:46,471
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to handle how the city is operated and how the city spends money.

634
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:52,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Because something like that, whether or not to do the library over, obviously, is a huge decision.

635
00:50:52,472 --> 00:50:55,413
[SPEAKER_12]: And the police department has to come into account.

636
00:50:55,573 --> 00:51:04,916
[SPEAKER_12]: But to get facilities and to be able to fight for $10,000, and then nothing changed, nothing happened, it's almost like, what are we doing week after week?

637
00:51:05,206 --> 00:51:06,507
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, voice in our opinions.

638
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:13,051
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about the library bathroom six times, seven times, and that's just completely unfortunate.

639
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:18,654
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, you know, that's one of the many things, obviously, that upset me with regards to how money's spent.

640
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:23,257
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would, I agree, we need, I would love to see an accounting and where the money went.

641
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:26,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

642
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:27,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

643
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

644
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:34,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Caviello for offering this resolve tonight and my colleagues for their comments.

645
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:43,265
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the article I read in the paper, you know, mentioned the library director, Brian Boutelier.

646
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:59,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And I remember the last several budgets when we sat in, like we do with all the department heads, and when we asked the question of the director of the library, what are your needs for the library, he said, at this time, I don't have any.

647
00:52:01,234 --> 00:52:03,655
[SPEAKER_11]: pointed to the question about the restrooms.

648
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:08,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And I likened them to prison bathrooms.

649
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:13,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said he doesn't see anything wrong with the bathrooms at the public library.

650
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:28,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's part of the problem we're seeing is the attitude, to be quite honest with you, from the director himself on the condition of the building and the inability to stand up on behalf of the library, which is his job.

651
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,603
[SPEAKER_11]: fight for what's needed within that library.

652
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,125
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told last week they're down a children's position.

653
00:52:37,165 --> 00:52:39,427
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told they're down a reference librarian.

654
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:44,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Knight just mentioned about the fact that we may lose certification.

655
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:47,752
[SPEAKER_11]: We're about a quarter of a million dollars away from certification.

656
00:52:48,392 --> 00:52:54,996
[SPEAKER_11]: The last, the Mass Board of Library Commissioners, Mr. President, without their certification,

657
00:52:55,426 --> 00:53:01,648
[SPEAKER_11]: We could lose network subscriptions, database, and interlibrary loans.

658
00:53:02,088 --> 00:53:10,470
[SPEAKER_11]: We could lose the ability for Method residents to use their Minuteman card and go to any other library in the Minuteman network.

659
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:14,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear a lot of people say, well, I go to Lexington or I go to Arlington.

660
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that we may be on an island

661
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:24,494
[SPEAKER_11]: because we refuse to put in the necessary funds to fund our library.

662
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:30,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say you go to that library at any given time, Mr. President, you'll see people in all the different sections.

663
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,301
[SPEAKER_11]: The library is highly utilized.

664
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:39,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And even based on the current offerings it has, it's still an attraction in this community.

665
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:43,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, things are changing and things are going more electronic and so forth.

666
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:44,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that.

667
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:57,226
[SPEAKER_11]: There's ways, like the town of Watertown, who just built a library a few years ago, state of the art library, is attracting people back to the library, different offerings back in the library.

668
00:53:57,506 --> 00:54:04,889
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a community room in the library, in my opinion, that's underutilized and could be a much larger asset.

669
00:54:05,189 --> 00:54:09,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caviello mentioned on many occasions about adding a second floor onto the library.

670
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:14,327
[SPEAKER_11]: and creating some type of community room or function room up there.

671
00:54:15,347 --> 00:54:20,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, there's a host of things we can do with this library.

672
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:26,595
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing we can no longer do is to underfund the library, keep on getting a waiver from the state.

673
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:32,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, from what I was told by a state representative, that waiver is supposed to be a one-time thing.

674
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:36,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Method, you couldn't reach the funding this year for whatever circumstance.

675
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:37,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a waiver.

676
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,461
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep you in the network.

677
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:41,962
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep the funding coming.

678
00:54:42,222 --> 00:54:43,102
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's your waiver."

679
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:48,445
[SPEAKER_11]: But to get a waiver year after year after year is an injustice, Mr. President.

680
00:54:48,745 --> 00:55:04,374
[SPEAKER_11]: And the state legislature should have never allowed that within their legislation, to allow a community to use that as a crutch to say, you know what, we're no longer going to fund our library and we don't care because we got a waiver from the state saying we can do so.

681
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:06,995
[SPEAKER_11]: That wasn't the intent of the legislature.

682
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,126
[SPEAKER_11]: the legislation that was filed by the legislature.

683
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:21,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And Method, from what I read in the article, was one of just a few communities that has received a waiver, or multiple waivers, in the last several years.

684
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:29,116
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we're falling short of the mark here, and it's quite disturbing, because I wish I could tell residents, you know what?

685
00:55:30,016 --> 00:55:33,678
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not putting the money into the library, but we're putting it into our police station.

686
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:35,875
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not the case, Mr. President.

687
00:55:36,315 --> 00:55:37,937
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not putting the money into the library.

688
00:55:37,957 --> 00:55:39,139
[SPEAKER_11]: We're putting it into City Hall.

689
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:41,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Go into any one of these restrooms up here.

690
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:42,723
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in deplorable condition.

691
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:46,727
[SPEAKER_11]: There's yellow crime tape around the urinals that you can't use.

692
00:55:47,168 --> 00:55:48,970
[SPEAKER_11]: The sinks don't work, Mr. President.

693
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a disgrace.

694
00:55:50,827 --> 00:55:58,011
[SPEAKER_11]: The hand sanitizers, the minute they put the hand sanitizer dispensers around the building, within three weeks, they were gone.

695
00:55:58,071 --> 00:56:01,433
[SPEAKER_11]: There was nothing left in them, and they haven't been replaced, Mr. President.

696
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:04,535
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, it's amazing.

697
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:10,579
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I wish I could tell people we're taking our money and utilizing it somewhere else, but that's not the case.

698
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:14,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And the taxes, as people mentioned, keep on going up.

699
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:18,824
[SPEAKER_11]: The buildings, the infrastructure is crumbling, and we really have very little to show.

700
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:30,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Councilor Caviello that, you know, I think we did receive an itemized listing a while back.

701
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:36,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what originally happened was this whole council voted unanimously for $10,000 in the budget.

702
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:38,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And the administration was kind enough to put it in there.

703
00:56:39,405 --> 00:56:42,586
[SPEAKER_11]: The air conditioning went within the public library.

704
00:56:43,446 --> 00:56:45,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And they used the $10,000 towards the air conditioning.

705
00:56:46,911 --> 00:56:51,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm not going to dispute that if they thought that was more of a priority than fixing the restrooms.

706
00:56:52,193 --> 00:56:55,614
[SPEAKER_11]: They did find more funding in the budget to do the restrooms.

707
00:56:56,415 --> 00:57:06,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Mr. President, I'm not going to want to speak out, but let me tell you, Mr. President, I don't know if anyone watched the movie, The Jerk, with Steve Mott.

708
00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:09,660
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a movie from years ago.

709
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,902
[SPEAKER_11]: He ran into millions of dollars, the jerk, and he lived in a little shack.

710
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:17,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that millions of dollars, you know what he did?

711
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,331
[SPEAKER_11]: He built a bigger shack.

712
00:57:20,892 --> 00:57:23,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we did in the library bathrooms.

713
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:38,426
[SPEAKER_11]: We went from a deplorable bathroom with deplorable tiles and fixtures and everything else to now a deplorable bathroom with a new sink, the same old tiles, dirty tiles, the same old crummy doors.

714
00:57:39,486 --> 00:57:42,449
[SPEAKER_11]: The same old prison style, Mr. President.

715
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,071
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's going to be the showcase.

716
00:57:44,271 --> 00:57:49,697
[SPEAKER_11]: When people from other communities come to our library, they walk in the restroom, they must be saying, where am I?

717
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:52,280
[SPEAKER_11]: My at Cedar Junction?

718
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Where am I?

719
00:57:54,482 --> 00:57:56,184
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, Mr. President?

720
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:01,430
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I just don't know what's happening, Mr. President.

721
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:10,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, in this year's budget, I hope we all sit down when we have our deliberations and when the director comes before us and say, you know what, I'm fine.

722
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything's running fine in here.

723
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I have half the staff, but you know, we make ends meet.

724
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:18,244
[SPEAKER_11]: My budget for maintenance has gone down, but we make ends meet.

725
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:23,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should all in one voice say, Mr. Boutelier, you're not making ends meet.

726
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:25,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Your library is falling apart.

727
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Open your eyes, Mr. Boutelier.

728
00:58:28,389 --> 00:58:29,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Open your eyes.

729
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:39,752
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could, just from the chair, in defense of someone who's not here to speak for himself, my experience with the librarian is that he's very much concerned.

730
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:48,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's at a crossroads now that we have the opportunity to elect new leadership, and we'll do that, and I think we'll see some adjustments.

731
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:53,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, just if I could, a department head is not here just to collect a $110,000 salary.

732
00:58:55,322 --> 00:59:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: A department head is there to do the people's business and to make sure whatever they're in charge of is kept up, Mr. President, and that they're the biggest advocate, the biggest advocate, and not playing second fiddle, saying, well, politically, I don't want to say anything because I don't want to jeopardize my job.

733
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:16,899
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not what a department head should be, Mr. President.

734
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think I'm throwing anyone under the bus, Mr. President, because I feel strongly

735
00:59:22,086 --> 00:59:30,371
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting with this particular department head over the last several years and hearing his answers year after year after year to our questions that everything is fine.

736
00:59:30,912 --> 00:59:37,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, I, I, I don't feel like I'm speaking out of turn here and I look forward to this budget session, Mr. President.

737
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe we'll get a different outcome from the department head.

738
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:41,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

739
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:42,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilmates.

740
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:43,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Carfiello.

741
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:43,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

742
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:46,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you know, if you go on the state website,

743
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:54,456
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a grant system there for rebuilding of the libraries and renovating the libraries for the last two to three years.

744
00:59:54,516 --> 00:59:57,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And I called up and asked, and we've never applied for the funds.

745
00:59:58,479 --> 01:00:02,763
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was funds out there available, but if you don't ask, you can never get them.

746
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:09,789
[SPEAKER_10]: We finally hired a top flight children's librarian.

747
01:00:10,598 --> 01:00:17,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And the kids are starting to go back there, and we have nothing to offer them when they go back there.

748
01:00:17,623 --> 01:00:19,285
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to update that.

749
01:00:19,305 --> 01:00:24,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, again, even some minor improvements would be helpful.

750
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:31,754
[SPEAKER_10]: On the last two budgets, I asked the librarian, I said, where do you see the library in five years?

751
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:34,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And didn't get an answer on either time.

752
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:37,628
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's no five-year plan.

753
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:40,269
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we're not getting any money, because we don't have a plan.

754
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:43,770
[SPEAKER_10]: People aren't going to just throw money at you anymore.

755
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:44,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Those days are over.

756
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:46,190
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to get out there.

757
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,190
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to do some work.

758
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,271
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to be creative.

759
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,131
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to go out there and find your money.

760
01:00:50,431 --> 01:00:51,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's been money out there available.

761
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:57,052
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of dried up now, but you let it sit there for three or four years, and you never went after it.

762
01:00:58,173 --> 01:00:59,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I agree with Councilor Marks.

763
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:04,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this year when the budget time comes, and he says everything is hunky-dory.

764
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:09,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all better sit there and question him a lot harder than we did last time.

765
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:10,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

766
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:13,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Caravaglio, as amended.

767
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

768
01:01:17,058 --> 01:01:20,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street, Medford.

769
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair for Councilor Caravaglio, February 11th, 2014, we issued a check for $9,694 for fixtures.

770
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And who do we buy these from, Liberace?

771
01:01:32,011 --> 01:01:32,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really?

772
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,120
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have?

773
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:35,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a disgrace.

774
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:36,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.

775
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.

776
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it.

777
01:01:38,082 --> 01:01:39,282
[SPEAKER_03]: The library is a disgrace.

778
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:43,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a suggestion, though, because not all is lost.

779
01:01:45,764 --> 01:01:53,147
[SPEAKER_03]: In the budget, when you go and look at the budget this year, we have two assistant superintendents making $112,000 each.

780
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:58,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see you just justify one assistant superintendent, let alone two.

781
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:01,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take that money and reallocate it somewhere.

782
01:02:02,878 --> 01:02:09,523
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get some people in there that know what to do with the numbers, because this city needs to get back up on top.

783
01:02:09,903 --> 01:02:12,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Tired of watching it go one rung below, another rung, another rung.

784
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So do the best you can on that, please.

785
01:02:14,686 --> 01:02:15,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

786
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:15,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

787
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:17,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

788
01:02:17,948 --> 01:02:21,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Caviello, as amended, all those in favor?

789
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:22,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

790
01:02:23,312 --> 01:02:24,052
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

791
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

792
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:26,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

793
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:32,118
[SPEAKER_07]: When I made my public service announcement earlier in the meeting, I may have misspoken.

794
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,221
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Friday, May 29th at 9 a.m.

795
01:02:35,261 --> 01:02:40,242
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Immaculate Conception Church, the Medford Police Memorial Mass will be offered.

796
01:02:40,942 --> 01:02:41,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

797
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:45,923
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-494 offered by Councilor Penta.

798
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:55,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the lack of important information not provided to this council regarding the Craddock Bridge be discussed.

799
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:56,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

800
01:02:56,686 --> 01:03:01,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, but more importantly, anybody who might be watching in Medford Square business folks,

801
01:03:02,352 --> 01:03:06,113
[SPEAKER_08]: The situation regarding the Karatek Bridge is just an ongoing tale.

802
01:03:06,493 --> 01:03:13,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's time to maybe have a little bit of a history lesson here as it relates to how did we get to the position we're in right now.

803
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:24,498
[SPEAKER_08]: We can go back to 2002, 02-2002-526, offered by Council Longo, be it resolved that the Karatek Bridge be discussed in regards to public safety.

804
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:27,899
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a whole host of amendments as it related to that.

805
01:03:27,939 --> 01:03:28,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that was in 2002, 13 years ago.

806
01:03:32,026 --> 01:03:34,187
[SPEAKER_08]: The first response from the state came back in 2006.

807
01:03:34,247 --> 01:03:43,831
[SPEAKER_08]: They first sent a note back that basically says that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will be taking a look and to review it.

808
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:46,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we go to 2011.

809
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:52,974
[SPEAKER_08]: From 2006 to 2011, there was absolutely nothing that took place that revolved around that particular bridge.

810
01:03:53,775 --> 01:03:57,796
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point in time in 2011, they said the cost of the bridge was going to be $2.5 million.

811
01:03:57,816 --> 01:03:58,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Then in August of 2012,

812
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:03,812
[SPEAKER_08]: it jumped to $8.5 million.

813
01:04:04,092 --> 01:04:10,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in April of 2013, it jumped up to $12.7 million.

814
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that meeting on April 13th, on April, excuse me, of 2013, I had asked the question as it relates to mitigation for our downtown Medford business folks.

815
01:04:21,476 --> 01:04:23,196
[SPEAKER_08]: The council voted seven to nothing on that.

816
01:04:23,456 --> 01:04:27,617
[SPEAKER_08]: As a matter of fact, we got a letter of support from the Medford Chamber of Commerce on that particular issue.

817
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:33,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Sent the letter to the mayor and to the state, and to this date, still, absolutely nothing has come back.

818
01:04:34,295 --> 01:04:37,056
[SPEAKER_08]: From April, we sent it again in May of 2013.

819
01:04:38,257 --> 01:04:44,159
[SPEAKER_08]: June of 2013, the cost then went down to $10.7 million.

820
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, again, on February of 2014, the question of mitigation came up.

821
01:04:50,222 --> 01:04:52,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It was presented, and we still have no answer to that.

822
01:04:53,543 --> 01:04:55,684
[SPEAKER_08]: All we know right now that we're getting a bridge

823
01:04:56,353 --> 01:05:00,996
[SPEAKER_08]: that's supposedly going to be starting at this point in time, sometime this summer.

824
01:05:02,257 --> 01:05:09,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And what doesn't make sense now, they're saying that on November 4th of 2018, the bridge will be completed.

825
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:17,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But during the summer of 2018, the bridge will be open for use.

826
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:24,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So how can you have something not completed and open for use or be completed in November of 2018?

827
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:35,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And that cost now is projected at $10.78 million for this particular bridge.

828
01:05:36,587 --> 01:05:48,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen all kinds of correspondence from representatives in our city who are saying this is a wonderful thing, dating back to 2006, to 2012, to 2013.

829
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:55,882
[SPEAKER_08]: We've received press releases from the mayor, from the senator in this community, that this bridge is such a wonderful thing.

830
01:05:56,142 --> 01:06:02,626
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they built the tunnel from France to England, which was, I believe, 21 miles in less than nine years.

831
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:12,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a bridge here starting in 2015 to be included by 2018, that's three years, to go 121 feet.

832
01:06:14,994 --> 01:06:20,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it, 121 feet when you built the tunnel, which was 21 miles, and it was underwater.

833
01:06:21,738 --> 01:06:25,320
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole thing, as far as I'm concerned, is the biggest slap in the face

834
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:26,917
[SPEAKER_08]: to the Medford business community.

835
01:06:27,478 --> 01:06:31,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sad part about it, one of the gentlemen who's in charge of this project lives in the city of Medford.

836
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:41,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Councilor DelaRusso, I'm calling you on the carpet tonight because you indicated that you'd never received the letter dated February 24th, of which your name is on here.

837
01:06:41,889 --> 01:06:49,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Every single one of our reps, our senators, our state, Paul Geer, Cassandra upstairs in the engineer's office.

838
01:06:50,557 --> 01:06:54,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And I accepted you for your comment saying that you couldn't find it in your file.

839
01:06:56,517 --> 01:07:02,680
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was convenient for you last week to get Eversource here just like that, when the conditions of the streets might be taking place.

840
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:10,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, this council has been asking, asking for you to go forward and call for this meeting.

841
01:07:11,764 --> 01:07:12,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is no meeting here.

842
01:07:13,585 --> 01:07:19,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are public notices out there, and there are stanchions out there indicating that the bridge is going to start this summer.

843
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:22,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So what clout you have, I don't know.

844
01:07:22,925 --> 01:07:24,605
[SPEAKER_08]: What clout this city has, I don't know.

845
01:07:25,425 --> 01:07:38,849
[SPEAKER_08]: But the more important part of where the clout all lies is this city council should be holding somebody to be accountable for the mitigation process that needs to take place on this, because businesses are going to be hurt, and some people might even go out of business.

846
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:48,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It's absolutely unfair that this project is going to start in the summer of 2015 and not be completed until November of 2018.

847
01:07:51,839 --> 01:08:00,325
[SPEAKER_17]: On my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councillor Marks bringing the issue forward.

848
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:02,467
[SPEAKER_17]: So I applaud you for that.

849
01:08:03,007 --> 01:08:11,654
[SPEAKER_17]: And my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe.

850
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:13,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Twice in six months.

851
01:08:14,196 --> 01:08:14,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

852
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:20,361
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses.

853
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:25,267
[SPEAKER_17]: even though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that.

854
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:27,947
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't want businesses to think otherwise.

855
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:35,469
[SPEAKER_08]: With all due respect to my council colleague, that may be your interpretation, but nothing was ever definitively signed or put in writing.

856
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:38,470
[SPEAKER_08]: This council asked to have that put in the RFP that went out there.

857
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:42,631
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are four people, there are four components to the people who are bidding on that bridge, number one.

858
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:51,873
[SPEAKER_08]: This council asked that they come here and they apprise the city, the council and the business community and the office of community development as it relates to the progress of that bridge.

859
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And they never did it.

860
01:08:53,514 --> 01:09:00,622
[SPEAKER_08]: The only meeting that they ever had was, I believe, some three weeks ago at 10 o'clock on a Wednesday morning, for which certain councils couldn't go.

861
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:01,843
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people couldn't go.

862
01:09:02,063 --> 01:09:05,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just their staff meeting, if you want to come and see what it's all about.

863
01:09:06,228 --> 01:09:11,793
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they send you a press release, for which is put in the paper, that basically tells you that this is not going to be completed until 2018.

864
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:23,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you forget all the gibberish he gets around to 2018, and then they acknowledge that the footings of the bridge, which have been there for 100 plus years, all they're going to do is reshore them up.

865
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,381
[SPEAKER_08]: That bridge is not sunk at all.

866
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:28,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they think they're building, the Taj Mahal, I don't know.

867
01:09:29,284 --> 01:09:32,806
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't need to build the Longfellow Bridge like they're building in Washington.

868
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:35,968
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very simple bridge of 121 feet.

869
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:40,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, you want to make it adaptable for people, sidewalks and bikes, go right ahead.

870
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:51,365
[SPEAKER_08]: But with the art of technology that's out there today, and for them to tell you it's going to take you a well over a year just to figure out what's underneath the bridge and move the lines and this and that, that is absolutely absurd.

871
01:09:51,946 --> 01:09:52,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely absurd.

872
01:09:52,987 --> 01:09:59,353
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably the biggest snow job that this council and this city has gotten from the State Department of Public Transportation.

873
01:09:59,953 --> 01:10:07,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And we haven't even gotten to the issue of the bus routes and the changing of the bus routes and what's going to happen after that and once this bridge goes into construction.

874
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:11,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'm asking once again, I'm asking you to call the Mass.

875
01:10:11,722 --> 01:10:20,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Transportation, have them come before this council, and have them explain if what Councilor Camuso was saying is correct, that they are not going to give us mitigation.

876
01:10:20,248 --> 01:10:20,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information?

877
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:25,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

878
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:31,257
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council.

879
01:10:31,317 --> 01:10:37,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Clearly stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do

880
01:10:38,419 --> 01:10:44,804
[SPEAKER_17]: is pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result.

881
01:10:45,664 --> 01:10:49,367
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a big difference, mitigation and physical damage.

882
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:54,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to respectfully disagree with my colleague because state agencies and state departments do pay mitigation.

883
01:10:55,171 --> 01:10:56,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they're asked to do it, they do do it.

884
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,294
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest one out there right now is the MWRA.

885
01:10:59,574 --> 01:11:04,558
[SPEAKER_08]: They will give you mitigation before they even start a project because they have to realize the length and the strength of their pipes.

886
01:11:06,949 --> 01:11:11,352
[SPEAKER_17]: We can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to.

887
01:11:11,952 --> 01:11:14,614
[SPEAKER_17]: They are not a state agency.

888
01:11:14,654 --> 01:11:17,415
[SPEAKER_17]: The MWRA is a separate and distinct authority.

889
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:19,316
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an authority like Massport.

890
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:20,957
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an authority like the MBTA.

891
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:23,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Their rules, their laws are different.

892
01:11:24,428 --> 01:11:26,870
[SPEAKER_17]: The Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us.

893
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:28,431
[SPEAKER_17]: They said it right here.

894
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,734
[SPEAKER_17]: If we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said.

895
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:35,517
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here.

896
01:11:35,878 --> 01:11:37,159
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is clearly what was said.

897
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:40,882
[SPEAKER_17]: The state does not pay mitigation on public projects.

898
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:43,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm responsible for what I know.

899
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:53,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I know is this, that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does and can, if the city of Memphis is going to be impacted to such a degree and businesses are going to be displaced for a period of time such as that,

900
01:11:53,395 --> 01:12:06,786
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have your own Chamber of Commerce, and when you have an entire city council, and when you've been talking about this since 2013, and went out since 2015, and there is nothing, no acknowledgement, no public hearing, no public meeting, it's a disgrace.

901
01:12:07,186 --> 01:12:08,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you think they're doing a good job,

902
01:12:08,897 --> 01:12:12,118
[SPEAKER_08]: taking this bridge over and cutting down the amount of time that it's going to take.

903
01:12:13,658 --> 01:12:14,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wrong.

904
01:12:14,758 --> 01:12:15,258
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right.

905
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:16,299
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not right.

906
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:20,960
[SPEAKER_08]: This does not speak well for a governmental project and a governmental agency.

907
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:28,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And more importantly, how can you go and start with $2 million, go as high as $12 million, bring it back to $10 million?

908
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,842
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't even figure out what the actual cost is going to be.

909
01:12:31,422 --> 01:12:34,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And the total disruption is going to be when they put that ramp in Medford Square,

910
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:40,472
[SPEAKER_08]: and shutting off one of the ramps coming off Route 93, there's going to be a complete fiasco.

911
01:12:40,672 --> 01:12:42,594
[SPEAKER_08]: We still haven't seen the final product.

912
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:47,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It still hasn't been presented to the business people, the Chamber of Commerce, or this council.

913
01:12:49,118 --> 01:12:53,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, to me, is what this whole system, this whole project is all about.

914
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely no transparency at all.

915
01:12:58,183 --> 01:12:59,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, Councilor Camuso.

916
01:13:00,004 --> 01:13:00,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

917
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:04,074
[SPEAKER_17]: to say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction.

918
01:13:04,515 --> 01:13:05,575
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fiction, once again.

919
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:11,938
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

920
01:13:12,358 --> 01:13:16,040
[SPEAKER_17]: One of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name.

921
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:18,101
[SPEAKER_17]: What was it?

922
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:18,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul King.

923
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:19,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul King.

924
01:13:19,882 --> 01:13:23,224
[SPEAKER_17]: They were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council.

925
01:13:23,944 --> 01:13:24,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Twice.

926
01:13:24,845 --> 01:13:25,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Twice.

927
01:13:25,425 --> 01:13:27,366
[SPEAKER_17]: So to sit here and say that there hasn't been public

928
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:31,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of clarification, Councilor Pinto.

929
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting took place on the 18th of July, 2013, and it took place at the Century Bank and Trust on Mystic Avenue.

930
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:44,629
[SPEAKER_08]: The time that came over here, his name was Billy something, he appeared here from Medford and his other person.

931
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:46,529
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what took place.

932
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:49,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And that meeting, we were told, as a matter of fact,

933
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:56,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Mr. Davies' private personal number because at that particular night, in that particular meeting, they were trying to shut me off.

934
01:13:56,532 --> 01:14:04,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm asking him a very important question as to why this meeting was not being held here in Medford and where is the mitigation as it relates to the concern that we have.

935
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:08,204
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not going to give us mitigation, what are you going to give to the business community?

936
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:11,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tell me you're going to pay for the disruption or the destruction to their product.

937
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:13,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course they would have to do that.

938
01:14:13,043 --> 01:14:14,283
[SPEAKER_08]: That's common sense tells you that.

939
01:14:14,723 --> 01:14:19,105
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't come in here and do a project and totally disrupt the entire community of the downtown area.

940
01:14:19,325 --> 01:14:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: You have bus routes, you can have people completely confused.

941
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:25,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone on this council turn around and explain what's going to go on?

942
01:14:25,688 --> 01:14:27,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me where the bus routes are going to go?

943
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:29,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, yes.

944
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:33,331
[SPEAKER_17]: The bus routes are going to go, the main bus route.

945
01:14:33,931 --> 01:14:38,073
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did.

946
01:14:38,426 --> 01:14:39,727
[SPEAKER_17]: but the bus route is going to be moved.

947
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:40,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of clarification.

948
01:14:40,327 --> 01:14:41,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of clarification.

949
01:14:41,588 --> 01:14:42,829
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to make representative to me.

950
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:45,391
[SPEAKER_08]: My point is they belong before the public.

951
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:48,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to do something in the public belongs to hear what's going on.

952
01:14:48,973 --> 01:14:50,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what the council call for.

953
01:14:50,414 --> 01:14:52,016
[SPEAKER_08]: If he wants to go on his own, good luck to him.

954
01:14:52,276 --> 01:14:53,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I want him to come before here.

955
01:14:53,737 --> 01:14:55,678
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a city of Medford project.

956
01:14:56,699 --> 01:15:02,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, as I stated, if the counselor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service,

957
01:15:03,402 --> 01:15:09,724
[SPEAKER_17]: reaching out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved.

958
01:15:10,404 --> 01:15:22,648
[SPEAKER_17]: They are moving it across the river over near the bridge and hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councillor Marks brought up before.

959
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:26,490
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am doing some talks with the appropriate people.

960
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:27,530
[SPEAKER_17]: That's number one.

961
01:15:27,839 --> 01:15:38,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.

962
01:15:38,402 --> 01:15:40,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Mr. President.

963
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got absolutely nothing to do with it.

964
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:43,703
[SPEAKER_08]: He's talking about apples and oranges.

965
01:15:43,763 --> 01:15:45,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got nothing to do with this particular issue.

966
01:15:45,563 --> 01:15:47,244
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a pattern of your fictitious mind.

967
01:15:47,704 --> 01:15:48,304
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your fictitious mic.

968
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:49,304
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to call him out of order or not?

969
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:52,045
[SPEAKER_08]: This has nothing to do with this issue.

970
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:54,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's nothing to do with the issue.

971
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:57,747
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to shield for her, do it in the public.

972
01:15:57,907 --> 01:16:03,448
[SPEAKER_17]: As I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings.

973
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,229
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, there were two public meetings.

974
01:16:05,549 --> 01:16:06,329
[SPEAKER_17]: This, I mean.

975
01:16:06,869 --> 01:16:07,769
[SPEAKER_17]: And the public meetings were in 2013.

976
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:07,989
[SPEAKER_17]: This is 2015.

977
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:29,019
[SPEAKER_17]: and we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.

978
01:16:29,299 --> 01:16:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right here, Councilor, and it's right here.

979
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:38,443
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.

980
01:16:38,703 --> 01:16:41,224
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not going to sit here.

981
01:16:42,005 --> 01:16:48,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I believe one councilor is talking about a public meeting and one councilor is talking about a public hearing.

982
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:54,832
[SPEAKER_12]: There was plenty of meetings, but I don't believe the state has had any public hearings.

983
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:56,733
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't declared any meetings.

984
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:58,134
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't notified neighbors.

985
01:16:58,174 --> 01:17:03,597
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't notified businesses of a meeting where citizens and business owners can give their... There was one here today in this building.

986
01:17:03,637 --> 01:17:05,498
[SPEAKER_17]: There was one today that he didn't go to.

987
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:07,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I didn't know about that one.

988
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,000
[SPEAKER_12]: What meeting?

989
01:17:08,828 --> 01:17:11,930
[SPEAKER_12]: A year ago, we had public hearings before the city council.

990
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:18,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I never have known about one where the community has been notified to give their input of this project.

991
01:17:18,393 --> 01:17:30,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, because I agree, three years is going to detrimentally affect our Medford Square businesses to the point where maybe there'll be no mitigation, but there'll be claims in court against the state.

992
01:17:31,419 --> 01:17:35,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and that's a given if you see a business go out of,

993
01:17:36,525 --> 01:17:41,008
[SPEAKER_12]: go out of business due to loss of income from the project that's going to take place.

994
01:17:41,108 --> 01:17:47,693
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think both councilors are making their points and are right in their own different ways.

995
01:17:48,254 --> 01:17:49,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your point of information.

996
01:17:49,935 --> 01:17:51,676
[SPEAKER_17]: So Mr. President, if I just can finish.

997
01:17:51,836 --> 01:17:52,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Camuso has the floor.

998
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:53,818
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll wrap it up.

999
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:57,260
[SPEAKER_17]: And Councilor Langel-Kern is 100% correct.

1000
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,862
[SPEAKER_17]: There can be lawsuits, and there probably will be lawsuits.

1001
01:18:00,423 --> 01:18:05,146
[SPEAKER_17]: But the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the Department of Transportation.

1002
01:18:05,445 --> 01:18:12,730
[SPEAKER_17]: does not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects.

1003
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:26,381
[SPEAKER_17]: If that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy.

1004
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And I understand that completely, completely.

1005
01:18:34,532 --> 01:18:36,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Camuso just referred to the Rose Kennedy Garden.

1006
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:38,514
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rose Kennedy Garden was an afterthought.

1007
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:40,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It was going to be a greenway.

1008
01:18:40,534 --> 01:18:42,575
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rose Kennedy Garden came in after the fact.

1009
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:50,358
[SPEAKER_08]: That was part of the mitigation and the rehabilitation because of the damage and the construction that took place in the artery.

1010
01:18:50,658 --> 01:19:03,183
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and

1011
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, businesses property get taken care of.

1012
01:19:08,693 --> 01:19:13,515
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting.

1013
01:19:14,515 --> 01:19:15,275
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't fiction.

1014
01:19:15,575 --> 01:19:18,557
[SPEAKER_17]: This is factual, what the state said to us.

1015
01:19:18,597 --> 01:19:20,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Now if the law changes, I hope it changes.

1016
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:21,998
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope it changes.

1017
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:36,263
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers,

1018
01:19:37,013 --> 01:19:44,257
[SPEAKER_17]: in the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with.

1019
01:19:44,277 --> 01:19:47,839
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over.

1020
01:19:48,699 --> 01:20:02,026
[SPEAKER_17]: The DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet?

1021
01:20:05,852 --> 01:20:06,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you turn him on?

1022
01:20:06,492 --> 01:20:11,114
[SPEAKER_06]: What they tend to do is either fax over a notice or email a notice.

1023
01:20:11,134 --> 01:20:14,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's sporadic the way some of these notices come in.

1024
01:20:14,836 --> 01:20:17,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not quite sure on the one today.

1025
01:20:17,057 --> 01:20:18,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't checked the postings.

1026
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:22,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

1027
01:20:22,899 --> 01:20:25,220
[SPEAKER_17]: The bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.

1028
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:29,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So the bids are posted mostly when you have bids.

1029
01:20:29,962 --> 01:20:31,182
[SPEAKER_06]: That's posted at procurement.

1030
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:33,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big wall posting things.

1031
01:20:33,363 --> 01:20:34,684
[SPEAKER_17]: And the DOT does notify?

1032
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:37,746
[SPEAKER_17]: the city though, where it is in the city, correct?

1033
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:38,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Normally.

1034
01:20:39,547 --> 01:20:39,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1035
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:45,571
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, so like I said, it just, uh, public meetings are meetings to get the information.

1036
01:20:45,651 --> 01:20:47,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Public hearings are more legality.

1037
01:20:48,293 --> 01:20:50,394
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a legality in certain instances.

1038
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:51,355
[SPEAKER_17]: You need a public hearing.

1039
01:20:51,395 --> 01:20:52,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1040
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Clerk Finn, is that correct?

1041
01:20:53,776 --> 01:20:55,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Public hearing is a legality.

1042
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:01,261
[SPEAKER_17]: If it, if it calls for you, if it calls for it, but they're not going to have public hearings unless it calls for it.

1043
01:21:01,581 --> 01:21:01,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1044
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:04,038
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting.

1045
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:04,618
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

1046
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:15,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And given the public hearings that may be, may be called for this might be because of the, um, the river underneath it and the river being affected by it.

1047
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:18,486
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a environmental public hearing, things of that nature.

1048
01:21:18,526 --> 01:21:19,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

1049
01:21:19,226 --> 01:21:20,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Conservation things.

1050
01:21:20,267 --> 01:21:25,189
[SPEAKER_17]: But typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community.

1051
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:26,590
[SPEAKER_17]: If it doesn't need.

1052
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:27,960
[SPEAKER_17]: because it doesn't need to be.

1053
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:28,320
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1054
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:32,682
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, I think that's important to, um, cause council Lungo Kern brought up a very valid point.

1055
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:42,085
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate.

1056
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:43,285
[SPEAKER_17]: It will be duly advertised.

1057
01:21:43,846 --> 01:21:47,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it,

1058
01:21:48,597 --> 01:21:51,078
[SPEAKER_17]: unless it calls for it for a specific legality.

1059
01:21:51,838 --> 01:21:55,779
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that.

1060
01:21:56,199 --> 01:22:02,981
[SPEAKER_17]: But they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings.

1061
01:22:03,862 --> 01:22:08,443
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.

1062
01:22:11,944 --> 01:22:14,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1063
01:22:14,245 --> 01:22:15,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight has the floor next.

1064
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:17,146
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two points of information.

1065
01:22:17,226 --> 01:22:17,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Panto.

1066
01:22:18,978 --> 01:22:35,825
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, as it relates to the bus stop, whether it's being moved over the bridge or, as some of us were led to believe, it might be moved to Medford Square, we were supposed to be getting a report back from the T that would indicate where that bus stop was going to be moved.

1067
01:22:36,165 --> 01:22:36,825
[SPEAKER_08]: That's number one.

1068
01:22:36,845 --> 01:22:41,087
[SPEAKER_08]: The other gentleman who came here that night, his name was Paul King, and he was the project manager.

1069
01:22:42,187 --> 01:22:47,350
[SPEAKER_08]: He also indicated, for which they have now changed their times from the days and the night shifts as to when

1070
01:22:48,921 --> 01:23:01,430
[SPEAKER_08]: working hours are going to take place, which is a change from what was written on January 21st, 2015, as compared to the most recent one on May 20th of this year.

1071
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:04,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, once again, none of the businesses are aware of this.

1072
01:23:04,653 --> 01:23:08,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a, and the request by the council was to have them here.

1073
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:12,819
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm not going to get hung up on the legality of a hearing or a meeting.

1074
01:23:13,299 --> 01:23:14,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a request.

1075
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the request to have a state agency or somebody come here,

1076
01:23:18,682 --> 01:23:24,027
[SPEAKER_08]: to explain what their project is about, then they should honor the request, either in writing or what have you.

1077
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:31,213
[SPEAKER_08]: You said, Councilor DelaRusso, when I gave you the letter that you said you couldn't find and you never got, you went to the city clerk.

1078
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,415
[SPEAKER_08]: The city clerk supposedly called them up.

1079
01:23:34,416 --> 01:23:35,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Never got a response, did you, Mr. Clerk?

1080
01:23:36,738 --> 01:23:39,981
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a great way to have, and he called not once, but he called twice.

1081
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:45,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great way for a state agency to act on behalf of a community that has a major project going through it,

1082
01:23:46,725 --> 01:23:51,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're worried about allegedly a legality from a hearing to a request to be here.

1083
01:23:52,313 --> 01:23:54,436
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely nonsense.

1084
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:55,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Knight.

1085
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1086
01:24:00,445 --> 01:24:01,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I have concerns about the bridge.

1087
01:24:01,847 --> 01:24:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I've raised them last week.

1088
01:24:02,967 --> 01:24:09,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a resolution asking the harbour master to meet with the project manager to determine what restrictions were going to be on the roadway for boaters up river.

1089
01:24:11,234 --> 01:24:15,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, you know, we've all scratched our heads and wondered what's going to happen with the buses.

1090
01:24:15,457 --> 01:24:22,943
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all scratched our heads and wondered how this off-ramp is going to work, where cars can take lefts and rights around the backside of Medford Auto to get through Medford Square.

1091
01:24:24,009 --> 01:24:30,955
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, Mr. President, you know, I wholeheartedly feel as though another meeting would be beneficial to get some of our questions answered.

1092
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:34,618
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it appears to me that the DOT is not willing to have this meeting.

1093
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:43,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I'm wondering if it would be a beneficial exercise for us to maybe put some questions in writing as to what we want answered and send them over to the project manager and have the project manager get back to us.

1094
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:48,100
[SPEAKER_05]: If in fact the project manager doesn't get back to us in a timely fashion, then we can take action.

1095
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:54,025
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point in time, Mr. President, let's try to get the questions answered so that we can provide the information to those people that are going to be most affected by it.

1096
01:24:56,147 --> 01:24:56,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can go from there.

1097
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,990
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what we really need to focus on is solutions, Mr. President.

1098
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:04,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we need to focus on how we're going to help these businesses through this tough time.

1099
01:25:04,454 --> 01:25:05,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be three years of construction.

1100
01:25:06,195 --> 01:25:11,119
[SPEAKER_05]: How we're going to improve traffic flow during this three-year period of time as construction is going on.

1101
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:18,644
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out what best practices work so that when we have another construction project at this scale, we're prepared to deal with it, Mr. President.

1102
01:25:19,424 --> 01:25:24,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'd like to see maybe a listing of the questions that we have that we need answered.

1103
01:25:25,165 --> 01:25:38,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can get those together maybe as a group in committee of the whole and then vote on it to come out of the committee and then vote on that to have those questions sent to the DOT for an answer, I think that we might be on the right track, Mr. President, to actually getting solutions.

1104
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:40,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1105
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:47,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a motion?

1106
01:25:53,551 --> 01:26:00,074
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso that the representatives of the project present themselves before the city council for a meeting.

1107
01:26:00,674 --> 01:26:01,454
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1108
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:05,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1109
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I should mention a timeframe on that.

1110
01:26:08,237 --> 01:26:08,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1111
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:16,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe before the summer session, but you know, I agree with the comments that were made.

1112
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:23,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we all agree that a meeting or a public hearing, whatever it may be, is necessary and would be beneficial.

1113
01:26:24,105 --> 01:26:31,670
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what Councilor Knight's going after, but I think you also need, you know, I may have a bunch of questions, but there may be a hundred residents that have different questions.

1114
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,782
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think a hearing or a meeting is imperative.

1115
01:26:35,182 --> 01:26:37,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to hear from the community.

1116
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:46,830
[SPEAKER_11]: And from what I remember with the FAST-14 project, which the state was involved with, you're right, the state didn't give us any mitigation, but J.F.

1117
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,032
[SPEAKER_11]: White most certainly gave us mitigation money.

1118
01:26:49,552 --> 01:26:53,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So whoever the contractor is, is the one that doles out the mitigation.

1119
01:26:53,795 --> 01:27:01,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we've asked, even with Eversource, we've asked the administration to use some leverage in order to get some mitigation.

1120
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,821
[SPEAKER_11]: for tearing up all our streets.

1121
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:19,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should be asking the same, whoever the contractor is of this credit bridge, for mitigation on what's going to take place, the impact of the business owners, the impact of the drive time in the morning, the commute.

1122
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:23,711
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a host of impacts that are going to take place, Mr. President.

1123
01:27:23,751 --> 01:27:29,494
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I hope that they don't turn a cheek at us, Mr. President.

1124
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:30,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm not mistaken,

1125
01:27:31,402 --> 01:27:38,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself, Councillor Penta, I think Councillor Caviello, we attended a meeting that was had right across the street.

1126
01:27:38,747 --> 01:27:40,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it was about a year ago.

1127
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:41,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Councillor Lungo was there too.

1128
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:56,791
[SPEAKER_11]: of the state, and our community development director, Lauren DiLorenzo, I'll never forget this, she stood up and pointed at the developer, I mean the state, and said, we have been left out of this process.

1129
01:27:57,251 --> 01:28:03,514
[SPEAKER_11]: You have not given us ample opportunity to speak on this, and that's coming from our own director of office of community development.

1130
01:28:04,055 --> 01:28:06,416
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can imagine when a member of the council gets up and says,

1131
01:28:06,803 --> 01:28:08,404
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to get more information on this.

1132
01:28:08,744 --> 01:28:15,267
[SPEAKER_11]: If our own Community Development Office can't get it, then how are we, as council, supposed to get this on behalf of the residents of this community?"

1133
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:21,770
[SPEAKER_11]: And that spoke volumes that morning, Mr. President, when she spoke up, saying that they haven't been involved in the process.

1134
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:23,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, that was some time back.

1135
01:28:23,311 --> 01:28:24,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if it's changed.

1136
01:28:24,852 --> 01:28:32,636
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can only tell you, the only information I get is through just piecemeal and whatever I happen to read in the newspaper, Mr. President.

1137
01:28:32,676 --> 01:28:34,397
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's a sad commentary.

1138
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Councilor Knight has the floor and then Councilor Camuso.

1139
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:48,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I know that mitigation is going to be very important to the businesses down in the Medford Square area and whether or not we're able to triumph that is a whole other question.

1140
01:28:48,142 --> 01:28:54,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that there are some things that we can control here at the local level in terms of mitigation and maybe that's something that we need to look at.

1141
01:28:54,284 --> 01:29:01,325
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, one of the first things that pops to mind is the biggest complaint that we're hearing out there right now from shop owners is the kiosks in Medford Square.

1142
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:02,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if

1143
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:17,946
[SPEAKER_05]: if the state is not willing to help us out with mitigation, then maybe we can go a step further and we as a city can help mitigate by maybe changing the hours of operation of the kiosk or closing the kiosk down for certain days or certain periods of time in that business district while construction is going on to provide some relief to the business owners.

1144
01:29:18,547 --> 01:29:22,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the construction alone, well, the traffic patents alone right now in Memphis will get people away.

1145
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:27,552
[SPEAKER_05]: With the construction coming in the kiosk, I think this is really going to have a detrimental effect, Mr. President.

1146
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you.

1147
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:37,322
[SPEAKER_17]: And the city administration, up to this point, this has been front and center.

1148
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:45,064
[SPEAKER_17]: This afternoon, I believe, 101.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce.

1149
01:29:45,485 --> 01:29:46,925
[SPEAKER_17]: And so everyone was at the table.

1150
01:29:48,206 --> 01:29:52,147
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe they're working out specifics right now.

1151
01:29:52,707 --> 01:29:55,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they'll be bringing it forward at another level.

1152
01:29:56,488 --> 01:29:58,789
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, at another meeting, I do not know.

1153
01:29:59,169 --> 01:30:01,190
[SPEAKER_17]: But there is ongoing dialogue.

1154
01:30:01,754 --> 01:30:06,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Councillor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break.

1155
01:30:07,597 --> 01:30:13,700
[SPEAKER_17]: But most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent.

1156
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:18,982
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking outside the box, in our community, like Councillor Knight said.

1157
01:30:19,602 --> 01:30:24,845
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening.

1158
01:30:25,105 --> 01:30:31,248
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation,

1159
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:33,680
[SPEAKER_17]: as a result of this project.

1160
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:43,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project.

1161
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:53,726
[SPEAKER_17]: When the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation, but they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area.

1162
01:30:54,086 --> 01:30:59,368
[SPEAKER_17]: If they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe or something like that.

1163
01:31:00,257 --> 01:31:03,580
[SPEAKER_17]: similar to the other projects that have taken place here within our community.

1164
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:09,404
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.

1165
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:22,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, there are subcontractors, as Councillor Marks has alluded to, that are going to be responsible.

1166
01:31:23,034 --> 01:31:26,157
[SPEAKER_08]: The main contractor here, the signer of the contract is the Mass.

1167
01:31:26,177 --> 01:31:27,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Transportation.

1168
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:28,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the main contractor for the bridge.

1169
01:31:29,502 --> 01:31:30,962
[SPEAKER_08]: But you've got Spectra Energy.

1170
01:31:30,982 --> 01:31:32,003
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got National Grid.

1171
01:31:32,163 --> 01:31:33,683
[SPEAKER_08]: You also even have the city of Medford involved.

1172
01:31:33,703 --> 01:31:35,263
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the Massachusetts State Police.

1173
01:31:35,283 --> 01:31:38,004
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the State Department of Conservation and Recreation.

1174
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:40,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are other little subcontractors involved in here.

1175
01:31:41,485 --> 01:31:47,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am not going to turn around and say mitigation is not a possibility, when, in fact, it could be a possibility.

1176
01:31:48,046 --> 01:31:58,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as the meeting goes today, it's another clear-cut example of this council being shut out on any types of meetings such as that, especially when they had a personal interest in this, especially on behalf of the

1177
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:09,150
[SPEAKER_08]: of the Metro business folks, and we've been discussing this for months upon months upon months, and not to be even notified about a meeting to go to, it's just wrong.

1178
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:19,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where the whole sense of frustration comes about, a complete lack of transparency, and that's how mixed messages get sent around, not only to this building, but to the businesses within this community.

1179
01:32:20,473 --> 01:32:25,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, pretty soon, there'll be a major change in this community, and this will not go on, this will not be tolerated.

1180
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, can we take?

1181
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:45,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay, go ahead.

1182
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:46,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1183
01:32:46,406 --> 01:32:51,449
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-496, petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, to address the city council on the police building.

1184
01:32:51,909 --> 01:32:52,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1185
01:32:52,089 --> 01:32:54,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Martin, please state your name and address for the record.

1186
01:32:54,271 --> 01:32:55,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

1187
01:32:55,231 --> 01:32:58,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and in spite of your

1188
01:33:00,089 --> 01:33:00,929
[SPEAKER_00]: spirited debate.

1189
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:05,391
[SPEAKER_00]: This council in the last two years has actually accomplished something.

1190
01:33:05,931 --> 01:33:08,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to people and they always say, well, what did they accomplish?

1191
01:33:08,592 --> 01:33:10,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually able to tell them something.

1192
01:33:10,713 --> 01:33:12,434
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them about the DPW yard.

1193
01:33:12,474 --> 01:33:15,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them about getting rid of TV3.

1194
01:33:15,495 --> 01:33:16,696
[SPEAKER_00]: You've actually made progress.

1195
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:19,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, in spite of arguing today,

1196
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:25,617
[SPEAKER_00]: This committee has done a lot better in communicating.

1197
01:33:25,637 --> 01:33:36,845
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every once in a while you get heated, but it's doing a lot better, and I would ask that you continue to keep the tempers down and the conversation flowing, because you've been doing a great job.

1198
01:33:37,466 --> 01:33:42,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when I drive by on Route 16 and I see the Pompeo Garage, it looks fantastic.

1199
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys made that happen.

1200
01:33:44,311 --> 01:33:46,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So in spite of it all, I just wanted to thank you for that.

1201
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:49,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was a sticker.

1202
01:33:50,293 --> 01:33:52,754
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could put on my truck that said, blue lives matter.

1203
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:57,755
[SPEAKER_00]: The police department in this city is often overlooked or taken for granted.

1204
01:33:58,275 --> 01:34:02,977
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask them to work in an environment not worthy of the sacrifice they make for us.

1205
01:34:04,137 --> 01:34:11,019
[SPEAKER_00]: The policemen and women of Medford commit to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including weekends and holidays.

1206
01:34:12,099 --> 01:34:12,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that some thought.

1207
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:14,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Like its officers,

1208
01:34:15,437 --> 01:34:24,500
[SPEAKER_00]: the police headquarters is a building that is also open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and used even on weekends and holidays.

1209
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:30,163
[SPEAKER_00]: I can lecture you, the public, on how an ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure.

1210
01:34:31,643 --> 01:34:38,085
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless you, the people, realize your obligation to stand behind the importance of a new building, it will never come to fruition.

1211
01:34:39,906 --> 01:34:42,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you how our police headquarters

1212
01:34:42,514 --> 01:34:46,755
[SPEAKER_00]: is the second most important building in this city, second only to City Hall.

1213
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:52,877
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, the people, do not value the role of the police department, this new structure will not be built.

1214
01:34:54,818 --> 01:35:04,100
[SPEAKER_00]: For everyone has their own wish list of projects, be it an art center or a garage, an old house renovation, or a school improvement.

1215
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:10,502
[SPEAKER_00]: While everyone in this city gives lip service and verbalizes the need for a new police station,

1216
01:35:10,945 --> 01:35:12,926
[SPEAKER_00]: and thanks the police for being there for them.

1217
01:35:13,646 --> 01:35:20,808
[SPEAKER_00]: When push comes to shove, they choose the project that they value more over the need for a new police station.

1218
01:35:21,908 --> 01:35:23,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no horse in this race.

1219
01:35:23,469 --> 01:35:26,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no family member or friend on the police department.

1220
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:32,871
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that without civil order, your other projects do not have a long shelf life.

1221
01:35:34,332 --> 01:35:39,333
[SPEAKER_00]: My fear is that by the time we pay off enough old bonds, in quotes,

1222
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:53,022
[SPEAKER_00]: As has been stated by our politicians and administrators, the cry for new school funding will overshadow the police department once again, as the political will for schools usually do.

1223
01:35:54,522 --> 01:36:01,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years is a long time, and a lot of these other new buildings are going to need a lot of major repair, and I fear that to happen.

1224
01:36:01,763 --> 01:36:02,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not done that.

1225
01:36:04,004 --> 01:36:10,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Our police station was built in the early 1960s and is very outdated and has been unable to stand the test of time.

1226
01:36:11,543 --> 01:36:14,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I repeat, has been unable to stand the test of time.

1227
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:20,291
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of the police building is not just to house the police and arrestees.

1228
01:36:20,871 --> 01:36:26,576
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a place where policy and policing can be discussed by and with the community.

1229
01:36:27,197 --> 01:36:28,878
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have a room for that purpose.

1230
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:31,561
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be safe for officers and prisoners.

1231
01:36:32,342 --> 01:36:38,387
[SPEAKER_00]: The building needs to be larger for detective work, technology updates, and technology I also include

1232
01:36:38,878 --> 01:36:46,344
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire department, which the chief came here, or one of their representatives came here and talked about how they don't have email, that needs to be addressed.

1233
01:36:46,404 --> 01:36:49,727
[SPEAKER_00]: These are basic issues that need to be addressed.

1234
01:36:50,128 --> 01:36:54,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about a police headquarters, I mean a police slash fire headquarters.

1235
01:36:56,413 --> 01:36:58,935
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have secure witness-proof privacy.

1236
01:37:01,137 --> 01:37:05,320
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, somebody comes in, they witnessed a crime.

1237
01:37:06,241 --> 01:37:06,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be

1238
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:13,411
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little quiet place for them to meet, to talk to the officers, so that they feel comfortable coming forward.

1239
01:37:15,112 --> 01:37:16,872
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have evidence-proof lockers.

1240
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:19,693
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have firearm safety and accessibility.

1241
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:23,774
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be located in a prominent position in the square accessible to all.

1242
01:37:24,674 --> 01:37:27,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have decided that I want it right where it is.

1243
01:37:27,955 --> 01:37:28,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the location.

1244
01:37:28,955 --> 01:37:29,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it bigger than it is.

1245
01:37:30,516 --> 01:37:32,916
[SPEAKER_00]: And if things have to happen, then things have to happen.

1246
01:37:33,816 --> 01:37:35,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it also deters crime

1247
01:37:36,337 --> 01:37:41,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as when I see a police officer car and I'm driving down the street, I slow down.

1248
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,061
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see the police department, I'm going to say, oh, there, and it's going to remind me.

1249
01:37:47,621 --> 01:37:53,143
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a place where people feel comfortable that they should go to if they're lost, if they need help.

1250
01:37:53,543 --> 01:37:57,185
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be visible so that if you want it, you know where it is.

1251
01:37:58,465 --> 01:38:01,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone agrees with this assessment from parents to the arts community.

1252
01:38:02,206 --> 01:38:03,987
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is no one wants to pay for it.

1253
01:38:05,241 --> 01:38:07,762
[SPEAKER_00]: The political will stops at the funding trough.

1254
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:13,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Allocating the money is where the city stops short of contracting this project out.

1255
01:38:14,824 --> 01:38:15,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

1256
01:38:15,364 --> 01:38:27,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone has their agenda, that they value more than the police building, including employees who sometimes would rather see a personal raise in their take-home pay than committing millions to a police building.

1257
01:38:28,948 --> 01:38:30,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their agenda.

1258
01:38:30,328 --> 01:38:31,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents want more teachers.

1259
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:33,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Arts Council wants Springstep.

1260
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Politicians want to be reelected.

1261
01:38:37,212 --> 01:38:50,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has a stake in not committing the millions of dollars required to have a full, real, state-of-the-art police building that the police could work out of, that you, the people, can own and feel proud of.

1262
01:38:50,955 --> 01:38:56,220
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of the police station should be right where it is, visible and accessible to everyone.

1263
01:38:56,821 --> 01:39:00,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that means taking some of the buildings out for eminent domain, so be it.

1264
01:39:01,285 --> 01:39:05,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should know where the station is and it should be built large and welcoming.

1265
01:39:07,792 --> 01:39:08,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I repeat, welcoming.

1266
01:39:11,235 --> 01:39:14,258
[SPEAKER_00]: It should incorporate the drug education personnel.

1267
01:39:14,718 --> 01:39:17,080
[SPEAKER_00]: to the judgment area for parking tickets.

1268
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:20,683
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be viewed as everyone's building.

1269
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:25,907
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no immediate gratification in this buildout.

1270
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:32,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Citizens of Medford, all, have their priorities, and most do not have the police station at the top of their list.

1271
01:39:33,573 --> 01:39:36,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet this building is open 24 hours a day and used by everyone.

1272
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:44,441
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to ignore my advice, don't come crying to me when the police morale is down and time on the call lags.

1273
01:39:45,023 --> 01:39:46,963
[SPEAKER_00]: because you didn't care about taking care of them.

1274
01:39:48,944 --> 01:39:50,484
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the best police department.

1275
01:39:51,184 --> 01:39:52,704
[SPEAKER_00]: You want an engaged citizenry.

1276
01:39:53,624 --> 01:39:55,665
[SPEAKER_00]: You want crime and drug issues to be handled.

1277
01:39:56,045 --> 01:39:56,765
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes money.

1278
01:39:58,185 --> 01:40:03,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Money you will not see the immediate benefits of, but in the long run will pay off.

1279
01:40:03,886 --> 01:40:10,367
[SPEAKER_00]: No other building project should even be discussed, i.e., the garage or art centers, until a police building is in the works.

1280
01:40:11,007 --> 01:40:14,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a small amount of businesses need to be taken by eminent domain,

1281
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:21,894
[SPEAKER_00]: to make enough room for the police structure, that's a hit they will have to take, and we will have to compensate them for.

1282
01:40:22,915 --> 01:40:24,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Public safety comes first.

1283
01:40:25,036 --> 01:40:25,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1284
01:40:26,617 --> 01:40:27,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1285
01:40:27,658 --> 01:40:27,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Martin.

1286
01:40:28,418 --> 01:40:29,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Caviello.

1287
01:40:30,139 --> 01:40:31,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1288
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, Gene, you brought up a lot of good points there.

1289
01:40:34,582 --> 01:40:42,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will say this, this whole council is uniformed with standing behind the police station and warning one.

1290
01:40:42,586 --> 01:40:43,507
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can recall,

1291
01:40:43,984 --> 01:40:50,268
[SPEAKER_10]: During last year's election, that was number one on everybody's list, including the mayor.

1292
01:40:50,668 --> 01:40:52,470
[SPEAKER_10]: What was needed was a police station.

1293
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,191
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, okay.

1294
01:40:54,871 --> 01:40:56,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, can, may I respond to that?

1295
01:40:56,732 --> 01:40:58,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor will finish his remarks.

1296
01:40:58,854 --> 01:41:00,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1297
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:03,397
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the number one request for everybody, including the mayor.

1298
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:11,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, now we're, two years have gone, a new election's coming up, and you're gonna, everyone's gonna ask, what's the number one priority again?

1299
01:41:11,582 --> 01:41:12,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're all gonna say the police station again.

1300
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:17,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have a chance where there's going to be a new mayor.

1301
01:41:19,231 --> 01:41:26,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see where the new mayor stands on, or the new potential mayor stands on this police station project.

1302
01:41:26,553 --> 01:41:37,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the one that's running currently, as said when she was the budget director, that she didn't think it would be possible for seven years.

1303
01:41:38,956 --> 01:41:43,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven years, so it means we have to wait seven, it's going to take three to build, that's ten years.

1304
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:47,352
[SPEAKER_10]: The city can't wait 10 years to build another police station.

1305
01:41:47,652 --> 01:41:48,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you.

1306
01:41:48,513 --> 01:41:50,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're right, it's a 24-hour building.

1307
01:41:50,614 --> 01:41:58,357
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just as important as city hall is because they don't, this building closes and the holidays and the weekends, they're open.

1308
01:41:58,397 --> 01:41:59,357
[SPEAKER_10]: They never stop working.

1309
01:41:59,398 --> 01:42:05,700
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fair to our policemen and the men and women who work in there that they work in those conditions.

1310
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:07,221
[SPEAKER_10]: They're jammed in there.

1311
01:42:08,201 --> 01:42:12,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they've branched over into the former training facility.

1312
01:42:12,443 --> 01:42:15,124
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not used anymore as a training facility.

1313
01:42:15,985 --> 01:42:27,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's high time that, um, uh, let's say that this becomes a main point of the new election coming up over, over how that is going to get built in funded.

1314
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:29,510
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I do agree with that.

1315
01:42:30,231 --> 01:42:35,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it should be, it should be one of the biggest points asked of the new mayor.

1316
01:42:36,674 --> 01:42:37,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1317
01:42:37,914 --> 01:42:38,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1318
01:42:38,234 --> 01:42:39,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, uh, with all due respect,

1319
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:44,284
[SPEAKER_00]: The budget director did say it would take seven years, and that's my problem.

1320
01:42:45,564 --> 01:42:46,224
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too long.

1321
01:42:46,684 --> 01:42:51,085
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely... Or seven before we could even start talking about it.

1322
01:42:51,105 --> 01:42:51,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is ridiculous.

1323
01:42:52,265 --> 01:42:53,406
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to anybody.

1324
01:42:53,426 --> 01:42:55,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So seven and then three years, the bill means ten years.

1325
01:42:56,386 --> 01:42:57,066
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.

1326
01:42:57,106 --> 01:42:57,206
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

1327
01:42:57,226 --> 01:42:57,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.

1328
01:42:57,586 --> 01:42:59,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to happen and it needs to start now.

1329
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:01,587
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole group of seven, I think, agrees with you there.

1330
01:43:02,127 --> 01:43:04,648
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect to the administration, it's too late.

1331
01:43:05,928 --> 01:43:07,108
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to happen.

1332
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:09,989
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be now, because in seven years,

1333
01:43:10,682 --> 01:43:11,823
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more buildings.

1334
01:43:11,843 --> 01:43:13,444
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more holes in this ceiling.

1335
01:43:13,464 --> 01:43:17,066
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more issues that are going to come up and schools will come in.

1336
01:43:17,386 --> 01:43:22,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parents have a very large voice in the city, no offense to the parents, but they have a very large voice.

1337
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:27,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the school kids come in and you see the four fourth graders, you're going to cry for them.

1338
01:43:27,972 --> 01:43:30,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always lose to the, you know, the police always lose out.

1339
01:43:30,914 --> 01:43:32,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information council care.

1340
01:43:32,835 --> 01:43:38,338
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct because you were already starting to see a little bit of a groundswell, but people talking about a new high school.

1341
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:45,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, as I'm out around, I hear that, well, how about a new high school?

1342
01:43:45,343 --> 01:43:46,363
[SPEAKER_10]: When are we going to build a new high school?

1343
01:43:46,964 --> 01:43:47,144
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1344
01:43:47,664 --> 01:43:48,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

1345
01:43:48,084 --> 01:43:49,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in agreement with you.

1346
01:43:49,465 --> 01:43:52,526
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole committee said that they want a new police department.

1347
01:43:52,566 --> 01:43:54,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of them said that's at the top of their list.

1348
01:43:54,647 --> 01:43:55,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And I commend you for that.

1349
01:43:56,188 --> 01:43:58,369
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people, I'm not talking to you so much.

1350
01:43:58,889 --> 01:44:03,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to those folks out there, because they're the ones that have to put the pressure to get the police station.

1351
01:44:03,552 --> 01:44:08,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to realize that there is going to have to be a sacrifice on their part.

1352
01:44:09,018 --> 01:44:11,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not going to happen unless they sacrifice something.

1353
01:44:11,259 --> 01:44:19,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you can recall, at one of the meetings, I was the one that brought up a possibility of a two and a half override, which got shot down in a matter of like three seconds.

1354
01:44:21,003 --> 01:44:24,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know we've never had one, but maybe that might be the end.

1355
01:44:24,945 --> 01:44:26,585
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be bonded, and it needs to be bonded now.

1356
01:44:26,605 --> 01:44:28,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's the avenue that we may have to go.

1357
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:29,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be bonded.

1358
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:32,608
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was told that that will not happen in this administration.

1359
01:44:33,116 --> 01:44:38,059
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect, if we needed to bond for a new high school, there would be parents right here.

1360
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:41,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the same as when you see a bunch of police officers.

1361
01:44:41,562 --> 01:44:43,743
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 100 police officers in their families.

1362
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:51,169
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't compare in the voice, the political voice, compared to the school department, school committee, and all those parents and all those kids.

1363
01:44:52,556 --> 01:44:53,136
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless them.

1364
01:44:54,017 --> 01:44:59,520
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will happen, and the police will get pushed to the back of the line once again.

1365
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,161
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that happens, don't come crying to me.

1366
01:45:02,621 --> 01:45:03,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm saying.

1367
01:45:03,702 --> 01:45:04,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1368
01:45:04,783 --> 01:45:06,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight has the floor next.

1369
01:45:07,044 --> 01:45:08,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1370
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:08,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ms.

1371
01:45:08,605 --> 01:45:11,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin, thank you very much for that thorough analysis.

1372
01:45:12,267 --> 01:45:20,111
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that you said really stuck out to me, and that was the fact that seven years is too long, because in seven years, we're going to look at our school buildings that are going to be deteriorating.

1373
01:45:20,991 --> 01:45:22,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a major problem.

1374
01:45:22,808 --> 01:45:26,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a brand new DPW yacht, just built, just built.

1375
01:45:26,251 --> 01:45:27,272
[SPEAKER_05]: The paint's not even dry yet.

1376
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:30,275
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our capital maintenance plan at the DPW yacht?

1377
01:45:30,475 --> 01:45:31,956
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our city's number one asset.

1378
01:45:31,976 --> 01:45:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the largest investment we've made in quite some time.

1379
01:45:34,299 --> 01:45:35,059
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our plan?

1380
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:43,247
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to do to be sure that this stays a state-of-the-art facility so that 10 years down the line, we're not looking to borne money to fix something we've already fixed, Ms.

1381
01:45:43,267 --> 01:45:43,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin.

1382
01:45:43,947 --> 01:45:47,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's a great assessment, and that leads me into my point.

1383
01:45:48,209 --> 01:45:52,251
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have a capital improvement fund in the city of Medford for our buildings.

1384
01:45:52,651 --> 01:45:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And without that, we're going to be behind the eight ball all the time.

1385
01:45:56,653 --> 01:46:00,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Until we actually take care of the facilities that we own and perpetuate

1386
01:46:01,003 --> 01:46:04,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And perpetual maintenance care isn't a bad idea, a perpetual fund.

1387
01:46:05,444 --> 01:46:15,006
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that I support, a capital maintenance and trust fund, where we dedicate a certain portion of our city's budget to a trust fund, just for the purpose of maintaining and upkeeping the current buildings that we have, Mr. President.

1388
01:46:15,587 --> 01:46:15,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Ms.

1389
01:46:15,967 --> 01:46:29,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin, I think that that was a very good point that you made, because there are going to be competing interests the more time that goes on if, in fact, we don't have a capital maintenance plan to keep the buildings and the existing assets that we have up to par to be livable, to be workable, to be usable.

1390
01:46:30,026 --> 01:46:33,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for taking the time to come up here and provide us with that thoughtful analysis.

1391
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:34,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1392
01:46:34,467 --> 01:46:36,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do agree also, one second now.

1393
01:46:37,388 --> 01:46:37,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree.

1394
01:46:38,028 --> 01:46:44,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally for a 5%, whatever that number is, for a maintenance plan for every single city building.

1395
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:46,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I am totally on board with that before we do anything else.

1396
01:46:47,271 --> 01:46:51,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that was part of the new school construction that was never followed through on.

1397
01:46:52,013 --> 01:46:52,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, you're all set?

1398
01:46:53,733 --> 01:46:54,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I rest.

1399
01:46:55,134 --> 01:46:56,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1400
01:46:56,054 --> 01:46:56,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Pinto?

1401
01:46:56,834 --> 01:46:59,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Just on that point, I'm glad you just brought that up because I was alluding to that.

1402
01:47:00,226 --> 01:47:08,452
[SPEAKER_08]: When we built our new school buildings, they're going on 13 years now, if not more, the 5% on an annual basis was supposed to be each school budget.

1403
01:47:09,353 --> 01:47:12,955
[SPEAKER_08]: The state never came in here to monitor that, to see if it was.

1404
01:47:13,316 --> 01:47:20,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Councilor Caviello, in the second year of his term, in year two, brought up a report that had $1,200,000 of repairs for the schools.

1405
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:20,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that correct, sir?

1406
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:21,542
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1407
01:47:21,562 --> 01:47:24,844
[SPEAKER_08]: $1,200,000 for schools that were no more, at that point in time, maybe 12 years old, 10, 11, 12 years old.

1408
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're worried about a new police station and making sure that it's going to be rehab.

1409
01:47:35,543 --> 01:47:36,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Look up at the ceiling there.

1410
01:47:36,504 --> 01:47:37,544
[SPEAKER_08]: You see that ceiling right there?

1411
01:47:37,805 --> 01:47:38,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

1412
01:47:38,085 --> 01:47:38,885
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been like that.

1413
01:47:38,925 --> 01:47:41,607
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how long that's been going on almost three years.

1414
01:47:42,427 --> 01:47:47,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And the superintendent of schools is sitting exactly where the gentleman is sitting there when that ceiling came down and he's lucky he didn't get killed.

1415
01:47:48,632 --> 01:47:51,553
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what the city's idea of maintenance is right there.

1416
01:47:51,974 --> 01:47:54,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Cover the hole up, patch it up, and maybe nothing will be said.

1417
01:47:55,136 --> 01:47:55,836
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard it tonight.

1418
01:47:55,856 --> 01:47:56,797
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard about the library.

1419
01:47:56,817 --> 01:47:57,958
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard about the bathrooms.

1420
01:47:58,378 --> 01:47:58,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1421
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,200
[SPEAKER_08]: You go through the infrastructure of our city.

1422
01:48:01,521 --> 01:48:09,222
[SPEAKER_08]: There were just so many things that, for the past many years, have been ignored, completely and totally ignored, whitewashed over.

1423
01:48:09,322 --> 01:48:09,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1424
01:48:10,242 --> 01:48:11,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know why?

1425
01:48:11,282 --> 01:48:17,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Because in all these bonds that the city has outstanding there, they're all going to be paid on a back end.

1426
01:48:17,364 --> 01:48:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's interest only for the first five or six years.

1427
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,165
[SPEAKER_08]: God bless whoever the next mayor is going to be.

1428
01:48:23,225 --> 01:48:28,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope I have a chance to do this, because I want to revitalize that whole situation on how

1429
01:48:29,298 --> 01:48:31,880
[SPEAKER_08]: this city is going to pay for those bonds in the future.

1430
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:37,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you realize on the fifth and the sixth year what the cost is going to be in this particular budget to pay for those bonds?

1431
01:48:37,904 --> 01:48:39,264
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't see any new buildings in here.

1432
01:48:39,464 --> 01:48:43,107
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll just be paying off for the bonds that you have here right now.

1433
01:48:44,067 --> 01:48:52,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So what needs to take place here is a thorough and an exhaustive review of how these buildings are going to be reviewed, how these buildings are going to take place.

1434
01:48:53,713 --> 01:48:59,674
[SPEAKER_08]: This past year, the school department budget passed $2 million additional dollars, from last year to this year.

1435
01:49:00,374 --> 01:49:01,814
[SPEAKER_08]: God knows what they have in it for this year.

1436
01:49:02,575 --> 01:49:06,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Salaries increased, as the councilor to my right, Councilor Longo, current and current.

1437
01:49:06,095 --> 01:49:16,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people got $20,000 salary increases, and I believe there was almost $32 million in transfers from last year's budget before the end of the year took place.

1438
01:49:16,757 --> 01:49:20,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So how are we talking about that being a legitimate budget when you pass it in the beginning of the year?

1439
01:49:21,078 --> 01:49:21,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1440
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:24,750
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all tricks of the trade, apparently, that have been going on for years.

1441
01:49:25,711 --> 01:49:44,514
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you have, all of a sudden, $2 million in additional dollars, and you start hiring extra people at $90,000 and $100,000 a year, and you take it away from the classroom, you take it away from the teachers, you take it away from the supplies, and you take it away from the front entrance of that high school, it looks like it's bombed out, like a war zone, because the bricks and everything are shattered.

1442
01:49:44,754 --> 01:49:47,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised there are enough kids that have not broken their ankles or their legs.

1443
01:49:48,294 --> 01:49:50,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Handles are still off the front door to come in.

1444
01:49:50,935 --> 01:49:51,475
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wrong.

1445
01:49:52,118 --> 01:49:56,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And when a parent goes up there and looks at it and says, is that where I'm going to send my kid?

1446
01:49:56,041 --> 01:49:57,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I really want my kid to go there?

1447
01:49:58,282 --> 01:50:04,366
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they get forced to go to these private schools, because appearance, as you know, is the name of the game.

1448
01:50:05,907 --> 01:50:09,809
[SPEAKER_08]: They spent $500,000 to redo this building over, just this council chamber.

1449
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:12,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it cost $497,000 to build the entire building, PWA days.

1450
01:50:12,111 --> 01:50:13,031
[SPEAKER_08]: But $500,000 to do this over.

1451
01:50:17,957 --> 01:50:19,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been like that for three years.

1452
01:50:19,278 --> 01:50:25,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the molding, if you look at the molding, that's ready to go and that's coming down and nothing's been done, nothing in the budget, no repair work, no nothing.

1453
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:29,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And y'all worried about a police station and they can't even figure out how to do this.

1454
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:37,167
[SPEAKER_08]: The next administration hopefully will be a work in composite between the council and the mayor.

1455
01:50:38,107 --> 01:50:39,468
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's going to be a meeting of the minds.

1456
01:50:40,195 --> 01:50:48,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that way there, when the money is going to be spent, it's going to be spent, and everybody's going to be on board to understand how it's going to be spent, when it's going to be spent, and where it's going to be spent for.

1457
01:50:49,122 --> 01:50:51,063
[SPEAKER_08]: That hasn't taken place here in 28 years.

1458
01:50:51,664 --> 01:50:53,805
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can assure you, it will take place.

1459
01:50:55,346 --> 01:50:57,688
Thank you.

1460
01:50:58,749 --> 01:51:05,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, can we take 15479, please?

1461
01:51:10,137 --> 01:51:11,778
[SPEAKER_08]: we laid on the table last week to this week.

1462
01:51:13,719 --> 01:51:18,682
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of a council paper to take a couple of Penta to take a paper off the table.

1463
01:51:19,343 --> 01:51:26,707
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor of those opposed 15 for 79, the future of Lawrence Memorial hospitals to be discussed.

1464
01:51:27,087 --> 01:51:27,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Penta.

1465
01:51:28,108 --> 01:51:38,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, as a result of unfortunately the merger that did not take place between partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital and the Melrose Wakefield on January 29th of this past year,

1466
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:53,302
[SPEAKER_08]: when Judge Sanders issued her 48-page decision not agreeing to this because she did not believe that what Martha Coakley had put together was going to work in the best interests of the hospitals mentioned in as well as offshore.

1467
01:51:53,983 --> 01:52:07,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on top of that, Mara Healy, the new attorney general coming in and likewise not only supporting the judge but nixing the whole deal and is willing to go to court

1468
01:52:08,387 --> 01:52:12,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we have a council resolution asking her and both parties to be here.

1469
01:52:12,949 --> 01:52:18,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I've taken the time to speak to some doctors and some employees up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1470
01:52:20,112 --> 01:52:31,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And since at the present time, the third and the fourth floor of the hospital is not being used to any type of its potential, nevermind its maximum, I'd like to make an offering and throw this back out.

1471
01:52:31,857 --> 01:52:35,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully it gets back to not only the Lawrence Memorial, but to partners because

1472
01:52:36,163 --> 01:53:00,717
[SPEAKER_08]: If we take a look at the doctors that are operating here in the city of Medford that are Hallmark Hospital doctors and at the same time private practitioners, and offer them room and space on the third and fourth floor of the hospital, and leaving the first and second floors available for emergency, for prompt care, emergency services, and what's presently in there right now, it would be a way not only to utilize the hospital

1473
01:53:01,188 --> 01:53:16,815
[SPEAKER_08]: with a complete medical density of doctors, no matter what their professions might be, and at the same time, make the offering to partners, rather than have the Lawrence be part of a consortium, which included the South Shore, which included Melrose-Wakefield.

1474
01:53:17,316 --> 01:53:30,842
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be an independent, isolated medical facility that the partners, Mass General, would be willing to entertain, which would not have to go through any type of a consortium, or review, or to go through

1475
01:53:31,719 --> 01:53:33,260
[SPEAKER_08]: 48-page review.

1476
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:41,482
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't realize that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was in a profit-making position before this whole idea of this merger took place.

1477
01:53:42,262 --> 01:53:48,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the last few years, a lot of its finances and a lot of its profits have been carried over to the Melrose-Wakefield.

1478
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:58,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately for the Lawrence Memorial, they did not receive the same benefits that the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital has received most recently over the past two to three years.

1479
01:53:59,755 --> 01:54:13,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's maybe because the former president, who's no longer the president, who left the day after the deal didn't go through, did not have the same feeling to the Lawrence Memorial as he had as being president over at the Melrose-Wakefield.

1480
01:54:13,698 --> 01:54:16,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think this would really bode well for our community.

1481
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:26,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would bode well for our citizens, seniors, mothers with babies, emergency room, prompt care locations, and for any other doctor that might be having a situation where

1482
01:54:27,412 --> 01:54:52,431
[SPEAKER_08]: either parking presents itself with a problem, location presents itself with a problem, but if they were all centrally located, because everybody knows where the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is, and if they were centrally located there, and they worked their offices out of that building, and even if they looked at the positioning that the doctors, to some degree, are not part of the nonprofit, and there is a way to legally separate the buildings or the floors or what have you, because anything is possible.

1483
01:54:53,132 --> 01:54:55,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I'm throwing this out there as a possibility

1484
01:54:56,192 --> 01:55:02,776
[SPEAKER_08]: to keep as many doctors as we can here, but also the greater possibility to bring Mass General partners here into the city of Medford.

1485
01:55:03,536 --> 01:55:05,817
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a great interest in Mr. Cardiology.

1486
01:55:06,178 --> 01:55:08,419
[SPEAKER_08]: They think it's a great team of doctors that are there.

1487
01:55:08,979 --> 01:55:16,123
[SPEAKER_08]: They were one of the first, if not the first group of doctors that partners, I believe, entertain for the purposes of hopefully being part of this consortium.

1488
01:55:16,824 --> 01:55:24,368
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, unfortunately on January 29th when the deal did not go through and Judge Sanders didn't approve it because she felt that for which Martha Coakley

1489
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:33,402
[SPEAKER_08]: had put in her request for the merger that the cost would not be contained, as they said it would be for a six-year period of time.

1490
01:55:33,942 --> 01:55:45,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, I believe there were 50 independent doctors and medical professionals and presidents of other hospitals, local area hospitals, who did not want it, did not believe it would serve in the best interest of the community.

1491
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:47,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that's the reason why.

1492
01:55:47,591 --> 01:55:50,133
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the 48-page decision says.

1493
01:55:51,390 --> 01:56:17,501
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move, Mr. Clerk, and I don't know if the words are going to be very probably general right now, that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital look at entertaining the utilization of their third and fourth floor locations for the purposes of offering to all Medford doctors an opportunity

1494
01:56:18,302 --> 01:56:38,733
[SPEAKER_08]: to house their private practices there in concert with the first and second, with the emergency and prompt care, the other medical facilities that the Lawrence Memorial offers now, and present that to the Partners Mass General Board, our president,

1495
01:56:39,888 --> 01:56:48,109
[SPEAKER_07]: That the, uh, if just for the point of clarity, counselor, that the, uh, that the hallmark health presented to the partners.

1496
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:48,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1497
01:56:48,970 --> 01:56:49,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1498
01:56:49,970 --> 01:57:08,833
[SPEAKER_08]: For the purposes of presenting to the hallmark help in essence, and they present that to partners mass general for the purposes of being an independent affiliate of the mass general and not part of the original consortium.

1499
01:57:10,025 --> 01:57:10,565
[SPEAKER_08]: You have it, Eddie?

1500
01:57:10,965 --> 01:57:12,046
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have to go back and watch the video.

1501
01:57:12,066 --> 01:57:14,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you are.

1502
01:57:14,167 --> 01:57:18,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was one more point of clarification, Councillor, for the point of voting on this resolution.

1503
01:57:19,468 --> 01:57:24,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Was anything of what you said done in consultation with an official from Hallmark Health?

1504
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:30,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Not with Hallmark Health, but speaking with their doctors, nurses, and as well as patients who thought it was a good idea.

1505
01:57:30,572 --> 01:57:31,733
[SPEAKER_08]: But doctors and nurses, yes.

1506
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a negative.

1507
01:57:36,814 --> 01:57:38,135
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councillor Penta.

1508
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:45,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Vice President, just point of clarification.

1509
01:57:45,271 --> 01:57:45,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1510
01:57:45,431 --> 01:57:47,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to, there's a third and fourth floor.

1511
01:57:47,611 --> 01:57:48,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So to house.

1512
01:57:48,411 --> 01:57:48,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1513
01:57:49,032 --> 01:57:55,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're just asking the question, have them discuss it on that motion.

1514
01:57:55,673 --> 01:57:56,233
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll call vote.

1515
01:57:56,253 --> 01:58:05,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President and have that forwarded to the Hallmark board of directors to be forwarded to home, uh, to be forwarded to, uh, partners, mass general.

1516
01:58:07,376 --> 01:58:08,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1517
01:58:10,117 --> 01:58:10,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso.

1518
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:12,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Carriello?

1519
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:13,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1520
01:58:13,581 --> 01:58:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

1521
01:58:14,181 --> 01:58:14,401
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1522
01:58:15,582 --> 01:58:16,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Lowenkern?

1523
01:58:17,122 --> 01:58:17,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1524
01:58:18,123 --> 01:58:18,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Moxley?

1525
01:58:19,063 --> 01:58:19,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1526
01:58:19,784 --> 01:58:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta?

1527
01:58:20,424 --> 01:58:20,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1528
01:58:21,164 --> 01:58:21,985
[SPEAKER_07]: President DelaRusso?

1529
01:58:22,045 --> 01:58:22,265
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1530
01:58:22,785 --> 01:58:27,907
[SPEAKER_07]: On the vote of one absent, two in the negative, four in the affirmative, the motion passes.

1531
01:58:32,029 --> 01:58:38,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Papers in the hands of the clerk offered under suspension by President DelaRusso and Councilor Knight.

1532
01:58:38,759 --> 01:58:48,722
[SPEAKER_07]: be resolved that the city solicitor advise and render an opinion to the council as to the process and parameters for the council to establish a charter review committee.

1533
01:58:49,582 --> 01:58:55,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty self-explanatory and we can discuss it when we get a response back to us.

1534
01:58:55,464 --> 01:58:56,264
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, Mr. President.

1535
01:58:56,284 --> 01:58:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion, Councilor Penta.

1536
01:58:58,484 --> 01:58:59,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I am absolutely perplexed.

1537
01:59:00,385 --> 01:59:08,147
[SPEAKER_08]: You and Councilor Knight are both offering these resolutions, but when this was presented over here for the purposes of possibly entertaining it by Mr. Storella,

1538
01:59:09,297 --> 01:59:12,339
[SPEAKER_08]: that both of you were opposed to it, and now all of a sudden you're for it?

1539
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:15,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people who had an opportunity to speak on it aren't even here?

1540
01:59:15,842 --> 01:59:21,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I respectfully request that I lay on the table, and anyone interested who might be watching can come next week to discuss this.

1541
01:59:21,547 --> 01:59:32,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think this is way too important of an issue to not have the public either be advised of it, but I'm just dumbfounded that people who are against it now want to get an opinion, when you didn't want to do it back then.

1542
01:59:34,643 --> 01:59:37,491
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just asking for an opinion, and we can discuss it afterwards.

1543
01:59:37,732 --> 01:59:39,758
[SPEAKER_08]: But you refused the gentleman when he came before, though.

1544
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:41,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So what changed your mind?

1545
01:59:43,886 --> 01:59:47,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I signed on to this resolution because I want to know what the process is.

1546
01:59:47,429 --> 01:59:48,470
[SPEAKER_05]: There are multiple processes.

1547
01:59:48,510 --> 01:59:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: This council can do it.

1548
01:59:49,631 --> 01:59:51,693
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a citizen-driven petition as well.

1549
01:59:52,074 --> 02:00:00,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important for the city clerk to come out and provide us with the perimeters, which venue we can recommend people take, which direction people may want to go or may not want to go.

1550
02:00:00,882 --> 02:00:04,666
[SPEAKER_05]: If there aren't enough votes for it here in the council, at least people know what direction to go, Mr. President.

1551
02:00:05,066 --> 02:00:07,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see no problem bringing the resolution forward.

1552
02:00:07,547 --> 02:00:10,008
[SPEAKER_05]: There were citizens that came here and then asked this council to make a decision.

1553
02:00:10,308 --> 02:00:12,068
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point in time, I wasn't ready to support that.

1554
02:00:12,148 --> 02:00:13,189
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point in time, I am.

1555
02:00:13,369 --> 02:00:14,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a little bit of homework.

1556
02:00:14,329 --> 02:00:16,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a little bit of research on the matter, Mr. President.

1557
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:19,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think that it's that outlandish.

1558
02:00:19,791 --> 02:00:20,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's crazy.

1559
02:00:21,312 --> 02:00:24,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's insane to bring this conversation topic forward.

1560
02:00:24,993 --> 02:00:31,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's insane, crazy, or outlandish to ask for the question, to be answered by a clerk, Mr. President.

1561
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:33,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1562
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:39,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Councilor Knight is new to the council, but this question has been brought up on several occasions.

1563
02:00:40,275 --> 02:00:50,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think some of the surprise is that there's been members of this council adamantly opposed to even looking at the city charter, let alone review it.

1564
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's some of the surprise.

1565
02:00:52,181 --> 02:00:53,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're relatively new to the council.

1566
02:00:54,182 --> 02:00:59,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself and other members of the council have supported this type of initiative and type of review.

1567
02:00:59,918 --> 02:01:05,643
[SPEAKER_11]: and feel that it should be built into the city charter that calls for a periodical review of the city charter.

1568
02:01:05,703 --> 02:01:08,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's where some of the surprise comes in.

1569
02:01:09,426 --> 02:01:13,750
[SPEAKER_11]: And I offered a resolution, I think it was a year and a half, two years ago.

1570
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:19,815
[SPEAKER_11]: And I won't speak out of turn, but the president at the time, Councilor Del Russo, said,

1571
02:01:20,413 --> 02:01:25,375
[SPEAKER_11]: He has never had anyone approach him regarding the city charter and didn't see a need to even look at it.

1572
02:01:26,156 --> 02:01:29,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was, you know, pretty close to a quote that he said.

1573
02:01:29,417 --> 02:01:42,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think some of us are concerned now because, you know, when the mayor was in office, there wasn't the feeling by some members of the council to review the charter when the mayor was in power.

1574
02:01:43,483 --> 02:01:47,225
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and now all of a sudden the mayor is going by the wayside.

1575
02:01:47,865 --> 02:01:52,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, all of a sudden, these same members want to take a look at the city charter.

1576
02:01:52,829 --> 02:01:54,350
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe they had an epiphany.

1577
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:54,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1578
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:57,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you did a good job debating.

1579
02:01:58,013 --> 02:01:58,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And good luck to them.

1580
02:01:58,953 --> 02:02:02,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've always been supportive of a charter review for years.

1581
02:02:03,016 --> 02:02:07,720
[SPEAKER_11]: And my record has always been one for looking at the city charter.

1582
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:09,721
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the way the city government operates.

1583
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:16,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Any paper that was developed 28 years ago, like any business plan, you wouldn't be in business too long if you had

1584
02:02:16,387 --> 02:02:18,108
[SPEAKER_11]: the business plan from 28 years ago.

1585
02:02:18,428 --> 02:02:19,689
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to change with the times.

1586
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:27,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I welcome this, and I welcome to see how my colleagues that were once opposed to this move forward with this.

1587
02:02:28,535 --> 02:02:36,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, too, think that, you know, figuring out what the process is and figuring out what direction we need to go in if we feel as though there are changes necessary is important.

1588
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,200
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for us to know.

1589
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:38,161
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for the people to know.

1590
02:02:38,181 --> 02:02:38,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on board.

1591
02:02:38,441 --> 02:02:42,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And more importantly, I think with the change in administration, there is a certain

1592
02:02:43,686 --> 02:02:48,730
[SPEAKER_05]: sense of insecurity or a sense of maybe uncertainty and instability right now.

1593
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:51,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that if we're going to make the change, now's the time to do it.

1594
02:02:51,111 --> 02:02:53,993
[SPEAKER_05]: If things are changing, let's really take a long hard look at what's going on.

1595
02:02:54,013 --> 02:02:54,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification.

1596
02:02:55,254 --> 02:02:57,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of clarification, Councilor Pinto.

1597
02:02:57,356 --> 02:03:05,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the Council's sense saying that there is a — when the — at present administration, there was a security sense here, but now there is a sense of insecurity?

1598
02:03:05,442 --> 02:03:06,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I misspoke.

1599
02:03:06,322 --> 02:03:06,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I misspoke.

1600
02:03:07,103 --> 02:03:10,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Instability versus insecurity was the term that I meant to use, Councilor.

1601
02:03:10,745 --> 02:03:11,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's even worse.

1602
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:18,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't think that there's a sense of instability here in the community of Medford right now with the 28-year mayor that's retiring?

1603
02:03:18,853 --> 02:03:23,575
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two good candidates that are going to be in the race over here.

1604
02:03:23,635 --> 02:03:25,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, maybe the best woman will win.

1605
02:03:25,476 --> 02:03:26,076
[SPEAKER_05]: A man will win.

1606
02:03:27,297 --> 02:03:42,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think the people of this community are smart enough to understand and to realize that when this issue has been brought up, as it has been brought up, and I really am going to respectfully ask my colleagues to lay it on the table so that way the people who are watching it can come next week and discuss it.

1607
02:03:42,267 --> 02:03:49,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, Councilor De La Russa, you owe it to the public to come down from the chair and explain why you're putting this resolution on when you were wholeheartedly against it before.

1608
02:03:49,402 --> 02:03:50,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this doesn't make any sense.

1609
02:03:51,607 --> 02:03:53,631
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to stand behind that for what you're proffering.

1610
02:03:54,214 --> 02:03:57,595
[SPEAKER_08]: You just can't turn around and put a resolution on and not tell the people why.

1611
02:03:57,855 --> 02:04:00,176
[SPEAKER_08]: This is such a huge, huge issue.

1612
02:04:00,556 --> 02:04:05,598
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about the community's charter that you were diabolically opposed to before.

1613
02:04:05,878 --> 02:04:13,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Now all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, and I don't know who put this bug in your ear, to have this resolution come before the council.

1614
02:04:14,619 --> 02:04:23,502
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're that much for it, well, then why don't you just have the city solicitor come forward and just tell him, Mr. Solicitor, there seems to be a feeling in the community.

1615
02:04:23,802 --> 02:04:25,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you just come here and explain it?

1616
02:04:26,403 --> 02:04:26,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1617
02:04:27,063 --> 02:04:30,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you thought this up on your own, because that would be just too good to be true.

1618
02:04:31,184 --> 02:04:36,446
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact of the matter is, you sat there and you were against it, same as he was, and same as Councilor Camuso.

1619
02:04:36,706 --> 02:04:38,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, most are to withdraw.

1620
02:04:40,347 --> 02:04:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: God.

1621
02:04:42,693 --> 02:04:49,215
[SPEAKER_08]: They moved that the paper lay on the table and allow the people to come next week who have an interest on this particular subject matter.

1622
02:04:49,395 --> 02:04:52,295
[SPEAKER_08]: You had an 80-year-old gentleman who was walking the streets.

1623
02:04:53,236 --> 02:04:56,276
[SPEAKER_08]: You basically embarrassed him and insulted him at the podium.

1624
02:05:00,698 --> 02:05:00,858
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1625
02:05:00,938 --> 02:05:01,078
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1626
02:05:01,138 --> 02:05:03,018
[SPEAKER_08]: He said things were all right the way they were.

1627
02:05:03,218 --> 02:05:04,198
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, that's like saying.

1628
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:06,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to have you characterize my words, Counselor.

1629
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight withdraws his name from the petition.

1630
02:05:10,542 --> 02:05:12,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was a good thing, Mr. President.

1631
02:05:12,484 --> 02:05:13,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was a good thing.

1632
02:05:13,385 --> 02:05:15,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was something that, you know what I mean?

1633
02:05:15,606 --> 02:05:17,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a good thing, but I just want to know why.

1634
02:05:17,408 --> 02:05:17,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Why the change?

1635
02:05:17,868 --> 02:05:18,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We can work together.

1636
02:05:18,809 --> 02:05:22,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the future is what we should be focused on as opposed to the past.

1637
02:05:22,352 --> 02:05:29,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the motion to table should be withdrawn and that we should send it to the solicitor and then we can discuss it when it comes back to us.

1638
02:05:29,538 --> 02:05:31,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you afraid to let people come and talk on it?

1639
02:05:31,961 --> 02:05:32,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not at all.

1640
02:05:32,801 --> 02:05:35,163
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have an answer and we'll discuss it then.

1641
02:05:38,002 --> 02:05:39,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you withdrawing your motion today?

1642
02:05:39,183 --> 02:05:40,383
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's people who want to talk.

1643
02:05:40,423 --> 02:05:40,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to talk.

1644
02:05:40,903 --> 02:05:40,963
[SPEAKER_08]: You.

1645
02:05:42,984 --> 02:05:43,144
[SPEAKER_07]: You.

1646
02:05:43,465 --> 02:05:44,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion if it's... You.

1647
02:05:44,645 --> 02:05:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

1648
02:05:45,966 --> 02:05:46,986
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over the table.

1649
02:05:47,006 --> 02:05:47,487
[SPEAKER_07]: What is wrong?

1650
02:05:48,647 --> 02:05:50,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the motion to table withdrawn, Councillor?

1651
02:05:50,988 --> 02:05:54,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not... No, I'm not withdrawing it because I... The motion is tabled.

1652
02:05:54,250 --> 02:05:55,470
[SPEAKER_08]: If I find... Okay, if it's undervalued.

1653
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:56,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is tabled.

1654
02:06:05,915 --> 02:06:07,196
[SPEAKER_07]: We will address the records.

1655
02:06:07,965 --> 02:06:10,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, I have a update.

1656
02:06:10,728 --> 02:06:23,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to, in one moment.

1657
02:06:23,623 --> 02:06:24,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval.

1658
02:06:24,844 --> 02:06:25,625
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1659
02:06:25,645 --> 02:06:26,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1660
02:06:26,566 --> 02:06:27,387
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1661
02:06:27,607 --> 02:06:28,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion's tabled.

1662
02:06:29,673 --> 02:06:38,295
[SPEAKER_07]: The announcement for the budget hearings next week, I had hoped to receive the printed schedule from the mayor's office this evening.

1663
02:06:38,335 --> 02:06:41,096
[SPEAKER_07]: We just worked it out with Louise Miller this morning.

1664
02:06:41,536 --> 02:06:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: However, that hasn't come to us yet.

1665
02:06:44,957 --> 02:06:51,538
[SPEAKER_07]: The plan is to begin next Tuesday, the 2nd of June at 5.30.

1666
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:59,480
[SPEAKER_07]: In my note taking, I failed to take down which departments we're going to take then.

1667
02:07:00,469 --> 02:07:02,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Wednesday, the 3rd at 6 p.m.

1668
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:04,572
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I take that back.

1669
02:07:05,312 --> 02:07:07,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Tuesday, the 9th at 5.30.

1670
02:07:08,034 --> 02:07:16,299
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have library, health department, and some of the related pieces with that, and bonds and interest.

1671
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:23,744
[SPEAKER_07]: On Wednesday, the 10th at 5.30, I do not have a note on that.

1672
02:07:24,545 --> 02:07:26,886
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 16th, Tuesday, 5.30, police and fire.

1673
02:07:30,355 --> 02:07:45,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday the 17th DPW 530 hopefully Thursday the 18th at 6 PM we'll be prepared to take the school department.

1674
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:54,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, then, uh, as it comes out, uh, we'll be able to begin discussion on the council floor, the 23rd.

1675
02:07:54,082 --> 02:07:58,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and if things need to be continued, we have up till the 30th.

1676
02:07:58,684 --> 02:08:00,044
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the first dates again, please.

1677
02:08:00,362 --> 02:08:03,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, the first date is Tuesday, June 2nd at 5.30.

1678
02:08:04,064 --> 02:08:13,369
[SPEAKER_07]: 9th at 5.30, the 10th at 5.30, 16th, 5.30, 17th, 5.30, 18th, 6 p.m.

1679
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:16,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1680
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:21,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Reconsideration on the vote that we just took, Mr. President.

1681
02:08:22,533 --> 02:08:26,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take, move reconsideration.

1682
02:08:26,435 --> 02:08:27,056
[SPEAKER_11]: That was tabled.

1683
02:08:27,836 --> 02:08:29,617
[SPEAKER_07]: On the charter issue.

1684
02:08:30,459 --> 02:08:34,822
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a few residents that would like to speak on it, and then we can make a motion after that.

1685
02:08:35,543 --> 02:08:38,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion for reconsideration to reintroduce it back to the floor.

1686
02:08:39,045 --> 02:08:39,826
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1687
02:08:39,986 --> 02:08:40,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1688
02:08:40,326 --> 02:08:40,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed?

1689
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:45,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Did members of the public wish to speak on that matter?

1690
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:49,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, again.

1691
02:08:50,141 --> 02:08:52,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street, Medford.

1692
02:08:52,743 --> 02:09:00,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I started a committee, just a grassroots committee.

1693
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:07,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have 57 members on it right now of people that were very much interested in reviewing the charter.

1694
02:09:07,234 --> 02:09:10,197
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important because it's a very old document.

1695
02:09:11,938 --> 02:09:14,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Councilor Penta was on it.

1696
02:09:14,902 --> 02:09:22,750
[SPEAKER_03]: At the initial change from plan E to plan A, there were a lot of amendments left out of it.

1697
02:09:23,631 --> 02:09:30,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Amendments that hurt the citizens of Medford because they weren't getting fair representation for their tax dollars, among other things.

1698
02:09:30,697 --> 02:09:37,224
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do recall when I came before, I had a discussion with Solicitor Rumley, and we had a miscommunication.

1699
02:09:38,096 --> 02:09:40,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to get to him before he went on vacation.

1700
02:09:40,198 --> 02:09:48,584
[SPEAKER_03]: He took a long weekend and I came before the council somewhat unprepared, but the emotion that I was trying to get across was to get a feel from the counselors.

1701
02:09:49,064 --> 02:09:58,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be amenable to having a commission set up where I believe each one of your counselors can pick somebody to go on the, on the committee or the commission.

1702
02:09:59,892 --> 02:10:01,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was shot down four to three.

1703
02:10:03,034 --> 02:10:04,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think council Mike, she voted for it.

1704
02:10:05,496 --> 02:10:05,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1705
02:10:09,082 --> 02:10:10,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very important.

1706
02:10:10,162 --> 02:10:13,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it's an election year and I know, you know, this is the right thing to do.

1707
02:10:13,803 --> 02:10:16,104
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the right thing to do 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

1708
02:10:16,144 --> 02:10:22,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, charter should review, be reviewed at least a minimum every five years because things change all the time.

1709
02:10:22,726 --> 02:10:24,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to get that straight.

1710
02:10:25,287 --> 02:10:28,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of people from that committee that I started.

1711
02:10:29,268 --> 02:10:33,829
[SPEAKER_03]: There were hundreds that want to see a review of the charter because they don't understand it.

1712
02:10:33,869 --> 02:10:37,330
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand why what happens here on Tuesday nights happens.

1713
02:10:38,438 --> 02:10:40,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you have authority to do this?

1714
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:41,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we spend this?

1715
02:10:41,219 --> 02:10:43,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we need to be some changes?

1716
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:44,320
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have a balance of power.

1717
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:46,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a boat taken.

1718
02:10:46,481 --> 02:10:48,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, it got stuffed four to three.

1719
02:10:48,942 --> 02:10:50,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that's all I wanted to say.

1720
02:10:50,743 --> 02:10:55,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1721
02:10:55,585 --> 02:10:57,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Martin of 18 Benton Road.

1722
02:10:59,087 --> 02:11:02,448
[SPEAKER_01]: A review of the chart is absolutely necessary.

1723
02:11:02,508 --> 02:11:06,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you use the analogy of an old, outdated computer,

1724
02:11:07,297 --> 02:11:16,283
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start to see that after the computer gets really slow, it's not working, you have to reboot it.

1725
02:11:16,343 --> 02:11:17,243
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to add to it.

1726
02:11:17,283 --> 02:11:18,764
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to upgrade it and update it.

1727
02:11:18,804 --> 02:11:31,172
[SPEAKER_01]: In a fast-evolving, fast-changing society, it's absolutely necessary to change this charter, to see the rules of government, to see how

1728
02:11:33,332 --> 02:11:35,213
[SPEAKER_01]: the charter in general can help society.

1729
02:11:35,293 --> 02:11:37,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's absolutely necessary.

1730
02:11:37,515 --> 02:11:50,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time that we start looking at changing the language in it and making sure that we can address issues for the city where this charter isn't really addressing.

1731
02:11:50,443 --> 02:11:51,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all.

1732
02:11:51,644 --> 02:11:51,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1733
02:11:51,884 --> 02:11:56,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1734
02:11:56,287 --> 02:11:58,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Could this state name and address for the record?

1735
02:11:58,489 --> 02:11:59,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael Agiro.

1736
02:11:59,049 --> 02:12:00,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1737
02:12:01,325 --> 02:12:09,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's absolutely essential that we review the charter, but we need to do it in a public forum where people have the opportunity to speak about the pros and cons of different systems.

1738
02:12:10,431 --> 02:12:15,554
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little disconcerting to me because I review the agenda every night, and I didn't see this item on the agenda.

1739
02:12:15,574 --> 02:12:16,654
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of surprised me.

1740
02:12:17,415 --> 02:12:24,960
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm all for a charter review, but let's do it in a kind of environment that allows for a diversity of voices from the community to participate.

1741
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:25,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1742
02:12:30,892 --> 02:12:33,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion, Counselor Knight?

1743
02:12:33,533 --> 02:12:39,397
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could ask the folks involved with this Chatter Review Commission that's been put together, when the next meeting is?

1744
02:12:39,417 --> 02:12:50,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm meeting with City Solicitor Romley on Thursday.

1745
02:12:50,503 --> 02:12:54,465
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm talking about Mr. D'Antonio, actually, and to the committee that he was speaking about.

1746
02:12:56,206 --> 02:12:58,047
[SPEAKER_03]: This was Anthony D'Antonio, Yale Street.

1747
02:12:58,067 --> 02:12:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an ad hoc committee.

1748
02:13:01,558 --> 02:13:04,080
[SPEAKER_03]: which came about because of the frustration of many citizens.

1749
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:08,102
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a, uh, you know, you don't have a charter.

1750
02:13:08,902 --> 02:13:10,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We just was a group of people.

1751
02:13:10,904 --> 02:13:13,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't know if you were meeting again in the near future.

1752
02:13:13,485 --> 02:13:18,608
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because what I, uh, what's happening now is because it's an election year and a lot of people busy with different things.

1753
02:13:19,388 --> 02:13:25,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I have a couple of other avenues I've been, you know, going down.

1754
02:13:26,152 --> 02:13:30,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that the, um, the next administrator, the next mayor in the city of Medford,

1755
02:13:31,529 --> 02:13:34,071
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll understand that this needs to be done and we'll go along with that.

1756
02:13:34,452 --> 02:13:38,294
[SPEAKER_03]: There's quite an operation to get this thing going.

1757
02:13:38,314 --> 02:13:41,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to go the signature way is 5,500 signatures.

1758
02:13:42,277 --> 02:13:44,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a process with this, that, and the other, and it takes a while.

1759
02:13:44,979 --> 02:13:52,485
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said, councilors can vote a commission, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, can vote a commission to work on the charter.

1760
02:13:52,685 --> 02:13:53,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs a lot of work.

1761
02:13:53,826 --> 02:13:56,768
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of weak spots in the charter.

1762
02:13:57,066 --> 02:14:04,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. D'Antoni, we've put some effort in and done some work on this and, you know, having dealt with you, I know that it's going to be good work and it's going to be thorough.

1763
02:14:04,789 --> 02:14:13,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you be willing to share that information with the council once we get our response back from the solicitor as to what your notes reflect in meeting minutes and stuff like that from the charter?

1764
02:14:13,613 --> 02:14:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have some minutes of what we've done.

1765
02:14:16,034 --> 02:14:18,415
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could share that with us, that might be helpful and start in the conversation.

1766
02:14:18,435 --> 02:14:23,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much what we discussed was the need for the change in the charter or the review of the charter.

1767
02:14:23,908 --> 02:14:36,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And not so much to besmirch the mayor or anything like that, because it's a very fine line when you're trying to work with somebody who's been mayor for 28 years in a charter that's been in existence from the year before he became mayor.

1768
02:14:37,156 --> 02:14:42,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a fine line, because there's a lot of different opinions of everything and everybody out there.

1769
02:14:42,739 --> 02:14:46,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was difficult, because we shook out the people that just wanted to come in and lambaste the mayor.

1770
02:14:46,681 --> 02:14:47,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do that.

1771
02:14:50,202 --> 02:14:50,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important.

1772
02:14:51,283 --> 02:14:59,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal was to get this city back in the back and I don't think anybody behind this rail, I don't think anybody behind this rail is questioning your motives, sir.

1773
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:07,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, you're Madam Vice President.

1774
02:15:07,533 --> 02:15:15,097
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can recall too, when it was before the council a number of times in the committee, your committee was started and Mr. Starello was a big advocate.

1775
02:15:15,338 --> 02:15:17,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, uh, Capucci,

1776
02:15:18,496 --> 02:15:19,417
[SPEAKER_12]: was a big advocate.

1777
02:15:19,457 --> 02:15:22,078
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you had a lot of meetings and you did a lot of work.

1778
02:15:22,178 --> 02:15:26,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the council took that vote of three to four and everything kind of died down after that.

1779
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:38,247
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe now if we can uniformly say we need to review the charter, we can move, you know, your committee and the city can move forward with, you know, reviewing the charter and seeing, seeing what needs to be changed in the future.

1780
02:15:38,627 --> 02:15:43,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, it is a committee ad hoc and not a commission, not a duly registered citizens commission.

1781
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:47,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Just a point.

1782
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:49,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1783
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:53,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of clarification to those meetings.

1784
02:15:55,272 --> 02:16:03,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony, when we were at those meetings, one of the things that were brought up that was pretty much not clear, because a lot of people didn't go back to 30 years.

1785
02:16:04,414 --> 02:16:10,096
[SPEAKER_08]: When this whole change of government took place way back when, it wasn't just a one option issue.

1786
02:16:10,416 --> 02:16:11,396
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a double option.

1787
02:16:11,536 --> 02:16:16,258
[SPEAKER_08]: You could retain the council manager form of government, or you could go forward with the strong AMEA.

1788
02:16:18,401 --> 02:16:20,943
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people seem to think that that wasn't the way it was.

1789
02:16:20,983 --> 02:16:26,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We had 32 meetings, 32 meetings, open to the public, open and notorious.

1790
02:16:26,867 --> 02:16:33,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had, I believe there was a Charter Review Committee, and then there became a Charter Commission, was elected citywide throughout the community.

1791
02:16:34,734 --> 02:16:39,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, I believe it's some year after that, it's a four to five year process.

1792
02:16:39,738 --> 02:16:42,820
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't an overnight thing, and people think it's gonna change overnight.

1793
02:16:43,421 --> 02:16:44,842
[SPEAKER_08]: This is open and notorious.

1794
02:16:44,882 --> 02:16:45,923
[SPEAKER_08]: There were many, many meetings,

1795
02:16:46,606 --> 02:16:52,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you digest each and every part of the segments of the charter, that's what this thing was all about, and that's where it was going.

1796
02:16:52,928 --> 02:16:59,469
[SPEAKER_08]: The unfortunate part, even though the vote was four to three, the unfortunate part about many good things were starting to come about.

1797
02:16:59,529 --> 02:17:11,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think all we were looking for, all that I guess you guys were looking for at the time, and I was willing to support, was having each council become involved, what a citizen, what a committee, in going over it.

1798
02:17:12,272 --> 02:17:15,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when the time came to make a presentation, you make a presentation.

1799
02:17:15,906 --> 02:17:16,806
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all that it was.

1800
02:17:16,906 --> 02:17:18,747
[SPEAKER_08]: This wasn't trying to upstage anybody.

1801
02:17:19,347 --> 02:17:19,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're right.

1802
02:17:20,147 --> 02:17:23,048
[SPEAKER_08]: This wasn't out there to smash anybody or anything like that.

1803
02:17:23,068 --> 02:17:26,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It was run very logically and very, very courteously.

1804
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:29,250
[SPEAKER_08]: People expressed their opinions as what they wanted to see.

1805
02:17:30,251 --> 02:17:36,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I just, you know, I still think there are other people out there who would like to come and speak on it.

1806
02:17:36,713 --> 02:17:41,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And just all due respect to my colleagues, I just ask that it lay on the table until next week.

1807
02:17:41,034 --> 02:17:43,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And at least that way, there are people, if they want to come, they come.

1808
02:17:44,386 --> 02:17:46,066
[SPEAKER_08]: At least they had an opportunity to know it's there.

1809
02:17:46,546 --> 02:17:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair to Councilor Penta, I do know the work that you did on the charter, because I read it and re-read it and read it again.

1810
02:17:54,368 --> 02:18:10,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do know that they omitted some very important revisions, amendments, clauses in there that sort of shot a whole lot of holes for that charter back then, Plan A. And one of the things people have to know, there were nine members on the commission.

1811
02:18:11,632 --> 02:18:13,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And just like the US Constitution when it was passed,

1812
02:18:14,423 --> 02:18:16,824
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very marginal on each one of them.

1813
02:18:16,884 --> 02:18:18,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of them were 5 to 4, 6 to 3.

1814
02:18:19,105 --> 02:18:20,886
[SPEAKER_08]: There weren't many that were really overwhelming.

1815
02:18:21,467 --> 02:18:23,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to probably find this on this particular issue, too.

1816
02:18:23,968 --> 02:18:24,628
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know something?

1817
02:18:25,209 --> 02:18:32,092
[SPEAKER_08]: This charter to be looked at today is going to be for the benefit of the citizens of tomorrow, for the people who are 20, 30, and 40 years old.

1818
02:18:32,112 --> 02:18:35,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're at an age right now, you know, we're living within something that's already there.

1819
02:18:36,054 --> 02:18:36,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been established.

1820
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:42,143
[SPEAKER_08]: But whoever the new council is going to be, your job isn't for today.

1821
02:18:42,163 --> 02:18:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Your job is where this city is going to be going for tomorrow.

1822
02:18:45,086 --> 02:18:45,806
[SPEAKER_08]: It's direction.

1823
02:18:46,327 --> 02:18:53,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And how are we going to enhance the vitality and rejuvenate this city to a point that's saying, hey, our government is working with us and it's moving forward with us.

1824
02:18:54,153 --> 02:18:59,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jeannie, whether it's a brand new police station or not, how we're going to get there, that's what you need to know.

1825
02:18:59,657 --> 02:19:01,919
[SPEAKER_08]: How it's going to be financed, that's what you need to know.

1826
02:19:02,299 --> 02:19:03,741
[SPEAKER_08]: You just can't say you want something.

1827
02:19:04,081 --> 02:19:04,982
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how we're going to do it.

1828
02:19:05,002 --> 02:19:05,982
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be collective.

1829
02:19:07,050 --> 02:19:12,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll be a cleft of thought process to get to that point, something that's been sort of like missing for a long period of time.

1830
02:19:13,252 --> 02:19:26,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully the new council, whoever those counselors might be, will realize that you do have an important role to play in this city and you're not going to be ostracized and you should be a game player for the future, just like the mayor is going to be a game player for the future.

1831
02:19:27,415 --> 02:19:29,295
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're elected to do the people's business.

1832
02:19:29,315 --> 02:19:31,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not elected here to be for ourselves.

1833
02:19:32,516 --> 02:19:33,997
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no personal gain in here for me.

1834
02:19:34,477 --> 02:19:35,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll speak for myself.

1835
02:19:35,994 --> 02:19:36,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this city.

1836
02:19:36,695 --> 02:19:38,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I've spent a lot of time in this city.

1837
02:19:38,536 --> 02:19:43,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been elected for a lot of years, and I'm very thankful to the taxpayers for that, and the rate payers, and the citizens.

1838
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:45,202
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know something?

1839
02:19:45,442 --> 02:19:46,543
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a new day dawned.

1840
02:19:46,843 --> 02:19:47,644
[SPEAKER_08]: We're moving forward.

1841
02:19:47,744 --> 02:19:52,308
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going into a new direction, and that's hopefully — I hope the taxpayers buy into that.

1842
02:19:52,328 --> 02:19:53,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a great — Mr. McNerney.

1843
02:19:53,309 --> 02:19:53,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Collaboration breeds success.

1844
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:54,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's a collaboration.

1845
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:55,131
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

1846
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:55,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1847
02:19:58,133 --> 02:19:58,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman.

1848
02:19:59,134 --> 02:20:02,597
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, just briefly, Mr. President, just because we're talking about the charter.

1849
02:20:04,845 --> 02:20:06,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I had some paperwork at my desk.

1850
02:20:06,326 --> 02:20:08,946
[SPEAKER_11]: It says the two main charter change routes.

1851
02:20:10,047 --> 02:20:12,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Option one, electing a home rule charter commission.

1852
02:20:13,568 --> 02:20:20,430
[SPEAKER_11]: It says option one is an election of a home rule charter commission, which leads to what is often referred to as a home rule charter.

1853
02:20:21,010 --> 02:20:25,971
[SPEAKER_11]: A commission of nine members may be elected to frame a charter or revise its present charter.

1854
02:20:26,471 --> 02:20:31,833
[SPEAKER_11]: For a city or a town upon a petition of 15% of the municipality's voters,

1855
02:20:32,495 --> 02:20:40,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Chapter 43B of the general laws provides a specific framework, timeline, and set of responsibilities for the charter commission to fulfill.

1856
02:20:40,882 --> 02:20:48,428
[SPEAKER_11]: The commission has a maximum of 16 months to produce a preliminary report and a maximum of 18 months to produce a final report.

1857
02:20:49,028 --> 02:20:52,151
[SPEAKER_11]: The statute requires that two public hearings be held.

1858
02:20:52,531 --> 02:20:57,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Both the preliminary and the final reports must be printed and distributed.

1859
02:20:58,475 --> 02:21:00,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Option two is a home rule petition.

1860
02:21:01,101 --> 02:21:05,164
[SPEAKER_11]: route, which leads to what is often referred to as a special act charter.

1861
02:21:05,705 --> 02:21:12,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Section eight of the home rule petition amendment provides that cities and towns may use a home rule petition to achieve change in the structure.

1862
02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:19,836
[SPEAKER_11]: The petition route was the only route available for cities and towns to make structural change prior to the passage of the amendment.

1863
02:21:20,416 --> 02:21:25,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Section eight does not provide detailed instructions regarding the preparation of a home rule petition charter.

1864
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:29,463
[SPEAKER_11]: A mayor or board of selectmen may appoint a study committee

1865
02:21:29,839 --> 02:21:34,420
[SPEAKER_11]: or such committees may be created by a city council or by a vote of a town meeting.

1866
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:44,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Such actions may set a timeline for such committees to report back to the appointing a body, but there is no statement requirement for a specific timeline.

1867
02:21:44,763 --> 02:21:48,124
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also no requirement for printing and distribution of any proposal.

1868
02:21:48,564 --> 02:21:58,307
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no public hearing requirements per se, although some study committees do provide a public forum for discussion of its recommendations in a town meeting or city council meetings.

1869
02:21:58,821 --> 02:22:01,522
[SPEAKER_11]: which such changes would be considered public meetings.

1870
02:22:01,922 --> 02:22:07,924
[SPEAKER_11]: In recent years, however, some study committees have used the CityTown website as publicized their recommendations.

1871
02:22:08,884 --> 02:22:11,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes on to say after completing their work and so forth.

1872
02:22:12,025 --> 02:22:23,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it also, Mr. President, just if I could, and I assume we're going to get this back from the city solicitor, it says periodic review of a charter by a charter review committee.

1873
02:22:23,969 --> 02:22:26,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Once a community has a charter, there's often a provision

1874
02:22:27,117 --> 02:22:29,578
[SPEAKER_11]: for the periodic appointment of a charter review committee.

1875
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:34,761
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee undertakes an examination to determine the charter's ongoing utility and accuracy.

1876
02:22:35,281 --> 02:22:40,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Such committees do not have the powers, duties, and responsibilities of an elected charter commission.

1877
02:22:41,245 --> 02:22:55,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Such committees are formed to review the charter and to make recommendations to its appointing body, example, Selectman City Council, regarding the need for additions, deletions, clarifications, or other amendments that would improve the charter.

1878
02:22:55,723 --> 02:22:58,264
[SPEAKER_11]: The term of such an advisory committee is usually one year.

1879
02:22:58,785 --> 02:23:04,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommendations of the committee may take the form of a proposal, special act, or a proposed charter amendment.

1880
02:23:05,108 --> 02:23:09,971
[SPEAKER_11]: But the local legislative body must act upon the recommendations before they take effect.

1881
02:23:10,691 --> 02:23:18,535
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee may also find, for example, that the charter's intent is clear, but related bylaws or ordinances may need clarification.

1882
02:23:19,015 --> 02:23:23,858
[SPEAKER_11]: The role of such committees can be important in ensuring that the charter is working as intended

1883
02:23:24,323 --> 02:23:30,447
[SPEAKER_11]: but the charter review committee has no assigned role in achieving any change beyond recommendation to the appointing body.

1884
02:23:31,047 --> 02:23:53,000
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I recall, uh, the discussion we had, um, the periodic review of the city charter by this creation, Mr. President of this charter review committee was the most expedient way of getting a community body to make recommendations to the council and the council having a public hearing and discussing and debating all the issues.

1885
02:23:53,866 --> 02:23:59,788
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could discuss this further, but I think that outlines the process that we as a body have.

1886
02:24:00,348 --> 02:24:03,770
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do have, you know, this information at our fingertips.

1887
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:08,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to more dialogue and discussion on this, Mr. President.

1888
02:24:08,791 --> 02:24:11,432
[SPEAKER_07]: The Vice President.

1889
02:24:11,813 --> 02:24:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor, do you happen to have a site on that?

1890
02:24:14,473 --> 02:24:15,594
[SPEAKER_05]: For which one?

1891
02:24:15,894 --> 02:24:17,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The document you just read off of.

1892
02:24:17,735 --> 02:24:20,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a website or some certain?

1893
02:24:23,434 --> 02:24:26,796
[SPEAKER_11]: The first option refers to Chapter 43B of the Mass General Laws.

1894
02:24:28,216 --> 02:24:37,741
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one refers to Section 8, which I assume is part of that 43B.

1895
02:24:39,301 --> 02:24:41,002
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't give a chapter, but it gives a section.

1896
02:24:41,783 --> 02:24:44,064
[SPEAKER_11]: And the periodic review is somewhere mixed in there.

1897
02:24:44,084 --> 02:24:45,244
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no site to that.

1898
02:24:45,504 --> 02:24:45,664
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1899
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Counselor.

1900
02:24:46,325 --> 02:24:46,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

1901
02:24:49,606 --> 02:24:50,446
[SPEAKER_07]: All set, Counselor Marks?

1902
02:24:50,547 --> 02:24:50,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1903
02:24:50,927 --> 02:24:51,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

1904
02:24:52,482 --> 02:24:53,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Pinto.

1905
02:24:54,303 --> 02:25:01,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, um, I'm going to apologize to you because, um, I think we've seen it and heard enough here tonight.

1906
02:25:02,526 --> 02:25:09,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand when you come out, you know what I'm going to ask you to do if you don't mind, would you just withdraw your motion and put it legitimately on the agenda for next week?

1907
02:25:09,708 --> 02:25:15,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that way there it's open and notorious and then everybody can discuss it because I think it can accomplish the same thing.

1908
02:25:15,951 --> 02:25:19,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, it's just such an important issue.

1909
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:21,781
[SPEAKER_08]: to have it come under suspension of the rules.

1910
02:25:21,801 --> 02:25:25,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think, can I, can I explain why I did what I did?

1911
02:25:27,984 --> 02:25:33,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I put it in so we can get an opinion back from the solicitor.

1912
02:25:33,888 --> 02:25:37,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore we could have a point of discussion.

1913
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:40,131
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an authoritative document before us.

1914
02:25:40,912 --> 02:25:48,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate that never my intention counselor to, uh, eliminate limit,

1915
02:25:49,285 --> 02:25:54,146
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, prevent or obstruct or obscure discussion on this.

1916
02:25:55,047 --> 02:26:03,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a beginning to get an opinion on how we go about this from the legal advisor to this council so we can begin the next steps.

1917
02:26:04,229 --> 02:26:05,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can appreciate that.

1918
02:26:05,149 --> 02:26:09,010
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it's such, it's, it's, it's the thing that makes this city run.

1919
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:13,892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's charter and you know, and if it was on the agenda, there'd be no, I'd have no problem with it.

1920
02:26:13,912 --> 02:26:17,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just, you know, it just reflects me back to the four to three vote.

1921
02:26:18,153 --> 02:26:18,893
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to understand,

1922
02:26:19,512 --> 02:26:21,072
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on one position, and I'm on another.

1923
02:26:21,392 --> 02:26:24,313
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we're on the same page as far as getting an opinion.

1924
02:26:24,373 --> 02:26:25,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm saying.

1925
02:26:25,873 --> 02:26:30,114
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't mind withdrawing it and just putting it on the agenda for next week, I would be more than happy with that.

1926
02:26:30,134 --> 02:26:30,814
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be OK.

1927
02:26:33,875 --> 02:26:39,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I see no reason why I can't say asking for an opinion and still having a discussion once we get there.

1928
02:26:39,415 --> 02:26:43,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because there are other people who were actively involved that might want to come and speak.

1929
02:26:43,376 --> 02:26:45,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want them to have an opportunity.

1930
02:26:45,297 --> 02:26:47,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Under suspension.

1931
02:26:47,417 --> 02:26:48,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Under suspension.

1932
02:26:49,094 --> 02:26:50,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not on the agenda, you know?

1933
02:26:50,395 --> 02:26:51,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still- I understand that.

1934
02:26:51,675 --> 02:26:57,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that because it came to mind over the long weekend and I wanted to just get a legal opinion.

1935
02:26:58,819 --> 02:27:04,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, but at the same time, Freddy, if I, if I laid it on the table and it wins, it sits there for another week.

1936
02:27:04,081 --> 02:27:07,443
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's on the agenda next week, it doesn't make any difference.

1937
02:27:07,483 --> 02:27:08,383
[SPEAKER_08]: At least it's open.

1938
02:27:08,423 --> 02:27:09,204
[SPEAKER_08]: People can see it.

1939
02:27:09,224 --> 02:27:11,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll withdraw it and place it on the agenda.

1940
02:27:11,765 --> 02:27:12,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1941
02:27:12,926 --> 02:27:13,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1942
02:27:13,506 --> 02:27:14,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

1943
02:27:14,526 --> 02:27:15,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion is withdrawn.

1944
02:27:22,501 --> 02:27:29,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question for you all.

1945
02:27:29,527 --> 02:27:47,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're aware of this, but I was driving down commercial street the other day and I noticed the catch basin contractor dumping the contents of their truck in one of the bays at the dpw yard where we formally leased the building over there.

1946
02:27:47,982 --> 02:27:49,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we're still under

1947
02:27:50,067 --> 02:27:52,848
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations, the rules and regulations of the lease, have we bought it out?

1948
02:27:53,388 --> 02:27:57,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, if that's listed as hazardous material, are we going to be responsible for that?

1949
02:27:58,331 --> 02:28:04,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know what the catch basis is of dirt and rocks and all kinds of garbage.

1950
02:28:04,253 --> 02:28:04,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the weekend.

1951
02:28:07,354 --> 02:28:08,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

1952
02:28:10,476 --> 02:28:14,317
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, no, I was just concerned because it's very unsightly.

1953
02:28:14,477 --> 02:28:15,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, thank you.

1954
02:28:17,308 --> 02:28:18,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It does smell bad.

1955
02:28:18,428 --> 02:28:20,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we still, are we still indebted to that?

1956
02:28:21,009 --> 02:28:25,069
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you.

1957
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:28,730
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of the May 19th meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

1958
02:28:28,770 --> 02:28:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, how would you find them?

1959
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:33,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the records, Mr. President, I find them to be in order, move approve.

1960
02:28:33,431 --> 02:28:36,471
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Marks for approval of the records, all those in favor?

1961
02:28:36,711 --> 02:28:36,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1962
02:28:37,131 --> 02:28:37,832
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1963
02:28:37,972 --> 02:28:41,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion, the records are approved.

1964
02:28:41,312 --> 02:28:42,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1965
02:28:42,292 --> 02:28:43,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1966
02:28:46,658 --> 02:28:47,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they remain on the table.

1967
02:28:48,039 --> 02:28:49,320
[SPEAKER_08]: One last thing, in all seriousness.

1968
02:28:50,341 --> 02:28:58,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my council colleagues to call me, because I am really impassioned about this issue regarding achata.

1969
02:28:58,388 --> 02:29:06,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to apologize to you, because I just was looking at you as being probably a naysayer back then.

1970
02:29:06,335 --> 02:29:08,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can understand where you're coming from now.

1971
02:29:08,677 --> 02:29:09,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with Councilor Camuso.

1972
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:11,740
[SPEAKER_08]: He was dead set against it, but that's beside the point.

1973
02:29:12,258 --> 02:29:19,623
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact of the matter is, you're the one that's standing up there, so I apologize, but I thank you for withdrawing, and I thank you for putting it on the agenda next week.

1974
02:29:19,803 --> 02:29:23,325
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, it's probably the most important thing that makes this city run, it's charter.

1975
02:29:24,826 --> 02:29:25,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Counselor.

1976
02:29:25,787 --> 02:29:26,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1977
02:29:26,387 --> 02:29:27,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Knight?

1978
02:29:27,688 --> 02:29:41,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I ask that when we adjourn, we adjourn in the memory of our deceased brothers and sisters from the Medford Police Department, Robert B. Corrado, Kenneth J. Hickey, Adrian L. Jean, Peter W. McGaffigan, Jr., Christopher E. Sano, Thomas J. Walsh, and Sheila Richard.

1979
02:29:41,469 --> 02:29:44,332
[SPEAKER_07]: and they will be remembered at mass when, councillor?

1980
02:29:44,612 --> 02:29:46,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday the 29th at 9 a.m.

1981
02:29:46,134 --> 02:29:47,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Immaculate Conception Church, Malden.

1982
02:29:48,096 --> 02:29:48,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1983
02:29:49,337 --> 02:29:50,818
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1984
02:29:51,019 --> 02:29:51,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1985
02:29:51,259 --> 02:29:51,940
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1986
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:55,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion is, the meeting is adjourned.
