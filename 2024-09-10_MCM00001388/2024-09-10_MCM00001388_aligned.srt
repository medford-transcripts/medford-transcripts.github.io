1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:00,731
Good evening all.

2
00:00:00,971 --> 00:00:04,193
This is the September meeting of the Medford Historical Commission.

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,074
I'm going to call the meeting to order at 7.02.

4
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:09,276
Read the governor's statement and we'll be off and running on our meeting.

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:20,141
On March 29, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31, 2025.

6
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:27,385
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public

7
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:33,990
body physically present at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

8
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:46,980
The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding the remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

9
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,763
So this meeting is being recorded by Community Development.

10
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,886
It's also being recorded by Medford Community Media.

11
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:56,088
So and of course you will be able to

12
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:03,457
get all of the information that we are seeing up on our website at www.medfordhistoricalcommission.org.

13
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:11,327
If you go to the news section, you can follow along with the appropriate MHC forms and information that we're reading.

14
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:18,524
All right, so first up on the docket is 18 Cherry Street determination of significance.

15
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:22,390
So we will be determining significance for three buildings tonight.

16
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,713
So I'm going to reiterate what that is.

17
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:25,354
It is a step.

18
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:31,201
the first step in the demolition delay review process.

19
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,042
There's two steps.

20
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:37,866
We determine whether or not the building is significant, and I'll go over the definition.

21
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:46,612
If it is, there's a public hearing component which gives the public a chance to chime in on if the demolition of the building is detrimental.

22
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:52,477
If it's significant and if it is detrimental, it invokes an 18-month, up to 18-month demolition delay.

23
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:56,720
If it is not significant or not preferably preserved as part of that

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,662
process, the demo permit is issued and the applicant is on their way.

25
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:21,250
So the commission will be determining whether or not these buildings are significant and by definition that is it is either listed or subject to a pending application for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, has been listed in the Massachusetts Historic Register of Places, or

26
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:51,849
was built within 75 years or older, which has been determined by the commission to be significant either because it is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the city or the Commonwealth, or it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period, style, method of building construction, or association with an important architect or a builder, either by itself or in the context of a group of buildings.

27
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,973
So commissioners, I sent around the MHC form B for Cherry Street.

28
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:04,279
I would like to welcome a motion to kickstart the conversation and we'll go from there.

29
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:12,806
I'll move to start the conversation.

30
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:21,673
Do you want to make a motion for significance or do you just want to open the conversation?

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,761
I just want to open the conversation.

32
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:26,123
I do have a question, Ryan.

33
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:28,005
This might be something that you can answer.

34
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:49,743
Under the architectural description for 18 Cherry, it says in the second paragraph, despite alterations, this is among the earliest buildings constructed in East Medford on the north side of Salem Street and serves as an important document of the neighborhood's

35
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,745
earliest phase of development.

36
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:57,929
Do you know how many houses in that neighborhood still remain?

37
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:03,613
Because I do understand that this building has gone under several additions, and it's changed quite a bit over time.

38
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:08,677
So this East Medford has some 900 pre-1900 buildings.

39
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:11,199
It's the largest amount of

40
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:18,577
buildings anywhere in the city of Medford.

41
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:26,543
I don't know what, how many of them are pre-1855.

42
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:35,270
I think it's more than half, so there's a huge concentration of that, but the

43
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:48,533
thing that I always go back to is that Neil Larson and Claire Dempsey and John Clemson always call our attention to the fact that pre-1875 buildings are rare in the city of Medford.

44
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:55,915
I mean, there's probably 2,000 pre-1900 buildings in the city of Medford, and of that, half of them, maybe 1,000, are pre-1855.

45
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:57,075
So there's only 12

46
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:07,625
or so 18th and 17th century buildings in total in the city.

47
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:15,728
So there's very, I would say, you know, maybe five or 600 total in the city.

48
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,349
So it's a small and getting smaller number.

49
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,230
Okay, thank you.

50
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,371
Okay, motion's been made to open discussion.

51
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:28,392
Do I have a second just so we can continue with the conversation?

52
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,873
I'll second.

53
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,749
Okay.

54
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,972
Let's see, Kit Nichols, second.

55
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:43,995
If there's no opposition, we'll start the discussion and the dialogue.

56
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:51,521
Landy, why don't you continue with your, why don't you, because you started with questions, so why don't you kickstart the discussion?

57
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:54,043
Okay, yeah.

58
00:05:54,123 --> 00:06:00,909
I mean, you know, I think the question for me is that now, I didn't know that there were so few pre, you know, 1875 buildings.

59
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:07,144
in Medford, but it has gone through a lot of change.

60
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:11,587
There have been a lot of additions.

61
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:14,249
I don't know.

62
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:17,191
I'd be open to hearing what the other commissioners have to say about this.

63
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,895
Ryan, if I could chime in here.

64
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:26,517
Can you give me a sense of what's being proposed for this project?

65
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:29,079
I'm just trying to understand that a little bit.

66
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,980
It might change how I'm thinking about it.

67
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:40,266
Yeah, I think it's schematic at this point, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was six townhouses, but I don't think there's any formal plans or anything at this point.

68
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:41,427
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:50,637
I mean, the question which arises for me is, I look at the application because of how terrible it gets.

70
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,344
And what does zoning permit there?

71
00:06:55,404 --> 00:07:14,258
I mean, this is all, you know, the building itself, and I think even the form being made clear, the hospital as it currently stands, you've got, you know, it's reported to be a two-family with parking for 13 and a substantial driveway space on the premises.

72
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,520
You know, what's permissible there?

73
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:19,889
I'm not sure.

74
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,211
Sid, I don't know if you've looked into it at all.

75
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:30,437
Most of this district is SF2, so you can do singles and duplexes.

76
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:33,660
You may be able to subdivide the lot there.

77
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,582
No, it's in SF1.

78
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,563
Hi, good evening, everyone.

79
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,164
Can I chime in?

80
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,285
Yeah, go ahead, Sid.

81
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,908
Yeah, so it's Aspermayer, Tony, whatever.

82
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:46,745
initial due diligence we did, it's a GR zone.

83
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:48,606
Oh, so it's general residence, okay.

84
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,427
Yeah, so two families are allowed.

85
00:07:51,348 --> 00:08:03,237
And right now there are two lots which are a little over 9,000, so the total lot is over 18,000 square feet.

86
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:10,683
So that's why we were saying that we could do, you know, two to two, you know, six units over there.

87
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:16,122
Also, again, I don't know, you have forms, so you might know that.

88
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:23,044
But when I was buying this thing, I mean, on public record and everything, it says 1920 built this building, you know.

89
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:26,245
So I don't know where 1800, I don't know.

90
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:30,206
I mean, on city SSR card or everywhere, it says 1920 built, you know.

91
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:41,274
Yeah, we tell people the city assessor's records are not the, you know, they're not the most accurate, but a lot of times it defaults to 1900.

92
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:49,079
And, you know, or it might have the date that they added water and sewer to it, depending on how late it is.

93
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:57,485
So it's definitely a 19th century building, at least the forward half, you know, the back half is a 20, clearly a 20th century addition.

94
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:00,747
Yeah, I mean, right now is just a single family.

95
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,048
And then there are

96
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,651
Tons of garages all around, and then there are tons of paving all around.

97
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:14,273
So that's what the existing property is right now.

98
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:20,195
When you talk about the two lots, are you talking about more land that's beyond those garages?

99
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,086
kind of what we see there.

100
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:30,292
No, so there are two lots, like an oversized lot, you know, like 9,000 plus.

101
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:34,976
So I don't have exact number, but if you add them, they are like over 18,000.

102
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:46,365
And in GR's zone district, if you get 6,000 square feet lot, you are allowed two units, you know, in each lot.

103
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:51,868
There is a, there is a site plan in the application.

104
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:55,849
Yeah, it looks like about the screen so we can see it.

105
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:59,771
If you don't mind just to get a sense of the diagram.

106
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,791
I know it's conceptual.

107
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:01,271
It's early.

108
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,892
Oh, there's no, it's just existing conditions.

109
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:04,993
If you just want that.

110
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:06,554
Oh, no, that's okay.

111
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,195
No, no, no plans.

112
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:11,677
And look, said this might be a question more for you than anyone else.

113
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,198
But are we saying that.

114
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:20,502
In the city of Medford, you can take any 2 lots side by side and combine them and be able to put 6 townhomes on them.

115
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:23,204
No, no, I'm not saying that I'm saying.

116
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:29,258
In a GR zone, a 6,000 square feet is the requirement, you know?

117
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:33,139
So if you got 6,000, I can do a two-family over there.

118
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,319
Just pull a apartment and go in.

119
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,340
I don't need to go through.

120
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,560
Yeah.

121
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:46,842
But you're combining two lots to get you... We're trying to... Over here, the initial... Right now, what my attorneys are doing, they're trying to divide it into three.

122
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:48,402
Three lots.

123
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,743
And they're doing an A&R for that.

124
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:58,797
We don't meet the lot with requirement, except everything else on that.

125
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:04,179
So, you said you haven't hired an architect yet or done anything in any detail?

126
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:08,241
No, not the architect yet, because we just closed on it.

127
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,302
And now we are just, yeah, I just closed like,

128
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,983
Let me give you my thoughts on this just based on what this conversation.

129
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:22,164
I personally don't think the property is significant.

130
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:33,687
I think it's worth documenting because this building does seem to cover quite a bit of the last 170 years in terms of its aggregation over time.

131
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:38,788
I personally don't think the building, in my mind, falls into significance.

132
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:50,023
I do think it's important that whatever goes here is at least sensitive to the scale and context of the neighborhood.

133
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,545
That's something that we don't really have any control over.

134
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:59,767
The city doesn't really have what I'd call a detailed process unless we put demo delay on it.

135
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,927
Then by default, we do have that.

136
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:12,856
I don't want to do that, but I do want to protect the neighborhood to a degree and make sure that whatever is designed there, and you haven't obviously designed it yet, so you can't tell us that.

137
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:26,387
But does it feels like it's not going to be a monster in the neighborhood, something that is reasonable and scalable and feels like it wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb to the neighborhood.

138
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,669
That would be my primary concern.

139
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:39,408
Sid, are you thinking these townhouses will be one side-by-side-by-side?

140
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,568
Are they connected in any way?

141
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:41,409
Are they all detached?

142
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:41,689
No.

143
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:49,011
They're going to be in two and two, so two, and then a U-shape, almost like a community.

144
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:52,713
For that, we need to go in front of the board.

145
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,804
So is there any way, because I can see on your existing plot plan, and if people want to pull it up, they can.

146
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:05,126
The existing house is already on a 6,000 square foot lot.

147
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:13,651
That leaves the remaining land, mainly the two garages, any chance you can find a way to just avoid the house altogether?

148
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:25,399
Because obviously, if somebody were just living in that house, and it seems like it's, I don't know how it's set up, but if the whole back half could certainly be demolished.

149
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:46,943
rebuild, build up, whatever, you know, if we could find a way to avoid that, you know, I'd be okay with just simply, you know, foregoing the rest of the design for the rest of the buildings there, you know, especially if you can find a way to creatively reuse that building, given it's already on a lot and, you know,

150
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:48,887
Something's already there.

151
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,169
But anyways, that's putting the cart before the horse.

152
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,371
That's just something to throw out to you for your thoughts.

153
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,573
Doug, anything else before I open it up to the rest of the commissioners?

154
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:01,995
No, I'll say thank you.

155
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:03,396
Who wants to be next?

156
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,338
All right, go ahead, Ed.

157
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:09,420
I guess I'm with Doug on this.

158
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,862
This house has gone through a lot.

159
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,983
It is, no one is arguing that the block is a district.

160
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:24,164
I just took another look at the, you know, took another look at the Google Maps images.

161
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:31,105
Clearly, older designs and some more designs in the block, but there is simply no consistency.

162
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:39,786
I could see documentation, and I understand that our authority is specious as to that if we find no significance.

163
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:43,007
But I can't say that

164
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:49,957
This is a lot it's on, and a lot is one unit.

165
00:14:50,797 --> 00:15:10,242
And with what's been done to it over the last at least 70, if not 120 years, that there's much, you know, the preservations really, this structure's made today.

166
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:13,618
Kit, you want to go next?

167
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:25,929
So I was really curious to hear what the other commissioners would have to say about this one, because I have to say, I mean, reading over the Form B, I'm persuaded that it's historically significant.

168
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,169
but in service of what?

169
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:43,658
I mean, there are, as has already been said, there are other buildings, not yet, I understand, a diminishing inventory, but other buildings from this era, it's on a huge lot.

170
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:51,343
And it's been so changed over the years that

171
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:59,352
Even if we found it historically significant, would anybody ever know that looking at it?

172
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,696
Right, right.

173
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:10,400
I mean, just because something significant doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be found preferably preserved.

174
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,681
We've had plenty of those cases.

175
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:21,948
We left it somewhat up to us, but also to the general public if there is enough care, you know, that they can certainly chime in right in.

176
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,096
influence, et cetera.

177
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:25,938
Peter?

178
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,740
Yeah.

179
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:43,372
I mean, I don't find the, even though it is old and it doesn't, but it doesn't exhibit its oldness, I guess, or its historical quality.

180
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:48,937
Cause it's been so altered and added onto and all the windows are been changed.

181
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:48,997
Um,

182
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:58,544
And I agree that the only significant part is sort of that front part, or the most aged part.

183
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,747
The other back part was done in the 60s supposedly.

184
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:14,859
So I guess that would be sort of my wish too, is if somehow that one little part of the building could somehow be saved as kind of like, I mean, if it works out.

185
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:23,878
to be somehow kind of set the tone or be incorporated within the new design.

186
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:24,858
You know what I'm saying?

187
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:31,879
But I don't see any value in keeping all these garages and asphalt.

188
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,920
In fact, they're kind of like detrimental.

189
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,422
And I think the need for housing in the city, you know, would merit it.

190
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:43,822
So, um,

191
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:49,942
I guess, you know, push comes to shove.

192
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:53,504
I don't think I would find it rising to the level preferably preserved.

193
00:17:53,544 --> 00:18:01,908
I mean, I think it is historically significant just because of its age and the fact that it's still there, but I don't know.

194
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:12,313
So I guess that'd be my wish, too, is to kind of like see if that part of the building could be kept somehow or acknowledged or, you know, I don't know.

195
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:19,373
Rebuilt at a different part of the site or something, but to try to keep the character of it.

196
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,557
I don't know I will I will say that

197
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:30,446
The shed row of garages here is particularly interesting.

198
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:41,713
You know how we had this discussion of like, okay, we don't care about garage block buildings or anything except for if something exceptional comes up?

199
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:48,618
I'm not advocating for preservation of them in any sense, but they certainly should be documented because this is probably the only one

200
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:53,341
Uh, like this in the entire city, that's this many garages.

201
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:57,304
Um, you know, there have been public auto houses that we've.

202
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:02,609
Reviewed, but there tend to be larger, more industrial buildings.

203
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:05,151
This is a more residential work scale.

204
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,432
So, um.

205
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:12,777
I, I think no matter what we do, we should certainly advocate for some level of documentation for this building.

206
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:20,918
If I can circle back, I just did a Google street view and went up and down the street on both sides.

207
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:26,880
This is actually the smallest building, I think, massing-wise on the street by far.

208
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,703
A townhouse properly designed like Sid's proposing, I actually think can be made to work.

209
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:38,225
I actually disagree with Peter a little bit here that I don't think

210
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:42,927
Saving that small massing is going to, I don't think it's going to fit well into the plans.

211
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:43,967
If I could just play it out.

212
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:51,811
In my mind, I think that would be a challenge and would would would kind of make that site really challenging to make work.

213
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:57,494
And I don't, I don't actually think it's important because I think that if you look across down the street, you know, there's a lot of.

214
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:02,656
two and three-story buildings that are bigger scale.

215
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:13,180
I think, again, a good design from sitting in his architect, whoever that is, and we have some good ones in Medford who do this kind of thing.

216
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:20,143
I think it can be made to work well to make the neighborhood not feel like it's being overwhelmed.

217
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:25,405
If every house in this neighborhood was this scale, I would disagree, but it's not.

218
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,106
They're all bigger than this.

219
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:31,900
You know, so I think there's an opportunity here to kind of bridge both worlds.

220
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:38,690
Yeah, I think I agree with Doug and that, you know, the.

221
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,696
The only sort of original feature of this building is.

222
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:48,345
the front end and it's just kind of the form, sort of like, you know, how it looks.

223
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:49,866
It's been stripped down.

224
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,307
There's, you know, new windows, new everything.

225
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:58,949
It's just kind of like just that little shape is sort of the last remaining historical detail.

226
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,551
But it is also kind of at a scale with the rest of the neighborhood.

227
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:12,875
So I don't know if like in the design process, there's a way that the architect can pay homage to the, you know, original shape of the older building somehow.

228
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:25,934
Um, so the, like, the impression is still there, but, you know, it is a very big lot and you can fit, you know, if you can fit six townhouses on it, I think that is, uh, um, something that Medford needs is more housing.

229
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:26,895
So, yeah.

230
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:28,976
Yeah.

231
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,578
I don't think it's really, uh, worth.

232
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,520
Yeah.

233
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:33,980
So.

234
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,783
Okay.

235
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:43,208
Uh, commissioners, you want to make a formal motion then, uh, for, or against significance?

236
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:46,857
I will move against it.

237
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:58,004
Before we do that, Ryan, I guess I would like to ask maybe Sid if he would, as an advisory role, bring whatever design he has before us.

238
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:00,006
I don't want to veto it.

239
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:06,670
I just want to give him some free advice from the various architectural experts on this.

240
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,451
We don't want to slow down the process.

241
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:08,851
I don't.

242
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:18,076
I don't think that's part of the motion, Ryan, but I think it can't be.

243
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:32,383
But I think I would like to just ask as a good faith effort to think about documentation, to think about bringing us just some early concept designs just to have us kick the tires and make sure that the neighborhood's going to be in a good shape.

244
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:34,668
Absolutely, Doug.

245
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:38,710
And I mean, this is not our first project and this is not the first time we are here.

246
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:52,198
Usually, you know, Yale was there and whenever, whether it's 69 Jerome or 75 truly, we have worked with you guys and we have done whatever more than what is needed, you know, like in 69 Jerome, whatever.

247
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:59,500
the design and we kept it all throughout the building over there and we will be.

248
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:07,744
The problem over here is that even though the lot is big, we still have to go in front of the zoning.

249
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:21,931
So whether they're going to allow that, the six townhouse, so right now we don't even know whether that or if they say no, we do like three lots and we are only allowed to do

250
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,773
to two families, so either are options.

251
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:37,603
We are not very clear yet, but once we know that direction, I'm happy to, you know, like whatever homage you guys are saying, you know, we'll definitely do that.

252
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:38,845
I mean, absolutely.

253
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:41,387
So you have to go before the ZBA anyway?

254
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:55,358
Yeah, if you're asking for six townhouses and the way we are asking it, like, because right now, if you divide the two laws, we can divide the two laws, but then we can only fit two, two, two, three, two families.

255
00:23:55,918 --> 00:24:09,561
But if we want two townhouses, and then the way I prefer, so that you can enter in between, and then you have two townhouses each side, and then you have one, two in the front.

256
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,635
Something like that, we have to go in front of the board for a variance.

257
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:16,996
OK.

258
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:21,880
OK.

259
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,102
Ed made a motion against significance.

260
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:26,904
Second.

261
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:30,047
Second.

262
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,909
OK, a little round roll call vote.

263
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:33,870
Kit?

264
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,074
A vote for against significance.

265
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,683
So that's a yes vote.

266
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:42,243
Eleni?

267
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,604
Yes for or against significance.

268
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:46,244
Ed?

269
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:48,865
Yes, no significance.

270
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:49,726
Peter?

271
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:50,666
Yes.

272
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:51,646
Doug?

273
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:52,447
Yes.

274
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:55,128
Five, zero, approved.

275
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:59,369
Okay, we'll get your letter, Sid, and keep us in the loop.

276
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,190
Sure, thank you.

277
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,171
Thank you, Sid.

278
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:08,453
Next up, Ian.

279
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,133
Oh, I got one more.

280
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:11,287
106 Alexander.

281
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:18,270
Commissioners, I sent out the MHC form B. We need to receive a demo application and determine significance.

282
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,851
I'll take a motion to receive the demo application as complete.

283
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,574
I will move to accept the demo application as complete.

284
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:28,815
And a second?

285
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:31,716
Second.

286
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:34,857
OK.

287
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:36,698
Motion's been made and seconded.

288
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:38,039
I'll do a roll call vote, Kit.

289
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:50,845
Yes, Lenny, yes, and yes, Peter, yes, yes, yes, OK, 6, 0.

290
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,612
Shall we kick start the discussion?

291
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,294
Is it 5-0 or 6-0?

292
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:03,876
I guess you can do 5-0.

293
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:04,876
I don't have to vote.

294
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:05,957
OK.

295
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:07,118
Whatever.

296
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:08,800
Normally.

297
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:14,827
commissioners, you want to kickstart the discussion on this property?

298
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:23,310
Okay, I will keep my motion as to not significant.

299
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,510
And a second.

300
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:31,292
Second.

301
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:36,034
All right, Ed, if you want to start discussion.

302
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:39,995
I mean, I did not get a

303
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:46,054
detailed chance to look at the B. I saw the form, I saw the pictures, and I know the block.

304
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:53,795
And in my view, we're not dealing with the House, which looks like it's going to need strong commentations of it.

305
00:26:54,196 --> 00:27:05,658
And it's in a block where, other than the social history of, again, working in these houses in Medford in the 20s, there's really not much to say.

306
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:07,318
I just don't see it.

307
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:10,733
Thanks, Doug.

308
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,976
Yeah, I'm agreeing with that.

309
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,057
I don't see a lot here.

310
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:17,618
There's been a lot of alterations.

311
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:24,363
The building itself is, I think of some of the 1930s buildings that we have found significant, Ryan, over the years.

312
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:28,046
And they haven't been many, but they've usually been gems.

313
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:33,790
And this is just clearly not one of those for, I think, obvious reasons when you look at the form.

314
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:40,096
And Peter.

315
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:43,558
Uh, yeah, I, I agree with that.

316
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,419
I, I don't have much more to add.

317
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:52,282
Nothing.

318
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:54,124
Sorry.

319
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:54,384
No.

320
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:58,086
I mean, I think everybody said it like we've got a million of these.

321
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:01,208
Yeah.

322
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:02,388
I agree.

323
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:02,708
Yes.

324
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,590
It's just, yeah, there's nothing significant there.

325
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,142
Okay, said anything to add on this one?

326
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:12,305
Nope, I'll go with everybody else.

327
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:16,749
Okay, most have been made and seconded.

328
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,851
I will call the roll call vote.

329
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:19,311
Kit?

330
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:22,754
Yes.

331
00:28:23,675 --> 00:28:24,175
And Eleni?

332
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:25,056
Yes.

333
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:26,557
And Ed?

334
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:28,359
Yes.

335
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,421
Okay, Peter?

336
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:31,342
Yes.

337
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:32,533
And Todd?

338
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:33,254
Yes.

339
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:35,215
5-0 approved.

340
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,217
All right, Sid, I'll get you your other letter out, and we'll be good.

341
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:40,699
Yeah, thank you, everybody.

342
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:42,460
But just one off-topic thing.

343
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,342
56 Wareham, I know it's not on the agenda.

344
00:28:46,382 --> 00:29:00,151
Last time we sent the, you know, iterations and suggestions, and not this meeting, last meeting when Yale was there, it was like it was okayed that that was a thing.

345
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:14,159
Yeah, I think the only thing we were waiting for is to see if Yale can pull back the size of the addition back towards the forward massing of the house.

346
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,861
So it doesn't look so much like the additions eating the house.

347
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,663
That's the only thing.

348
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:24,027
I'm pretty certain she can do it because there's a dividing wall between the

349
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:31,133
If I looked at the floor plans the last time, like, the master suite was there, and then there was some additional height in the back.

350
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:34,896
I'll send her an email tonight.

351
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:40,520
Yeah, just if you could send so we can... And then you guys can do it, and then we'll get it to the subcommittee and approve it.

352
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,942
I think there was some tentative okay for that.

353
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:43,522
Yeah.

354
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:44,563
Yeah.

355
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:45,223
Okay.

356
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:45,804
All right.

357
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:46,764
Thank you, guys.

358
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:47,465
Thanks.

359
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:47,765
Good night.

360
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:48,766
Good night.

361
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:49,486
Night.

362
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:51,208
Okay.

363
00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:55,088
Next up on the agenda, 110 Brooks.

364
00:29:56,428 --> 00:30:03,250
Same deal, we need to receive the application as complete and review the MHC form B for significance.

365
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:08,972
I'll take a motion for receiving the application.

366
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:12,453
Motion to receive the application.

367
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:14,894
Second.

368
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:20,756
OK, we'll go around for completeness.

369
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:23,618
Yes.

370
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:24,538
Lenny?

371
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:28,300
Yes.

372
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,340
Ed?

373
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,160
Yes, that's the form.

374
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:31,861
Peter?

375
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:32,781
Yes.

376
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:33,581
Doug?

377
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:34,421
Yes.

378
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:35,422
Great.

379
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:36,522
5-0.

380
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:38,183
We're approved.

381
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:39,883
All right.

382
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:52,127
Commissioners, I sent out the MHC form B. If you want to kickstart the discussion, I'll take a motion to find for significance or against.

383
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,591
Doug, you want to make the motion?

384
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:13,835
I'm kind of cramming here looking at the drawing, sorry.

385
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,516
Oh, it's just a kickstart discussion.

386
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:22,400
You know, I will move to find a significant just on yes, significant.

387
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,642
Ed West moves for significance.

388
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:27,563
And a second?

389
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,204
I'll second.

390
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:30,425
Okay.

391
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:37,336
just so you guys know, you can change your vote just because your motion for something doesn't mean you have to vote for it.

392
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,096
Well, I understand that.

393
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:47,538
I'm just making sure everybody understands that, you know, you can, you can say one thing, but you can turn around and do another or be convinced otherwise.

394
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:48,379
All right.

395
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,699
Motion's been made and seconded.

396
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,639
So why don't we start with Ed?

397
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:57,141
I would say I would like to hear from the architects on this.

398
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,181
It is an interesting design.

399
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:08,985
It looks like the form has survived a good deal of on and off over the years.

400
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:17,289
I think the form being made clear that as we're looking at it now, we're looking at it without the siding, which had been there for years, which is evident in these pictures.

401
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,353
So I think it's interesting whether it's compelling is what I'm willing to listen to on both sides.

402
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:29,808
And Oleni?

403
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:32,289
Yeah.

404
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,894
I do think, again, it's stripped down.

405
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:47,101
But I do think a lot of the original form and through the window openings still reflect its original design.

406
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:54,727
And it looks like in the plans that the applicant is essentially keeping the structure as is.

407
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,549
It's just putting new siding, new windows.

408
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,621
uh, but it's, it's going to retain its same form and sort of, um, overall design.

409
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:20,964
Um, but yeah, I mean, I think that it is interesting and it could, um, I think with, you know, a little, uh, TLC, um, can bring it back to life while still kind of maintaining that sort of like original historical quality.

410
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:25,465
Great.

411
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:26,385
Uh, Peter.

412
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:31,950
Yeah, I kind of concur with Eleni on this one.

413
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,832
I mean, we've had similar projects to this.

414
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:48,077
The one on Grove Street, this one reminds me a lot of the one on Grove Street where it was kind of re-skinned.

415
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:57,647
all new siding, and all new windows, et cetera.

416
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:10,372
But also, we were able to influence that design to keep some of the nice elements that might have been lost, such as the stone foundation of the porch and stuff.

417
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:11,793
I'm talking about Grove Street now.

418
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:14,114
But it's a similar form of a house.

419
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,355
And this one has the nice columns.

420
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:24,661
and you know the window patterns and stuff so um I feel like

421
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:29,597
If that one was worthy of significance, then I feel like this one was.

422
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:41,983
Also, on the form B, again, it's due to, you know, the box is checked for recommended for listing in the National Register.

423
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:48,945
Although, as with a lot of these, it's, you know, because it would contribute to a future historic district.

424
00:34:51,363 --> 00:35:00,666
And, um, I believe there was, uh, somewhat of a significant architect on this one or builder guy, Aaron Gould.

425
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:08,868
Um, so I think it has all those things going for it that, you know, the other projects we'd looked at tonight didn't really have.

426
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:14,830
So I think I'd be in favor of at least going for significance on this one.

427
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:18,911
Great kit.

428
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,377
Yeah, I agree it's significant.

429
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:30,387
I guess my question was looking back at the application for demolition, what more is going to be done that hasn't already been done?

430
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:37,478
because it's removal of all interior and exterior finishes to exposed framing.

431
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,319
That's been done.

432
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:49,461
Yeah, to clarify, the building department let this slide by and this should not have gone to full demolition permits.

433
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:59,243
So we are implementing a process to prevent the disconnect of interior demolition and then later exterior demolition because it's a

434
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:05,705
way that applicants, not these applicants, but other applicants have been trying to circumvent the process.

435
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:17,990
So I would just make sure that and just know that the building department is working to correct the issue and we're working together on the issue and that something like this shouldn't happen again where it just kind of accidentally slips through the cracks.

436
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:26,251
But, you know, the bottom line is that in terms of administration, there's been some back and forth.

437
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:34,859
And KP has said that we have, we as a commission have the right to interpret the bylaw as we see fit.

438
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,543
And it's not up to the building department, it's up to the building department to help us enforce it.

439
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,445
And they have the right to enforce it.

440
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:44,549
And in this instance, you know, this would have been a reviewable project right from the get go.

441
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:48,798
OK, that's actually really helpful context.

442
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,180
So I'll just stick with historically significant.

443
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:57,482
Doug, anything to add?

444
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:04,806
I'm kind of with Peter on this and that it feels a lot like that grocery house to me scale wise and quality wise.

445
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:16,155
You know, if the city made an error, and no one's perfect I don't want to, you know, the city has been really improved its process in the last couple years and work with us I don't want to.

446
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:19,746
you know, say anything negative.

447
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:34,220
I just, you know, I just also don't want to penalize the owners for, you know, for following a process that perhaps wasn't clear or that was sidetracked by no actions of their own, if that's an accurate statement, right.

448
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,011
Yeah, no, they didn't do anything wrong.

449
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:51,702
And, you know, it's difficult sometimes because, you know, sometimes you have to open up and it economically just makes sense to go through and demo everything all at once so that you have a clear and consistent picture, as you know.

450
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:56,186
But also there's a line because you're losing

451
00:37:56,966 --> 00:38:03,171
if we go through and document the building, you're losing any and all evidence that we would normally capture as part of this process.

452
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:08,535
So a lot of times it does tell us phasing and how much the building has changed.

453
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:12,298
And sometimes you'll find that many of the interiors are intact.

454
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:20,505
And, you know, although our purview, we keep to the primarily to the exterior, you know, sometimes it's worthy to maintain all of it.

455
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:21,305
So.

456
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:23,987
Right.

457
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:24,288
But we

458
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:32,384
given where we are, I mean, aren't we really just looking at, at potential design review, design advisory at this point?

459
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,665
Cause that's, I mean, we can't undo what's been done.

460
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:35,746
Right.

461
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:36,587
Yeah.

462
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:54,160
I mean, I mean, in fairness from the other side, you know, had living in a house, which went through this process long before there was a condition, you know, exterior, you're calling exterior cladding demolition in this case, probably appropriately only because

463
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:58,965
of what had been done to the house in prior periods.

464
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:11,432
But again, I've been, you know, I've replaced planting in my house at least once, but with identical, I hope identical, identical materials of contemporary, those that contemporaneously avail.

465
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:14,273
You know, is that demolition or not?

466
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:19,036
I'm just paused a bit, but I think, you know, this is worthy of what, you know,

467
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:25,271
this, you know, even if it's just dealing with the planning issue, I think it's worthy of our keeping.

468
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,193
Ed, do you mind turning up your volume?

469
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,155
I'm having a little trouble hearing you.

470
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:32,255
No, okay.

471
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:48,585
I don't know if I can get, yeah, it was just, again, it just seemed to me from the application, understanding that we have no, strictly speaking, no jurisdiction over interior renovations, that what was being done mostly was

472
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,926
you're probably improving existing platting, and you're calling that demolition.

473
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:04,136
Yeah, I mean, historically, we have looked at all portions of it.

474
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:13,663
Yes, I think the predominant thing that we look at is the exterior, but I don't think that we care so much about the interior.

475
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:16,545
We understand that these buildings are not museums.

476
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:27,733
But I think in terms of reviewable demolition, sometimes the interior demolition, even though we're not reviewing it, it does trigger the demo review process.

477
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:55,914
So, but yeah, in this case, I think it's mainly just, you know, if we go through the process, I, I treat this just like we would, you know, the property on Forest Street that it, you know, we're looking at significance as if it were starting the process fresh so that we're not penalizing anybody and is the building significant and then go from there for preferably preserved if it is significant.

478
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:58,495
That's, that's how I take this process.

479
00:40:59,756 --> 00:40:59,876
So.

480
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:09,678
I, I agree, but I feel like we should do everything in our power to accelerate it just so that it's we're, we're being fair.

481
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:10,538
Yeah.

482
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:19,021
Yeah, and we just so you know, we have no desire to hold this project up.

483
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:28,327
That's, it's just that, you know, that's whatever, for whatever reason, this got, you know, we should have had review from this from the get go.

484
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:30,508
And it kind of slipped through the cracks.

485
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:36,912
So, you know, we're interested in trying to expedite it and move it along as quickly as possible.

486
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:38,113
I guess.

487
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:47,892
For myself, I don't want to speak for any other commissioners, but I just don't want to if there's some good bits on the building that it would be nice to save.

488
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:53,333
I mean, it would be nice to save those if we could just.

489
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,234
I guess that'd be my preference.

490
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:07,757
Yeah, let's get through the determination of significance that we can discuss what the next steps are.

491
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:08,137
How's that?

492
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:09,291
Sounds good.

493
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,712
That sounds good.

494
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:12,792
Circling back.

495
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:16,654
Did I get to everybody right?

496
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,554
There's no additional commissioner comments.

497
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:25,737
Ed made the motion for significance with Eleni seconded.

498
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:27,977
I'll go around roll call vote.

499
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:33,579
So a yes is for significance and a no is for no significance in this case.

500
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:34,100
Kit?

501
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,100
Yes.

502
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:37,247
And Eleni?

503
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:38,108
Yes.

504
00:42:38,948 --> 00:42:39,288
And Ed?

505
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:41,349
Yes, significantly.

506
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:42,229
Peter?

507
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:42,949
Yes.

508
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:44,010
And Doug?

509
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:44,810
Yes.

510
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:45,790
Okay.

511
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,271
So it's 5-0 pass.

512
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:54,613
So what we will do is we will have the legal ad ready to roll.

513
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:58,655
So because of the holiday next month, we actually meet earlier than we would.

514
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:01,136
So there will be a public hearing on October 7th.

515
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:17,132
But I would suggest that we can send the proposed design perhaps to the subcommittee for any sort of preliminary comments that can be brought up during the normal process of the hearing for the public hearing.

516
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:36,336
so and there's also a sign requirement i would be more concerned with the legal ad because the deadline for the paper is in two days so we will get you that legal ad tomorrow and if you get us the check down at city hall it'll get published in the paper and there'll be absolutely no delay otherwise it's off until the end of october otherwise so

517
00:43:37,797 --> 00:43:44,040
We're trying to expedite, so we will get you the legal ad tonight so that you can get that in the paper.

518
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:56,066
You have 48 hours, so that's plenty of time, I'm sure, to get down to City Hall and drop off the check for the legal ad, and we take care of the rest of that portion.

519
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,688
Then there's a sign requirement, but the sign has a looser deadline.

520
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:05,651
I'm sorry, not to interject, but what exactly is the legal ad?

521
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:16,448
We will send you a notice for the public hearing on October 7th, and it has to go in the newspaper.

522
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:24,936
So all you have to do for that is to bring this down to City Hall to Dennis McDougall, a check, and I will send you the dollar amount for what it is.

523
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:26,298
I don't have it off the top of my head.

524
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:36,660
If you can, and if you get it to me in the next 48 hours, that's the deadline for the paper for the October 7th meeting.

525
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:36,720
So.

526
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:48,744
All right, at some point, would I be able to speak about.

527
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:52,565
You know, coming at this from the as the owner of the property.

528
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,828
I'm certainly happy to have comments.

529
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:24,328
I was going to say normally we take them at the public hearing and kickstart off the October 7th hearing with your comments, but we're happy to take them now so that we can also, what we were going to do is send the design drawings that you guys had proposed to our subcommittee and get some initial feedback ready and prepared for that hearing in case there were any potential changes that the commission would like to see.

530
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:28,150
So I don't think there will be many but you know.

531
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,971
Yeah, okay.

532
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:34,952
So my name is Adriana Cardenas.

533
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:37,232
I'm the owner of the property.

534
00:45:37,712 --> 00:45:44,914
My husband and I purchased the property last fall and it has been definitely a ride the past year trying to get to this point.

535
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:53,437
We bought it with the hopes of fully renovating it into our forever home for our family including our five-year-old daughter.

536
00:45:55,076 --> 00:45:56,798
My background is in architecture.

537
00:45:56,818 --> 00:46:01,141
I have a degree in architecture as well as a minor in art and architectural history.

538
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:18,917
So upon purchasing this home, I at first glance fell in love with its architectural character and style and have always maintained my position in trying to restore it to its original architectural character as best as possible.

539
00:46:20,355 --> 00:46:25,338
There have been obvious, you know, slight changes to the, you know, to the design.

540
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:32,020
But overall, I really tried to, you know, achieve the architectural style design with the renovation.

541
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:39,024
What the pictures don't show is that the house was in a serious state of disrepair.

542
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:46,467
And for structural issues and whatnot, we've had to make different, you know, concessions of what we can afford.

543
00:46:47,360 --> 00:47:03,134
Um, and, you know, there's been a lot of concessions, but also we're dealing with a huge issue in the backyard as well with Japanese knotweed and it has become a $300,000 additional investment that we were initially planning on.

544
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:08,818
So there's been a lot of little extra expenses here that have been coming about for us.

545
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:09,299
Um,

546
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:11,673
We are not developers.

547
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,874
We've become friends with the, you know, community.

548
00:47:15,074 --> 00:47:17,235
Everyone's really excited for us to move here.

549
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:33,101
But as I've explained to the building department, upon learning that we were going to be put on hold until this delay, and unfortunately we were not told in time to go to the last meeting, so here I am today, we're going into a financial hardship at this point.

550
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:38,763
So it is, you know, we do request as quick as possible the decision, if that's October 7th,

551
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:44,327
You know, that's what we'll have to do, but we are severely under the gun here.

552
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:57,971
So I'm just trying to understand the steps that are going to entail, because every moment we wait is less likely that we will be able to afford and see the project through.

553
00:47:58,851 --> 00:48:07,033
And I would like to think that the front of the house, again, does reflect the original architectural style to most of the degree.

554
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:13,829
The rear of the house, as you can see from the photos, that was not original to the design.

555
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:31,092
That was an addition made in 1978, which was structurally falling off of the house when we purchased it, and so that had to be removed, which is why the back of the house, that is not historically significant, I would imagine, or it isn't 1978.

556
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:36,753
Now, I've never done the historic review process before,

557
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:44,694
So what I'm hearing now is that, you know, there's going to be this legal ad and I'm going to familiarize myself after our meeting.

558
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:49,780
But does this mean that we're going to have to get a determination?

559
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:53,752
on October 7th and then wait or how does this work?

560
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:54,333
I mean.

561
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:55,693
So where?

562
00:48:56,714 --> 00:49:00,176
So so any building so two step process.

563
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:02,217
So we just did the determination of significance.

564
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:07,499
Any building that's determined significant gets a public hearing.

565
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:11,501
It's the affords the public the opportunity to chime in.

566
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:12,421
That's you.

567
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:13,542
That's your neighbors.

568
00:49:14,442 --> 00:49:15,643
That's anybody interested in

569
00:49:15,943 --> 00:49:23,859
in buildings and what goes on in the city of Medford to chime in on if the demolition is detrimental to the cultural resources of the city of Medford.

570
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,724
And that's where the commissioners weigh.

571
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:35,173
the pros and cons of this project and whether or not it's preferably preserved.

572
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:56,767
And if a building is preferably preserved, it invokes an up to 18 month demo delay, during which time we would try to come to a resolution that would mitigate the demolition, meaning that we would find a design alternative that would work together with both sides of the table here and come together on a design that

573
00:49:56,967 --> 00:50:04,690
that is suitable for this building or, you know, or if we say it's not preferably preserved, then you get your permit.

574
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:09,112
So our goal is to sort of expedite that process.

575
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:18,337
I think we're taking some of our comments that we may have in that meeting, and we may normally would have included with a subcommittee and do that over the next,

576
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:23,038
what 20 or so days that we have between the next two meetings.

577
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,719
Because we're meeting earlier than we normally would.

578
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:47,146
So we will work to expedite that process and just to save you time so that we can finalize things immediately after that hearing, whether it's advisory or actual stuff that we would work into a demo delay.

579
00:50:49,785 --> 00:51:02,060
And so if you read through the packet that we provided you that you guys filled out, it has our entire timeline on there and it explains the process in great depth so that you guys know where you are.

580
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,684
Our goal is to not wait you out 18 months.

581
00:51:05,744 --> 00:51:07,907
Our goal is to get you off and running.

582
00:51:08,808 --> 00:51:22,793
in some way shape or form uh at the latest probably you know a few weeks after the October 7th meeting at the latest but you know it could be that the building's not preferably preserved and you get your permit on October 8th.

583
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,975
So that would be the goal.

584
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:37,219
Now the fact that the house is already demolished is what's making me very concerned is the fact that at what point like you know it's already been demoed fully demoed um

585
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,496
So how does that play into it?

586
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:45,179
Because in my experience, usually that happens prior to demolition.

587
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:46,960
Yeah, normally we don't face that issue.

588
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:52,524
So I think the commissioners will certainly take that into whether or not the building is preferably preserved, right?

589
00:51:52,604 --> 00:51:54,746
So that's, you know, is the frame.

590
00:51:56,144 --> 00:52:03,994
You know, enough of a storyteller to explain the history of the building, or is the benefit the design project that you guys are doing?

591
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,377
That's 1 of the things that they're going to weigh at that meeting.

592
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:06,877
Right guys.

593
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,902
I think you guys can chime in and say, that's certainly something that will be weighed.

594
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:15,007
It's certainly something that we have weighed before we have had cases where.

595
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:23,212
Certain people have gone above and beyond the initial scope of work because either buildings were rotten or stuff like that.

596
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:25,813
It happens, things change.

597
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:31,997
So we just want to move your project along through this process.

598
00:52:32,077 --> 00:52:41,002
It's just a process that we have to uphold to be fair to everybody, not just you guys.

599
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:44,344
I understand there's a hardship, but we would undertake this same

600
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:52,287
Review, whether it's you or a developer or somebody else that's coming before us, like the developers that were here.

601
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:52,747
So.

602
00:52:54,228 --> 00:52:57,670
We, we treat everybody equally on the same playing field.

603
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:57,730
No.

604
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,191
I completely understand this.

605
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:03,052
This is, as you can imagine, it's just quite a surprise for us.

606
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:08,355
We were ready for building permits issued on the 1st, and we didn't understand what the delay was.

607
00:53:08,595 --> 00:53:09,716
And here we are.

608
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:09,936
So.

609
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:19,135
I respect the Historic Preservation Commission and the interest in preserving these homes.

610
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:28,478
I just obviously am stuck in a hard spot, as you can imagine, being the owner and designer, everything trying to get into it.

611
00:53:28,818 --> 00:53:30,159
All right.

612
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,979
Thank you.

613
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:32,699
Thank you.

614
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:34,200
Let me ask a question.

615
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,721
This is one building permit that's covering interior and exterior, right?

616
00:53:39,141 --> 00:53:39,781
I believe it was.

617
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:40,602
The building permit?

618
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:41,262
Yes.

619
00:53:44,213 --> 00:53:51,478
Since we have no authority over the interior, why couldn't the interior portion be a partial permit awarded by the city right now?

620
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:54,320
Since we're only talking about the exterior, right?

621
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:01,886
That is the exact, that is the exact, I mean, we can ask the building department, but it is exactly the type of conflict that we're trying to avoid.

622
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:02,566
I mean,

623
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:12,214
They can, I mean, I don't see why they couldn't separate it, but also the, the interior, you know, other than the.

624
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:17,618
The framing, I mean, impact what they're doing to the building impacts the exterior.

625
00:54:17,698 --> 00:54:26,223
There are not a lot of changes to the exterior, but I mean, they still got to put in and what happens if things change because of minor discrepancies, little things like that.

626
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:26,763
Right.

627
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:27,104
So.

628
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,402
And yes, that good separation of permit is the exact type of thing that we're trying to avoid.

629
00:54:33,742 --> 00:54:43,288
Leading up to, I mean, after the fact, after it's gone through the review, certainly if we're reviewing, there's no reason why they couldn't, you know, the building department couldn't pull it, but it is a process, right?

630
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:53,515
Because they have to reestablish a new permit and withdraw their existing one, which is something that they don't wanna do because then it also has to go through all the boards and commissions again, so.

631
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:02,189
So, any other questions?

632
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:05,110
You know, you're welcome to email us.

633
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,731
Jen and I are always on the, you know, generally at the email.

634
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,431
So, we're happy to answer any questions between now and then.

635
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:19,494
And I will confer with Jen on this project and make sure that we get you the legal ad and a clear explanation as to what the next steps are.

636
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:22,474
So, that will go out in an email tonight.

637
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:24,935
Okay?

638
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:25,235
Okay.

639
00:55:26,316 --> 00:55:26,456
Yep.

640
00:55:26,516 --> 00:55:26,696
Great.

641
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,076
Thank you.

642
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:27,776
Thank you.

643
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,030
All right.

644
00:55:30,551 --> 00:55:34,394
I'm going to let, so that concludes that.

645
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:36,255
So let's see what's next on the agenda.

646
00:55:36,315 --> 00:55:37,516
Salem Street Burying Ground.

647
00:55:37,556 --> 00:55:39,257
So I'm going to let Jen in because Jen's here.

648
00:55:39,277 --> 00:55:48,864
Hi, Jen.

649
00:55:59,003 --> 00:55:59,944
We'll wait for you to connect.

650
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:04,349
You're muted.

651
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:08,534
Hi, sorry.

652
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:09,775
No, that's okay.

653
00:56:11,897 --> 00:56:14,100
You want to take over the meeting?

654
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,842
No, you can keep going.

655
00:56:15,862 --> 00:56:17,524
Okay.

656
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,445
I don't know where you're at.

657
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,558
We're going to talk about Salem Street Burying Ground.

658
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:32,169
We got an email from Veronica and Dean Morris and the cemetery trustees.

659
00:56:32,249 --> 00:56:37,675
They want to replace the aging flagpole in Salem Street Burying Ground.

660
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:39,797
The proposed

661
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:44,642
The proposal was originally to replace it at the same location.

662
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:46,884
The base is somewhat deteriorated.

663
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:56,534
So, as a result, asking them to pay special attention to maybe designing something that's a little bit more in a better location.

664
00:56:58,337 --> 00:57:15,698
It's a 35 foot flagpole, which is, I think, a little tall for that location, but I don't know it's hard to tell because, because of the trees on the site, I don't know what's currently there now I think it's like a little 15 foot flagpole so I'm not sure why so but the bottom line is.

665
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:36,632
both I think D and I agree that we've asked the city to hire an archaeologist to monitor any sort of excavation that's there given the age of the cemetery and given that we don't know where burials are in that location and what sort of subsurface remains underneath the existing flagpole.

666
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:43,916
So we're just waiting on them to go forward with that or not and see what the next steps are.

667
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:46,879
That's the only update that I have on that.

668
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,167
Medford Historical Society.

669
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:58,274
Jen, you had met with the members of the Historical Society?

670
00:57:58,414 --> 00:57:59,296
This is a reminder.

671
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:17,312
Yeah, I had a meeting a little more than a month ago now with Meg Bowen from the Historical Society, and she had reached out to me to talk about partnering with us more on their events and their programming that's going to be happening.

672
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:22,374
really looking at next year because they're putting their calendar together.

673
00:58:22,394 --> 00:58:39,278
Of course, I said we would love to partner where it's appropriate and however we can help them both bolster traffic to events, help support them online with social media reach out, emails to our list.

674
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:45,081
We didn't really talk about any specific programming.

675
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:48,244
Actually, no, I lied.

676
00:58:48,604 --> 00:58:49,945
She did bring up something.

677
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:52,347
The house program?

678
00:58:53,528 --> 00:58:53,909
Yes.

679
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:54,689
You know what?

680
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:55,130
Hold on.

681
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,673
Let me I know exactly where this piece of paper is that I need to refer to.

682
00:58:58,733 --> 00:58:59,693
So give me one second.

683
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:00,554
I will be right back.

684
00:59:00,594 --> 00:59:03,677
I want to go grab it because I would like to make sure I have the right info.

685
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:04,850
Okay, that's fine.

686
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:07,633
I'm going to circle right around and related to this Doug.

687
00:59:07,953 --> 00:59:13,559
Have you heard of anything from the discussion on Sarah Bradley Fulton?

688
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:15,501
Because that's sort of.

689
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:18,524
No, other than there was.

690
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:20,847
I don't know a minor.

691
00:59:22,232 --> 00:59:29,560
Kerfuffle was doing a few parties there, but about a grant getting some money, I believe, from the state supporting it.

692
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:30,602
I don't know.

693
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:34,987
I never heard a resolution for many of that from the various parties.

694
00:59:35,027 --> 00:59:38,651
I was just copying a few emails, and then all the activity just stopped.

695
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:40,233
I don't know where it ended.

696
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:47,878
Maybe we should see where, if you would maybe reach out to Laura and see where things are.

697
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:50,101
I'd be curious.

698
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:58,932
I do know, because I was asked by Teresa, if it made sense to put some money towards.

699
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:11,901
you know, Medford's Revolutionary War stories, Isaac Hall, Sarah Bradley Fulton, and maybe doing some digging, deeper digging on those individuals.

700
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:15,523
And I think that's a great idea, certainly worthy.

701
01:00:15,623 --> 01:00:24,928
So I had them, had her reach out to John Bell, who's a very well known and respected Revolutionary War historian in the Boston area.

702
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:28,971
So I think he's, might be interested in helping with that.

703
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:34,860
So yeah, sorry to circle back.

704
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:47,455
So the Historical Society is planning an event on December 3rd that is called Deep Time, the Early Archaeology of Medford and Greater Boston.

705
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:52,420
And Ryan Suanna Crowley is going to be their speaker.

706
01:00:53,682 --> 01:01:04,234
They have that confirmed at the library, so they wanted to know if we wanted to co-sponsor that event, considering that we just had a dig and we could kind of talk through some of those things.

707
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:07,798
So I think that that's definitely a good partnership there.

708
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,422
And then they're basically talking about

709
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:21,048
They have some programming scheduled for early 2025, but then they're looking for topics from April through November next year.

710
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:23,089
Their goal is to have one event per month.

711
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:30,893
Doug, we talked about potentially doing like the art and architecture lecture again, the Brooks Estate one.

712
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:33,934
And really, you know,

713
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:44,011
They're open to ideas, they're open to us bringing them ideas and co-sponsoring or anything that we can do to support them.

714
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:58,475
And I think anywhere we can partner in and kind of bring visibility to Medford history and some of these, what I always call consumer facing events, like getting in front of people and helping.

715
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:01,696
So if we have any ideas for programming, they are all ears.

716
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:14,942
I think on that note, there, and Teresa sent this out too as well, just as kind of like a poking the bear, because Historical Society was researching this.

717
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:19,246
Medford's 400th anniversary is going to come up very quickly.

718
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:23,990
And I think it's going to take a lot of effort from a lot of people to make that happen.

719
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:29,015
And especially if we don't want to be overshadowed by Boston, which

720
01:02:29,015 --> 01:02:30,956
is going to be doing things in the same year.

721
01:02:31,096 --> 01:02:43,483
So if we we should probably plan on a collaborative meeting with all of the groups, the Brooks Estate, the Royal House, Historical Society, the commission, and anybody else that's involved, the mayor and

722
01:02:44,583 --> 01:03:03,588
start thinking about fundraising for that, starting with private and then just working with the city government and city council now to start planning on how to fund that in the future, because that should include some big things like a parade, fireworks, and music.

723
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:10,210
If we start to plan now, we might actually have and be able to raise some sizable money.

724
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:18,678
Yeah, Meg also mentioned that next year is the, what is it, that Paul Revere's 250th.

725
01:03:18,698 --> 01:03:22,862
So she asked us if we were doing anything for that.

726
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,104
And I said, we are not planning to do anything.

727
01:03:25,144 --> 01:03:27,566
She should probably check with the Chamber of Commerce on that.

728
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:32,230
But yeah, I think both of those events are.

729
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:47,250
you know, obviously the Paul Revere 250 is gonna be in, you know, six months-ish, so that's not a lot of time, but the Medford anniversary in a couple of years, certainly we have a little bit more time to plan.

730
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:56,919
Yes, there's an American Revolutionary War 250th anniversary every year from now until now for like the next seven years, so.

731
01:03:58,299 --> 01:04:10,202
And our big one is next year and the following year, because we get from April 1775 to March of 1776 is when they move, and then they go down to New York.

732
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:16,383
So that's our big hurrah, and then that's it until Boston 400.

733
01:04:16,683 --> 01:04:22,085
And I'm sure there's a bunch of little towns that are turning significantly older.

734
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:29,304
So should we just circle back with Teresa and just say, hey, like, we should get a meeting?

735
01:04:29,944 --> 01:04:43,080
Yeah, we should put everybody in the same room, have a meeting, certainly get some public collaboration, because I'm sure there's some people from the general public who will love to donate their time to make that happen.

736
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,283
And they'll have to be some conversations from somebody about some sort of budget.

737
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:59,751
Yeah, I would say, yes, we should start talking about like, you know, with the council about what is the budget outlook so that we can plan for some actual city funding?

738
01:04:59,891 --> 01:05:04,995
And then where can we go in the meantime for grants, building up fundraising?

739
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:07,456
Can we get some big sponsors, etc?

740
01:05:07,496 --> 01:05:07,696
I mean,

741
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:12,358
you know, things that bring in tourism will be better, you know, could be mutually beneficial.

742
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:24,001
For example, the people that own Chevalier, you might want to plan some specialized things around our history, and maybe they'll be interested in contributing.

743
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:29,843
But there's restaurants and, you know, other big things in there that might be works.

744
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:37,005
Who knows, maybe maybe Medford's Great American Beer Hall, when they get up, up and running and successful, they can do something.

745
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:37,325
So

746
01:05:40,347 --> 01:05:46,410
I think they're already pretty successful based on the traffic I saw last week when I tried to go and couldn't go in.

747
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:50,312
There's a CPC meeting tomorrow night.

748
01:05:51,233 --> 01:05:51,993
I will bring this up.

749
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:54,655
I know Teresa in the past has.

750
01:05:55,868 --> 01:06:11,282
you know, brain dump, just a bunch of ideas that she was thinking of, um, that we haven't gotten very far, but I'll, I'll bring it up and mention that this, this commission is interested in, in supporting it, but coming up with a framework, a structure, a schedule, something that makes sense.

751
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:16,546
Um, so I'll bring that up tomorrow night, uh, with the next CPC meeting.

752
01:06:19,969 --> 01:06:20,250
Thank you.

753
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:20,450
Great.

754
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:25,617
And then on that note, we have the preservation and changing climate event.

755
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:26,718
Chen, you brought that up.

756
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:30,364
That's coming up at the PV Essex Museum.

757
01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:35,572
Teresa also mentioned that there's an affiliation if we want to attend that.

758
01:06:37,063 --> 01:06:40,425
Yeah, I mentioned it briefly last month, but I know we had a few people missing.

759
01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:43,306
So that event is, it's actually this week.

760
01:06:43,947 --> 01:06:45,147
I think it's Wednesday.

761
01:06:45,247 --> 01:06:46,388
It's a one day event.

762
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:55,053
And yeah, I think we would be able to go in at a discounted rate if anybody was interested in going or heading that way for the day.

763
01:06:56,453 --> 01:06:58,515
So just let me know if anyone's interested.

764
01:06:58,535 --> 01:07:06,479
If not, I'm sure there'll be other ones in the future and we'll keep an eye on the programming there.

765
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:20,763
And then I set out a few weeks ago, but I'll just remind everybody that Jen Dougherty from the Massachusetts Historical Commission sent around some workshops.

766
01:07:20,823 --> 01:07:34,413
They have the Basics for Online Research for Historic Buildings on Friday, October 18th, Determining Architectural and Historical Significance on November 19th, and Best Practices for Developing a Strong Local Preservation Program

767
01:07:34,933 --> 01:07:35,913
on December 9th.

768
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:37,493
All of these are electronic.

769
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:42,734
They're all recorded after the fact, but it's sometimes great to be there in person to be able to ask questions.

770
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:49,396
So I will resend those around if people want to join in on those presentations.

771
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:58,477
There are daytimes, you know, 10 and 1 p.m., but, you know, I, you know, if you can make it there only for an hour.

772
01:07:59,097 --> 01:08:01,838
So it's like a good lunch and learn.

773
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:08,016
Okay, anything else before we move on to minutes?

774
01:08:10,138 --> 01:08:11,759
All right, just hold on.

775
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,800
I just wanted to know.

776
01:08:17,102 --> 01:08:18,063
Hold on something.

777
01:08:18,143 --> 01:08:19,023
I just went out of my head.

778
01:08:22,706 --> 01:08:23,126
Forget it.

779
01:08:23,506 --> 01:08:23,987
Moving on.

780
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:25,868
Was it on programs or?

781
01:08:27,665 --> 01:08:28,225
No, okay.

782
01:08:28,745 --> 01:08:32,327
When it comes back after about July meeting minutes, then that's fine.

783
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:36,288
All right, July meeting minutes, they were tabled from the last meeting.

784
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:37,769
Peter sent them around.

785
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:41,810
Peter, these were not the ones that you guys were discussing changes to, right?

786
01:08:43,771 --> 01:08:45,191
Okay.

787
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:48,473
I can take a motion to approve July meeting minutes.

788
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:50,914
Move to approve July meeting minutes.

789
01:08:52,614 --> 01:08:53,154
And a second.

790
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:57,196
Jen, you got a?

791
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:02,181
Sorry, I'm like, yeah, a second.

792
01:09:04,302 --> 01:09:06,424
Who made the motion, sorry?

793
01:09:06,564 --> 01:09:06,704
Ed.

794
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:07,484
Okay.

795
01:09:07,504 --> 01:09:11,647
All right, roll call vote.

796
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:11,928
Kay?

797
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:12,868
Yes.

798
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:13,629
Ed?

799
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:15,130
Yep.

800
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:15,830
Peter?

801
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:16,771
Yes.

802
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:17,411
Jen?

803
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:18,572
Yes.

804
01:09:19,012 --> 01:09:19,233
Doug?

805
01:09:19,673 --> 01:09:19,973
Yes.

806
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:20,674
Melanie?

807
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:21,494
Yes.

808
01:09:22,094 --> 01:09:23,716
All right, 6-0 approved.

809
01:09:25,137 --> 01:09:28,459
Okay, any other new business before we move on?

810
01:09:30,704 --> 01:09:31,964
Nothing.

811
01:09:32,284 --> 01:09:34,265
Old business properties under demo delay.

812
01:09:34,285 --> 01:09:35,485
I don't think we have anything.

813
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:42,267
The carriage house for 91 Winchester is coming up, but I don't think there's any movement on that from the homeowner.

814
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:43,727
They have not reached out at all.

815
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:50,929
I have sent my email while we were talking about 56 Wareham, so that's going out.

816
01:09:51,929 --> 01:09:54,870
Subcommittee, I'm going to be reaching out to you about 27 Almond Street.

817
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,930
They want a meeting with us.

818
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:57,030
They don't have any design yet.

819
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,291
They just want some feedback as to where to go with the design.

820
01:10:01,192 --> 01:10:07,167
They are in a similar situation with SID, but they're under demo delay, so they need some direction.

821
01:10:11,947 --> 01:10:15,009
Form B's, order preemptively.

822
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:22,511
So on that note, I ordered earlier today a Form B to document 55 Myrtle Street.

823
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:32,395
The subcommittee passed on review, I understand, on that one, but we'll do the documentation on that one just so that we have it, so that there's a record of the building.

824
01:10:33,715 --> 01:10:47,798
For buildings upcoming, I have a list of 42 Franklin Street, 161 Main Street, which will also include the building next door because it's related to it.

825
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:54,299
Then we're in the process of reviewing the permit for 254 Salem Street.

826
01:10:55,179 --> 01:11:00,120
So we might as well have a form be preemptively prepared for that as well.

827
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:15,404
I'm gonna hold off on ordering them until more movement is made on them, but, because I don't want our budgets, that will bring our budget up to a $7,000 expenditure, so that's nearly half of it.

828
01:11:15,464 --> 01:11:19,545
So I'm just, I have it like tentatively if we need it.

829
01:11:19,945 --> 01:11:21,525
I don't think we need any formal motion.

830
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:23,946
Yeah, Jen.

831
01:11:23,966 --> 01:11:26,787
So $254, whatever that one was, Nelson's.

832
01:11:28,115 --> 01:11:28,315
Yeah.

833
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:28,895
Thank you.

834
01:11:29,195 --> 01:11:32,956
I did approve interior demo on that today.

835
01:11:34,137 --> 01:11:41,039
They did say that they're not changing any windows and they just, I think they just wanted to start on the inside.

836
01:11:41,219 --> 01:11:43,859
So I think that one will definitely be coming.

837
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:47,660
I think depending on what they want to do, you know.

838
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:51,741
So we might want to just order that one is my thought.

839
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:52,942
All right.

840
01:11:53,002 --> 01:11:53,282
That's fine.

841
01:11:53,302 --> 01:11:53,982
I can get that out.

842
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,572
Is there any other motion?

843
01:11:59,132 --> 01:12:00,493
No, I don't think we need a formal motion.

844
01:12:00,513 --> 01:12:01,993
There's a standing order just to do it.

845
01:12:02,153 --> 01:12:06,615
So I was just bringing it up in case there was anything else that's on anybody's radar.

846
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:16,500
And I have your 161 Main Street, which will include the house next door, because that building, the green building, is a carriage house that relates to that house.

847
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,960
So might as well do both of them.

848
01:12:20,121 --> 01:12:24,003
And we are all caught up on permits otherwise as of today.

849
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:28,393
Great.

850
01:12:29,437 --> 01:12:31,203
I did remember the thing I wanted to mention.

851
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:31,283
Yep.

852
01:12:33,419 --> 01:12:38,542
Teresa send around an email about survey planning grants.

853
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:41,303
OK, yeah, well, let's save that for when we get down to this.

854
01:12:41,363 --> 01:12:43,024
OK, sorry, yeah, sounds good.

855
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:44,825
OK, yes, that's that is on the list.

856
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:46,866
OK, any other?

857
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:56,572
So if anybody else has anything in the neighborhoods that they're checking out, you know, if people see stuff for sale, you know, certainly just ping me and Jen just so that we can take a look.

858
01:12:56,612 --> 01:13:00,854
And if we see something that we want to bring or call attention to, we certainly can.

859
01:13:04,403 --> 01:13:08,947
I don't think we have anything at that point, other than we're all caught up to date.

860
01:13:10,148 --> 01:13:10,969
We're all caught up.

861
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:14,012
I'm still trying to work with the building commissioner.

862
01:13:14,112 --> 01:13:18,476
He asked me to come meet with the staff, which I'm happy to do.

863
01:13:19,196 --> 01:13:28,325
He's got a standing meeting every Wednesday at four o'clock with his team, which is perfect because that's typically the day that I stay home and kind of is my day off.

864
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:41,251
So of course my schedule in September is a little crazy, but I'm working with him to just go meet with his team and just continue to have open communication and rapport between them and us.

865
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:44,092
So I'll keep you guys posted on when that gets scheduled.

866
01:13:44,492 --> 01:13:46,153
But otherwise, I think we're in good shape.

867
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:53,468
Yeah, I think we mentioned this during the process of reviewing Brooks is that that we're in a good place with the building commissioner.

868
01:13:53,508 --> 01:13:57,735
We just have to make sure that we just fine tune the fine tune the process to make sure.

869
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:15,109
Yeah, and what he explained to me was that there's really no way, at least as of now moving forward, that anybody in the building department can kind of bypass us.

870
01:14:15,669 --> 01:14:17,791
It's just the system's not set up that way anymore.

871
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:21,454
As something gets categorized, which

872
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:27,998
from when a permit gets applied for, there's this kind of line between minor work and major work.

873
01:14:28,538 --> 01:14:35,581
And anything that's considered major automatically has a route assigned to it that is all departments, including us.

874
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,323
Yeah, so we can no longer be blamed.

875
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:41,024
You know, if somebody says, oh, the commission's holding up.

876
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:41,324
Nope.

877
01:14:41,664 --> 01:14:43,805
Every department's holding you up because we get right.

878
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:44,906
Department gets review.

879
01:14:45,746 --> 01:14:45,926
Right.

880
01:14:45,966 --> 01:14:55,029
And I did reiterate to him if, you know, just to remind people when they're applying that it is 30 days to get through all city channels.

881
01:14:56,649 --> 01:15:06,612
You know, I mean, I try to look at things depending on my schedule at least once a week, if not a little bit more frequently, depending on if I have a few minutes in front of the computer, et cetera.

882
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:13,655
And sometimes one of the, you know, inspectors will just kind of send an email like, hey, can you look at this one real quick or whatever?

883
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:26,846
but otherwise we try to move them right along, or at least we reply and say, we need some more information or et cetera, so they at least know we looked at it and it's kind of in progress.

884
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:35,874
So yeah, so I think, and they're in the process of working with the assessor's department to put in ages of properties.

885
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:40,238
One of the things we talked about too was that,

886
01:15:41,653 --> 01:15:45,635
You know, there is always onus on the property owner, right?

887
01:15:45,695 --> 01:15:50,078
It's not, you know, some property owners, you know, it's like...

888
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:57,512
They have to put in things that are truthful and accurate to what they're doing.

889
01:15:57,532 --> 01:16:09,835
If they need to look up the age of their house or whatever it says on the public record, it's not always just up to us and every other city department to, for lack of a better word, police people.

890
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:13,476
There is some self-policing that goes along with that as well.

891
01:16:13,976 --> 01:16:19,178
And certainly the onus is on the person applying for the permits to make sure that they're

892
01:16:19,998 --> 01:16:31,233
Uploading plans and making sure their descriptions are accurate and, you know, that's how they can get things moved through quickly when they're doing all the things that they're supposed to be doing on their end.

893
01:16:32,495 --> 01:16:32,735
Great.

894
01:16:34,618 --> 01:16:35,018
OK, good.

895
01:16:37,122 --> 01:16:38,342
cross street cemeteries.

896
01:16:38,442 --> 01:16:49,444
So the city has hired, uh, land and faint, uh, fan and leaner, um, to conduct the survey of the headstones.

897
01:16:49,704 --> 01:17:06,267
So, um, they completed the first phase of work, which was digging, um, at the base of the stones at cross street cemetery in West Medford, uh, at Oak Grove cemetery in West Medford to determine how the stones are placed, um, in for majority of them.

898
01:17:07,067 --> 01:17:14,232
They are concreted in a single line trench, which makes it extremely difficult to repair them.

899
01:17:14,352 --> 01:17:21,617
So that will be taken into consideration as the cost estimates and construction and scope of work are developed.

900
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:25,159
For the rest of them, those big monuments that

901
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,082
have just simply shifted and toppled.

902
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:34,048
A lot of them are just free floating if they thought that their base was sufficient enough to support the monument.

903
01:17:35,029 --> 01:17:40,696
And then there's a few individual stones that are just kind of like out there that need replacing.

904
01:17:41,596 --> 01:17:46,121
We do have, thanks to Jess before she left, she did transcriptions of all the original

905
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:50,763
epitaphs and documentation on the stones.

906
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:53,605
So we know what they say, even if we can't read them anymore.

907
01:17:54,406 --> 01:17:58,228
And for some of them, especially the military ones, they're missing the top stones.

908
01:17:58,269 --> 01:18:13,119
It might be certainly within the realm of responsibility of both the Veterans Department and cemetery trustees to replace those stones and restore them to original condition so that they're actually marking the people that are buried there.

909
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:39,775
um that gets us to uh that portion so they are they are actively documenting each individual stone that requires work now so that will be happening over the next couple of months so that with the goal of having a list of work that needs to be done to each stone a priority list and then how to approach cpc for some of the funding and maybe getting some budget money from the trustees and whatnot so

910
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:45,514
Um, there's, as they've explained to me, there's multiple years of work.

911
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:51,261
There are many, many years, many, many years of work to make that back into sound condition.

912
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:54,184
And Salem street will also need some work.

913
01:18:54,285 --> 01:18:57,709
And, of course, we're discussing the larger cemetery too.

914
01:18:57,729 --> 01:18:57,829
So, um.

915
01:19:00,812 --> 01:19:06,358
Flipping to the other cross street site, so I've sent Alicia some information.

916
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:11,303
They're going to issue the RFP for the development project.

917
01:19:11,504 --> 01:19:16,429
So I think within some amount of time, so they are anybody that's.

918
01:19:18,912 --> 01:19:26,135
bidding on that portion of the project is aware that the city is conducting due diligence at the former Cross Street Cemetery site.

919
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:30,517
We are in the process of hiring an archeologist.

920
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:38,140
The contract's being drawn up, and as soon as Fiona okays that, I can send it to the selected consultant.

921
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:44,063
So the only thing we're waiting on is we have to re-bid the excavation work.

922
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:48,025
It came in too expensive, so as soon as that's done,

923
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:53,689
then hopefully we can move forward with opening up the ground there and seeing what is underground.

924
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,092
So that will be a bit of an adventure.

925
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:00,655
Any questions before I move on?

926
01:20:02,486 --> 01:20:05,188
Okay, Thomas Brooks Park.

927
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:07,729
I'm working with Peter to come up with a new date.

928
01:20:08,189 --> 01:20:18,235
We're going to go with a digital only meeting because we can't find a venue in the city because even though we built a bunch of venues, we can't find a suitable venue to have a public meeting because everybody's busy.

929
01:20:18,756 --> 01:20:23,078
So we'll go back to a digital only meeting and invite the public and get that notice out.

930
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:24,919
So that's next on my agenda.

931
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:29,982
Jen will work on that maybe a little bit tomorrow if I can.

932
01:20:31,768 --> 01:20:32,449
get that together.

933
01:20:32,849 --> 01:20:35,392
Yeah, we're thinking the second half of October.

934
01:20:35,412 --> 01:20:36,433
Okay, yeah.

935
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:39,497
So but we're we have to just check with Peter on a date.

936
01:20:39,617 --> 01:20:43,121
But yeah, every the library is booked literally every night in October.

937
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:45,804
And so yeah, done more design.

938
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:52,310
No, it's mainly just getting public feedback.

939
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,990
Now, we asked the city for feedback.

940
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:55,952
There was no feedback from any of the departments.

941
01:20:56,512 --> 01:20:57,312
Fine, it happens.

942
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:15,303
Now we want to tell the public that we have this plan and that we got phase two money so that we can tell them all the things that we have said that are coming are now going to be coming, like the sidewalks, the crossing improvements, the curb cuts, safe travel.

943
01:21:16,283 --> 01:21:17,404
signage, etc.

944
01:21:17,424 --> 01:21:23,409
All of those are going to end another round of archaeology there to finish off that art excavation.

945
01:21:23,429 --> 01:21:32,577
Does this include the ideas for the archaeological cap or whatever that we talked about with the pathway?

946
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:36,480
It doesn't include the construction that's under a separate small grant.

947
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:42,826
That's just a design and that will be a phase unto itself, but I would like to think that that might be a good

948
01:21:44,197 --> 01:21:47,980
3rd phase, if somebody is willing to carry the torch there.

949
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,921
So it's mainly just the path.

950
01:21:50,582 --> 01:21:55,805
Paths and interpretive signage at that point, and maybe some earth and landings.

951
01:21:56,486 --> 01:22:04,331
But I think the point of the meeting is to share the idea about the CAP with the public along with everything else.

952
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,953
The path and the interpretive signage and stuff.

953
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:13,775
Yeah, to show them that, you know, in addition to all the things that we promised, we're also trying to recuperate the site.

954
01:22:14,816 --> 01:22:18,900
I'm just curious, but those aren't in this next phase of monies.

955
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,804
What you're hoping to do next is the crosswalks and that stuff?

956
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:23,485
Yeah.

957
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:24,646
Okay.

958
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:27,950
Yes, because people are inevitably going to bring up...

959
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:36,991
Yeah, people are inevitably going to bring up that, okay, well, if you're yes, why are you looking at a path when, you know, you said you were going to be doing all these things?

960
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:38,774
Well, we're going to deliver on those things.

961
01:22:42,078 --> 01:22:42,219
So

962
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:47,360
Okay, survey and planning projects, Fulton Heights is done.

963
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:53,782
We have to discuss, not now, the next survey project and where we want to go.

964
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:59,725
And then on that note, Teresa asked us for some ideas.

965
01:22:59,785 --> 01:23:02,686
She threw out some ideas on where we can apply

966
01:23:03,446 --> 01:23:11,593
S and P funding in addition to just historic survey, they will also plan pay for master plans.

967
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,034
So, like, they brought up.

968
01:23:13,414 --> 01:23:22,922
Potentially funding the Oak Grove master plan and using the 16,000 dollars that we received for that project for the trees to be the seed money to also get some.

969
01:23:24,062 --> 01:23:29,204
funding for a survey and planning grant for the rest of the cemetery as a whole.

970
01:23:30,424 --> 01:23:35,506
There's been some planning efforts there, so I don't see why they wouldn't favor a project like that.

971
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:41,207
And Medford is a CLG, so 10% of funding will automatically go to CLGs.

972
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,948
So CLGs are usually guaranteed to receive a grant.

973
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:48,210
The big question is if we'll receive more than one.

974
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:56,915
from the, you know, it's possible it's happened before, but we also don't want to necessarily be competing with ourselves.

975
01:23:57,996 --> 01:23:58,236
So.

976
01:24:01,838 --> 01:24:12,826
OK, so we'll say I think we should send out that email to the entire board and have them review and provide comments and see where we can go, because that application is usually due in November.

977
01:24:13,026 --> 01:24:13,647
The short app.

978
01:24:14,307 --> 01:24:16,789
So when do we have to figure out what our next?

979
01:24:18,101 --> 01:24:21,463
survey projects is going to be, or do we know?

980
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,445
So that's kind of immediate.

981
01:24:24,045 --> 01:24:25,586
I will send out some suggestions.

982
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:26,107
How's that?

983
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:31,931
Because we can do a project this year because we have that grant that we, you know, we have the matching portion of the grant money, so we can.

984
01:24:32,031 --> 01:24:33,852
We're going to be doing a smaller project this year.

985
01:24:33,872 --> 01:24:36,414
This is mainly for 2025.

986
01:24:37,675 --> 01:24:43,939
So this is June of next year is when it will kick in, so we're thinking ahead a little bit.

987
01:24:45,507 --> 01:24:54,451
Okay, so should we, you wanna throw out some ideas and then I can put it as an item on our next agenda to chat about if it's too crazy?

988
01:24:54,491 --> 01:25:04,876
No, we should maybe start a Google Drive doc and then just have a list of ongoing like ideas that people can dump into and then we'll have it.

989
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:08,818
And then we'll, maybe you, me, Teresa and a few others can meet.

990
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,959
see what's feasible, what's not, and what we should do.

991
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:14,480
Because the app, like I said, that short app, it's very short.

992
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:20,623
And then they invite us back to do a long app whether, you know, so we should do a long app.

993
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:21,603
It's just a one page.

994
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:23,364
So.

995
01:25:23,964 --> 01:25:24,785
Okay, that sounds good.

996
01:25:25,545 --> 01:25:27,666
Okay, great.

997
01:25:28,146 --> 01:25:28,326
Yeah.

998
01:25:29,007 --> 01:25:29,887
Approval of meeting minutes.

999
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,668
So we have the last two meeting minutes.

1000
01:25:34,265 --> 01:25:35,466
I was not at the last.

1001
01:25:36,146 --> 01:25:37,667
Well, we just did July, right?

1002
01:25:37,987 --> 01:25:38,247
Right.

1003
01:25:38,307 --> 01:25:42,989
So this is this is August and the August special meeting.

1004
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:48,672
Move to approve both both the regular August special.

1005
01:25:48,972 --> 01:25:53,075
Second, with with edits that Peter made.

1006
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:56,616
With the edits circulated, yes.

1007
01:25:56,956 --> 01:25:57,297
OK.

1008
01:25:58,417 --> 01:25:58,917
And a second.

1009
01:25:59,498 --> 01:25:59,798
Second.

1010
01:26:00,662 --> 01:26:02,283
Okay, I'll go around roll call vote.

1011
01:26:02,303 --> 01:26:04,005
We're approving both meeting minutes at once.

1012
01:26:04,165 --> 01:26:04,405
Kit?

1013
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:05,306
Yes.

1014
01:26:05,886 --> 01:26:06,007
Ed?

1015
01:26:07,107 --> 01:26:07,428
Sure.

1016
01:26:07,768 --> 01:26:08,168
Peter?

1017
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:10,330
Yes.

1018
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:11,111
Jen?

1019
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:12,112
Yes.

1020
01:26:12,512 --> 01:26:12,872
Lenny?

1021
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:13,993
Yes.

1022
01:26:14,414 --> 01:26:14,614
Doug?

1023
01:26:15,454 --> 01:26:15,735
Yes.

1024
01:26:16,215 --> 01:26:17,536
Okay, it passes 6-0.

1025
01:26:17,997 --> 01:26:19,598
Any other business before we adjourn?

1026
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:20,819
I had one more thing.

1027
01:26:21,299 --> 01:26:22,560
Sorry, who was the second on that?

1028
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:23,421
I was.

1029
01:26:23,922 --> 01:26:24,182
Okay.

1030
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:34,744
I just wanted to mention real quick that the Brooks Estate Board of Directors, we are looking for an administrative professional to help us.

1031
01:26:35,384 --> 01:26:40,886
We have a little bit of grant money for a brief kind of five to six month contract.

1032
01:26:41,486 --> 01:26:44,288
The applicants must be Medford residents.

1033
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:53,796
So if anybody knows anybody that would like to potentially throw their hat in the ring, the job is posted on our website.

1034
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:56,118
I posted it on some social sites as well.

1035
01:26:57,099 --> 01:27:01,162
Or you can reach out to me or Doug or Carly, the president at Brooks Estate.

1036
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:03,744
John, you missed it.

1037
01:27:05,685 --> 01:27:15,613
They're close to the owner of 110 Brooks Street is a has an architectural background and art history background.

1038
01:27:15,653 --> 01:27:16,614
So you may want to.

1039
01:27:16,634 --> 01:27:18,076
Oh, I know you can't, but I can't.

1040
01:27:18,096 --> 01:27:18,276
Yeah, well.

1041
01:27:22,339 --> 01:27:36,349
I will mention it to them just on the off chance that they are, you know, I know that the house construction project is going to certainly keep them busy, and I'm sure that they're busy in their professional lives, but you just never know if they're there right around the corner from the Brooks Estate, so it might be a good fit.

1042
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,431
So great.

1043
01:27:38,871 --> 01:27:40,552
And one last question.

1044
01:27:40,612 --> 01:27:42,233
Some other architect on in.

1045
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:44,035
It's a way in, right, Doug?

1046
01:27:44,315 --> 01:27:47,097
Have another architect and point of view on the board.

1047
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,979
So just thinking about you guys long term, that's all.

1048
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:57,251
Yeah, Peter, who was the lady who was doing Dennis McDonald?

1049
01:27:58,411 --> 01:28:02,014
Oh, that's early on.

1050
01:28:02,974 --> 01:28:03,935
I forget her name.

1051
01:28:04,215 --> 01:28:04,715
Oh, hold on.

1052
01:28:04,775 --> 01:28:05,516
It's in the email.

1053
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:09,098
It's, um, Oh, hold on.

1054
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:17,603
It's a D C a D I T H I. She's the housing planner for the last name.

1055
01:28:17,864 --> 01:28:19,925
M O O G O O R.

1056
01:28:21,285 --> 01:28:21,805
M-O-O-G-O-R.

1057
01:28:22,486 --> 01:28:24,187
M-O-O-G-O-R.

1058
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:25,667
O-O-R.

1059
01:28:26,188 --> 01:28:27,788
So two O's, two O's.

1060
01:28:28,549 --> 01:28:28,849
Okay.

1061
01:28:31,951 --> 01:28:32,391
Anything else?

1062
01:28:34,478 --> 01:28:35,858
And good luck, we hope we find somebody.

1063
01:28:36,298 --> 01:28:38,059
I think you will get an applicant.

1064
01:28:38,999 --> 01:28:43,900
Yeah, we have a couple so far, but we just want to make sure we kind of put it out there far and wide.

1065
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,001
Yeah, I was going to say, Lenny, does the PhD still have their practice lab for job posting?

1066
01:28:50,021 --> 01:28:57,842
So that would be a good one for there, even for, you know, because I feel like it's not overly demanding.

1067
01:28:57,882 --> 01:29:00,543
So it'd be a good fit for some students that need work.

1068
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:01,703
Yeah, it could be.

1069
01:29:04,204 --> 01:29:06,565
Yeah, I mean, you can send the job description over.

1070
01:29:06,585 --> 01:29:09,327
Okay, I mean, it's more of an administrative role.

1071
01:29:09,367 --> 01:29:17,872
I think they're looking more for, you know, something that relates directly to one of our degree programs, but I'll run it by them.

1072
01:29:18,457 --> 01:29:21,579
Yeah, Jen, yeah, Tufts University.

1073
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:28,363
I don't know how loose you are with Medford resident, but Tufts University has a museum studies program, so.

1074
01:29:29,644 --> 01:29:32,946
It's not our rule, it has to do with the grant that we got.

1075
01:29:32,966 --> 01:29:33,827
Yeah, of course.

1076
01:29:33,847 --> 01:29:46,895
But I mean, if a student, there are occasionally Medford students, or I don't know who would classify students that are at Tufts University as a Medford resident, but I mean, if they're here for 180 days,

1077
01:29:48,255 --> 01:29:50,495
I mean, they will be for the duration of this contract.

1078
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:58,017
So I can see if I can look up the person for that, the community contact.

1079
01:29:58,057 --> 01:29:59,937
They just emailed us, so I can see if I can get them.

1080
01:30:00,017 --> 01:30:04,038
Yeah, I mean, I think we would love to connect with them anyway on other things.

1081
01:30:04,138 --> 01:30:08,538
So feel free to send an intro, and I'll run with that.

1082
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:09,619
I can do that.

1083
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,619
OK, motion to adjourn?

1084
01:30:13,999 --> 01:30:14,779
Motion to adjourn.

1085
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:15,900
And a second?

1086
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:17,720
I'll second.

1087
01:30:19,728 --> 01:30:20,529
Roll call vote, Kent?

1088
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:21,590
Yes.

1089
01:30:22,171 --> 01:30:22,311
Ed?

1090
01:30:23,773 --> 01:30:24,714
Long night, yes.

1091
01:30:25,274 --> 01:30:25,595
Peter?

1092
01:30:26,435 --> 01:30:26,736
Yes.

1093
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:28,077
Jen?

1094
01:30:28,618 --> 01:30:28,978
Yes.

1095
01:30:29,659 --> 01:30:29,959
Lenny?

1096
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:30,780
Yes.

1097
01:30:31,241 --> 01:30:31,481
Doug?

1098
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,182
Yes.

1099
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:33,483
And good to go.

1100
01:30:33,503 --> 01:30:34,684
6-0 approved.

1101
01:30:34,825 --> 01:30:36,026
It's not really a long night.

1102
01:30:36,066 --> 01:30:36,386
It's only 8.30.

1103
01:30:36,626 --> 01:30:38,488
The night is still young.

1104
01:30:38,509 --> 01:30:39,409
There's been later nights.

1105
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:45,347
Sorry, who was who motioned and who was seconded?

1106
01:30:45,647 --> 01:30:46,528
I motioned.

1107
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:47,690
Eleni was second.

1108
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:52,095
Yeah, just just looking ahead because we have the meetings coming up.

1109
01:30:52,175 --> 01:30:56,520
So we will be having the October 7th meeting, just so you know.

1110
01:30:58,445 --> 01:31:03,468
The two properties before that were not significant, so the only one we have is the hearing.

1111
01:31:03,528 --> 01:31:11,252
So provided we don't take an application on October 7th, there will be no need for the meeting at the end of the month, and we'll go right into our November meeting.

1112
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:12,613
But that remains to be seen.

1113
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:15,515
We'll see if we receive an application in the next 20 days.

1114
01:31:17,098 --> 01:31:25,344
Yeah, and I don't know if you already went over this just to remind everybody, because the Columbus Day, we had to kind of jigger our calendar a little bit between October and November.

1115
01:31:25,424 --> 01:31:34,610
So we have on the calendar the 7th, the 28th, and then I forget the November date, because we had to fit everything in within 30 days.

1116
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:43,116
Oh, yeah, we moved November up a little bit because of the- We moved it back, I think, because Veterans Day fell on a Monday as well.

1117
01:31:43,136 --> 01:31:45,818
It was like a trifecta this year.

1118
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:52,351
Ryan, I won't be here for the October 7th team.

1119
01:31:53,651 --> 01:31:53,871
Okay.

1120
01:31:57,972 --> 01:31:59,932
Hope you're going somewhere good.

1121
01:31:59,952 --> 01:32:03,453
Yeah, are you going somewhere good?

1122
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:05,453
Europe.

1123
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:07,233
That's good.

1124
01:32:08,194 --> 01:32:09,714
Husha, just going to Europe.

1125
01:32:10,434 --> 01:32:10,894
No big deal.

1126
01:32:10,934 --> 01:32:11,814
November 18th and then December 9th.

1127
01:32:12,214 --> 01:32:12,634
November 8th.

1128
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:19,941
I may not be here.

1129
01:32:20,062 --> 01:32:22,164
Yeah, I will not.

1130
01:32:23,005 --> 01:32:23,866
I may or may not.

1131
01:32:24,366 --> 01:32:25,587
Okay.

1132
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,008
Okay.

1133
01:32:26,809 --> 01:32:27,229
All right.

1134
01:32:28,771 --> 01:32:30,072
All right.

1135
01:32:30,092 --> 01:32:30,312
Thank you.

1136
01:32:30,332 --> 01:32:31,053
Well, have a good night.
