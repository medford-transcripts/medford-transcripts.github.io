1
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:21,227
We're currently live on YouTube and I'm going to record to the Zoom cloud so that we also have the recording there as well.

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,973
I am now going to start to share my screen after I give my introduction.

3
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,574
So my name, for those of you who don't know, is Peter Cushing.

4
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:35,295
I am the Assistant Superintendent for Secondary Education in Medford.

5
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:51,218
Right now, just so you know, the PJC Mac Monitor computer is actually a Macintosh computer I have right behind me, where when I share my screen, I wanna make sure that everybody can see what I intend for you to see, which is,

6
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:56,821
the names of the school and the random number generator, and then you'll be able to see the cut and paste in.

7
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,583
And I want to make sure that that is recorded for posterity.

8
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:08,648
I also have on the call under the Medford Public Schools, the camera was just turned on, are both Lisa and Susie.

9
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:14,431
They have co-hosting rights to this, so they will be able to let everybody in as time goes.

10
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:22,539
While the chat is available and people have the opportunity to unmute, this is not an open public meeting or anything like that.

11
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,861
This is simply a selection.

12
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:28,626
So there should not be any conversation or anything like that, under my understanding.

13
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,351
I only see myself as a tool to carry this out.

14
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:35,674
And I guess you could use tool in multiple facets there.

15
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:39,578
I appreciate all of your patience and your understanding.

16
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:43,281
And Josie, I hope you're not missing too much class right now.

17
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:46,523
So you can smile on that one as a former middle school principal.

18
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:47,444
All right.

19
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:52,308
So I'm going to share my screen, which will be screen one.

20
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:55,871
I work on a two screen monitor setup and

21
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,679
All right, good.

22
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,241
It looks like we are seeing what we are we are needing to see.

23
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:07,224
So I'm going to do a random dot org sequence.

24
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:13,827
And so the sequence boundaries you'll notice here are the names.

25
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:22,972
What I did was I simply added an ID number because Microsoft Excel does the row number one.

26
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:25,533
And so I simply started the numbering

27
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,422
here and carry down through 23.

28
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:40,168
So Josie Dufour is number 23, Brie Brothers is number one, and we will go with that.

29
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:50,453
The names are randomly in there, as far as I can tell, based on there's no alphabetization, so these numbers are somewhat random.

30
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,795
So we will pull that down for a second.

31
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:02,808
And then I will set the parameters, the smallest value of one and the highest value of 23.

32
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:14,395
I'm going to leave it in one column just because that will be easier for pasting when we start going through this.

33
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,137
So there will be some clicking back and forth because of this.

34
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:25,216
and I'm going to do the get sequence at this time, and we'll get the first sequence.

35
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:38,479
I will then copy down five, Control X, and then paste in Control V, right?

36
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,099
So those are the numbers for the Amelia Earhart School.

37
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm simply looking at the monitors to see if anyone is flagging me.

38
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:52,180
For seeing an error, not seeing any, I will go with that.

39
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:54,865
Wait a second.

40
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,145
So immediately I have to start over.

41
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:21,986
I apologize.

42
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:27,631
I must have clicked something there.

43
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:40,525
So I will just click again and I will copy down those five, Control X. I wanna make sure that that is there so everyone can see.

44
00:04:49,514 --> 00:05:07,086
And then control V. Control X. Control V. My copying does not seem to be working.

45
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:09,268
These are those embarrassing moments of technology.

46
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:15,232
So quite frankly, what we're gonna do is, not that, we're gonna simply go,

47
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:52,705
I appreciate your patience, but we will go 11, 9, 21, 16, 7.

48
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,906
And then we will go to the next.

49
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,961
which will be 18, 10, 18, 10, 14, three, 22.

50
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:21,501
Then we will go five, 15,

51
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:56,907
1323 and to go 620 17 or all.

52
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,013
Then we will go 8, 19, 1, 8, 19, 1.

53
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:29,781
And then we will, again, I love the exclamation point.

54
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,563
Here we go.

55
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,146
And the random number generator has not picked up the two.

56
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:41,849
So we will simply start at number 18, number seven.

57
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,571
15, five, 10, 15, five, 10, 11, and 16.

58
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,954
We will go eight, 20, three, one.

59
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:24,575
And six, 23, two, 12.

60
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:33,617
Hi, you skipped a number.

61
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:34,817
Oh, I did.

62
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:35,757
Thank you for picking it up.

63
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:36,537
Which one did I skip?

64
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:38,018
I believe it was number 13.

65
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:41,258
Between 11 and 16, there's a 13.

66
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,560
All right.

67
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,360
Thank you very much.

68
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,241
I apologize.

69
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:53,802
And that would simply be 13 there.

70
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:56,403
That's a great pickup.

71
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:57,043
And thank you.

72
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,084
I don't know who's speaking, but I greatly appreciate it.

73
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,545
No worries.

74
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:12,389
And I'm going to put a 16 right there and I'm going to move six here.

75
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,086
Six there.

76
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,088
Six, one, two, three, four, five.

77
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,068
All right, there we go.

78
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:25,030
All right, so 17 was the last number.

79
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,211
So then I go 19.

80
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:26,211
14.

81
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:34,317
Sorry, again, I'm sorry.

82
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:37,339
On row eight now, you have that extra six.

83
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:38,900
I have the extra six.

84
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,701
All right.

85
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,082
Good pick up.

86
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,843
I love the team support.

87
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,840
If you can't tell, I'm sweating.

88
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,281
I should have worn a degree today.

89
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:48,761
All right.

90
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:49,701
We're here for you.

91
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:51,322
Here we go.

92
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:51,942
All right.

93
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,863
So I'm going to be 17 and then 19, 19.

94
00:09:55,043 --> 00:10:01,565
I'm not sure why my cut and paste is not working, but you guys saw multiple times.

95
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:02,285
14, 21, 22, and 4.

96
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:03,906
All right.

97
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,063
Let's just recheck this sequence real quick with number nine.

98
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:25,987
So nine, four, 22, 21, 14, 19, 17, 12, two, 23, six, one, three, 20, eight, 16, 13, 11, 10, five,

99
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,411
15, seven, and 18.

100
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:52,492
So that sequence looks complete.

101
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:55,092
I will now click the again.

102
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,873
All right.

103
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,654
And 21, five, four, and 20.

104
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,334
And then three,

105
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:29,498
18, 13, 11, and seven.

106
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,780
As I head to the next line, perhaps it was my Triskaidekaphobia with 13 in the last sequence.

107
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,140
I apologize again.

108
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,601
All right, so numbers six, 22,

109
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:54,022
17, six, 22, 17, two, 14, and then 10, 23, nine, one, 19,

110
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:26,900
15, eight, 16, 12.

111
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:33,685
I'm gonna regenerate.

112
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,433
So number six, and then five, 11, five,

113
00:12:49,602 --> 00:13:07,194
eight, 14, nine, 22, 23, 20, three, and 18, and then 13,

114
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:30,141
16, seven, 10, and two.

115
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,641
One, 19, four, 15, 21,

116
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:51,903
12 and 17.

117
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:55,104
I'll now regenerate.

118
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,126
As I do that, I will say that I wish I'd kept that eye appointment months ago.

119
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:03,848
16, seven, and 20.

120
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,610
17 to.

121
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:19,870
Three.

122
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,211
and two.

123
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:20,211
8 610 1886. 18.

124
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:49,672
15, boom.

125
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:52,594
1, 19, 9, 23, and 5.

126
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:52,594
13, 12, 4, 11, 21.

127
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:27,407
Again.

128
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:30,069
So, 22.

129
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:30,209
Three.

130
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:30,209
20.

131
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:30,209
10.

132
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,549
16.

133
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:30,549
Five.

134
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:30,629
Six.

135
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:30,629
17. 21.

136
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:00,813
13, two, one, 14, 11, 18, 15, 12, four, 19,

137
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,001
9, 7, 8.

138
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,001
9, 7, 8.

139
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,001
I will regenerate.

140
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:29,001
3, 6, 12,

141
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:05,796
four, one, 19, one, two, three, four, five, yep, okay.

142
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:11,158
22, 11, 14, 15, and two, 10, seven,

143
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:41,648
17, eight, five, 15, 20, one, 16, and nine.

144
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:46,991
And then we have 18 comma,

145
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,974
Regenerate, we have passed halfway through.

146
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:06,256
So we have 8, 3, 7, 1.

147
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:06,256
8, 3, 7, 1.

148
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:06,256
5, 13, 15, 5.

149
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:06,256
15, 15.

150
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:09,096
11, and 22, six, 17, 21, 14.

151
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:09,877
Regenerate.

152
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:32,095
All right, so in this sequence, 21 has come up to the top.

153
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:40,497
So in order to stay with the efficacy of it, I will start at the bottom and work backwards, all right?

154
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:48,259
That seems to be the most efficient way to do that rather than regenerating again or redrawing.

155
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,001
So as five at the bottom, and then I will work up 16,

156
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:58,929
18, one, 15, and 11.

157
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:07,496
And then two, seven, 20, 18, nine,

158
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,529
10, eight, 17, 22, 19, three, 13, three, 13, 23,

159
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,968
six, four, 12, 21.

160
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:24,119
We'll now regenerate and start back at the top, barring any sequences in the first three numbers that cause an issue.

161
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,341
Seeing none, we'll go 17, seven,

162
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:44,418
18, 11, sorry, 11, two, eight, six, five, two,

163
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:10,518
nine, three, and 19, 15, 16, 15, 16, three, 13, 21, 10,

164
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,303
One, four, 14.

165
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,404
One, four, 14.

166
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,408
Clean break, new line.

167
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:50,349
And we'll regenerate.

168
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:52,671
Eight.

169
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,137
Eight, six.

170
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:11,392
16.

171
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,392
You typed 16 instead of six.

172
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:12,472
Oh, I did.

173
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:12,853
Thank you.

174
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,653
Appreciate that.

175
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:14,614
Good pickup.

176
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:14,614
8, 6, 14.

177
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:14,614
13.

178
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:14,614
16, 17, 9, 22, 16.

179
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:43,484
Three.

180
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:43,484
11.

181
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,126
Seven.

182
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:47,366
20 more.

183
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:47,366
15.

184
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:47,366
18.

185
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:47,366
10. 20.

186
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:21,367
19, one, 23, five, four, two.

187
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:25,068
Five, four, two.

188
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:29,289
Regenerate.

189
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,950
Make sure my cursor is back there this time.

190
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,050
23 and 12.

191
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,410
10, five, two.

192
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:50,278
22, 22, 21, six, four, 17, three, and one, 20, 15, 13,

193
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:44,248
Again.

194
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:48,009
One.

195
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,310
One.

196
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:58,332
Nine.

197
00:25:58,352 --> 00:25:58,332
16.

198
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:07,594
Seven.

199
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,594
Sorry, I stopped counting out loud.

200
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:10,154
15 and 17.

201
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:16,806
14, 20, 28, and then five.

202
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:16,806
23, 19, 13.

203
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:16,806
23, 19, 13.

204
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:55,486
12, two, three, 10, six and seven.

205
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:55,486
21, 11, 22, 18, 11, 22.

206
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:06,674
Hi, I'm sorry, line 60 has six numbers in it.

207
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:14,463
Ah, perfect, thank you.

208
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:25,849
What's wonderful is my mess-ups will be caught forever on YouTube.

209
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:29,010
All right, so 21, 11, 22, and 18.

210
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:35,253
All right, we will regenerate.

211
00:27:38,515 --> 00:27:39,315
We are almost there.

212
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,792
as the end of the list is now in sight.

213
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:57,142
So here, we'll start with number 14, number two, 10, seven, 15, and nine.

214
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:35,872
13 and 20, 13 and 20.

215
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:36,192
Three, 12, 22.

216
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:36,512
Three, 12, 22.

217
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:37,593
Four and one, four and one.

218
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:43,094
And then 21 and eight, 21 and eight.

219
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:08,412
and one last cycle for regeneration of the numbers.

220
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:11,276
23, nine, one.

221
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,836
23, nine, and one.

222
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:24,740
Right, so ladies and gentlemen, there are the numbers as randomly generated.

223
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:28,303
These will be all shared out with you.

224
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:33,648
They are probably already shared out with you, but they will be shared out with you momentarily.

225
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,710
And we will make sure that you have them.

226
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:38,332
We will also send

227
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:52,183
the numbers yep we're gonna we're gonna work to get the names out to you so that people aren't having to cross reference like and find your names and numbers so we will work on that over the next couple of hours uh for you here.

228
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:54,105
I really appreciate your patience.

229
00:29:54,345 --> 00:30:05,135
I really appreciate whoever was the voice of a little bit of help um there um and while I see a hand up uh I apologize as this was just the selection.

230
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,316
I really can't take questions or comments.

231
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:07,897
There's an

232
00:30:08,297 --> 00:30:09,979
I'm sorry, that was my hand.

233
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:13,722
Okay, I was, I was raising it to make to speak up.

234
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:15,884
And I didn't realize I could just unmute myself.

235
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:19,166
So I really appreciate you speaking up.

236
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,910
And I really appreciate you guys being here to observe this process.

237
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:29,135
And as I said in my email, I can't thank you enough for the support you're giving the Metro public schools in the city of Medford through this process.

238
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:42,739
With that, I'm going to end this Zoom and we will forward you all the information momentarily and the names themselves we'll have out to you this afternoon.

239
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,401
There are two entries on number 58.

240
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:47,984
There are two names that cannot stand.

241
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:55,211
Okay.

242
00:30:56,698 --> 00:31:05,161
So I guess my question is, my question is seeing that, I apologize, Hendrik, for some reason, your volume is very low.

243
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:18,886
My suggestion would be then that where this is the second name, all right, I can cut and paste this, all right, down below in the line 67,

244
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:27,325
and simply carry on with the number generation that is still up on this screen where number one was the last number.

245
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:31,085
So then it would be 15, 16, eight, 11, and five.

246
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:38,827
Sorry, can Hendricks actually repeat what the problem is?

247
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:39,868
I couldn't hear it.

248
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:45,009
So on line 58, there are two names, all right?

249
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:50,390
It's Sagamore John School or Pawtucket School.

250
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:51,902
Okay.

251
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:55,244
And so having not seen that, I did not review the names.

252
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,745
I want you to know like that.

253
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:58,265
I didn't see that as my purview.

254
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:06,209
So having now seeing that and having that brought to our attention, my suggestion would be, we simply move the Pawtucket.

255
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,569
There are two ways we could do this.

256
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,510
All right.

257
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:14,653
One, I could cut line 59 through 66 and bump everything down one.

258
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:20,514
All right, and then the Pawtucket School would take that, or I simply cut the Pawtucket School.

259
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:36,738
And what I would say is, since we have assigned the numbers this far, what I think is the best is to take that out there and to put it in on line 67, all right, and to carry forward with the numbers, which are 15, 16, 8, 11, and 5.

260
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:37,618
I'm OK with that.

261
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:37,678
So 15.

262
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,379
I'm sorry.

263
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,640
15, 16, sorry.

264
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,001
My eyes are going a little bit on this just because.

265
00:32:55,021 --> 00:33:02,603
15, 16, eight, five, and 14.

266
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:06,304
Let me just double check that.

267
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:08,264
15, 16, eight.

268
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:10,805
I'm sorry, are you still sharing your screen?

269
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:12,265
No, I stopped.

270
00:33:12,385 --> 00:33:13,565
Sorry, forgot I was sharing.

271
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,146
Forgot I wasn't sharing anymore.

272
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,286
My apologies here.

273
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:20,283
share screen.

274
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,384
Oh, there it is.

275
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:32,568
Alright, so the last sequence was here, you'll see that I've cut Pawtucket school, I have not taken out the or up here.

276
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:35,810
I'll leave that for somebody else to make that decision.

277
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,992
But the number last sequence here is number one.

278
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:46,905
So 15, 16, eight, 11, and five.

279
00:33:47,385 --> 00:34:00,507
We'll go here, 15, 16, eight, 11, and five.

280
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:01,967
Okay.

281
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:07,108
I appreciate that being caught before we closed out this session.

282
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,989
I hope there are no other issues that anybody saw.

283
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:16,677
But I will stop the screen share at this time, and these will all be shared out with you.

284
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:32,832
I believe the documents have already been shared as it's linked, but we'll make sure that we start translating these numbers into people's names, members of the committee's names, and so that those are out to you so you can start doing your research before Tuesday's meeting.

285
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:44,709
Thank you all very much for your time, your patience, and once again, your support for the errors I made along the way that comes along with being human.

286
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,672
I appreciate all your time and thank you.

287
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:48,393
Have a great day.
