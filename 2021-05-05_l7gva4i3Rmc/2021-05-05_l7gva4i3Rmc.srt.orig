[SPEAKER_02]: So it's May 5th, I'm calling to order the rules policy and equity subcommittee meeting that is scheduled for tonight from four to 6 p.m.

[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

20
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:36,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau present.

21
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin will be joining us shortly.

22
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,986
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a partial conflict.

23
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,667
[SPEAKER_02]: to present the quorum.

24
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So the agenda for tonight, we have three items listed.

25
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We have policy BEDH, which is the public participation policy.

26
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be reviewing a possible update for that.

27
00:02:54,957 --> 00:03:02,604
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have policy BEDB, the agenda creation and format for regular meetings of the school committee, which will be also an update.

28
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:05,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the sexual harassment procedures, which are new.

29
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna start with the public participation policy and I'm gonna just share my screen.

30
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:15,802
[SPEAKER_09]: One sec.

31
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:44,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.

32
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:50,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just rearrange things on my screen so I can see everything.

33
00:03:50,544 --> 00:04:03,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm gonna just read my introduction that I wrote for myself to read to you all, but since it's on screen.

34
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:11,068
[SPEAKER_02]: The current policy is quite brief and does not include much detail that is necessary for concise understanding of our expectations as a committee.

35
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:27,305
[SPEAKER_02]: this major update to this policy should provide clarity to the public and to ourselves about what we mean by the phrases public comment and community participation, as well as lays out some expectations to ensure we can perform the work we are charged with in a welcoming and efficient manner.

36
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:41,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I expect there to be a discussion on the addition of full Medford Street address where you reside, to which I will remind folks that owning a rental home here or having a friend or relative in Medford does not grant you a voice before the committee

37
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:59,060
[SPEAKER_02]: If we fail to limit participation to residents, we open ourselves up to participation by anyone across the entire nation, which will become a real challenge when we deliberate on controversial matters and diminish the voice of the residents of Medford by drowning them out.

38
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to just first bring up our current policy, which is remarkably brief.

39
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:06,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it was long, I wouldn't take this approach.

40
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: The current policy says that any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.

41
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:30,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Community participation portion of the agenda be established, which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item for the school committee or be heard on any item.

42
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:37,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Any item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools by the Wednesday noon prior to the scheduled meeting.

43
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:41,394
[SPEAKER_02]: with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation.

44
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:47,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've done a little bit of legwork to prepare for this meeting.

45
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the language that I am proposing.

46
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:57,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I did look at other school committees policies on this.

47
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't just start writing.

48
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:04,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And this particular section here is actually called out in several other communities.

49
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:08,917
[SPEAKER_02]: the new policies.

50
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:11,698
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's actually written right on the agendas of some of them.

51
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, although I don't ask me which ones, um And this is this is, uh So this would be the new policy starting.

52
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:21,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.

53
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:25,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies for not including Start.

54
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And this just calls out the

55
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:47,504
[SPEAKER_02]: often confusion about, well, what are the requirements around, you know, do people truly just have the freedom to come and talk about whatever they want?

56
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:58,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just language right out of the law that I thought was particularly important that really says, you know, if the chair, no person shall address a meeting of the public body without permission of the chair.

57
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:04,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just goes on, I won't quote the whole part of the law, but essentially if somebody,

58
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:09,676
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to disturb the meeting and prevent the committee from doing our work, that they can be removed.

59
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:22,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine that this has happened in ages, but I do recall seeing that on medfordtv.org a couple of times prior to being in office.

60
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:28,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a reference to there, and there's a link to the full law.

61
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is where there's really new stuff.

62
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,652
[SPEAKER_02]: public comments on agenda items.

63
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:43,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've broken the new policy out to really make it, to beef up the language.

64
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:52,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

65
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

66
00:07:56,662 --> 00:08:02,145
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaker will speak to the full committee through the chair and will not address individual members or administrators.

67
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:08,208
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

68
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:15,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Residents may also submit their comments in writing to the superintendent prior to the meeting, and then there's the email address.

69
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:26,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the record in less than three minutes, or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee.

70
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,279
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the person who typically reads in comments during the meeting.

71
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:44,005
[SPEAKER_02]: A welcoming community is, this is a new couple of sentences based on feedback I know I've heard many times in the last three and a half years on the school committee.

72
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:53,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So this language may not survive to the full committee, but I drafted this in hopes that it will at least survive at a subcommittee.

73
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:57,217
[SPEAKER_02]: A welcoming community is both a value to the school committee,

74
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:01,279
[SPEAKER_02]: a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

75
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:12,085
[SPEAKER_02]: To move us towards this goal, we ask that the duration of your residency in Medford not be provided as all residents have the same rights and responsibilities regardless of the duration of their residency in our city.

76
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:27,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's just the, if you're writing or providing a comment, name and number of the item on the agenda, your first and last name, your Medford street address and your question or comment.

77
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I go on to community participation, are there any comments or questions about what I've presented so far?

78
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:36,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Cushing.

79
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:44,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a suggestion to add the superintendent at Medford email address.

80
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:56,687
[SPEAKER_08]: as that would make it easier for people to, if they find this policy, that would make it easier for people to report out to the superintendent.

81
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:01,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that doesn't change with names or anything like that.

82
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:04,375
[SPEAKER_08]: The other,

83
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:15,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the other point I had is up above where it says may authorize a constable or other officer, just given the fact that zoom might very well be here to stay.

84
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:24,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, would it be, would it be worth the chair may authorize and this is from the law.

85
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, okay.

86
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:26,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

87
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:28,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize this doesn't work for Zoom.

88
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:35,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm only thinking like, you know, if you think about it, who is a constable or officer, even when we're in the chambers?

89
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have no idea.

90
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:54,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I certainly understand that that's a really excellent point that this does not address the fact that somebody may have to be put into the waiting room or I don't even know what the language would look like.

91
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:55,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody

92
00:10:56,238 --> 00:11:00,921
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly would have to investigate legally, like what does any of that mean?

93
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:06,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even just muting somebody, I think is something that is not yet decided.

94
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:10,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but.

95
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:18,191
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other suggestion that I would have is you have the option for a person to go up to five minutes.

96
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:33,661
[SPEAKER_08]: My only suggestion would be to just given some of the public comment that we've had to go from three to two with the option to extend as the board sees fit on various things.

97
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:37,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just thinking about the sometimes the number of people.

98
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:43,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think recently, we did set it at two minutes, and it seemed to be functional.

99
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,668
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's yeah, question.

100
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:50,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an interesting suggestion.

101
00:11:50,290 --> 00:12:02,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And I certainly what isn't in the this new policy here, assuming we adopt it, is something that I do see in many other communities.

102
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is

103
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:07,265
[SPEAKER_02]: public comment has a time limit.

104
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:09,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 20 minutes, it's 30 minutes, whatever.

105
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's 500 people that show up, it's 30 minutes.

106
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you hit the 30 minutes, everybody else can submit it in writing or whatever.

107
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:23,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a little surprised that other communities don't explode over that.

108
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:28,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you take the effort to show up and to prepare comments, and then you're number 48 on the list,

109
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also require you to sign up ahead of time, like before the meeting begins, you must provide your details, what item you're gonna talk about, and then it happens.

110
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:50,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But it ends when it ends based on the time, which is partially how they're able to, many communities are able to have much shorter meetings.

111
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:59,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just feel like that, I personally like to keep three minutes, and maybe that's because I'm not,

112
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:01,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked too much.

113
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:10,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, do you have thoughts on that?

114
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:18,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a problem with three minutes necessarily.

115
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:24,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think many people who participate don't speak for three minutes.

116
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to

117
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:35,329
[SPEAKER_06]: uphold our rules and have some clear procedures on how to do that.

118
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:48,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the places where our public comment has gone on for many, many, many hours is not because any one person at one time spoke for more than three minutes.

119
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:55,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that the same person spoke many, many times for three minutes and that there were a lot of people who wanted to speak.

120
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:04,996
[SPEAKER_06]: given that, like, I don't have a strong opinion about two versus three.

121
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:17,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I like, I think there are times where the difference is important and giving somebody three minutes to, like, give us their sort of fully baked thought is a good idea.

122
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:20,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially

123
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:29,583
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's something that is evolving as they're listening to the conversation that's unfolding, right?

124
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:35,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like you're necessarily limiting people who came prepared to talk about something.

125
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:41,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't have a problem with up to three minutes.

126
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hesitate to put in place

127
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,982
[SPEAKER_06]: the time limit, because I feel like that's too far gone.

128
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:04,644
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel really strongly that we need to uphold our rules that we have set.

129
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:09,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we moved to a two minute comment, that was actually done without the committee's approval.

130
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:17,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanna make sure that whatever rules we set, they are adhered to, and that there's just a clear process for that.

131
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:20,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

132
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Edward-Vinson?

133
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:37,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was in agreement with Dr. Cushing's comment about the two minutes or if we're going to say up to three minutes that we respect that it's up to three minutes.

134
00:15:39,661 --> 00:16:01,299
[SPEAKER_00]: where I think, you know, with emails and allowing the opportunity for the public comment, I think that that is important, community participation, but I too feel that there needs to be clear rules that everyone understands and that they are actually followed.

135
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:07,044
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece that I had a question or a comment about

136
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:24,530
[SPEAKER_00]: was the addition of people not stating the duration of residency in order to be a welcoming community.

137
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:30,453
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to know, would this verbiage be read prior

138
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:45,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be read at every meeting, this particular paragraph that's being added onto the official agenda so that everyone would know that's the goal that we're moving towards.

139
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just was trying to get a little greater clarity on.

140
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next item on our agenda is the agenda format.

141
00:16:57,072 --> 00:17:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll give you a sneak peek, but yes, much of this language does end up on the actual agenda.

142
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,136
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll get to that exact thing after we get through this one.

143
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:12,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I agree that it should be part of the agenda and actually read out loud, but.

144
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:29,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my wondering was if, for example, you were to have someone, we're promoting, we're encouraging public participation and community comments, if someone,

145
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:43,544
[SPEAKER_00]: not realizing that the policy changed were to state that, then what would happen during that meeting, I guess, is what I'm trying to understand.

146
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think anything would happen.

147
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:51,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I did include it on the agenda statement.

148
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that one later.

149
00:17:55,914 --> 00:18:00,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think just repeating it at the meeting

150
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:08,557
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if people are going to, some people may feel that they're going to say it now, especially because there's a change in policy.

151
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:19,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that'll be up to the chair, frankly, to, to say something or, or not.

152
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

153
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:28,741
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I wouldn't imagine if somebody decides they will, they're going to say it because it's also remember, it is sort of automatic, I think for a lot of people.

154
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't

155
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:38,782
[SPEAKER_02]: that people say this usually out of any kind of like any attempt to make it an unwelcoming environment.

156
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:50,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just like, you know, I was born and raised in Medford and like when you're speaking at a public meeting and it's you're speaking both to the to us and to frankly the public that's watching.

157
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like it just rolls off the tongue.

158
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:56,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't imagine it's anything that like causes any consequence of any sort.

159
00:18:57,463 --> 00:19:17,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think it's important to state it clearly that we as a committee, that your duration of residency in no way affects the value of your opinion on what you have to say, and that that's our statement, even if individuals may feel differently about that.

160
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:41,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I almost feel like it sounds like we're creating norms and I don't know if we should call them, call it out as norms so that if we're saying, you know, we want it to be a welcoming community that, you know, earlier you mentioned that they will address the entire school committee and not individual members through the chair.

161
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,729
[SPEAKER_00]: So should we also have a statement in there about,

162
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,231
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we understand.

163
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:51,872
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we agree to disagree, but in respectful language and respectful tones.

164
00:19:53,073 --> 00:20:04,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just, that's what I was thinking, like, are we really creating like norms that would be said, and if so, I think we should probably add an additional statement about

165
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:18,278
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, ensuring that we want to use appropriate language and, you know, even if we're presenting divergent views, we do it in a respectful manner.

166
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I completely agree.

167
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:35,491
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the challenges is that the language that the chair will be reading, you know, after, especially after having just said the governor's statement,

168
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we don't want the chair to have to read for 15 straight minutes.

169
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:50,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that some, most of this stuff, you know, the speaker will speak to the full committee through the chair.

170
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's not our opinions.

171
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:52,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Robert Bowles.

172
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:54,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally in our city charter.

173
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:55,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not optional.

174
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:05,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, pulling that out and saying that it's just sort of highlight what I see are things that,

175
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,935
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't always adhere to as norms, even as members, frankly.

176
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:20,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question of what do we pull out and put up in the policy, this is the policy, this isn't the agenda though.

177
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:30,090
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we pull up and add into the policy and what do we not, even though it's all really there behind the scenes automatically is important.

178
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

179
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:37,507
[SPEAKER_02]: because of this being the actual policy, it can be as long as we want.

180
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:40,028
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no reason to be brief here.

181
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The current policy is surprisingly brief in my opinion.

182
00:21:46,190 --> 00:22:03,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if there's thoughts on an additional sentence about being welcoming, I mean, what I would suggest is, you know, we can certainly amend this, well, we can amend it tonight if we have that sentence, but we don't want them to go all night

183
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:20,094
[SPEAKER_02]: you could also, you know, think on it and send any one of us, you know, suggested change, and I can offer an amendment in the actual meeting when we hopefully adopt this, rather than putting us on the spot to wordsmith it and come up with a new additional statement.

184
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:22,376
[SPEAKER_02]: If that sounds okay.

185
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:27,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yes, thank you.

186
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham, yes.

187
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:56,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have any significant questions or changes to this policy revision in general, but I do think it would be wise for us to explicitly call out that there will be a timekeeper that is managing public participation, whether it be three minutes or five minutes, and that speakers will get a 15-second warning

188
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:00,725
[SPEAKER_06]: when they're approaching their time limit.

189
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:07,032
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do think, you know, obviously that has some implications about how the meetings are run and who does that.

190
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:10,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would need to be a role for somebody.

191
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:11,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think

192
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:20,325
[SPEAKER_06]: When Lisa has played that timekeeper role for us a couple of times, and I thought it's been very effective.

193
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:29,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to see us adhere to that as standard practice versus only sometimes.

194
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:37,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to see us be much more consistent about that timekeeping process so that

195
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:47,125
[SPEAKER_06]: people know what to expect when they come to a meeting and everyone is clear upfront that there will be that timekeeper.

196
00:23:47,145 --> 00:23:51,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is how they'll signal that we're out of time.

197
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:52,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

198
00:23:52,606 --> 00:23:52,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

199
00:23:52,886 --> 00:24:01,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I've been to the state house for subcommittee meetings or whatever they call them there, there's a screen, the timekeeping is going on.

200
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:04,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it's not contentious or contentious.

201
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just always there.

202
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:13,398
[SPEAKER_02]: to be expected and it will, you know, flash and then it will be, it doesn't care who you are.

203
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sort of, you know, that's the core of Robert's rules is that there's fairness and that the idea of being preferential is impossible if you follow the rules.

204
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:34,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So I certainly like that, I guess, you know, I just worry about operationally and,

205
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:45,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, superintendent, do you have thoughts on that?

206
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cause it feels to me like it's a role in addition to.

207
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: taking notes, minutes.

208
00:24:50,300 --> 00:25:02,143
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could, to allow for flexibility, I agree, you know, Lisa Evangelista, she did a very good job maintaining time for us.

209
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:11,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could say that, you know, there will be a designated timekeeper, you know, to

210
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:19,779
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to monitor or to support public participation.

211
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:30,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were saying up to three minutes, I actually would love for, at the one minute marker, for the person to be told one minute and then 15 seconds.

212
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:37,262
[SPEAKER_00]: But just while, that doesn't have to be spelled out, but just so they can keep track of their message.

213
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:44,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a designated timekeeper will be provided by the superintendent's office.

214
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:48,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think that that's perfect.

215
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:51,689
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.

216
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other comments on this before we go out of the community participation section?

217
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:02,695
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so community participation.

218
00:26:03,356 --> 00:26:10,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So the purpose of community participation, regular meetings of the school committee will include a community participation agenda item.

219
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

220
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:19,099
[SPEAKER_02]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

221
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:27,661
[SPEAKER_02]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

222
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:37,083
[SPEAKER_02]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, the member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

223
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:40,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stop there because this particular paragraph

224
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:52,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, well, first of all, I believe this is not typically how our community participation presentations are understood by most members.

225
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly they're not understood by the public.

226
00:26:55,471 --> 00:27:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is so common for somebody to come to a community participation and ask a question.

227
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:06,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly the superintendent is more than

228
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,673
[SPEAKER_02]: legally and under open meeting law can answer the question or say that she'll have somebody get back to them or whatever.

229
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:24,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But the person coming to speak does not have the opportunity to circumvent open meeting law.

230
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:33,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they bring up something within our authority, which is their only option, like if it's not within our authority, it shouldn't be here at all.

231
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:44,403
[SPEAKER_02]: if it is within our authority, then it is not on the agenda for other members of the public who might be interested in dialoguing on a particular topic.

232
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:49,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to understand that.

233
00:27:49,807 --> 00:28:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see this in meetings where people ask a question and there's like really significant concern about the fact that we aren't responding.

234
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:10,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be about a topic for which, of course, we all have opinions and we all really want to respond.

235
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really important to spell it out that this is not an opportunity to essentially circumvent open meeting law and have us start making motions and deliberating on topics.

236
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:32,846
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other reasons for which I think it's also just a bad idea.

237
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:42,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to take a presentation and assume that the superintendent may disagree with some of the information presented, for instance.

238
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:52,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair to her and the administration, and it's not fair to the members who may wanna go off and read and do some actual background work on the presentation that was given.

239
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:57,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really critical to point this out so that,

240
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's on the same page about why we all just sit like deer in their headlights when these situations come up.

241
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:15,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, I've seen some pretty nasty comments, like, I can't believe nobody had anything to say on something as important as that.

242
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:21,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is, because we are not supposed to have something to say.

243
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:25,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments on those two paragraphs under purpose?

244
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:30,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any changes or issues with what's been outlined.

245
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:32,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

246
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:44,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I also looking at the current policy, which essentially says, you know, the public can submit something to school, the superintendent for a presentation.

247
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:56,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It says nothing about, you know, I mean, if you submitted a presentation to talk about, about, you know,

248
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:59,475
[SPEAKER_02]: the speed of cars on 93.

249
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:05,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems slightly out of the authority of the school committee.

250
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And this doesn't say anything about, you know, what if the superintendent is just like, that's not appropriate.

251
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:21,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I took that first issue of like, okay, it's, you know, the things that are presented should be things within our authority.

252
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:25,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, well, what if there's a disagreement on that?

253
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:30,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I sort of went a little deep on the submitting a presentation.

254
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa, did you want to speak before I keep going?

255
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, can you hear me?

256
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

257
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

258
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,791
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just, you know, everything you're saying is appropriate, Paul.

259
00:30:46,831 --> 00:30:47,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying it's not.

260
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:50,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just saying that I don't know if the general public

261
00:30:51,794 --> 00:30:53,635
[SPEAKER_04]: knows that.

262
00:30:53,795 --> 00:31:06,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, these changes have to be made, but I'm wondering are we, are you planning to do this so we passed it say Monday night, would it go into effect for the next meeting?

263
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:17,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you gonna, you know, get a press release out and tell, you know, so people can learn about how to approach an elected body the proper way.

264
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I just,

265
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:21,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just, I don't know.

266
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this would take place in your first meeting in August or something like the new rules or something.

267
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

268
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:33,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just throwing it out there because I think that generally people aren't gonna literally know.

269
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:38,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, unless the mayor would show explain it the first night in detail, you know, I don't know.

270
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:38,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

271
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just- That's really, sorry.

272
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:46,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredibly important.

273
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's on the second I'd edge.

274
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:52,555
[SPEAKER_02]: on our agenda tonight is the agenda actual format.

275
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:56,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that will be addressed when we get to the agenda format.

276
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:03,221
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, please raise your hand and say you don't think that covers it.

277
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:14,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly the public knowing this, you know, writing a policy that gets stuck up on our policy service that nobody knows about, that's not really, that's not a good idea.

278
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:25,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So I laid out a process for submitting a presentation, which the current policy just says that it has to be sent to the superintendent before the Wednesday before noon.

279
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:29,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It says almost everything is the same.

280
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:31,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it cannot exceed five minutes in duration.

281
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:44,401
[SPEAKER_02]: This adds that it must be a topic within the authority of the school committee, which I think is really implied in the old policy, but I thought, why not just say it?

282
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:49,344
[SPEAKER_02]: The submission timeframe is the same, Wednesday before noon.

283
00:32:49,364 --> 00:33:01,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to include, we didn't say that this stuff is included, but I mean, if you sent us a presentation to the superintendent and didn't tell her who you were or anything, that would be kind of strange.

284
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:04,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it just lays out the details.

285
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:15,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happens there is the superintendent makes a determination on whether the topic is within the authority of the school committee, which is not new.

286
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:17,214
[SPEAKER_02]: always just done that.

287
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:28,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the event that the superintendent says this is not within the authority of the school committee, the person has the, what I added here is an entire appeal process.

288
00:33:29,785 --> 00:33:35,250
[SPEAKER_02]: The person would write back and say, I disagree, or I'd like to appeal this.

289
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:38,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would actually show up on the agenda.

290
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:41,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should read all of this, I'm sorry.

291
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:46,909
[SPEAKER_02]: determination made the appeal by submitting and writing to the superintendent and request for an appeal.

292
00:33:47,529 --> 00:34:03,172
[SPEAKER_02]: The appeal will be placed on the next scheduled regular meeting of the school committee under the community participation agenda item as appeals of authority determination with the full name, full Medford street address and a very brief description of the denied presentation topic.

293
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent will then, so when we get down to community participation on the agenda,

294
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:20,135
[SPEAKER_02]: this appeals and the superintendent and the presenter will have two minutes to address the committee on why the item is or is not within the authority of the school committee.

295
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:28,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, hypothetically, somebody wants to do a presentation on the performance of a teacher.

296
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is not within our authority.

297
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,680
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent would reject that.

298
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:39,423
[SPEAKER_02]: The person would have two minutes to explain why they believe that is within their authority.

299
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:42,173
[SPEAKER_02]: not the actual performance, not the presentation itself.

300
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:52,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the committee will not discuss the performance of the teacher, but we'll simply discuss whether something is within their authority or not.

301
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:58,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the vice chair or some other member make a motion to sustain the determination of the superintendent.

302
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:04,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we sustain that, then the presentation will not be coming to us.

303
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:06,785
[SPEAKER_02]: If it,

304
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:19,900
[SPEAKER_02]: is if we disagree with the superintendent, that actually this is within our authority, then at the following meeting, it will appear on the agenda, obviously under the objection of the superintendent.

305
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,262
[SPEAKER_02]: This of course does not give us the authority to, for instance, you know, violate employment law.

306
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:34,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like we're still bound by law, but I think there are plenty of situations for which

307
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:40,036
[SPEAKER_02]: there's lots of confusion about who's authority, what is our authority?

308
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:45,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I frequently have to look it up, like, well, do we really have authority here?

309
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:52,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, things like curriculum, we don't have authority to decide on the curriculum.

310
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:54,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We have authority to decide whether to buy it.

311
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there's like, there's some gray area.

312
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:05,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So I envisioned this being about the gray area and it gives the members of the public who, you know,

313
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,728
[SPEAKER_02]: took the effort to create a presentation for us.

314
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:09,910
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent is saying, no, you can't.

315
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:17,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the public needs to have an opportunity to explain or to perhaps have us override the superintendent.

316
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:20,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Edward-Vinson.

317
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:28,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this particular portion, I actually feel like I

318
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:36,653
[SPEAKER_00]: The possible example that you gave personnel is never discussed on the floor.

319
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:49,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So I almost feel like if something were to be denied, that I should use the district counsel, legal counsel, to be able to say if it's something that is clearly

320
00:36:52,379 --> 00:37:01,246
[SPEAKER_00]: not permitted that I don't even feel like the person should be presenting that at a school committee meeting because legally it's not permitted.

321
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:07,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I deliver the message we don't discuss personnel on the floor like that is that does not happen.

322
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,830
[SPEAKER_00]: That

323
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:21,797
[SPEAKER_00]: if they didn't believe what I said that I would have legal counsel and school committee could be CC'd on the legal counsel response to what was said.

324
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:38,002
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you said, if it was someone wanting to present about curriculum and present a different program that I might not have liked, but still to be able to present it, that's something that I see as permissible.

325
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:50,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so how about a step after a determination?

326
00:37:50,889 --> 00:38:07,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say the person sends you an appeal, like the superintendent will seek advice from the- District council.

327
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:09,273
[SPEAKER_02]: District council.

328
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:15,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I spell it right, that's the right one, right?

329
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:16,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too many councils.

330
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:30,637
[SPEAKER_01]: About whether to proceed with the following appeals process.

331
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:40,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Should the council determine that

332
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,816
[SPEAKER_01]: The presentation did not proceed.

333
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: The, I don't wanna say petitioner, I don't know what we call a person, the presenter will be informed.

334
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:01,845
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

335
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:11,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really, I think that's good, because I do worry about, I did worry greatly in my example, like if they can come in and even have the microphone

336
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk about personnel, they could easily go off the rails a bit, and then we get in trouble, real trouble.

337
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:29,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do like this out for our council to simply say, no, this cannot proceed, and that's the end of story.

338
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:34,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, do you think that sounds okay?

339
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:41,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, I think that makes a lot of sense and provides assurances that we don't end up

340
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,502
[SPEAKER_06]: wading into unallowed territory on the floor.

341
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:48,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

342
00:39:49,384 --> 00:40:11,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm gonna put the superintendent may seek, you know, if it's a curriculum issue and you're like, Howard, you know, he's already said many times, yeah, you know, if he throws his hands up and says, it's the gray area, then you may, you know, may not wanna ask him, but for things that you're just like, whoa, we cannot have this,

343
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:18,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other comments on the language of that?

344
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:19,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I finish reading it all?

345
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:20,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

346
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:39,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I do have this thing in here about, okay, in the event that there is no majority due to an absence, abstention or vacancy within the committee, the determination will be deemed rejected and the presentation will be placed at the next meeting agenda.

347
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:44,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, if it's a split vote for any reason, then the public

348
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:47,308
[SPEAKER_02]: presenter will be given the benefit of the doubt.

349
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:51,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It does also include that no member may vote present.

350
00:40:52,732 --> 00:41:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in my opinion, and the members can disagree, but this is a matter for which you can't just be like, I don't wanna get involved.

351
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:05,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're on the school committee, you signed up for the job, make a vote one way or the other.

352
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:14,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says that we may only vote abstain if there has been a conflict of interest that we have presented and has been determined to be valid.

353
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:23,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, can you make Melanie a co-host so she can unmute?

354
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:25,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.

355
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome, Member McLaughlin, hi.

356
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you have a question?

357
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:36,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you raising your hand because you couldn't unmute?

358
00:41:37,302 --> 00:41:39,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, yeah, raising my hand because I couldn't unmute.

359
00:41:39,502 --> 00:41:41,723
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also wanted to apologize for being late.

360
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:44,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had the chance to read through this.

361
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think those changes make sense as well.

362
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:47,826
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

363
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:54,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I make a motion to approve?

364
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, although I see Mr. Cushing has his hand up.

365
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured we should listen to him.

366
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:05,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a quick question, and I don't know if it's elsewhere.

367
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:13,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard other members say that in chambers, signs are not allowed and things of that nature.

368
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And on Zoom, it's

369
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:24,369
[SPEAKER_08]: slightly more problematic because anyone can change their background to literally anything at any time.

370
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:31,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if that's covered here or somewhere else, but that seems to be public participation.

371
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:39,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I'm like, I'm just there are moments when I'm extraordinarily

372
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,181
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, our hashtag Zoom bombs is a thing.

373
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:54,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a, as someone who helps manage the meetings on the back end, it is something that I'm continuously looking for.

374
00:42:55,023 --> 00:43:00,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not saying it needs to be a policy, but I just figured that this might be where it needs to be.

375
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:02,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

376
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:04,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Kashigi.

377
00:43:04,226 --> 00:43:10,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that, that, so there was a second sort of like level on this policy that I

378
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:19,017
[SPEAKER_02]: have refrained from, because I feel like this is a huge movement from our current policy of just a few sentences.

379
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt a bit like, do we go all the way or do we go a lot of the way and then revisit this?

380
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, because one of the things that I've also heard is, when people come to speak in the chambers, there's,

381
00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:43,672
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't have your screen, you know, the equivalent of not turning your video on doesn't exist.

382
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:53,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that I personally like wish that anybody speaking had to put their camera on.

383
00:43:53,896 --> 00:44:04,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but I think there are some issues with that that concern me that are just beyond the amount of time and scope to getting something done.

384
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:08,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I know that,

385
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:12,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Zoom allows you, for instance, to configure it so that nobody can have a background image.

386
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:17,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I joined plenty of meetings where my photo doesn't ever show up at all.

387
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:18,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always surprised.

388
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:19,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, where am I?

389
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:23,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most meetings, the photo is there.

390
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's configurable.

391
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that we have to put that in policy.

392
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a member could simply motion at a meeting and say, going forward,

393
00:44:35,355 --> 00:44:42,917
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Dr. Cushing, could you configure our meetings that don't allow people to have anything but a black screen or there's their video?

394
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:50,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is right this moment, I don't know if people have actually chosen this or if it was just a configuration that happened to be in place.

395
00:44:52,180 --> 00:45:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It is distracting, but at the same time, you know, when we go into the chambers, you know, I'm thinking of when the Red for Ed, when all the teachers were there with their red shirts on,

396
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:10,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the red shirts were speech.

397
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,717
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, you know, we didn't have name and address and we didn't have who they were.

398
00:45:17,557 --> 00:45:21,659
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have all been from another community, frankly, but there was speech and we allowed it.

399
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:34,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, thinking about that and how is that terribly different than somebody who changes their background to, you know, to Medford Pride or something else.

400
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:42,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like I have the bandwidth to philosophically work through that.

401
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:47,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And I prefer to err on the side of speech should be protected.

402
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:48,576
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the government.

403
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:57,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, freedom of speech is actually about us and what we do around it versus what the public generally thinks freedom of speech is.

404
00:45:58,865 --> 00:46:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So I prefer to go slow.

405
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:11,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are other communities that have gone much more, gone hard on this stuff.

406
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:19,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm expecting that they will go through the lawsuits and go find out what the real answer is.

407
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:22,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, other people wanna speak on this?

408
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,064
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, that's okay too.

409
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:49,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I just, I guess what I'm thinking about is that the vast majority of people who come to speak at a meeting, whether it's in person or even on zoom, like the majority of people are

410
00:46:53,387 --> 00:46:58,509
[SPEAKER_06]: behaving in a manner that allows constructive dialogue.

411
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:13,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some that don't, but at the same time, I feel like we can't get into the business of saying there can't be more than five people in chambers with a red shirt on.

412
00:47:13,754 --> 00:47:15,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And so to police

413
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,243
[SPEAKER_06]: There can't be more than five people with a red background.

414
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:35,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I just feel like it's such sticky territory that I would rather maybe keep the faith in our residents because I think they deserve it, that this on the whole can go well.

415
00:47:35,136 --> 00:47:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if it becomes a recurring issue, we may need to revisit it, but I'd rather not be preemptive about this particular issue.

416
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:48,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

417
00:47:48,883 --> 00:48:04,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think this piece from the law, which is very clear, the chair has, frankly, an enormous amount of authority around ejecting people if the person's being disruptive and they've been warned.

418
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: The chair, I read this as the chair could eject somebody from a Zoom meeting just as, I mean, if they can call the police and have them removed from a public meeting, that is consequential.

419
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:20,975
[SPEAKER_02]: consequentially the same as clicking the remove from the meeting.

420
00:48:21,155 --> 00:48:45,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in my opinion where we have enough so far, I certainly want to acknowledge though that Dr. Cushing who does our meetings from a technology perspective has to keep a remarkably high level of vigilance and stress hormones flowing to make sure that we are not zoom bombed with some truly, you know, I mean, it's not,

421
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:50,366
[SPEAKER_02]: every meeting, thankfully, but he doesn't know when it's going to come.

422
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:51,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.

423
00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:53,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to kind of like be ready at all, every moment.

424
00:48:55,271 --> 00:49:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to acknowledge that, but I don't, I don't think we're, it doesn't sound like we're ready to move towards anything more restrictive.

425
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:04,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments?

426
00:49:08,437 --> 00:49:09,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a comment.

427
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:09,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

428
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:17,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I didn't see, did you guys discuss the aspect of the full address consideration that we talked about?

429
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good, thank you.

430
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:34,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did talk about it and I did talk to, I sent an email to the, so you had communicated with me about the, what about somebody who is the victim of internet partner violence, I believe is the current language.

431
00:49:35,604 --> 00:49:37,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I emailed the,

432
00:49:38,524 --> 00:49:46,329
[SPEAKER_02]: MASC, our Schools Committee Association, to ask folks what they have done about it, how have they put that into policy explicitly.

433
00:49:47,070 --> 00:50:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I did get back was apparently there's a Massachusetts law that allows for, I don't know if it's a fake name, it's certainly a fake address, but I think also a fake name.

434
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,891
[SPEAKER_02]: for the purposes of allowing this kind of thing.

435
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:10,655
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that seems like an awful lot of work to expect to somebody who just wants to comment on a bus schedule or something.

436
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:15,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they've never needed to do that, it seems like a huge lift.

437
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:23,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is still an ongoing conversation in the responses I'm getting.

438
00:50:23,322 --> 00:50:25,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we can amend that.

439
00:50:26,578 --> 00:50:33,984
[SPEAKER_02]: or even have a separate policy that sort of covers all policies around this situation once we have some more clarity there.

440
00:50:35,085 --> 00:50:53,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess, thank you, Member Russo, and I guess I would also just like to think about, as I'm thinking about that, just to sort of think about language around presentation, you know, when we talk about how people need to reach out or if they want to do presentation or what have you that, you know,

441
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:58,988
[SPEAKER_07]: the policy just includes something that, you know, if accommodations are required to let us know, right?

442
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:17,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically if I'm imagining somebody who, you know, maybe doesn't communicate with words and uses a, you know, maybe has cerebral palsy, is not communicating with words, needs a device to be able to articulate, or not needs a device, but needs a system technologically to be able to communicate with their device, right?

443
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:21,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Like any sort of accommodation like that for public presentation, I think we should just be thinking about,

444
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,882
[SPEAKER_07]: align like that in all of our policy, right?

445
00:51:25,902 --> 00:51:27,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if there are combinations of, yeah.

446
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:30,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, sorry, let me interrupt.

447
00:51:31,627 --> 00:51:47,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think along the same lines, we may wanna have a separate policy to, because then we can, if you have a separate policy that affects all policy, you can tweak and change and update, especially as the law changes and not have to run around and find all the instances where it is.

448
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:50,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I certainly,

449
00:51:52,293 --> 00:51:59,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take a note on that, because I think that's a, you know, I have not looked through our policy manual to see if such a thing already exists.

450
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: We should get moving along.

451
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:06,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to approve this for the full committee?

452
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:08,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

453
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:09,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

454
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:11,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

455
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:13,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

456
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

457
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

458
00:52:16,711 --> 00:52:17,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

459
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:19,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Member, so yes, three in the affirmative.

460
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:21,955
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be sent up to the school committee

461
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:29,086
[SPEAKER_02]: at our May 10th meeting for approval.

462
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:33,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're gonna move on to the second part.

463
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:44,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one is, our current policy BEDB is for our, it's incredibly brief.

464
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:45,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show it to you real quick.

465
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And BEDB-E is the policy that includes the specific

466
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:52,274
[SPEAKER_02]: of our agenda.

467
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with the- Point of information.

468
00:52:54,695 --> 00:52:54,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

469
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:58,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you tell us what BEDB stands for?

470
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we could spell it out the first time so folks know what that actually is.

471
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:03,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't stand for anything.

472
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a numbering system.

473
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's an alphabetical in order numbering system.

474
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

475
00:53:10,283 --> 00:53:15,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the B I believe stands for, let's see, board governance.

476
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:19,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But then under that- Yeah, I see what it is.

477
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:21,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

478
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:21,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

479
00:53:21,883 --> 00:53:27,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to figure it out myself, but I, and so many policies could belong in multiple places.

480
00:53:27,906 --> 00:53:39,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder why they don't, why don't we use numbers then instead, because it just begs that with all the acronyms that exist in education, this sort of opens the question for me, like, well, what does that acronym mean?

481
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:43,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it means nothing, like, why are we not using numbers?

482
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:45,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe it's just because that's the way it was done before.

483
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:46,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

484
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:46,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

485
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:54,127
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you went to another school committee and looked up BEDG minutes would be what you would find there.

486
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:58,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So we subscribe to the service from MASC.

487
00:53:58,791 --> 00:54:00,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

488
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:04,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this dash E for instance, most people don't have it.

489
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:10,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that once you start adding things in a finer granularity, they just start adding letters.

490
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:16,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So our current meeting agenda policy, which I am recommending we actually

491
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know the language to retire.

492
00:54:19,282 --> 00:54:23,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real language, lists the order of business.

493
00:54:24,905 --> 00:54:30,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe this is in fact what we have done.

494
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:37,552
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had many conversations about the problems with this.

495
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:41,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just showing this to you before we go to my suggestions.

496
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:45,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also this other one here called agenda format.

497
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:45,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't read it.

498
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:53,951
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is just the arrangement of the agenda, who will do it.

499
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:59,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And nothing in here is being changed in my suggested policy.

500
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me come back up here.

501
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:13,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had initially been working towards very, very slow evolution of our agenda, but I feel like we keep coming into things where it's like,

502
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:19,688
[SPEAKER_02]: it's time to stop being quite so evolutionary and to just take a big bite here.

503
00:55:19,988 --> 00:55:28,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a policy that when implemented by Susie, frankly, will create the agenda.

504
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a result, it is not a typical policy.

505
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:38,952
[SPEAKER_02]: At the bottom here, there's this document format information.

506
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:44,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It says that things are italicized, indicates that they should be filled in when building the agenda.

507
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:55,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Content that is in quotes must be read by the chair and information in the brackets is purely instructional and does not get included in the actual agenda.

508
00:55:56,084 --> 00:56:01,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some policy before there's some actual formatting.

509
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:10,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Superintendent conferring with the chair of the school committee will rearrange the order of the items on meeting agendas as provided in this policy.

510
00:56:10,383 --> 00:56:26,190
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee will be judicious in their use of rearranging the agenda at a meeting as this can lead to open meeting about complaints when an item was indicated to be later in the agenda, but it's suddenly taken up early, resulting in a limitation of the public to participate in our open meetings.

511
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:30,992
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw this in city council where something was early in the meeting, it was tabled and then like,

512
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:35,086
[SPEAKER_02]: At midnight, it was taken from the table and nobody was paying any attention anymore.

513
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:39,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think there was anything malicious going on there, but the public was not happy.

514
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:56,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we put something as the 12th thing on our agenda and you're making dinner or whatever else you're doing, and then suddenly it's the first thing on the agenda and you come to the meeting an hour in and we're on number five and you're there for number 10, but number 10 never comes because it was taken early.

515
00:56:57,058 --> 00:57:06,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be far more judicious with our use of that and just rearrange the agenda before we actually send it out to the public.

516
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:08,725
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're gonna do.

517
00:57:09,686 --> 00:57:11,747
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my logic behind that language.

518
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I literally said those exactly those same words right here.

519
00:57:18,111 --> 00:57:24,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Superintendent in consultation with the chair will rearrange the agenda prior to the posting of the meeting to accommodate presentations to the committee

520
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: as may happen from time to time, but these may not include community participation presentations.

521
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:53,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So frequently, if we have somebody coming to present on some product we've purchased or curriculum, we've asked somebody to come from Harvard or something to come and speak about some project, making them spend all night waiting to do their presentation is just ridiculous and not professional.

522
00:57:54,423 --> 00:58:06,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Rearranging the agenda to move those people up ahead of time to the early part of the agenda is totally normal and allowed, but community presentation should be in the format.

523
00:58:06,452 --> 00:58:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be in line.

524
00:58:07,573 --> 00:58:10,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be that community participation just is wherever.

525
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:16,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Any school committee member, staff member, or resident may suggest items of business.

526
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,723
[SPEAKER_02]: The inclusion of such items, however, will be to the discretion of the chair of the committee.

527
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:26,404
[SPEAKER_02]: A staff member who wishes to have a topic scheduled on the agenda should submit the request to the superintendent.

528
00:58:26,844 --> 00:58:27,764
[SPEAKER_02]: That's current language.

529
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:41,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I may have moved or changed the words slightly, but the agenda together with supporting materials will be distributed to the school committee members at least three days prior to the meeting to an adequate time to prepare for the meeting.

530
00:58:41,767 --> 00:58:50,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Materials that are already earlier than the three days prior to the meeting should be distributed to the school committee members when these materials are substantial in length.

531
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:59,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking if we're gonna get a 500 page document about a Harvard study, Friday evening isn't gonna be enough time for me to read it for Monday.

532
00:58:59,857 --> 00:59:08,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not a, it happens frankly a couple of times a year and we need time to actually read the stuff.

533
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:13,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Agendas will be posted in the compliance of the meeting law and be available to the press.

534
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:16,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the bulk of this.

535
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:18,589
[SPEAKER_02]: The format of the agenda will be,

536
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:25,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff I've taken from city council that I have found very, very just nice.

537
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:30,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And what number of meeting of regular meeting of the Metric School Committee are we in?

538
00:59:31,814 --> 00:59:33,835
[SPEAKER_02]: The first, the 12th, whatever.

539
00:59:35,336 --> 00:59:42,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously the very first time Susie does this, she'll have to go and look and count, but then from then forward, she'll know, cause she'll just look at the last one.

540
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: The month of the date and the time, the meeting location,

541
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:53,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I have specified a few options.

542
00:59:54,852 --> 01:00:07,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of this new format is to compensate for our current situation of being on Zoom and to also compensate for when we get off of Zoom or we're also on Zoom so that we don't have to redo this all over.

543
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:17,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So meeting location would be remote by Zoom only or in-person at the and then Alden Chambers and by Zoom or in-person at the

544
01:00:18,412 --> 01:00:29,435
[SPEAKER_02]: superintendents conference room only, whatever is the right language, but then this is all part of the policy.

545
01:00:29,495 --> 01:00:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So any active provisions of emergency orders.

546
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that giant blob.

547
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,457
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's active, it'll be here.

548
01:00:37,477 --> 01:00:39,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it goes away, it'll be gone.

549
01:00:39,537 --> 01:00:43,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And then should there be another reason for emergency orders, they would just be inserted.

550
01:00:44,398 --> 01:00:45,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to change the policy.

551
01:00:48,446 --> 01:00:50,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, we get to the actual agenda.

552
01:00:50,306 --> 01:00:52,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call of attendance of members and the student representative.

553
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:55,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Salute the flag.

554
01:00:55,688 --> 01:01:01,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next is community participation, which has been moved way up.

555
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:06,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at lots of other communities, this is pretty normal.

556
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:08,331
[SPEAKER_02]: They put community participation way up.

557
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:14,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's, I think that's just respectful.

558
01:01:14,373 --> 01:01:15,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

559
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:17,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

560
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:27,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering about, and maybe this comes under the suspend the order, but I'm wondering about when we know that there's a lot of people to speak on a particular topic.

561
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:36,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to wait until sometimes there's a, you know, there's a, the superintendent is discussing the topic and then people want to respond to this discussion of the topic.

562
01:01:36,629 --> 01:01:42,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just thinking about times in the past where I've been in meetings and I'm sure you guys have been there as well.

563
01:01:42,391 --> 01:01:45,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you have member Rousseau where the room's been packed to speak about

564
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:46,792
[SPEAKER_07]: a particular topic.

565
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:51,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I wonder if in that instance, it makes sense because there's a ton of people talking about that topic.

566
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:59,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we just sort of go on to the normal procedural stuff as opposed to having this community conversation.

567
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:05,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that is so this is just the presentations that we just discussed.

568
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,222
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not you have something to say about an item on the agenda.

569
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:14,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So it based on my experience in the last year and a half, I

570
01:02:16,455 --> 01:02:22,597
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% of the time there is no public, there is no community, there's nobody doing a presentation.

571
01:02:24,878 --> 01:02:26,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have one on dyslexia.

572
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:29,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we have that?

573
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I forget.

574
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just those, this is not the public comment.

575
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:40,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we could articulate that so that we are the presentation specifically not public comment yet.

576
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:42,442
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna need to include this community.

577
01:02:42,462 --> 01:02:43,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just read this.

578
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:51,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just read this out loud because it answers some of the questions that the superintendent and Lisa had earlier, I think prior to your joining.

579
01:02:52,127 --> 01:03:02,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a sort of a summary slash rewording of much of the policy we just worked on, trying to make it so that the chair does not have to read for half an hour.

580
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:11,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this community participation agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

581
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

582
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:27,120
[SPEAKER_02]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the, probably should find another word for that, but to the committee, but are not opportunities to dialogue with the committee.

583
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,483
[SPEAKER_02]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, the member may,

584
01:03:34,738 --> 01:03:44,040
[SPEAKER_02]: A member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

585
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:52,421
[SPEAKER_02]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BDH public comment and community participation.

586
01:03:54,342 --> 01:04:00,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So this part here, Lisa had asked about earlier,

587
01:04:01,786 --> 01:04:05,268
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really a substantial clarification.

588
01:04:05,328 --> 01:04:08,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actually a change, but for most people it will look like a change.

589
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:15,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this will be part, so this stuff in quotes would be read by the mayor every single meeting, sort of like a refresher.

590
01:04:16,094 --> 01:04:16,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, member McLaughlin.

591
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess this is, and I can understand sort of the questions around this.

592
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:41,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm thinking about in the past, before I was on the school committee, you know, when we would come on multiple occasions, either presenting as part of the special ed parent advisory council or concerns from the, you know, annual report or concerns from the special ed parent advisory council about things that, you know, we were hoping would be discussed or communicated.

593
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:45,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a huge, and it had- This is not those though.

594
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:46,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

595
01:04:46,893 --> 01:04:47,753
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not those.

596
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the normal business, you know, CPAC presentations or the PTO presentations.

597
01:04:58,081 --> 01:04:59,302
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not those things.

598
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:00,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

599
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:06,483
[SPEAKER_07]: This is strictly non-organization, individual participation presentations.

600
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:07,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're saying?

601
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:09,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it could be a community group, I guess, right?

602
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:10,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

603
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:17,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the example from the last year that is most salient is Ms.

604
01:05:17,765 --> 01:05:19,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronay presents on dyslexia.

605
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:34,247
[SPEAKER_02]: or I frankly am running short of other presentations, but this is anybody in the community, they want to do a presentation to us about something within our authority.

606
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:37,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the things on our schedule.

607
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:38,469
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that schedule.

608
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:40,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the CPAC presentation is in there.

609
01:05:41,991 --> 01:05:48,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I do expect this to be usually empty as it frequently is now.

610
01:05:49,716 --> 01:05:55,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think having this here and explicit may make members of the public feel that they want to do one.

611
01:05:56,983 --> 01:05:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's bad.

612
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:09,694
[SPEAKER_02]: If every week we have 15 presentations, we're going to have to revisit this, but that's always been the policy, so it's not like it's new.

613
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:14,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I think just making it if I may and I think also just making it really clear.

614
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:29,326
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the case if somebody is coming before us to present and I know that this will be read at every meeting but also just either the chair through the chair I would assume, making it very clear that we appreciate the presentation and we want to let you know that, you know, we appreciate

615
01:06:30,026 --> 01:06:33,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it can be put on an agenda for discussion in the next meeting.

616
01:06:34,547 --> 01:06:37,828
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're, you know, based on our policy, we can't discuss it at this meeting.

617
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:44,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So that I just think it's going to be awkward if somebody comes before us with a presentation, and then we're like, okay, thank you.

618
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:45,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody responds, right.

619
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:56,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we need to make it really clear that it needs to be because we need to allow members of the community to understand and give us a time to

620
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: review the presentation so that we can respond?

621
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:00,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that why this is here?

622
01:07:01,992 --> 01:07:05,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you turned just after we finished that conversation.

623
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sorry.

624
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sorry.

625
01:07:08,634 --> 01:07:09,395
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's okay.

626
01:07:09,415 --> 01:07:09,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

627
01:07:09,915 --> 01:07:13,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have you got to ask your questions here.

628
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, so this is about, you know, the presentation.

629
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean any recent presentation.

630
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,181
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not fact checking presentations.

631
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:26,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not fact checking the law that might be referenced.

632
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,182
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not

633
01:07:29,138 --> 01:07:33,061
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, I sit down at PowerPoint and I write what I wanna write.

634
01:07:34,642 --> 01:07:38,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it on Wednesday and I send it to the superintendent.

635
01:07:39,485 --> 01:07:51,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not it's accurate, whether the superintendent may want to do some work to respond, whether we may wanna go and do our own research as members and investigate, well, is that what I heard?

636
01:07:51,414 --> 01:07:53,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really what I, is that true?

637
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:54,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that takes,

638
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:13,187
[SPEAKER_02]: time and energy and planning that is completely, it would be short circuited if members of the public could just simply come in and decide our agenda, which is really what would be happening here.

639
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we also are not supposed to be deliberating on this.

640
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:23,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So this by its nature has to be stuff within our authority.

641
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:24,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So

642
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:37,539
[SPEAKER_02]: if this is within our authority and the presentation is within our authority, if we start talking about it and make emotions and like that's deliberation and it's not on the agenda as our business.

643
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:53,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I know this is your first term and I don't mean that in any way other than simply a statement, but in Zoom it's very different, but in the actual Alden Chambers,

644
01:08:54,776 --> 01:09:03,538
[SPEAKER_02]: we would have a presentation come to us and we would all sit there like deer in the headlights and not say anything.

645
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:12,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the presenter was asking a question for which we all wanted to answer, we would not answer.

646
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:16,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was super awkward, so awkward.

647
01:09:16,962 --> 01:09:22,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this language can make it clear that this is why.

648
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:25,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't that we don't care.

649
01:09:25,425 --> 01:09:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of us is probably gonna reach out to you about, you know, maybe getting this on the agenda.

650
01:09:31,928 --> 01:09:42,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I see this same problem happen at City Council and not problem, but I see this same scenario roll out City Council and at other meetings and other communities.

651
01:09:43,172 --> 01:09:43,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

652
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:46,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, that's interesting.

653
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:47,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

654
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,755
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

655
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else wanna talk on the community participation statement look okay?

656
01:09:54,784 --> 01:09:59,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I do realize now that, oh, actually, let's move on to the report of the superintendent.

657
01:10:00,808 --> 01:10:04,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh, that's just the report of the superintendent.

658
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:06,432
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff under here is not related to that.

659
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:09,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So being that this is the policy, it looks wonky.

660
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:16,338
[SPEAKER_02]: When it gets actually created, an agenda gets created, it won't look so weird.

661
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:20,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So the superintendent's report would come next after community participation.

662
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:22,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that sometimes is a little later.

663
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:24,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It is later.

664
01:10:24,668 --> 01:10:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, I've certainly heard the feedback that that's the best part of the meeting.

665
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:32,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It's often the best part of the meeting for me.

666
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:35,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving it way up, I think is really important.

667
01:10:37,194 --> 01:10:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next part.

668
01:10:38,475 --> 01:10:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, again, so pursuant to policy BEDH, the public comment and community participation.

669
01:10:45,895 --> 01:10:51,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item of the agenda for up to three minutes.

670
01:10:51,436 --> 01:10:52,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we've just read this whole thing.

671
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna read it all again to you.

672
01:10:56,557 --> 01:11:07,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's that a welcoming community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal about our rights and responsibilities regardless of the duration in our city.

673
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when writing provide all of those details.

674
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just gets read.

675
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:23,815
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a, at that moment, people can start raising their hands to talk because that's not actually an item on the agenda.

676
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:30,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But prior to this, there's nothing on the agenda for the community to raise their hands and talk about.

677
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:43,490
[SPEAKER_02]: The roll call, the presentation by another member of the community, the superintendent's update, that's not the time when we have community people raising their hands to ask questions.

678
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:46,434
[SPEAKER_02]: After that though, is what we do.

679
01:11:46,514 --> 01:11:55,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, the superintendent would, sorry, the chair would read that language, and then we would go straight into stuff that is often earlier.

680
01:11:55,236 --> 01:12:00,157
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the report of subcommittees, and if there are none, I'll say none.

681
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:01,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

682
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:07,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Russo, could you change that to report of committees?

683
01:12:08,145 --> 01:12:13,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this also includes special meetings, committee of the wholes.

684
01:12:13,848 --> 01:12:28,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the language on the, even though subcommittees are also clearly delineated there, I just wanted it to, if you could make that tweak.

685
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:29,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

686
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

687
01:12:32,146 --> 01:12:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next, so continued business.

688
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:37,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

689
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:47,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you continue, I think in a prior meeting, we talked about the committee of the wholes and the special meetings being part of the consent agenda, superintendent.

690
01:12:48,573 --> 01:13:09,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Um because they because they are attended by the entire group we're really just approving minutes where the report of committees the because they are subcommittees they are not attended by everybody and the the the chair typically provides an update and then the minutes are voted on so I think this was

691
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:30,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the original intent was just simply that this was the subcommittees because there would be like an actual report out and then approving the minutes versus like the committee of the holes are just going to be part of the consent agenda, which is a little bit further down where we are just like in one fell swoop, approving all of that stuff without discussion, because it's just a matter of approving minutes.

692
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:32,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

693
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:33,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Graham.

694
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:36,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot all about that, even though I wrote this.

695
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:37,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

696
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.

697
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So continued business, this is formerly known as old business.

698
01:13:43,942 --> 01:13:48,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go to another school committee conference and they yell at us for using the words old business.

699
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:53,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's apparently very much not an acceptable way to describe things.

700
01:13:54,147 --> 01:13:56,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be items that were tabled from a previous meeting.

701
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:05,173
[SPEAKER_02]: We sometimes struggle with this, but we table something to the next meeting and then we sort of forget.

702
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:12,370
[SPEAKER_02]: the most recent example is the face mask policy.

703
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:21,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We tabled it to the meeting, the very next meeting, and this is not a criticism, by the way, of anybody here.

704
01:14:22,553 --> 01:14:24,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, I didn't even realize it until it was too late.

705
01:14:25,634 --> 01:14:28,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is continued business, anything we've tabled.

706
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:34,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realized that I think we have a lot to learn from the city council.

707
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:38,932
[SPEAKER_02]: this is not the end game here as far as I'm concerned.

708
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a numbering system for motions and all that other stuff that the city council has that I think is excellent.

709
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:47,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff doesn't just kind of get lost.

710
01:14:49,116 --> 01:14:53,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I look at why it doesn't get lost, it's because it has a number.

711
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:57,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have a number and we can have a what happened to it.

712
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:03,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't go there in this particular agenda update to this policy yet.

713
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:11,428
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that has been tabled will show up on this list.

714
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:26,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be disposed of by an up or down vote to approve or deny it, or the member who submitted it, one of the members who submitted it can withdraw the item so that it just drops off the agenda going forward.

715
01:15:28,351 --> 01:15:34,412
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something I imagine where we have a motion, it gets tabled, and then come the next meeting,

716
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:37,326
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually resolved and not even needed anymore.

717
01:15:37,606 --> 01:15:40,187
[SPEAKER_02]: The member can just motion to withdraw it.

718
01:15:42,448 --> 01:15:45,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entire item will be on the agenda.

719
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:56,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So as it was when it was under new business, this is actually necessary to comply with meeting law versus just having a placeholder that doesn't tell anybody anything.

720
01:15:57,293 --> 01:16:02,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've indicated that it would say tabled on and then the date so we can all

721
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:12,197
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe once a year go through our table stuff and say, all right, I don't want that anymore and get the agenda down from 40 pages down to three again.

722
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:17,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions on continued business?

723
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:20,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

724
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:22,284
[SPEAKER_02]: New business is new business.

725
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:28,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's practically the only thing on here I didn't think needed to change other than where in the agenda it is.

726
01:16:29,468 --> 01:16:34,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the consent agenda, which we have previously approved in the full school committee.

727
01:16:35,953 --> 01:16:41,477
[SPEAKER_02]: This just simply moves it in the actual agenda and I've added language.

728
01:16:41,838 --> 01:16:54,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, I'm trying to make this policy both descriptive and instructive and prescriptive so that, you know, the chair will know how do you do this the first time the chair sees this.

729
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:57,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the chair will ask, is there a motion to approve the consent agenda?

730
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the words.

731
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:03,803
[SPEAKER_02]: That won't be on the agenda.

732
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:07,846
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not gonna be printed on the agenda, but that will be in the policy.

733
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:19,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So the actual agenda would show, consent agenda, and then on the next line would be like, number one, approval of minutes for a date, approval of payrolls, approval of bills.

734
01:17:19,775 --> 01:17:22,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the chair will ask this.

735
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody hopefully will motion to approve the consent agenda.

736
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:26,980
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a second.

737
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,601
[SPEAKER_02]: we do the vote and then everything on there is just approved.

738
01:17:32,801 --> 01:17:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if there's something in there that a member wants to talk about, we have a consent agenda.

739
01:17:41,803 --> 01:17:45,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I sometimes have an edit to the minutes of a particular meeting.

740
01:17:46,264 --> 01:17:49,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not offer my edit.

741
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, I would like a division to take item number four out.

742
01:17:55,246 --> 01:17:57,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the rest of it is approved.

743
01:17:58,499 --> 01:18:03,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And then item number four is called specifically, and then I could make my change to the minutes.

744
01:18:04,017 --> 01:18:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Edward Benson, did you have a question?

745
01:18:05,988 --> 01:18:22,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I just was going to ask, based on the feedback that member Graham shared, if you could put within that consent agenda, committee of the wholes and special meetings, because it's only three of you who are here right now.

746
01:18:22,774 --> 01:18:28,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this is a significant shift from what we've done before.

747
01:18:31,318 --> 01:18:35,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that anything where all seven of you are

748
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:37,687
[SPEAKER_00]: present.

749
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:50,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they understand that that's where the distinction is between consent agenda and the previous section about reporting out on subcommittee activity.

750
01:18:51,637 --> 01:18:51,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

751
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:52,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

752
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:54,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

753
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:55,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's an interesting distinction.

754
01:18:55,926 --> 01:19:08,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So does that mean that if we're in the consent agenda and we don't ask for a division of the subcommittee meetings, we're not sharing with the community what occurred at the subcommittee meetings as we have in the past?

755
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:12,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that we are on paper, but we're not actually explaining it.

756
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,911
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's number five up here, the report of subcommittee.

757
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you mean by special meetings?

758
01:19:22,668 --> 01:19:22,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

759
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:23,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

760
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:33,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the, if a special meeting is just, if a meeting is called, we had a special meeting just before we closed the schools for the pandemic.

761
01:19:34,297 --> 01:19:37,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not a committee of the whole, it's not a regular meeting, it's a special meeting.

762
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:44,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think there's been two in my three and a half years and they're never for good reasons, so.

763
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:48,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a special meeting, we're not happy.

764
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:56,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see, the next is item number nine, reports requested.

765
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:11,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will take a little time to get us to really be in compliance with this policy because a lot of the information that is listed here, I don't know that we necessarily had our fingertips.

766
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:21,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, you know, the first time this new policy is used to draft an agenda, it may not end up perfect

767
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:22,671
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine, we'll get there.

768
01:20:23,892 --> 01:20:30,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be a list of the reports that are outstanding that we have approved.

769
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:35,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chair will ask, are there any updates on outstanding reports?

770
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:38,945
[SPEAKER_02]: The superintendent may provide an update on any item.

771
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:42,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Members may ask for an update to their particular report.

772
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:46,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been waiting for this report since June last year, is it coming or not?

773
01:20:48,174 --> 01:20:50,476
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we also can, by the way, send an email.

774
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:52,017
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to make everything public.

775
01:20:54,619 --> 01:20:56,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything doesn't have to happen in public as individuals.

776
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:02,524
[SPEAKER_02]: We can ask the superintendent these questions about whether something's forthcoming.

777
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,607
[SPEAKER_02]: We may request that it be rescinded.

778
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:15,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got approval for a report and it turns out, oh, well, that's actually a report that the DESE website has.

779
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:16,935
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, none of us knew it.

780
01:21:17,756 --> 01:21:21,619
[SPEAKER_02]: we found out later we wanna ask for it to be removed or it's just not important.

781
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be reports on the first day of school during the pandemic.

782
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:31,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna bet that if we have some, it might be okay to rescind those.

783
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just details on how to do that.

784
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:43,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Only members have asked for the report may rescind them unless the requester is no longer on the committee.

785
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:46,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a former member

786
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:48,966
[SPEAKER_02]: has requested a report, it should still be here.

787
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:53,368
[SPEAKER_02]: We voted as a committee, it is the committee's request.

788
01:21:54,348 --> 01:22:02,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that member is no longer here, the members may, any member may ask for it to be rescinded, it would have to be voted of course.

789
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:15,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the reports would list the following information, the date the report was approved by the committee, the name of the report, the members that requested the report and the date the report is or was expected.

790
01:22:17,894 --> 01:22:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And our whole report policy, which we approved in 2019, does require a name, for instance, of a report.

791
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,480
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it should be there.

792
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:34,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions on that?

793
01:22:37,923 --> 01:22:39,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is new.

794
01:22:39,964 --> 01:22:43,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it on agendas and I absolutely adore it more than I can tell you.

795
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:45,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The next meeting's listing.

796
01:22:47,497 --> 01:22:55,441
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be a list in, you know, I understand this is not always gonna be complete, especially when there's those big three week gaps between meetings.

797
01:22:55,961 --> 01:23:01,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be all of our meetings between now and the next regular meeting, inclusive of the next regular meeting.

798
01:23:02,405 --> 01:23:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So not the whole year, but subcommittees, committee halls, special meetings, hearings, and the next regular meeting, the date, the time, and the meeting location.

799
01:23:14,391 --> 01:23:16,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the Zoom information is available,

800
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,241
[SPEAKER_02]: and that would be handy too.

801
01:23:18,481 --> 01:23:20,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

802
01:23:20,622 --> 01:23:37,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna make a suggestion that the next meetings part become an appendix so that there's no obligation for the chair to be reading off like the list, but instead it's just available as part of the agenda.

803
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:41,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the condolences could be read, the meeting could be adjourned.

804
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:50,299
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't, this list doesn't need to be read out loud, but just simply the fact that it's there, I think is important.

805
01:23:50,379 --> 01:24:03,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, you know, when we get to the end of the meeting, whatever time that may be, like reading this list is not gonna be meaningful for anybody as so much as having it on the agenda would be.

806
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:05,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

807
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:09,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, I definitely did not envision that this would get read at all.

808
01:24:11,287 --> 01:24:29,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And although sometimes the chair might want to say the next regular meeting is, but so I've changed the actual text from next meetings to next meetings and then for informational or informational information only just informational.

809
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:36,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I added to the instructions that the chair would know that this is not read.

810
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:39,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I agree.

811
01:24:41,106 --> 01:24:43,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there other things on here that should not be read?

812
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:45,788
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

813
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:48,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, reports requested.

814
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:52,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

815
01:24:52,732 --> 01:24:54,532
[SPEAKER_02]: She simply will ask, are there any updates?

816
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that satisfy that number, Graham?

817
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's fine.

818
01:25:01,956 --> 01:25:03,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I added condolences as an actual thing.

819
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:10,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally on every single meeting, unfortunately, and we don't have it officially part of our agenda.

820
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,280
[SPEAKER_02]: policy.

821
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:20,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So I so I know it's a lot to digest.

822
01:25:20,207 --> 01:25:27,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I sort of look, look at this is we try and then whatever doesn't work, we come back and fix it.

823
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:29,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope that looks good.

824
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:48,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to suggest that you reverse the numbers for condolences where condolences used to be under the new classified under new business.

825
01:25:49,077 --> 01:26:02,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're having condolences that it be Roman numeral 10 and 11, I actually like having it listed as an appendix, but if it needs to be numbered, then leave that as,

826
01:26:04,675 --> 01:26:12,698
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 because we also list all of the upcoming meetings on our weekly communications for one week at a time.

827
01:26:13,358 --> 01:26:19,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parents and community have access to it on a weekly basis as well, upcoming meetings.

828
01:26:22,061 --> 01:26:23,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's smart.

829
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:29,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also sort of reinforces that number 11 doesn't actually get read.

830
01:26:30,723 --> 01:26:32,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I will actually, I just realized that

831
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:33,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

832
01:26:33,637 --> 01:26:34,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

833
01:26:34,138 --> 01:26:34,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

834
01:26:35,379 --> 01:26:35,739
[SPEAKER_02]: That adjournment.

835
01:26:35,759 --> 01:26:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally on agendas.

836
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:38,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

837
01:26:41,303 --> 01:26:42,164
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have that there.

838
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:45,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Um Motion to approve.

839
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:46,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

840
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:48,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

841
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:50,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

842
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:52,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

843
01:26:53,132 --> 01:26:53,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

844
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:55,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, three and affirmative.

845
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:04,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have.

846
01:27:04,546 --> 01:27:05,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The last item on our agenda.

847
01:27:06,107 --> 01:27:06,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you,

848
01:27:33,242 --> 01:27:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the right one up.

849
01:27:35,423 --> 01:27:37,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, is this the right one?

850
01:27:37,483 --> 01:27:37,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

851
01:27:40,384 --> 01:27:41,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just double check.

852
01:27:42,144 --> 01:27:43,885
[SPEAKER_08]: If you scroll down.

853
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:46,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Down or up, whatever that is.

854
01:27:47,186 --> 01:27:53,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I changed the reporter to say Director of Pupil Services.

855
01:27:57,649 --> 01:27:58,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Where?

856
01:27:59,889 --> 01:28:00,770
[SPEAKER_06]: The second to last page.

857
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,521
[SPEAKER_06]: under record-keeping requirements.

858
01:28:08,321 --> 01:28:09,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

859
01:28:10,983 --> 01:28:11,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.

860
01:28:11,424 --> 01:28:11,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.

861
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:26,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it you changed?

862
01:28:26,154 --> 01:28:26,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

863
01:28:26,754 --> 01:28:31,117
[SPEAKER_08]: So where it says the contact information for the district Title IX coordinator is as follows.

864
01:28:31,177 --> 01:28:33,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It should read Director of Pupil Services.

865
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:35,200
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

866
01:28:42,122 --> 01:28:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are, by the way, just for some context, this is a policy we approved.

867
01:28:46,483 --> 01:28:52,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually not supposed to be editing my, let me create a copy.

868
01:28:58,185 --> 01:29:04,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only change to this policy is the Title IX coordinator, correct?

869
01:29:08,347 --> 01:29:11,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me just turn on my camera.

870
01:29:11,798 --> 01:29:13,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Rude, not to have my camera on, I apologize.

871
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:29,672
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were reviewing with council, this was recommended to be implemented wholesale, just to make sure that our policies are complete in this area.

872
01:29:32,045 --> 01:29:39,348
[SPEAKER_08]: And so another edit that I made, I apologize it didn't save, is when we're looking at Medford High School.

873
01:29:40,288 --> 01:29:49,631
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you'll notice that there's a, and I know what happened in the conversion from Microsoft Word to Google Docs, sometimes doesn't exactly play nice.

874
01:29:51,112 --> 01:29:58,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Medford High School, and then you could just put MVTHS on that.

875
01:30:03,517 --> 01:30:03,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And then.

876
01:30:05,117 --> 01:30:05,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Conversion.

877
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:07,878
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some conversion stuff going on here.

878
01:30:07,898 --> 01:30:11,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.

879
01:30:19,942 --> 01:30:21,462
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford High School assistant.

880
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:24,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Assistant principal.

881
01:30:24,023 --> 01:30:24,963
[SPEAKER_07]: M-A-T-H-S, Paul.

882
01:30:25,463 --> 01:30:26,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

883
01:30:28,884 --> 01:30:31,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Assistant principal.

884
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:35,849
[SPEAKER_08]: and middle school?

885
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:45,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question, so at each level, there should be one, it appears based on the way the policy was written by MASC.

886
01:30:48,197 --> 01:30:51,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did not add in every school's assistant principal.

887
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,021
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I could see, you know, there should be one person that these are reported to.

888
01:30:59,181 --> 01:31:11,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So an assistant principal at Medford High School, Medford Votational, an assistant principal at one of the two middle schools, and an assistant principal at one of the four elementary schools.

889
01:31:12,224 --> 01:31:20,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we just need to make sure that in the student handbooks, that those are very clearly articulated, because that might be a person that you're not necessarily familiar with.

890
01:31:24,865 --> 01:31:27,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to have one individual for each level.

891
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:29,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

892
01:31:30,008 --> 01:31:45,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, you know, operationally, if I'm going through this as somebody who wants to file a complaint or something, you know, there's four assistant principals at the high school, there's two in the middle school, there's four in the elementary schools.

893
01:31:45,538 --> 01:31:52,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we write that to make it clear?

894
01:31:52,102 --> 01:31:52,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember McLaughlin?

895
01:31:53,663 --> 01:31:53,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

896
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,821
[SPEAKER_07]: We also need to include Curtis Tufts.

897
01:31:59,423 --> 01:32:06,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would, to member McLaughlin's point, I would simply add another slash and put CTHS.

898
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:13,732
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the other thing you could put is just Medford High Schools.

899
01:32:16,673 --> 01:32:18,355
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it works this way.

900
01:32:20,016 --> 01:32:22,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but back to my question about,

901
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:28,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's Chandler Street?

902
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:30,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, sorry.

903
01:32:31,881 --> 01:32:32,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a member of that?

904
01:32:33,442 --> 01:32:34,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so.

905
01:32:34,903 --> 01:32:35,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry.

906
01:32:36,064 --> 01:32:36,844
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some updates.

907
01:32:37,244 --> 01:32:48,210
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the other, I mean, you can delete that, and then the phone number might be beneficial to put the central office phone number, where then it can then be sent out.

908
01:32:49,551 --> 01:32:52,172
[SPEAKER_08]: from there.

909
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:57,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we have here is a nexus of policy and then the procedure that will follow it.

910
01:32:57,955 --> 01:33:06,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the procedure will be clearly articulated in the handbooks as to who needs to be specifically contacted.

911
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:18,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Say like, you know, if you have an issue with sexual harassment, you need to reach out to boom, this elementary assistant principal who has received either specialized investigatory training or something along those lines

912
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: where, you know, that it can be properly investigated.

913
01:33:25,347 --> 01:33:30,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so would you, do we want actual names here or?

914
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:37,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think in the, so, and, you know, I don't think in the policy you would have specific names.

915
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I think here you could have the district contact information, and then you could simply say like,

916
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:59,311
[SPEAKER_08]: these will be articulated in the individual school handbooks as to this, because this policy will be essentially cut and pasted into all of our school handbooks once we adopt it, right?

917
01:34:00,231 --> 01:34:11,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then that will be an edit that each principal or each level will have to say, you know, Peter Cushing is the assistant principal at Medford High School who will respond to sexual harassment, complaints of sexual harassment.

918
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:29,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we want to specify the actual address and phone number or just... I would say the director of people services, you can put 49 Winthrop Street.

919
01:34:31,903 --> 01:34:33,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

920
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:10,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, let's go first.

921
01:35:12,699 --> 01:35:12,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

922
01:35:13,019 --> 01:35:20,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think anybody happen to know the telephone number offhand for the Director of Pupil Services offices, the main number.

923
01:35:20,622 --> 01:35:26,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't have my phone booked right in front of me.

924
01:35:26,363 --> 01:35:29,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I think unless, sorry.

925
01:35:30,565 --> 01:35:31,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa, was that you?

926
01:35:31,485 --> 01:35:32,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Lisa.

927
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:35,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Director of Pupil Services, Joan 393-2383.

928
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:43,644
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have to pick.

929
01:35:45,945 --> 01:35:46,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

930
01:35:48,205 --> 01:35:56,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't, I don't, you know, what we approve here has to go to the whole school committee to become actual policy.

931
01:35:56,769 --> 01:36:07,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I, as a subcommittee chair, certainly feel comfortable approving this with the assumption that these pieces of information will be filled in prior to arriving at our meeting.

932
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:08,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And I,

933
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:13,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the other members have any qualms with that?

934
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:18,510
[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay.

935
01:36:19,291 --> 01:36:20,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there other changes?

936
01:36:24,953 --> 01:36:32,515
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, we basically took the boiler plate that was provided for us and made those few minor tweaks.

937
01:36:33,256 --> 01:36:35,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you go back to the top, Member Rousseau, sorry?

938
01:36:36,317 --> 01:36:36,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

939
01:36:50,933 --> 01:36:57,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So was this formally, just if I may, was this formally referred to in any other language, i.e.

940
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,698
[SPEAKER_07]: bullying policy or anything like that?

941
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:11,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if the bullying prevention and intervention plan references this.

942
01:37:11,945 --> 01:37:16,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I would

943
01:37:16,977 --> 01:37:20,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where I have this in digital format, so I'm searching for it.

944
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look quite from a format perspective to be related.

945
01:37:28,848 --> 01:37:38,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, let me look to the last page for the legal references, because if there are different legal references, then that would sort of answer the question.

946
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:46,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm wondering how they differentiate it.

947
01:37:46,492 --> 01:37:49,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe again, it's a Howard question, I don't know, but I'm curious.

948
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:02,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one is a reference to National Law 71, Section 370.

949
01:38:06,008 --> 01:38:07,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally different sections of the law.

950
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.

951
01:38:12,135 --> 01:38:17,224
[SPEAKER_02]: rational to think that there's a relationship and there maybe could be integrated or overlap.

952
01:38:17,565 --> 01:38:19,167
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely intersectionality.

953
01:38:19,248 --> 01:38:20,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess sorry.

954
01:38:20,169 --> 01:38:20,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

955
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:22,934
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's good.

956
01:38:23,435 --> 01:38:23,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

957
01:38:26,410 --> 01:38:49,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if we should include some language to that effect, just that there may be overlap and intersectionality between this policy and blah, blah policy, and both should be referenced or something to that effect, because I think one might assume that this supersedes another, which was what I was wondering when I was looking at it, because obviously I'm not an attorney.

958
01:38:49,334 --> 01:38:50,255
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

959
01:38:53,442 --> 01:39:17,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Dr. Cushing, could you just, I think I talked to you about this, about how this change is related to the prior federal administration's view of Title IX that was a bit unwelcome to public schools, and that there's an expectation that we will be redoing all of this yet again

960
01:39:17,799 --> 01:39:22,523
[SPEAKER_02]: once the new administration has had a chance to get to this issue, is that correct?

961
01:39:22,963 --> 01:39:23,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

962
01:39:23,383 --> 01:39:30,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, it was actually reported on about six to eight weeks ago that the current administration was looking into the changes.

963
01:39:30,609 --> 01:39:39,916
[SPEAKER_08]: The changes are much more favorable for the alleged aggressor rather than the target.

964
01:39:40,937 --> 01:39:45,601
[SPEAKER_08]: In respect to member McLaughlin's concerns about the bullying policy, there is a,

965
01:39:47,282 --> 01:40:00,966
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a natural intersection under Massachusetts law where it references bullying, but the only mechanism in the law to address bullying is through criminal harassment.

966
01:40:01,566 --> 01:40:04,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the natural intersection.

967
01:40:04,987 --> 01:40:08,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no, if I'm remembering correctly, there's no consequence

968
01:40:09,648 --> 01:40:20,218
[SPEAKER_08]: unless you go through the criminal harassment piece, which is, you know, that three times and then whatever comes with criminal harassment.

969
01:40:20,278 --> 01:40:27,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, they're school-based, obviously, but that's school-based under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 7,

970
01:40:28,526 --> 01:40:33,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Chapter 37, section O, which specifies bullying and all those types of things.

971
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:50,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to put a reference down there, I mean, whereas I will say once again, though, where we subscribe to this policy service by MASC, the MASC attorneys vet these and link them fairly well.

972
01:40:51,873 --> 01:40:58,457
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is probably a natural intersection there because of how the law works in relation to bullying.

973
01:40:59,818 --> 01:41:14,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just, so we also are going to be, we approved an update to the bullying prevention and intervention plan just because we had to get one through quickly.

974
01:41:14,867 --> 01:41:18,550
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe it's on my board here of,

975
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:28,077
[SPEAKER_02]: things to actually go with a fine-tooth comb and go through this whole bullying prevention and intervention plan.

976
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:40,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that that is probably easier to work this stuff into the bullying, because this is a plan with actual steps and what to do and when to do it.

977
01:41:40,522 --> 01:41:47,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my mind, frankly, it's a much better policy.

978
01:41:48,065 --> 01:41:51,608
[SPEAKER_02]: and this thing that we have perceived, which is just a reflection of Title IX.

979
01:41:55,311 --> 01:41:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody has thoughts on that.

980
01:41:58,233 --> 01:42:05,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this came before this update for the sexual harassment, for this policy we're looking at today.

981
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:12,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And given that this policy we're looking at today is going to be before us again by the end of the summer, maybe.

982
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:18,584
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully will look significantly different.

983
01:42:22,045 --> 01:42:32,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I just think maybe we can put our focus on the one, the thing that we know isn't gonna be changing every 15 minutes, the bullying prevention and prevention plan.

984
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:54,550
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the, I would say that's the only thing that I hope is that we are not going to be yo-yoed, for lack of a better term, with varying administrations and changing Title IX because, I mean, our staff has already gone through significant retraining on this.

985
01:42:54,991 --> 01:42:59,953
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's, I think it was August 15th last year was when the regulations changed.

986
01:43:01,394 --> 01:43:09,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's actually, you need to know both because if something happened before August 15th, you need to follow those regulations.

987
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:13,502
[SPEAKER_08]: If something happened after August 15th, you need to follow these regulations.

988
01:43:14,502 --> 01:43:24,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's definitely something that I know many school leaders are hoping gets resolved in a more permanent manner.

989
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a good thing you had nothing else going on last summer that might've kept you busy.

990
01:43:30,948 --> 01:43:31,508
[SPEAKER_02]: My goodness.

991
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, Member McArthur, do you have any specifics about the current language that you would like us to change?

992
01:43:44,576 --> 01:43:54,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I would want, what I'm suggesting is one line somewhere that talks about the intersectionality of policies, you know, regarding harassment and bullying and, you know, should be referenced.

993
01:43:56,608 --> 01:44:07,182
[SPEAKER_07]: or the individual policy should be referenced around intersectionality for bullying and harassment, something along those lines, just a one line so that people don't.

994
01:44:07,703 --> 01:44:14,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm imagining, say, for example, you're a parent or a caregiver and you've had the unfortunate

995
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:27,775
[SPEAKER_07]: situation where your student has experienced something along these lines, and you come into or are looking at the policy online to figure out under which category, you know, your situation falls.

996
01:44:28,756 --> 01:44:33,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, even around training for staff, you know, are they differentiated?

997
01:44:33,902 --> 01:44:35,284
[SPEAKER_07]: If so, how, you know, in

998
01:44:36,525 --> 01:44:38,247
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, where is the intersectionality?

999
01:44:38,267 --> 01:44:42,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know the answer to that, but it seems to me that there are some.

1000
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:44,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's just a similar situation.

1001
01:44:44,332 --> 01:44:49,436
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just interesting because it's a similar situation when you're thinking about, you know, special education complaints.

1002
01:44:49,476 --> 01:44:56,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a special education complaint system for procedural guidelines for IEPs.

1003
01:44:56,422 --> 01:44:59,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, there's intersectionality with civil rights, right?

1004
01:44:59,244 --> 01:45:04,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have one office that handles one thing and another office that handles another thing, but there's certainly intersectionality across the two.

1005
01:45:05,469 --> 01:45:17,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, you know, in the interest of being informed, I want to make sure that the community understands that, and the staff, frankly, understands that there's intersectionality, but I'm not exactly sure what that sentence should be.

1006
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:24,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sounds like you're saying it, you know, may fit in the bullying better than it fits here because of the federal administration's guidance.

1007
01:45:25,025 --> 01:45:26,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm okay with that.

1008
01:45:26,886 --> 01:45:30,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to be on the record that, you know, we need to do that in one or the other.

1009
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:32,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1010
01:45:33,151 --> 01:45:33,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

1011
01:45:34,927 --> 01:45:44,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps at the end of the policy, we can just add a line that says related policies and put a link in there to our bullying policy.

1012
01:45:44,512 --> 01:45:46,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that covers us.

1013
01:45:49,294 --> 01:45:54,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we actually sometimes have a related policies in the policy information section.

1014
01:45:57,258 --> 01:46:00,720
[SPEAKER_02]: This was copied from MASC, so it didn't come in.

1015
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:04,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to find, I'm just going to actually call it the bullying

1016
01:46:11,692 --> 01:46:22,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would also just offer potentially procedural guidelines for special education as well as an intersectional policy, but related policies.

1017
01:46:24,716 --> 01:46:25,376
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that called?

1018
01:46:25,396 --> 01:46:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1019
01:46:26,757 --> 01:46:30,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to look at the actual document, but it's procedural guidelines for special education

1020
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:35,012
[SPEAKER_07]: We get them in every mailing of everything we get from the school.

1021
01:46:35,452 --> 01:46:37,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask Joan exactly what the name is, but.

1022
01:46:38,273 --> 01:46:43,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll put down that you'll get me the exact words.

1023
01:46:55,863 --> 01:46:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1024
01:46:56,609 --> 01:47:01,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, let me hold this so I don't forget that and send that off to the policy service.

1025
01:47:04,354 --> 01:47:07,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and what was the other one I want to bold so that we don't send that off?

1026
01:47:08,417 --> 01:47:09,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it member Russo.

1027
01:47:09,618 --> 01:47:10,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you did?

1028
01:47:10,718 --> 01:47:10,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1029
01:47:11,919 --> 01:47:14,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, um, parents, sorry.

1030
01:47:15,862 --> 01:47:19,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, parents notice of procedural safeguards.

1031
01:47:25,148 --> 01:47:25,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

1032
01:47:27,162 --> 01:47:27,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

1033
01:47:27,242 --> 01:47:30,205
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1034
01:47:30,865 --> 01:47:31,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

1035
01:47:31,966 --> 01:47:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

1036
01:47:35,629 --> 01:47:36,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

1037
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:38,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everybody.

1038
01:47:39,852 --> 01:47:41,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Um member Graham.

1039
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:42,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1040
01:47:43,495 --> 01:47:44,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember my coffin?

1041
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:45,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1042
01:47:46,337 --> 01:47:48,039
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no yesterday in the affirmative.

1043
01:47:48,579 --> 01:47:48,719
[SPEAKER_02]: This

1044
01:47:56,287 --> 01:48:10,476
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't have answers to these folded items, do the members mind if this actually gets held back one meeting?

1045
01:48:11,396 --> 01:48:11,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1046
01:48:14,318 --> 01:48:15,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

1047
01:48:15,099 --> 01:48:17,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can't get that done before Monday,

1048
01:48:17,793 --> 01:48:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have the next couple of weeks after that too.

1049
01:48:19,835 --> 01:48:21,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to pick the person, I think, right?

1050
01:48:22,317 --> 01:48:23,858
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually already have them identified.

1051
01:48:24,518 --> 01:48:28,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can put that in and have it ready to go for Monday.

1052
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:29,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

1053
01:48:30,103 --> 01:48:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to necessarily delay.

1054
01:48:32,645 --> 01:48:32,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1055
01:48:33,145 --> 01:48:33,526
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1056
01:48:33,586 --> 01:48:33,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1057
01:48:34,146 --> 01:48:34,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1058
01:48:35,768 --> 01:48:38,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any other questions or comments?

1059
01:48:42,513 --> 01:48:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.

1060
01:48:43,033 --> 01:48:46,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that we were all willing to go an extra hour tonight.

1061
01:48:46,836 --> 01:48:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't think

1062
01:48:47,777 --> 01:48:49,099
[SPEAKER_02]: any of these things could really wait.

1063
01:48:49,239 --> 01:48:51,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a motion to adjourn?

1064
01:48:51,642 --> 01:48:52,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1065
01:48:52,323 --> 01:48:53,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

1066
01:48:54,947 --> 01:48:55,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1067
01:48:55,287 --> 01:48:55,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

1068
01:48:56,349 --> 01:48:56,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1069
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:58,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

1070
01:48:58,672 --> 01:48:58,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1071
01:48:59,873 --> 01:49:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rossell, yes.

1072
01:49:00,734 --> 01:49:01,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Three in the affirmative.

1073
01:49:02,136 --> 01:49:02,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1074
01:49:02,517 --> 01:49:03,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

1075
01:49:03,138 --> 01:49:04,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Edwards and Dr. Cushing.
