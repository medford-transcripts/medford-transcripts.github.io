Once again, Ryan McDonald from Access Engineering out of Westborough, Massachusetts.

63
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,672
The purpose of this project is to provide internet service for management health services located at 200 Rivers Edge Road in Medford.

64
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:56,292
Pretty much that's it.

65
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:57,433
Thank you.

66
00:04:58,613 --> 00:04:59,613
Counselors, any questions?

67
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:02,354
Counselor Lungel-Kern.

68
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,008
Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

69
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:08,410
So this is to service the new projects that it is going up currently?

70
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,794
We actually just got contacted by Management Health Services, so it's just for their purposes, so to speak.

71
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,515
And are they located in the new building?

72
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:18,775
They are located in the new building, yes.

73
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:23,618
So if you have to provide power, is this line going to

74
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:28,335
extend to everybody in the building, be able to extend every time?

75
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:28,596
Yes.

76
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:33,121
Okay, so you won't have to come before us again for every unit that's occupied.

77
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:33,722
Correct.

78
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:35,104
Great, thank you.

79
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,887
Council Meyers.

80
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:40,423
Councilor Martins.

81
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:41,043
Thank you.

82
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:44,186
So when will the bulk of the work be done?

83
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:47,469
Will it be done during the day or is this going to be... We're flexible.

84
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,891
Whatever you guys will allow us to do, we prefer to do it during the day.

85
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,434
Worst case scenario, five days.

86
00:05:53,574 --> 00:06:03,143
Best case, three days, which that's, you know, more the case is going to be three days, but we like to just prepare for five days just in case anything happens.

87
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:07,027
Is there any interruption to the traffic flow in the area?

88
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,289
Uh, we have a engineered traffic plan.

89
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:10,890
I believe we'll have a police detail out there.

90
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:21,077
So at some point, uh, yeah, at some point we'll have to close down now one portion of the road and then dig one half of the road and then move over and dig the other half of the road.

91
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,278
But there will be one lane open at all times.

92
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,680
Just one lane of traffic.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,522
So you won't be able to go east or west at a certain period of time.

94
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,444
or one or the other?

95
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:34,066
It's a double lane there on either way.

96
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:39,171
So we'll have to close one side down while we're on one side.

97
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,053
So on the other side, you'll have traffic on both ways?

98
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,414
Yes, we'll have traffic on both ways.

99
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,076
OK, thank you.

100
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:46,597
Thank you.

101
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,298
Councilor Knight.

102
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:56,686
Is there going to be a project manager assigned or a point of contact assigned to make sure that the project is performed

103
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:00,196
On time and according to City of Medford standards.

104
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:07,783
Yes, I have the contact of Mark Pavone, Phoenix Communications, and Scott Harnois of Light Tile Fabric Networks.

105
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,485
I can provide that information to you if you need it.

106
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:09,945
That'd be great.

107
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:10,626
I appreciate that.

108
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,807
That was all I had, Mr. President.

109
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:14,749
I see the papers were in order.

110
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,051
Everything seems fine to me.

111
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:20,034
Motion moved by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Caviello.

112
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:21,175
Councillor Caviello.

113
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:27,113
One last thing, and I'll assume that you'll put the road back in the same condition that it's in, because that's a fairly new road there.

114
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,273
Exactly, exactly.

115
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:32,554
If there's any problems, feel free to reach out to us and we'll amend anything that you need.

116
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:36,096
Very good.

117
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,116
Motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

118
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:39,157
All those in favor?

119
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:39,617
Aye.

120
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:40,597
All those opposed?

121
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,298
Congratulations.

122
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:45,599
Thank you.

123
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,179
Last week,

124
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:53,485
City Council met with the Committee of the Whole to address a number of papers that were in committee.

125
00:07:54,366 --> 00:08:04,518
The paper was reported out to us and the clerk, over the week, created a list that came out into our packets.

126
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:09,099
So we have this matter before us for consideration.

127
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:21,541
Dozens of papers were received and placed on file, many of which had been in subcommittees in Committee of the Whole for several years.

128
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:31,404
And some of them had been addressed in a lateral way, but never, according to parliamentary procedure, been moved out of committee.

129
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:36,046
We have all the recommendations before us.

130
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:42,311
I'm sure the councilors had a time to review that lengthy list that we went through.

131
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:47,015
Some of the papers are remaining in committee and are being addressed by the committee chairs.

132
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:51,518
So with this paper before us, 16-418, the chair awaits a motion.

133
00:08:54,072 --> 00:09:01,055
Mr. President, a motion to waive the reading of each individual matter that's on the paper, and a motion to accept the committee report.

134
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:10,799
I motion that Council elect to waive the reading of each individual matter, thanks be to God, and to accept the paper as whole.

135
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:11,379
Second?

136
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,519
Second, Mr. President.

137
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,900
Second by Councilor Caviello.

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
All those in favor?

139
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,581
Aye.

140
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,501
All those opposed?

141
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:18,542
Congratulations.

142
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,811
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

143
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,272
16-404 offered by Councilor Knight.

144
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:31,214
Be it resolved that the City Administration provide the Council with the following information.

145
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:49,743
Listing of all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have been performed or are scheduled to perform any digging or excavation work from January 1st, 2014 to date, including the street address of where the work took place or is scheduled to take place.

146
00:09:51,093 --> 00:10:08,906
A listing of all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed any digging or excavation work that have not been completed in accordance with the established City of Medford standards from January 2014 to date, including the street addresses of where the work took place.

147
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:09,867
Three.

148
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:25,070
schedule of repair for all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed any digging or excavation work that have not been completed in accordance with established City of Medford standards from January 2014 to date including the street addresses of

149
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,614
where the work is to take place.

150
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:39,759
Four, a listing of all trees that require pruning or removal that are the responsibility of public utilities, including street address of where the work is to be performed.

151
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:51,243
And five, a schedule of repair for all trees that require pruning or removal that are the responsibility of public utilities, including the street addresses of where the work is to be performed.

152
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:52,284
Councilor Knight.

153
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:59,136
Mr. President, thank you very much, and I appreciate you bearing with my long-winded resolution this evening.

154
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:12,585
However, I feel as though it's very important that we begin to hold our public utilities a little bit more accountable to the work that they do on our roadways, on our sidewalks, as well as dealing with the trees that end up getting wrapped around public utility wires up in the sky, Mr. President.

155
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:18,147
So I bring this resolution forward based upon a constituent call that I received back about a year ago.

156
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:27,092
Doonan Street was done over, and public utilities were on Doonan Street, and they dug quite a large trench, and it was a trench that went up the whole length of the street.

157
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:33,215
And the size of the equipment actually damaged the majority of the street up there, and the street's still not been repaired, Mr. President.

158
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:37,418
And I know that there are a number of other streets in the community that have this same situation happening.

159
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:41,659
I'd like a list of the streets as noted in the resolution.

160
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:45,904
I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

161
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,649
I've also asked for the trees that need to be cut down that are the responsibilities of public utilities.

162
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,332
Just in the news last week, Mr. President, we saw

163
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,702
couple down in Abington who were struck by a falling tree branch and killed.

164
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:05,765
And there are many trees in the city that are wrapped up in the electric wires and the city of Medford will not cut them.

165
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,346
The public utility is responsible for cutting them.

166
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:12,808
So I'd like a list of those to make sure that we can monitor the work and be sure that it's done, Mr. President.

167
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:13,929
Wonderful.

168
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,110
Uh, councillor Carrifiello.

169
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,070
Thank you, Mr. President.

170
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,731
I, I thank council nice for bringing this forward.

171
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,632
You know, I drive around and I see, um,

172
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,099
All these street dig ups that have been done, and you see the shoddy work that's done after.

173
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:30,820
They've sunk when they're supposed to come back, and we fill them, and the company's never come back.

174
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,741
Some of them are two, and three, four years old.

175
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:39,084
And like I asked the gentleman the other night, if he's going to put the road back in the same condition, whether they do it.

176
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:49,628
But there's probably hundreds of trenches that have been dug that just are sinking, and somebody should be held accountable for this.

177
00:12:51,984 --> 00:13:04,473
I don't know who inspects this from our city, but when they're done, and I know they sink a little bit after they're done, but there should be a time frame to go back and check it again so the company can come back and refill it and put it back where it belongs, Mr. President.

178
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,394
So again, I think this is a good motion.

179
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:06,954
I support it.

180
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:07,895
Thank you.

181
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:15,120
So on the motion to approve by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello, chair recognizes Councilor Scarpello.

182
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:16,821
Thank you, Mr. President.

183
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:21,557
I follow along with my fellow counselors.

184
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:34,721
One of the biggest calls I've been getting and driving around is after the utility work comes in, the sinking of those areas, I think, that are very noticeable now.

185
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:44,185
They're really noticeable when you see the new work on new streets, and then the little patchwork comes in.

186
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,615
There was some that are really dangerous out there.

187
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:55,639
So I think that I appreciate Councilor Knight for bringing this forward and I support this wholeheartedly.

188
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you.

189
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,721
Thank you, Councilor.

190
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:00,422
Chair recognizes Councilor Langel-Kern.

191
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:02,123
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

192
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,644
I too agree with the resolve.

193
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:11,488
I know this has come up many a times and I remember about probably eight years ago we had this issue.

194
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,620
with streets not being repaired, and how do we hold them accountable?

195
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:25,786
And it didn't really seem to go anywhere, because obviously you need the administration to get on board, create a plan to enforce our ordinances with regards to utility companies being held accountable.

196
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,668
So I think this is a great resolve.

197
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:40,855
I would just ask maybe for a little more clarity, or just if we could be clear with regards to which departments we're sending them to, so that the city administration, the mayor, can send our resolve off to the right places.

198
00:14:42,147 --> 00:15:00,798
For instance, number four and five, obviously we'd ask Miss Aggie Tude and our tree warden to, I don't know if she would do like an audit of every tree, or go through the streets and figure out which ones need repair, which ones need to be cut for the safety of the public.

199
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,740
And then I'm assuming maybe the city engineer for the top three.

200
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,242
I just want to make sure we request the appropriate departments

201
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:12,993
to do this work so that we know who to go to and ask, you know, why haven't you done it?

202
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:16,434
Or when will we be expecting the documents?

203
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:17,874
I think that's important.

204
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:18,834
Very good.

205
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:26,736
So on the motion of approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Vice President Longo Kern, Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

206
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:29,077
Thank you, Mr. President.

207
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:37,099
And this is a very wise resolution regarding the upkeep of our streets.

208
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,360
and to hold the utility companies accountable.

209
00:15:41,081 --> 00:16:03,438
I would suggest, as Councilor Longo-Kern mentioned, that over the last several years, we've struggled as a city because there's really no oversight on behalf of the city to represent the city, to make sure, as Councilor Caviello mentioned, that these jobs are being done up to our standards and according to the contract.

210
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,500
So I would ask if Councilor Knight doesn't mind

211
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:14,873
to amend his resolution that we put a section in there that puts who the clerk of the work is on behalf of the city.

212
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:33,279
So at least, and there may not be someone, and that's the whole issue that we have, that there is no oversight, the clerk of the work for each job and each utility job, because someone here at City Hall has to sign off anytime a road is being broken into and so forth, excavated.

213
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:35,320
So I would ask that we amend that

214
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:43,115
to put who is the clerk of the work on behalf of the city, for each of the projects.

215
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:47,118
So on the motions, as further amended by Councillor Marks.

216
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:56,524
On the motion for approval, it's seconded by Councillor Cavielle, as amended by Vice-President Longo-Kern, and Councillor Marks.

217
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,404
All those in favour?

218
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,025
All those opposed?

219
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,326
Passes.

220
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:01,627
Thank you, Councillors.

221
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,898
16-405 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

222
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:17,142
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the purchase of crime wash signs for the West Medford area in light of the current rash of break-ins into the homes and automobiles.

223
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,283
Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

224
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:20,123
Thank you, Mr. President.

225
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:31,687
Mr. President, myself and Councilor Marks have attended these meetings with many people from the West Medford area in regards to the rash of breaks both in the cars and in the homes.

226
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:39,572
The neighbors were very diligent there, a lot of them showed up and they've established their own little crime watch there.

227
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:45,857
So hopefully that'll help with some of the break-ins there.

228
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:52,541
But they felt that in the past, there had been crime watch signs up in a lot of those streets.

229
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,704
And the neighbors and the committee would like to have in the back.

230
00:17:56,764 --> 00:18:01,247
And Chief Sacco is in agreement, he thinks that it shouldn't be that big of a deal.

231
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,171
to get them and put them back up, Mr. President.

232
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,552
So, and I think there's some neighbors here that may want to speak in support of that also.

233
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:07,372
Very good.

234
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,613
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello.

235
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,754
Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

236
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:14,674
Welcome.

237
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:15,435
Good evening, sir.

238
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,315
Please state your name and address for the record.

239
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:18,475
My name is Robert Pinter.

240
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,316
I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of your August body.

241
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:28,378
I've attended both of those meetings and there is a major concern in the West Medford area as well as throughout the entire city of Medford.

242
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:37,646
But these signs did have, in fact, an impact many years ago as it related to crime taking place, especially in the West Medford area and other parts.

243
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,409
I think it's a beginning that needs to take place.

244
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,390
There are 100 people strong.

245
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,152
They have petitions walking the street.

246
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:51,156
And the real need that needs to take place is this upcoming budget that you folks are going to have to deal with here on the city council.

247
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,718
This administration has to step up to the plate.

248
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:11,036
and recognize the fact that in the petition that's running around, they're asking for 10 additional street police officers over the next two years, whether they be bicycle files, fellas, gals, and whether they be motorcycle, walking patrolmen, patrol ladies, or just more people for visibility in the neighborhood.

249
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:11,957
It's a desperate need.

250
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:13,097
They're serious.

251
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,058
They don't like their houses broken into.

252
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,538
They don't like their cars hijacked.

253
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:20,320
And they don't like to be held hostage in their own community.

254
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,360
So when only 72 police officers

255
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,160
On the patrol, in our city method right now, we need to increase that.

256
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,104
We need to represent ourselves as being a community that is responding to the needs of the community, especially in the areas of public safety.

257
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:41,729
And I believe it's in this city council and prior city councils that's always mandated that public safety was its number one issue.

258
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,790
Thank you, sir.

259
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,834
Motion approved by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Marks.

260
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:49,974
All those in favor?

261
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:51,676
All those opposed?

262
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,275
16-406 offered by Councilor Caviello.

263
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:06,201
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss and request a crosswalk be inserted at the corner of Grove Street and Buzzle Road in the interest of public safety.

264
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,222
Councilor Caviello.

265
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:09,863
Thank you, Mr. President.

266
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:17,668
As the traffic grows in the West Medford area, as people know, the city's becoming more of a cut-through every day.

267
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:22,491
All these apps on your phones are all giving people

268
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,402
cut-throughs, all these little side streets.

269
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:34,905
Grove Street is becoming busier every day, and one of the new areas to cut through is down Bustle Lane, which goes to Placehead Park.

270
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:41,408
There is a mirror up there that helps slow the traffic, but no one seems to be stopping there, and the car's just running right through there.

271
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,309
Didn't a famous doctor live there?

272
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,009
Yes, he did.

273
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:45,009
That's right.

274
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,631
If he was here tonight, I'm sure he would be in favor of that.

275
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:50,011
Yes.

276
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,701
Some of the neighbors are a little concerned.

277
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:56,403
They're walking the children down to the park.

278
00:20:57,043 --> 00:21:01,787
And if we could have, I know there's a stop sign there, but if a crosswalk would be helpful, Mr. President.

279
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:02,447
Very good.

280
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:04,489
So on the motion approved by Councilor Caviello.

281
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,611
Ma'am, you wish to speak on this matter?

282
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,271
Welcome.

283
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,932
Please state your name and address for the record.

284
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,354
Good evening, and thank you.

285
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,675
My name is Patricia Wheeler.

286
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,596
I live at 35 Wellgate Road.

287
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:21,983
I would greatly, as Councilman Caviello said, together with my neighbors, we would like to see a crosswalk.

288
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:52,088
In addition, children crossing sign, when you cross up from Bustle over to Grove, the curb is so high that it really causes a delay for the children to get their bicycles safely on the sidewalk, moms with strollers, and you literally have to enter into the roadway to look down Grove Street to see oncoming traffic that comes up High Street, and they do come at a high rate of speed, and it has had dramatic increase in traffic because of the apps that Councilman has referred to.

289
00:21:52,615 --> 00:22:00,539
It is absolutely a public safety necessity, and these steps would greatly mitigate any potential damage to a pedestrian.

290
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
Thank you for your time.

291
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,740
Thank you.

292
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:07,543
So on the motion for approval by Councillor Carviello, Councillor Marks.

293
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:08,884
I agree.

294
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:17,328
In addition to the crosswalk pedestrian crossing signage, neon signage is very important to alert people.

295
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,769
There is a crosswalk there.

296
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:38,288
Being familiar with the area, I'm not sure exactly where the councilman wants to put the crosswalk, but I think if you put it close to the bridge, that may be a public safety concern, because coming from High Street down Grove, you're really cut off from visual at a great length.

297
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,229
But when you're coming from... They have a mirror there.

298
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:45,913
They have a mirror there, but when you're coming down from Winchester, you have a long strip and you can actually see someone.

299
00:22:46,353 --> 00:22:48,395
So my suggestion would be to put the crosswalk

300
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,517
further down from the bridge.

301
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:56,079
So if you're coming from Wellgate, you'd have to walk up Grove Street and then cross over.

302
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,581
I think it adds a little bit more safety than having it too close to the bridge.

303
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:01,482
It's an odd configuration of streets there.

304
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:02,643
Right.

305
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:03,223
I agree.

306
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:13,048
So what I've seen be the problem, you know, problematic area is when you come up Bustle and you go looking left down Grove Street,

307
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:17,912
that literally puts you in the line of traffic to have a line of sight.

308
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:39,372
So if you put the crosswalk just to the right of that area, so basically you come up Bustle, and the way the traffic lines are painted, there's an opening that would really lend itself to a visible aid to motorists with the crosswalk right there that people are coming up and crossing.

309
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,594
So if you're coming up Bustle, you're saying?

310
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:46,016
As you take that left, there's a wide area to cross over Grove.

311
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:51,678
So it's on the Winchester side, if you will, of the train bridge.

312
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:52,278
The cross.

313
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:52,558
Right.

314
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:58,941
That would be basically at the base of where the mirror is, affects to, I think, a telephone pole.

315
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,041
That would really benefit the community.

316
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:02,082
That makes sense.

317
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:04,323
That way you have a line of vision both ways.

318
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:04,863
Exactly.

319
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:05,850
Thank you.

320
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,551
Thank you.

321
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:06,871
Thank you.

322
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:07,531
Counselor.

323
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:20,939
So on the motion for move by Councilor Carviello, as amended with the country remarks with the, uh, children, protest, cross, cross, all those in favor.

324
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,720
All right.

325
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,380
Counselor night.

326
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:30,912
Can I further amend the paper, Mr. President, to ask for a directed patrol there for the next couple of weeks, just to be sure that we monitor the activity there as well as that it's getting more and more stuck in town.

327
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:32,533
So if you want to go down that route, please.

328
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:33,433
Thanks, Mr. President.

329
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:46,059
I ask further amendment by Councilor Knight that there be a directed patrol there to monitor the situation, and perhaps that input that the Traffic Commission would find beneficial to remedy the problem.

330
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:52,262
On the motion for approval, as seconded and amended,

331
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:54,524
Hence, Councilor Marks.

332
00:24:54,864 --> 00:25:09,656
I think it would only be appropriate, whereas this council voted unanimously a couple of weeks ago to prompt the administration to use thermoplastic crosswalks rather than the traditional paint that fades after six months.

333
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:20,145
And thermoplastic, we all know, is highly reflective and slip resistant and lasts up to five years, that this crosswalk be installed with thermoplastic

334
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,802
So the residents won't have to come six months from now saying, we can't see the faded crosswalk.

335
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:25,603
Correct.

336
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,465
So I would amend if Councilor Caviello would mind that.

337
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,125
That would be fine, Mr. President.

338
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:29,986
And shift the whole plastic.

339
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,888
An excellent amendment, as further amended by Councilor Marks.

340
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:34,749
All those in favor?

341
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,431
All those opposed?

342
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:37,872
Motion carries.

343
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:40,754
Offered by Vice President Longo Kern, 16-407.

344
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:54,962
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city solicitor appear at our next meeting to publicly discuss his findings after his review of the contract the city has with Republic Parking.

345
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:56,422
Madam Vice President.

346
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:57,143
Thank you.

347
00:25:57,163 --> 00:26:09,728
President DelaRusso, I believe it was last Monday or Tuesday, we received an email with regards to Republic Parking selling, which we were all pretty in shock by.

348
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:10,648
Nobody knew.

349
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:12,529
I don't believe the administration knew either.

350
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:17,391
and I know that it's in the city solicitor's hands as of today.

351
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:18,852
It's been a week.

352
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:30,481
I was hoping some of his research and obviously review of the contract would give us a better idea of where we go and move forward.

353
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,542
I know we all have questions that need to be answered.

354
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:42,890
I know the public has questions and the public has concerns, so I would like to obviously educate us as well as the public, but after getting

355
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,221
I did speak to the city solicitor.

356
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:53,667
I know that there could quite possibly be a number of things that could happen and some things that he would like to talk to us in executive session about.

357
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:58,690
I think that's something that he's definitely willing and going to do next week.

358
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:05,655
I'm not sure if you discussed it with him, President, but I think that's something that we at least need to get our questions answered.

359
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,982
And if it is a situation where, if you read the contract, I know a lot of people have been bringing it up.

360
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:14,582
And number 23 is the termination clause.

361
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:16,523
So.

362
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:28,246
And he urged us to, if you don't mind me interrupting, Vice President, that we refrain from speculation in an open forum where this matter is so delicate and sensitive.

363
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:29,227
Right.

364
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:39,221
I'm not going to be long-winded and talk about all the problems and whether or not we should get rid of the contract or whether or not we should try to change the contract.

365
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:46,487
I think we just need to sit down and get a better understanding of where our city solicitor believes we're at and where we could possibly be.

366
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:54,733
And then after that, I think we need to try to educate the public as much as we can, as well as when the time comes.

367
00:27:55,384 --> 00:28:12,799
possibly hold a public hearing with regards to everybody's concerns and issues with the parking program so that the administration and the city solicitor know what do we need to do, how can we make this better, what do we see as our two-year goals with regards to parking enforcement.

368
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:17,203
I think that's very important and I think the public needs to be educated and

369
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:21,009
It needs to be obviously transparent as much as it can be.

370
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:25,330
So I look forward to the meeting next week, hopefully get some of our questions answered.

371
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:34,613
And then after that meeting, once it's safe to do so, I think we need to obviously educate the public and get some input, public input on how to move forward.

372
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,994
Thank you very much, Madam Vice President.

373
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:38,554
So on that motion, all those in favor?

374
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:40,815
All those opposed?

375
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:43,236
Motion carries.

376
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:44,516
16-408 offered by Councilor Falco.

377
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,337
Be it resolved that the city administration

378
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:53,310
provide the Medford City Council with policies and guidelines that are used to operate the

379
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,560
Click Fix System.

380
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,601
Counselor Felk?

381
00:28:58,202 --> 00:28:59,102
Thank you, Mr. President.

382
00:28:59,383 --> 00:29:04,728
I received a number of calls this week regarding the C-Click Fix System.

383
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,952
I support the C-Click Fix System 100%.

384
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:09,693
I think it's a great tool.

385
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:16,540
It's a great way to monitor issues and actually get things done efficiently.

386
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,421
But it seems that

387
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:34,872
We've had a number of issues recently where it's almost becoming more of a populist of some sort, where people, the specific call that I got this week was that someone took a picture of someone else doing something wrong and putting it on CNN.

388
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:37,694
And that is something that's been taken down.

389
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:43,538
But I really think that we should know as a community council, what are the policies

390
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:54,477
But is there a screening process?

391
00:29:54,917 --> 00:30:04,062
Are there any policies that you're suggesting behind the system when things actually get recorded and logged on the system?

392
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:08,544
I know, I believe, a few weeks ago, Consular Marks had a resolution regarding it.

393
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:09,865
We need to have that.

394
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:21,071
I think when people talk about issues like this, the policies and guidelines, it's good to get a presentation on how it works.

395
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:29,816
And I know Andrew mentioned weeks ago as well that it'd be nice to see the type of reporting that we can receive as soon as possible.

396
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:38,699
I'm really concerned about the policies, the procedures, the guidelines that surround the system.

397
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,461
And I think we need to work with them at this point in time.

398
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:43,961
Thank you so much.

399
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:44,281
All right.

400
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:50,023
Councilor Falco, I wish they changed the name of it, because see, click, fix is difficult to say fast.

401
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:50,264
Yes.

402
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:51,364
Councilor Caravaglio.

403
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:52,324
Thank you, Mr. President.

404
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:57,786
Mr. President, I applaud the administration moving forward with this and finally getting it in.

405
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,507
I was able to attend

406
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:11,100
The meeting when they debuted the program, and that was the exact concern that I had that I expressed that evening about that was turning it into a blog.

407
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,241
And I think that's what it's become a little bit.

408
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:15,383
And I think Councilor Falco's right.

409
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:21,307
Maybe we should have a meeting with the people or whoever operates it, maybe help fine tune it a little bit.

410
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:24,490
And I think that would be better for everybody.

411
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:25,811
Very good.

412
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:28,973
On Councilor Knight.

413
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:38,033
Yes, Mr. President, I think we've made a number of resolutions relative to the C-Click-Fix program since the press release came out about its inception.

414
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:46,421
And I think that Councilor Falcone, Councilor Luxembourg, the Grand Trafficking Committee, the Board of Governors, and I think that I understand and can kind of grasp

415
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:52,909
as to how this program is going to work, whether or not we have enough personnel and manpower behind it to support the initiatives.

416
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,996
The timelines that are being set forward, Mr. President, so with that being said, I owe a lot of your support.

417
00:31:58,076 --> 00:32:01,881
So it was a matter of being able to be able to pay this forward.

418
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:07,428
I think it's a great system.

419
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,410
I think it works.

420
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,873
I support it.

421
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:19,121
If used properly, I think it's a system that can be used to bring neighborhoods together and not be divisive so much.

422
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:25,106
I support this as a monitor, Senator, just to get some more information.

423
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:26,587
Thank you.

424
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:27,747
Thank you, Councillors.

425
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:31,810
And so on the motion for approval by Councillor Falco, seconded by Councillor Marx.

426
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:32,991
All those in favour?

427
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:33,332
Aye.

428
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,172
All those opposed?

429
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:34,352
Aye.

430
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,054
Motion carries.

431
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:38,375
16-415 offered by Councillor Caravaglio.

432
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:48,983
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Medford Police increase enforcement of distracted driving infraction in the interest of public safety.

433
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:50,144
Councillor Caravaglio.

434
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,274
Thank you, Mr. President.

435
00:32:51,294 --> 00:33:02,897
Mr. President, I don't know if you've seen in the last few weeks on different stations, different cities, they're doing distracted driving stops around town where they have an office further up the road.

436
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:11,720
And they're reporting people that are texting on the phone and driving, which is, I'm on the road all day and I see it constantly.

437
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,741
People just aren't paying attention and it's only a matter of time before

438
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:24,247
And if somebody gets run over, and I'm sure that's a major reason for most of the accidents that are happening now, is people just not paying attention.

439
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:33,389
So I would maybe, if the chief could maybe increase his policy on that.

440
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,210
I don't know if we even have a policy on it.

441
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,871
But we do speed traps, we do all the kinds of things.

442
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:41,091
I think maybe this is something we should look into,

443
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:46,598
keep people more stable in our city.

444
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,500
On the motion approved by Councillor Kerviel, seconded by Councillor Falco.

445
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,600
All those in favour?

446
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,840
All those opposed?

447
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:55,981
Motion carries.

448
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,322
Offered by Councillor Mark, 16-416.

449
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:07,644
Be it resolved that the city's lead service water lines be discussed in the interest of public safety.

450
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:09,624
Very good, Councillor.

451
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:13,045
Thank you, Mr. President.

452
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:26,834
I read an article in the Boston Globe back February 11th that talked about lead water pipes and the concern of lead water pipes in the Boston area.

453
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:30,996
And I think the article was a result of Flint, Michigan.

454
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:34,198
And we all know the disaster that took place in Flint.

455
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:43,502
And the article went on to report that there are a number of communities that still have a high percentage of lead lines.

456
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:53,826
And it listed the city of Malden having 47% of their total service lines in the city as lead lines, which is a very high percentage.

457
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:59,870
And then it went on to say the city of Method has 28%, which was the second highest.

458
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,311
And this is in the MWRA district.

459
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:05,453
It's not statewide, but is in the MWRA district.

460
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:13,058
And I found that number to be, in my own opinion, very excessive, knowing that the city went through

461
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:21,142
change back in 2004 when they created a policy to try to address lead service lines in the community.

462
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:40,867
So I did a little research into it, Mr. President, but the reason why I bring this up tonight is to draw awareness to residents that may have a lead line still connected, to report on the fact and not what was reported in the Boston Globe, which listed Method as the second highest.

463
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:42,588
And I don't believe, according to my

464
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:48,043
facts and figures, we are the second highest in the MWRA district of lead lines.

465
00:35:48,723 --> 00:36:01,253
And also to let residents know that there may be some solutions to a very costly replacement of a lead line, which could run $3,000 to $5,000 to remove a line.

466
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:10,880
So if your home was built prior to 1940, which many of our homes in this community were built prior, I know I live in a home that was built prior to 1940,

467
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:15,430
your house most likely has a lead service line.

468
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:27,014
And there are standards that were created that allows for a certain percentage of lead to exist within someone's bloodstream.

469
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:33,156
However, for infants and young children, it could be very dangerous, even low, low levels.

470
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:39,998
And what I found out, Mr. President, is that Medford has roughly 14,000

471
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:42,605
water service lines.

472
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:52,187
And according to the MWRA, 28% of those, or 3,920, are made of lead.

473
00:36:53,167 --> 00:37:07,850
And after talking to Ron Baker in our water department, who's a very astute person when it comes to water in this community, he mentioned to me that, and he sent me a list, and I can provide that to members of the council,

474
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:13,592
In 2004, the city started with a lead replacement program.

475
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:18,755
And their hope was every year that they would reduce that by 7%.

476
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:22,098
And I don't know if they met the quarter every year.

477
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,499
I didn't go through the exact numbers.

478
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,701
But from 2005, fiscal year 2005 to 2015, the city has replaced 1,768 lead lines in the community.

479
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:50,043
And when I say they replaced, meaning that when a resident calls up and says, I'd like to, you know, they hire a contractor, get rid of my lead line, the lead line comes out to the curb.

480
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:55,005
And then the city has another portion that leads to the main in the street.

481
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:59,166
So there may be another six or eight feet that the city's responsible for.

482
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:06,189
So the city keeps track of what they've done on their end through these figures, and they have reported 1,768

483
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:11,083
changes in lead lines since 2005.

484
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:29,686
So if you look at the figures now, according to what Ron Baker provided me, and I would assume the Globe that wrote this article on February 11th would have updated information when they're reporting, there currently exist roughly 2,232 lead lines in the community.

485
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,847
And this is a rough estimate, but it's a very close estimate.

486
00:38:34,307 --> 00:38:35,548
And that is only 16% of the total

487
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,437
service lines in the community, not 28 percent.

488
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:44,819
That's almost 1,200 lead lines off in that article.

489
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,622
So I wanted to report the facts, at least I've received.

490
00:38:49,782 --> 00:38:59,108
And if anyone wants to dispute that, I'd be more than happy to sit down and discuss what I found out on this information, Mr. President.

491
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:07,013
And, you know, when you look at what we received from the MWRA, it's virtually lead-free.

492
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,380
So our water comes, for the most part, from the Quab and Rez.

493
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:30,784
It's through steel pipes, concrete pipes, iron pipes, comes over to the city of Method, might travel some 25, 30, 40 miles in piping, and then it comes up to your home, and if you have a lead line, from eight feet into your house, lead can leach into your water.

494
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:36,285
So it travels 30 miles lead-free, it gets up to your home, and guess what?

495
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:44,009
Your eight-foot connection to the main could be putting you at risk for lead poisoning.

496
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,951
And it's a major concern, especially, as I mentioned, for young children and infants.

497
00:39:52,212 --> 00:40:00,334
However, there is some helpful hints in your cold water, as reported in the paper, which was helpful.

498
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,455
I think they were accurate on that.

499
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:06,056
If you run your cold water a few minutes, it takes any of the leaching that

500
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:12,497
If the water's been sitting there a while in your cold lead pipes, it takes any of that and cuts it out in the drain.

501
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,277
So you let that run for a little while.

502
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:23,420
And the city of Boston, and I'm not proposing this tonight, but the city of Boston for their residents offers financing.

503
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:33,603
So if you have a hardship and you say, geez, I can't afford this time to spend $3,000 to $5,000 to replace my lead line, although I have three infants in my home.

504
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:38,420
and I'm very concerned, they do offer a financing program.

505
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:56,793
My motion tonight, Mr. President, is to have the water department create a list of lead service lines that they're aware of, they may not be aware of every single one, but they're aware of, and notify residents of a lead connection.

506
00:40:57,434 --> 00:41:03,058
So I think it would be a very helpful PR that the city of Medford, we receive so many

507
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:04,768
confirmations and calls.

508
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:10,950
If I was a homeowner, I'd like to know, I may not be astute and realize that I have a lead line coming into my house.

509
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:19,573
I'd like to know if the city of Memphis thinks I have a lead line for my own sense of peace and knowledge.

510
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:31,396
And so that would be the first resolution that I offer motion is the city contact those that may have a lead line for notification, nothing else but notification.

511
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:32,917
And also that

512
00:41:33,735 --> 00:41:47,424
The MWRA, if we can get a report back from the MWRA, whether or not there's any way that they can assist residents in the replacement of lead lines, if there's any funding available.

513
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:56,090
I know the city takes advantage of roughly a million dollars a year in 0% finance loans through the MWRA.

514
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:02,595
And would any of that apply to residents that may have a concern with lead

515
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:04,337
in their water.

516
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,779
There's also lead testing done.

517
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:13,023
The way I understand it, it's done randomly in every city and town in the MWRA district.

518
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:20,648
So they may pick a few homes throughout the community, do lead testing, and report on that particular testing.

519
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:32,956
But if anyone has a concern or believe that they may have, for whatever reason, high quantities of lead, they should be able to contact the Method Water Department.

520
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:38,849
and find out more information on where they can get some lead testing done, Mr. President.

521
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:56,717
And this is all — I don't want to alarm people, but I think it's only important that people are aware of some of the concerns, some of the health concerns with lead and ways that they may be able to combat the lead on their own by running the faucet and so forth.

522
00:42:57,497 --> 00:43:02,680
And again, the MWRA provides this water to us from 30 miles out.

523
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:09,196
I remember a while back, someone made a presentation when we were talking about water and sewer rates.

524
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:22,002
And it was, I remember at the time, and it's still stuck in my head, to deliver a gallon of water from the Corbin Res to your home of fresh drinking water, it's roughly one penny in cost.

525
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:25,164
Now, the sewer may be a different pot.

526
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,865
You know, the sewer may have a different cost.

527
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,586
But to deliver, it's one penny.

528
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:33,548
And I just find that amazing, especially with

529
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:42,527
the job that the MWRA is doing to provide clean drinking water to our residents so we don't have a Flint, Michigan in our community, Mr. President.

530
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:47,309
So those two offerings of motions I would offer tonight, Mr. President.

531
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:48,189
I count to three.

532
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:55,511
So create a list of the city of Medford if they have the data and notify the residents if they have led service.

533
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:59,853
Two, that the MWRA report to the city council

534
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:10,413
regarding any programs they may have or opportunities for citizens to receive assistance in funding the repairs or the mitigation of lead pipes.

535
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:22,781
And third, that the possibility or the resources for testing of a home's water be made available to the public.

536
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:28,445
I recently saw on television, Councillor, that the primary

537
00:44:29,017 --> 00:44:38,744
A source still for lead poisoning in the United States, unfortunately, is lead paint in the homes ingested by children, which is a tragedy.

538
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:39,925
Thank you for this.

539
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:42,266
This was very informative, Councilor.

540
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:43,827
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

541
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:44,648
Thank you, Mr. President.

542
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:46,949
Councilor Mox is 100% right.

543
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:53,134
There should be some type of program, at least for families that have children, for some type of help.

544
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:56,536
I don't know many people that have $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 sitting around.

545
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:01,832
of extra spending money to get this done.

546
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:10,856
I mean, we have money in our water and soil account that we maybe make available for financing for some of these people.

547
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:20,800
So again, I commend the council for this, and again, it's, especially the people with young families, it really is something they should look into, get done, and the city should provide some help to them.

548
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:22,541
Thank you.

549
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:27,383
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, it's seconded by Councilor Caviello.

550
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,362
Vice President Longo.

551
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:30,743
Thank you briefly.

552
00:45:30,803 --> 00:45:35,626
I agree with my colleagues How would you know so I think that if the city has a record of that and I

553
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:55,360
you know, feels to do what we're asking with regards to notifying those residents, I think that's really unfortunate.

554
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:05,689
So I think the result's a good one, and I hope that the administration takes it seriously and gets that list together so that we can help notify families.

555
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:10,553
When I got my new water meter is when I got my house, and I had it done then.

556
00:46:12,195 --> 00:46:14,957
On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks.

557
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:27,744
If you happen to go into your basement and see where the water's coming in from outside, the lead line is usually like a brownish, greenish color almost.

558
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:30,925
But you can actually see the line coming in.

559
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:35,227
It may not come in too deep into the house, but you can actually see it.

560
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:40,089
Someone knowing the difference between pipes, copper, lead, should be able to tell you.

561
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,572
And I think on your deed itself, or I know when we bought our house, I think it mentioned

562
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:49,440
you know, like it says you have a paid driveway, you have asphalt shingles.

563
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:54,804
I think it also said you have a lead line or copper line or, you know, two 20 electricity.

564
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,085
I think it did mention that.

565
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,867
So that might be another way of, of also checking.

566
00:46:59,187 --> 00:47:06,532
And then hopefully if we can get the city to go through their records, uh, you know, they should be able to give us an accurate assessment.

567
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:12,096
So on the motion for move by council marks, uh, seconded by councilor Cabello,

568
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:15,585
Chair recognizes the gentleman at the podium.

569
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,687
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

570
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:19,649
Name is not important.

571
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:35,401
Point of possible information from Councilor Marks and all the people that have water.

572
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:40,786
In order to tell what kind of pipe you have, it would probably be best

573
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:51,927
says it's all dirty and corroded on the top, to scratch it with a piece of metal, and you'd be able to tell if it's a silvery look, that would probably lead, and you may want to get the lead out.

574
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:59,330
Secondly, hopefully you have a reddish copper look, because you prefer copper pipes.

575
00:47:59,871 --> 00:48:03,012
As far as I know, these days, unless they change their mind, tomorrow morning.

576
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:03,592
Thank you.

577
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:04,633
On the motion.

578
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,373
All those in favor?

579
00:48:06,014 --> 00:48:06,674
All those opposed?

580
00:48:07,494 --> 00:48:09,635
Motion carries.

581
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:10,896
16-417, offered by Councilor Knight.

582
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:25,539
Be it resolved that the City Administration take the proper steps to notify the Council and the residents of Brewster Road of the construction work being performed on the street, including but not limited to 1.

583
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,163
Dates that construction will take place.

584
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:29,163
2.

585
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:33,607
City point person for the project.

586
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:33,607
3.

587
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,910
Scope and purpose of the construction. 4.

588
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:43,799
Any and all restrictions concerning road closure, detours, parking restrictions, driveway use restrictions.

589
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,484
Five, a timeline of what work will be performed and when and where the work will occur.

590
00:48:53,566 --> 00:49:05,114
Be it further resolved that the administration make available the point that the point that person for this project to appear before the DPW subcommittee

591
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:09,769
to address residents' concerns arising from this project.

592
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:10,989
Councillor Neill.

593
00:49:11,129 --> 00:49:12,449
Mr. President, thank you very much.

594
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:14,810
This new resolution was filed.

595
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,650
I just wanted to just elect a notice to the residents on the street.

596
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:28,012
A couple of weeks ago, I went up to the engineering division after a simple phone call from a constituent asking about the lines that are located on the street for cutting and excavation.

597
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,533
And I went to the engineering division, and they said,

598
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:33,775
Since that time, they have put, what was the construction?

599
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,066
residence doors.

600
00:49:52,106 --> 00:49:54,128
However, there are still some questions, Mr. President.

601
00:49:54,148 --> 00:50:05,217
So I'd ask the administration to provide us with a timeline of construction, at least at this point, versus the scope and purposes for a drainage project that this council actually approved the funding for.

602
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:13,660
There are going to be a significant number of restrictions on the road at this point, as is the number of pedestrians in the absence of residents.

603
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:19,122
I'd just like to talk about communication, the engineering and planning to the residents of the road.

604
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:27,425
First of all, as to what's going to be going on, what constraints are going to be in place, what restrictions are going to be on the expected potential of the road.

605
00:50:30,387 --> 00:50:32,208
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

606
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:35,110
All those opposed?

607
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:35,951
Carries 16-409.

608
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:47,999
Offered by Vice President Lungo Kern, be it resolved that the Medford High School Drama Club be congratulated on their superb performances of Fiddler on the Roof last weekend.

609
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:54,964
Be it further resolved that the performance director and Andrews Middle School music teacher, Sarah Grant,

610
00:50:55,374 --> 00:51:00,597
be thanked for her hard work in preparing and organizing the four plays.

611
00:51:01,097 --> 00:51:02,178
Madam Vice President.

612
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:04,359
Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

613
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:09,962
I just want to congratulate the students who were on Fiddler on the Roof, as well as the performance director.

614
00:51:12,643 --> 00:51:16,445
The show was amazing, and I just want to congratulate them.

615
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:17,566
I know that

616
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:30,607
This director, she is a music teacher at the Andrews Middle School, is also prepping now for the Andrews Middle School play of Annie, which is going to be coming up on June 10th and 11th.

617
00:51:30,907 --> 00:51:32,048
So I wanted to announce that.

618
00:51:32,788 --> 00:51:35,731
I'm hoping to take my girls to that play.

619
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:39,013
And it's just really great to have the community involved.

620
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:42,616
And such a great, somebody so great working with the children.

621
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:43,817
Tomorrow?

622
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:51,265
It is June 10th and 11th, the play of Annie at the Andrews, I believe it's at the Andrews Middle School.

623
00:51:51,805 --> 00:51:53,006
Thank you.

624
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,107
On the motion approved by Vice President London-Kern, all those in favor?

625
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:57,307
Opposed?

626
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:58,828
Motion carries.

627
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:09,033
16-410, offered by Councilors Falco and Caravello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Medford Troop 416 on their 100th anniversary.

628
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:09,973
Councilor Falco.

629
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,240
Thank you, Mr. President.

630
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,943
I just wanted to say congratulations and happy anniversary to Troop 416 down at Otis Street.

631
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,984
They run a fabulous program.

632
00:52:19,024 --> 00:52:24,067
There are over 100 Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts involved in the program.

633
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,629
They produce Eagle Scouts, I think, almost every year.

634
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:31,030
And it's just a great program.

635
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:34,632
They have great leaders down there, Paul McLean, Bob Wright.

636
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:36,393
They do a great job.

637
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:47,080
I know they've always provided us with a lot of service projects, and I just wanted to say happy anniversary.

638
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,341
Are you an Eagles fan from that group?

639
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:50,402
I am not an Eagles fan.

640
00:52:50,442 --> 00:52:51,203
All right.

641
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:52,744
Thank you.

642
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:53,104
Thank you.

643
00:52:53,124 --> 00:52:54,986
I just want to reiterate what Councilor Falco said.

644
00:52:55,626 --> 00:53:05,254
I've been down at Otter Street many times for the Eagle Awards, and I think they're having an event coming up soon in regards to this, if I read correctly.

645
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:06,875
They had one this past weekend.

646
00:53:07,587 --> 00:53:13,001
Mr. President, if we could maybe have them come up here and offer them a commendation for their service, it would be appreciated.

647
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:13,683
Very good.

648
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:15,628
So on the motion approved by Councilor Falco.

649
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,191
as amended and seconded by Councilor Caviello.

650
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:18,951
All those in favor?

651
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:19,251
Aye.

652
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:21,312
All those opposed?

653
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:22,153
Carries.

654
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:23,653
16-411 offered by Councilor Falco.

655
00:53:23,693 --> 00:53:42,961
Be it resolved that Medford City Council congratulate the Medford Middle Schools String Ensemble under the direction of Sophia Chang for winning the gold medal at the MICCA, Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association Band and Orchestra Concert Festival.

656
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:45,182
Be it further resolved that they be invited

657
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:49,055
to a future city council meeting to accept accommodations.

658
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,456
Councilor, we want them to come and play.

659
00:53:52,536 --> 00:53:54,497
Councilor Marks had them play here last year.

660
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:55,878
Councilor Falco.

661
00:53:56,218 --> 00:53:57,299
Thank you, Mr. President.

662
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,961
You know, having them come down and play I think is a fabulous idea.

663
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:06,683
I know when I was on the school committee, they would come and play for us each year.

664
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:11,125
And when you hear them play, it's amazing.

665
00:54:11,385 --> 00:54:13,286
It's hard to believe it's actually kids playing.

666
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:14,787
I mean, they do a fabulous job.

667
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,134
I just want to congratulate them on winning the gold medal again.

668
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,316
I think this is, if not the third, maybe the fourth year in a row.

669
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:24,818
I mean, there are a lot of great things happening in the Medford Public Schools.

670
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:28,981
This is just a fabulous program that is happening.

671
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:33,544
Sophia Chang does a great job, and the kids are just very, very talented.

672
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:41,770
And congratulations to them again for just a fabulous accomplishment.

673
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:43,841
Thank you.

674
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:44,241
Counselor.

675
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:54,285
So on the motion for approval, all those in favor, all those carries 16 dash four one two offered by councilor Falco be resolved at the Medford city council.

676
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:54,565
Thanks.

677
00:54:54,585 --> 00:55:00,668
Susan D a long time member of the board of trustees at Oak Grove cemetery for her 25 years of service.

678
00:55:00,748 --> 00:55:01,188
Counselor.

679
00:55:02,288 --> 00:55:03,149
Thank you, Mr. President.

680
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:06,790
Um, I just want to thank Susan D for a long time.

681
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:11,332
I've been a long term, um, time member of the, um, board of trustees up at the Oak Grove cemetery.

682
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:15,957
She gave over 25 years in that position, which is a significant amount of time.

683
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:20,501
And I just wanted to say thank you on behalf of the council.

684
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:25,845
And if I could just amend it to actually, if she could be invited to a future meeting to be recognized.

685
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:30,068
Absolutely.

686
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:32,530
Do we?

687
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:33,450
Yes.

688
00:55:33,651 --> 00:55:36,293
And we invited her, but I think it might've been when Councilor Falco was.

689
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:36,793
Oh, was it the one?

690
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:36,913
Okay.

691
00:55:36,953 --> 00:55:37,393
I apologize.

692
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:39,275
You weren't available at that meeting.

693
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:42,046
On the motion for approval then.

694
00:55:42,267 --> 00:55:42,927
All those in favor?

695
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:43,187
Aye.

696
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:43,907
All those opposed?

697
00:55:44,147 --> 00:55:44,807
Motion carries.

698
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:45,568
Motion to suspend.

699
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:50,289
Moved by Councillor, Vice-President Laura Kern for suspension of the rules.

700
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:52,190
All those in favor?

701
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,190
All those opposed?

702
00:55:53,811 --> 00:55:54,631
Madam Vice-President.

703
00:55:54,691 --> 00:56:03,374
Just briefly, while we're saying thank you and congratulations, I just wanted to mention the vigil that was held over the weekend and

704
00:56:04,723 --> 00:56:18,213
I guess congratulate them on a great event, but more so thank Medford's Overcoming Addiction and Janelle Rocco and her strong team for an amazing event.

705
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:23,397
There were five or six strong speakers who were moving.

706
00:56:24,698 --> 00:56:28,902
And I know that they filled the auditorium at the high school.

707
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:31,484
There was more people there than last year.

708
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:40,192
I think it was at City Hall last year, and I think I had standing room only in the back, and it was standing room only again this year at a bigger event.

709
00:56:40,212 --> 00:56:43,014
So I have to say there's more faces on the wall.

710
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:51,571
slideshow than last year and more names and recognizing half of them myself.

711
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:57,057
It was definitely an emotional event, but it was wonderful at the same time.

712
00:56:57,798 --> 00:57:03,663
Trying to break the stigma, which so many people could use some education on the topic.

713
00:57:05,545 --> 00:57:08,767
I just want to thank them for doing what they're doing in the city of Medford.

714
00:57:08,807 --> 00:57:11,528
And obviously, the council's in support of what they're doing.

715
00:57:11,548 --> 00:57:13,089
The mayor was there in support.

716
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:14,990
And it was a great event.

717
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:19,612
So on the motion for approval, all those in favor?

718
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:20,692
All those opposed?

719
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:21,353
Motion carries.

720
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:29,136
While we're under suspension, we have papers to clean up here in the hand of the clerk, offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

721
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:32,458
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate

722
00:57:33,023 --> 00:57:38,466
our residents who participated in the running of the 120th Boston Marathon.

723
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:41,668
Councilor Scarpelli.

724
00:57:41,888 --> 00:57:55,916
Being a superb athlete myself, Mr. President, I want to congratulate our residents who competed in this weekend's historical event, and especially a few people that we know personally.

725
00:57:55,936 --> 00:58:00,619
I know that Meg Richard, a personal friend of most of ours, really did a great job.

726
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:01,579
I believe she ran for

727
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,636
juvenile diabetes, which is very impressive.

728
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:11,872
And our neighbor, Bella Giambuso, who's a mother of three and a Fulton Street resident.

729
00:58:13,226 --> 00:58:16,627
And you realize how important and what this means to the families.

730
00:58:16,707 --> 00:58:28,011
I was speaking to her son yesterday, and he said he's so proud of his mother that she really set a tone in what anything they set their mind to, that they can achieve those same goals.

731
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:30,211
So I think that's what the marathon does.

732
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:37,334
And I know that I have a marathon runner at home, and my wife Dina, and this is something that's so important.

733
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,714
And they should be commended.

734
00:58:39,774 --> 00:58:42,075
So I congratulate them on a job well done.

735
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:47,782
I want to just piggyback on what Councillor Scarpelli said.

736
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:52,745
I unfortunately myself miss Paul Revere because I went into a tear on some of those runners.

737
00:58:52,765 --> 00:59:05,533
It took me and my family two hours to get in, two hours to get home on three trains, but we watched the runners at noon and it was just amazing and you saw more faces than I even knew I was going to see.

738
00:59:05,633 --> 00:59:07,874
It's such an accomplishment.

739
00:59:07,894 --> 00:59:08,855
I want to congratulate.

740
00:59:08,915 --> 00:59:10,636
I think we had in bed for 86 runners.

741
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:21,770
I opted for Paul Revere versus the Marathon.

742
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:34,978
I was going to go, but we'd be remiss if we didn't thank myself and Ed Finn's classmate, 72, Dave McGilvery, who had another fine job of managing the Marathon this year.

743
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:37,219
So congratulations to Dave McGilvery, class of 72.

744
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:37,719
Very good.

745
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:38,900
Nice.

746
00:59:39,901 --> 00:59:44,063
So congratulations to all those involved in the Boston Marathon.

747
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:45,558
Who have ties to Medford.

748
00:59:45,618 --> 00:59:46,938
On that motion, all those in favor?

749
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,138
Aye.

750
00:59:47,258 --> 00:59:47,939
All those opposed?

751
00:59:47,979 --> 00:59:51,080
Motion carries.

752
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,661
16-419 offered by Councilor Scott Belli.

753
00:59:53,101 --> 01:00:01,285
Be resolved that the Mayor's Office report back to the City Council on the status of the trailer of the Medford High School band.

754
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:02,966
Councilor?

755
01:00:02,986 --> 01:00:03,666
Thank you, Mr. President.

756
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:04,687
I received an email.

757
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:09,716
from the parent president of the board, the band Parent Association.

758
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:25,881
And I know they were asked to send quotes for the, I believe it was the new band trailer, and uniforms that were donated by Mayor McGlynn on his last wish list.

759
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:32,904
So they're curious that when that would come about, because they believe that they were setting up

760
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:40,635
time to drive down to Georgia to pick up that trailer, so if we can get some assistance on that, that'd be greatly appreciated.

761
01:00:40,675 --> 01:00:41,035
Thank you.

762
01:00:41,495 --> 01:00:42,956
On that motion, all those in favor?

763
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:44,277
All those opposed?

764
01:00:44,297 --> 01:00:44,977
Motion carries.

765
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:57,803
Offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the two electrical ground boxes at Carr Park be repaired immediately in the effort of public safety to children of Medford.

766
01:00:58,603 --> 01:01:00,304
These ground electrical boxes

767
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:04,213
are located in front of the baseball and tennis courts.

768
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:08,715
And the councilor, I think you all saw the photographs that the councilor had attached to this.

769
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:09,756
Councilor Caviello.

770
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,596
Thank you, Mr. President.

771
01:01:10,616 --> 01:01:17,220
Mr. President, I was informed of those by a couple of non-neighbors who were at the park with the children, and they brought that to my attention.

772
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:22,963
I'm surprised no one has gotten hurt up there with those two boxes up there.

773
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:28,186
So if that could be something that could be addressed immediately, Mr. President, it would be appreciated.

774
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:33,449
On that motion, all those in favor?

775
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:34,931
All those opposed?

776
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:36,212
Motion carries.

777
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:45,423
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters petitioned by Robert L. Capucci, Jr., 71 Evans Street, Medford to address the City Council about TV3.

778
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:46,365
We also have a

779
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:57,564
a redundant motion as well as it is of the same subject matter from another citizen, but the chair will allow both to speak.

780
01:01:57,984 --> 01:02:03,326
So we welcome you, citizen Capucci, and ask you to share your name and address for the record.

781
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:05,046
Thank you, Mr. President.

782
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:07,807
I'm Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

783
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:15,030
Let me start with the city is being denied a service that we're paying for.

784
01:02:15,673 --> 01:02:28,000
The last figure I heard is somewhere around half a million dollars from our Verizon and cable bill is going towards public access that's been shut off since, I believe, 2013.

785
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,842
That's years of a disservice to Medford.

786
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:43,568
So on Friday, I actually took a day off from work and I drove around to Melrose Community Public Access Station, SCAT TV in Somerville,

787
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,811
and Stoneham.

788
01:02:46,752 --> 01:02:50,494
Just to give an idea of what we're being denied here in Medford.

789
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:51,554
First of all, jobs.

790
01:02:52,575 --> 01:02:55,116
Somerville employs eight people full-time.

791
01:02:55,877 --> 01:03:01,680
Malden, I found out from one of the station managers that I visited, employs nine people full-time.

792
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:07,503
Melrose has three people full-time with three part-timers, and I think it's the same in Stoneham.

793
01:03:08,104 --> 01:03:11,165
That's jobs being denied to Medford residents.

794
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:11,986
That's number one.

795
01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:18,299
The programming that's on some of these stations is unbelievable.

796
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:23,481
Self-help programs, community awareness programs.

797
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:37,586
I think of some of the organizations here in Medford, like the Medford Community Coalition or Prominent Citizens that were just honored a few weeks ago, Jay Campbell, the fine things these folks do.

798
01:03:37,906 --> 01:03:39,767
With a public access TV show,

799
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:45,372
it could be compounded and bring more great services to the city.

800
01:03:45,813 --> 01:03:51,235
I mean, you all know I'm a political activist, so my forte is, you know, we're in a big election year here.

801
01:03:52,215 --> 01:03:54,957
Candidates, next year's a municipal election year.

802
01:03:55,537 --> 01:04:02,840
Candidates could have a forum, another avenue to bring their campaign and talk about different things.

803
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,301
You know, I think about in 2015, some 2,500 people blanked

804
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:10,534
the ballot question.

805
01:04:11,816 --> 01:04:19,825
It might not have been so many if we had, you know, a public access TV show where we could discuss the pros and cons of the ballot question.

806
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:29,056
Other things, too, that could happen, the Honorable Brianna Lungo-Kern talked about

807
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,727
communications from the police in terms of different things.

808
01:04:35,607 --> 01:04:36,728
He could have a show on there.

809
01:04:37,548 --> 01:04:44,352
You can talk about different neighborhoods in Medford that might be having problems or might need more attention.

810
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:57,979
Boards and planning meetings that happen in this building could find a show from somebody who wishes to produce a show on things like that and bring more information

811
01:04:58,672 --> 01:05:05,756
which is power and knowledge to the taxpayers of this city that deserve public access.

812
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:27,026
Now, in talking with other station managers and the wonderful things that they're doing, at least one of them, the station manager at Somerville, knew a little bit about what we have here in Medford, the equipment, and they offered, you know, they said if I'm successful in bringing a positive message and do get the ball rolling,

813
01:05:27,316 --> 01:05:30,778
They're going to reach out, and they're going to help us get us up on our feet and running.

814
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:32,679
I'm sure there's a lot of other residents.

815
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:50,648
The students, they have great teaching going on at Medford High School, but having our own public access, this could be almost like an internship for them to get real world experience to move on to whatever college and future careers they might have.

816
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,991
In closing, I just want to say that I

817
01:05:56,063 --> 01:06:04,129
I hope that the mayor's office is watching this because I believe ultimately it resides in the mayor's office to get this back up and running or not.

818
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:14,257
But if there's any kind of vote or any influence that you find city councilors can have on the mayor's office to get this going, it would be great.

819
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:25,465
I mean, in terms of helping this city, there's so many things a public access station can do for children, for working families,

820
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:27,085
and for our senior citizens.

821
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,546
So I hope you take that into consideration.

822
01:06:29,626 --> 01:06:30,446
Thank you for your time.

823
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:31,246
Thank you very much.

824
01:06:32,007 --> 01:06:33,507
Thank you very much, Mr. Capucci.

825
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:41,089
Do we have a motion to receive and place on file?

826
01:06:41,169 --> 01:06:41,909
Councilor Falco?

827
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:43,810
Councilor Caviello?

828
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:45,710
All those in favor?

829
01:06:47,031 --> 01:06:47,991
Madam Vice President.

830
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:50,572
Thank you, President Diller.

831
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:51,612
On a motion of Councilor Caviello.

832
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:55,905
Yes, I don't know if we're going to combine the resolutions.

833
01:06:55,965 --> 01:06:58,528
I just think there's a lot of them we're not going to combine.

834
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:05,734
Then on this one specifically, I hear our concerned citizen loud and clear.

835
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:09,517
I think we've asked the question many times, what is going on?

836
01:07:10,018 --> 01:07:14,061
I know I had testified in front of Judge Jack Jackson, which seems like maybe

837
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:17,939
and over 10 years ago.

838
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:26,121
And I just, I think it's, I've voiced my opinion with regards to how the process moved along within the last 10 years.

839
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:38,043
It's really unfortunate that the residents of this community are paying for an access station, putting money, money's taken out of their cable bill every single month.

840
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:42,884
And I'm not sure the exact figure, but I think Mr. Cuccio was right.

841
01:07:43,284 --> 01:07:46,325
She was right, about half a million dollars is being held.

842
01:07:46,745 --> 01:07:48,025
Now, that's taxpayers' money.

843
01:07:48,445 --> 01:07:49,285
We've said it before.

844
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:59,287
Are we going to give that back to the taxpayers, or are we going to do something about it, create a new station, something that the residents and the taxpayers, great payers, deserve?

845
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,948
I think we need, it's time we get an update from our new mayor.

846
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:06,108
It's been four months.

847
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:08,489
We've had some time.

848
01:08:09,606 --> 01:08:11,147
for the administration to settle in.

849
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:14,050
And I think we need to see what we're gonna do moving forward.

850
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:23,497
And I hope that TV3, we did have one meeting with the administration and the mayor, which was a great meeting, but nothing about TV3 was discussed at that meeting.

851
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:30,683
So I'm hoping at our next meeting with the mayor's office that we get some information with regards to how we're gonna move this forward.

852
01:08:30,843 --> 01:08:32,305
I think it's extremely important.

853
01:08:33,045 --> 01:08:37,909
He nailed it on the head with regards to students and what this can do for students alone, nevermind jobs.

854
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,110
what other cities and towns are doing.

855
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:50,413
It's really unfortunate the state that our TV access is in, which is a state, I guess, but we need to move this forward.

856
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:56,854
This should be one of the tough things that need to be done within the next few months, and I hope that comes to fruition.

857
01:08:57,454 --> 01:09:07,697
So if we could get a report back from the mayor's office on what we're doing to move forward on this issue, TV3, getting a television station up and running in the city of Medford

858
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:11,812
the entire community, an update would be appreciated.

859
01:09:11,832 --> 01:09:16,755
A motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Caviello, seconded by- If you could withdraw that.

860
01:09:16,775 --> 01:09:22,419
Do you mind just move, just to get a report back from the Mayor's Office?

861
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:23,059
Thank you.

862
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:23,619
You withdraw that?

863
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:33,065
On the motion of Councilor Langel-Kern that the Mayor's Office update the City Council on the efforts towards

864
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:36,674
public access, TV3.

865
01:09:37,154 --> 01:09:39,034
Chair recognizes Councilman Max.

866
01:09:39,154 --> 01:09:40,115
Thank you, Mr. President.

867
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:43,996
I want to thank Mr. Capucci for bringing this topic up.

868
01:09:44,036 --> 01:09:52,799
It's a very important topic, and we know the old administration under Mayor McGlynn was anti-public access.

869
01:09:53,719 --> 01:10:04,323
I still can't figure out why, but for many years, that administration did everything they could to stop public access in this community, but still maintained

870
01:10:04,795 --> 01:10:12,922
the funding through franchise fees that we were all paying for PEG, government, public, and educational access.

871
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:17,506
This current mayor now appointed many committees.

872
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:31,098
I know, Mr. President, you chair the Business and Economic Committee, or co-chair, and I know there were recommendations just made by the Constituent Service Committee after having several public hearings in this community.

873
01:10:31,534 --> 01:10:39,696
And after hearing from residents, the main theme of their report was, we need more transparency in this community.

874
01:10:40,577 --> 01:10:51,580
And I find it ironic that the one thing that really would bring some great change in this community, and it's not a solve-all by any means, but government access.

875
01:10:52,537 --> 01:10:53,578
Community access.

876
01:10:54,318 --> 01:11:02,163
Those are the initiatives, I think, that as a government, we're obligated to let people voice their opinion.

877
01:11:02,664 --> 01:11:07,707
And I remember the good old days when they used to televise Meffitt High football games.

878
01:11:08,127 --> 01:11:10,088
And they used to televise the parade live.

879
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:12,330
And they used to have talk shows on there.

880
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,772
And they used to bring up current events in the community.

881
01:11:16,259 --> 01:11:18,961
And they'd have a cooking show, and they'd have other shows.

882
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:22,563
It was just a great way of uniting the community.

883
01:11:23,024 --> 01:11:32,670
And I'm hoping this new administration practice what they preach in transparency and brings back local community access, Mr. President.

884
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,091
We're paying for it.

885
01:11:35,532 --> 01:11:36,973
There's a need in this community.

886
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,334
People want to have access.

887
01:11:39,835 --> 01:11:44,378
I hear it over and over again, and I'm not sure why it takes so many years.

888
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:49,845
to get access after creating committees to advise the administration.

889
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,306
We've been there, done that.

890
01:11:51,386 --> 01:11:54,469
The Judge Jackson report, we've been there, done that.

891
01:11:55,029 --> 01:11:56,250
Now we want access.

892
01:11:57,431 --> 01:12:08,459
So I agree with the speaker and I'm hoping this administration, I know Mayor Burke has a lot on her plate, but I too would like to hear more about community access.

893
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:12,281
I read the article in the first 100 days and that's great.

894
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:14,523
There's been some change in the community

895
01:12:15,008 --> 01:12:17,570
some initiatives that this administration has offered.

896
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:21,893
But some of the meat and potato issues, I still want to hear about.

897
01:12:22,573 --> 01:12:29,558
And this community access has been an albatross around the city's neck for a long time.

898
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:31,800
And I think we need to address it, Mr. President.

899
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,301
The Vice President and the public are currently with you.

900
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:35,982
The chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

901
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:38,984
Welcome, Mr. Indy, and Mr. President.

902
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:40,566
Thank you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

903
01:12:40,586 --> 01:12:42,127
And I'm sorry, Indy, that was my bad.

904
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:43,247
I didn't know you were sick.

905
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:49,566
This could be an energizing battery for the city, for the business community, for the schools, for everything.

906
01:12:50,006 --> 01:12:54,628
But I wanted to break down some of the money issues involved because not everybody wants to talk about it.

907
01:12:55,649 --> 01:13:02,012
For every $100 that I pay in my cable bill, whether it be Verizon or Comcast, $5 gets taken off the top.

908
01:13:02,572 --> 01:13:11,717
The deal that the mayor made in 1988 or whatever it was, was that out of that $5, $3 goes to the general fund of the city of Medford.

909
01:13:12,197 --> 01:13:14,278
Now, I was hired on the arts community last week

910
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:24,343
But if they were to seek that money from the general fund back into the arts community for AXS TV, then I would be a proponent of that.

911
01:13:24,843 --> 01:13:30,244
That's not what the city wants to hear, but I would be a proponent of having that money go back to what it's supposed to go to.

912
01:13:30,264 --> 01:13:37,106
Because when you tell me that Somerville hires nine people, they have to be using all 5% of that money.

913
01:13:37,586 --> 01:13:43,608
And so we only receive 2% for our peg, which is public, education,

914
01:13:44,058 --> 01:13:45,159
and government access.

915
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:53,626
And 1% is used for, only 1% is used for the public access.

916
01:13:54,126 --> 01:14:02,173
The other 1% is split in half, the government channel slash high school channel or education channel.

917
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:05,275
And so people need to be aware that there is more money in there.

918
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:07,437
We're paying that out of our cable bills.

919
01:14:07,757 --> 01:14:09,119
It's not coming out of the tax base.

920
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:10,780
So it's not the taxpayer's money.

921
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:15,333
It's the rate payers' money, but it goes to the tax base.

922
01:14:16,094 --> 01:14:18,354
So there's a little bit of a mix up there.

923
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:21,095
I know it's hard for people at home to figure that out.

924
01:14:21,396 --> 01:14:22,916
It took me a while to figure it out myself.

925
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:25,537
So I just wanted to clarify that that's where the money comes from.

926
01:14:25,977 --> 01:14:33,680
And I want to know, if I could ask through the chair, is the theater has a cable drop?

927
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,282
It has the ability, the theater, our Chevalier Theater currently has the ability

928
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:43,428
to have a station in that building, it's cable ready.

929
01:14:44,168 --> 01:14:55,530
So if it's just because of the Boys and Girls Club, if we move the Boys and Girls Club out of the basement, we could automatically, without even renting a new space, just put the station in the basement of the theater.

930
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:04,251
Because otherwise it's a cumbersome process to go through the square, find a spot, and it would take longer to do that.

931
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:08,712
We could do that in the future or whatever, but if you wanted to have it done today, they're cable ready.

932
01:15:09,675 --> 01:15:14,478
The man that's in charge over there, he said that they had a cable drop, so it's cable ready.

933
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:16,479
So thank you very much for letting me speak.

934
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:19,541
Good evening.

935
01:15:19,621 --> 01:15:20,082
Thank you.

936
01:15:20,302 --> 01:15:21,963
Your name and address for the record, please, sir.

937
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,564
Thank you, Mr. President.

938
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:25,445
Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

939
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:35,732
Really briefly, what these other cities and towns do to offset costs, as I'm sure you probably know, is they charge a membership fee for the year.

940
01:15:36,483 --> 01:15:40,245
So that brings in money to the station to help pay for some of the employees that work there.

941
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:46,068
And a couple of other quick points, too, is obviously not everybody has cable in Medford.

942
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:57,755
So what Melrose does is they put all of their shows, you know, if everybody has the internet at home, even without cable, you can still be watching local access in that town.

943
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:03,458
And one final point I want to make, and it's something that I brought up here.

944
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:10,881
that, you know, I don't want to say it was pushback on doing public access, but some of the comments I hear is that nobody will watch it.

945
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:14,902
Well, Comcast actually does internal ratings.

946
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:23,584
And in Melrose, 75% of the Comcast subscribers are watching their community local access TV.

947
01:16:23,924 --> 01:16:25,525
So the interest is there.

948
01:16:25,885 --> 01:16:27,045
The funding is there.

949
01:16:27,545 --> 01:16:29,826
It's just a political will to get it done.

950
01:16:29,906 --> 01:16:30,706
Thank you, Mr. President.

951
01:16:31,147 --> 01:16:34,830
On the motion for approval by Vice President Logan Kern, Counselor Knight.

952
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:45,698
I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and ask the administration the question as to whether or not we actually received a qualified, received and accepted a qualified bidder for the running of the community access programs.

953
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:47,340
It's amended by Counselor Knight.

954
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,601
On the motion, all those in favor?

955
01:16:50,322 --> 01:16:51,143
All those opposed?

956
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:53,685
Motion carries.

957
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:08,765
16-414 petition by Robert M. Penta, Xero, Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts, to address the city council about Medford public access.

958
01:17:09,445 --> 01:17:10,826
Welcome, citizen.

959
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:12,887
Please state your name and address for the record.

960
01:17:13,187 --> 01:17:14,908
Good evening, Mr. President and council members.

961
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:18,449
My name is Robert Penta, Xero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

962
01:17:18,589 --> 01:17:19,610
I'm a member of this board.

963
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:24,612
I thank Mr. Capucci for coming forward because his flavor on the subject matter is different than mine.

964
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:28,023
Mine basically as history has a way of repeating itself.

965
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:33,127
Regarding public access here in the city of Medford, we are at the repeating stage once again.

966
01:17:33,928 --> 01:17:43,236
Since early 2013 to date, we, the Comcast and Verizon cable subscribers, have been charged the monthly public access fee totaling some $500,000.

967
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:48,320
And we, the subscribers, still have no public access station.

968
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:54,025
What we heard from 2013 by the city administration was that the city will be asking for

969
01:17:54,581 --> 01:18:08,225
Channel 3 records, bank statements, meeting minutes, and an inventory accounting of the Channel 3 Public Access Corporation, because then at that point in time, Channel 3 Corporation was filing for dissolution of its Chapter 3 Corporation.

970
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:20,448
Records of expenditures of gasoline, restaurants, retail, supermarkets, hardware home suppliers, plumbing and air conditioning materials, building materials, auto supplies,

971
01:18:21,128 --> 01:18:33,892
Miscellaneous expenses in bank and ATM withdrawals, along with deposits and credits from the banks in the accounting were examples that were supposed to have been forwarded to the city of Medford pursuant to the dissolution filing.

972
01:18:34,412 --> 01:18:43,395
As of this date, no accounting of any records, bank statements, meeting minutes, or accurate inventory accounting has ever been verified from channel three.

973
01:18:44,355 --> 01:18:47,776
Regarding the city's lack of providing public access TV,

974
01:18:48,358 --> 01:18:57,904
The ever-going question since 2013 has been, why has the city failed to mandate that public access be made available as contractually applied for?

975
01:18:58,805 --> 01:19:14,255
Fast forward to today, and putting aside all the comments and issue regarding the forced ascertainment hearing, the former mayor's commission report regarding public cable access, and multiple council resolutions regarding this matter.

976
01:19:15,193 --> 01:19:26,261
It seems that this administration feels that to spend some $500,000 for an access studio up in the back of Medford High School will serve in the best interest of a local public access station.

977
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:32,705
I don't believe this to be in the best interest of our subscribers and citizens, and for the following reasons.

978
01:19:33,525 --> 01:19:39,570
It's location, location, location that is the primary success staple of any business.

979
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:44,493
The Medford High location will not serve the best interest for our public access.

980
01:19:45,341 --> 01:19:46,461
Examples as to why.

981
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:52,083
Its public access is not on a main street that is centrally located.

982
01:19:52,963 --> 01:19:54,503
The entranceway is not well lit.

983
01:19:55,023 --> 01:20:01,925
It is not easily accessible to walk up and to walk back the hill from the back to and from Medford High School.

984
01:20:03,025 --> 01:20:10,267
It presents a winter problem of ice and snow needing to be cleared at all times on the hill and the walkway to the school's back entrance.

985
01:20:10,947 --> 01:20:14,348
It presents a safety security problem for after school hours

986
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,581
and nighttime lighting is at a minimum.

987
01:20:18,002 --> 01:20:26,246
As a major positive contrast to the Medford High location, the Medford Public Library serves as the best location for public access studio.

988
01:20:27,326 --> 01:20:29,107
It is centrally located within our city.

989
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:33,789
It has walking convenience within the city's downtown area and bus routes.

990
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:41,253
It is handicap accessible to being easily available for front door entrance for bus and cab transportation.

991
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:47,331
It offers a great additional public educational opportunity for community public access.

992
01:20:48,252 --> 01:20:58,919
Medford's $500,000 bank deposits from Comcast and Verizon thus far will definitely produce at the library the space needs necessary for this development.

993
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:10,907
As Councilor Caviello has indicated by requesting the Massachusetts State Library Commission come to Medford to ascertain what state additional funding can be for the library to Ghana for the library's rehabilitation,

994
01:21:11,903 --> 01:21:33,029
That, along with what I proposed last year during the Mayor's campaign to have a complaint present use and future use, along with the $500,000 funds that are readily available right now here in City Hall, could catapult the Meffitt Public Library to being Meffitt's premier central educational and social meeting spot that incorporates an entire community of opportunity.

995
01:21:34,069 --> 01:21:36,550
This would be the perfect segue for having

996
01:21:36,987 --> 01:21:49,252
The Massachusetts State Library Commission realized that we are working to make our library a major focal point in our city, and their additional support position would certainly carry us to that potential.

997
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:55,734
It would be an example of how a city fully realizes the community potential of its public library.

998
01:21:56,575 --> 01:22:05,498
To my understanding and education thus far, this would be a first for the Massachusetts State Library Commission to co-invest with a city with matching funds.

999
01:22:06,403 --> 01:22:21,006
The Meffitt Vocational School location, as is presently being entertained, could be a satellite location for students' learning of production and access operations as a school program offering separate and distinct from the public access studio.

1000
01:22:21,947 --> 01:22:30,369
This opportunity for community public access to be better located and more readily available should not be squandered away because of political posturing.

1001
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:34,470
Mayor McGlynn's own committee report of June 2015 specifically stated,

1002
01:22:37,305 --> 01:22:46,531
We are a committee that feels that the best location will be in one that is conveniently and centrally located with its own entrance and exit and should be handicap accessible.

1003
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:53,555
The Method Public Library could serve no better location than the one that has been advised for.

1004
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:59,518
Also, with the city owning the property, annual rental payments will not have to be provided.

1005
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,921
Therefore, providing for more revenue to maintain, upgrade equipment,

1006
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:12,598
and conveniently offer to the community programs that showcase our city and the families and subscribers that watch and use public access TV.

1007
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:33,345
I respectfully ask that this honorable body of councilors request by a roll call vote that our city administration reconsider its position regarding public access to TV being at Medford High School and entertain the Medford Public Library as the location that will better serve our community in the Comcast and variable cable rate payers

1008
01:23:33,732 --> 01:23:35,353
for paying for their public access.

1009
01:23:46,477 --> 01:23:49,118
Well, I have a question that I presented before the council.

1010
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:52,840
I was just wondering if anyone would entertain that because I think this is a very important issue.

1011
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:57,242
It's a lot of money and I think it offers a great opportunity.

1012
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:11,193
I do believe when Barbara Kerr was here recently discussing some of the plans for the library, one of the things that was raised was that there was a deeded restriction on the library because that land was donated to the city of Medford and the only purpose that it could be used for was for a library, if I remember correctly.

1013
01:24:11,233 --> 01:24:18,921
So maybe we can ask that question to see as to whether or not there's a deeded restriction on the library and as to see as to whether or not there is any other use that would be appropriate there other than a library.

1014
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:25,363
On the motion of council night that the Memphis City Council requests of the librarian, Ms.

1015
01:24:25,403 --> 01:24:31,666
Barbara Kerr, to inquire as to deed restrictions on the use of the library.

1016
01:24:31,686 --> 01:24:32,147
Mr. President.

1017
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,008
Chair recognizes Councilor Karen Fiala.

1018
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:34,848
Thank you, Mr. President.

1019
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:42,312
Um, Councilor Pinto, I don't want, I don't want the people to be misled to think the library is going to get built, uh, you know, very soon.

1020
01:24:42,372 --> 01:24:47,895
Um, I was fortunate to be with the mayor, uh, and the library and the library, uh, people when that day they came and, um,

1021
01:24:49,382 --> 01:25:02,245
speaking with the mayor last week, we do have a lot of work ahead of us just to make the grant round by the end of October when the papers have to be filed for the January meeting.

1022
01:25:03,585 --> 01:25:09,466
So if that doesn't get done, the next round of funding for the library will be 2022.

1023
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:18,068
So I know the mayor and her staff are working to try to get into that date by the end of October so we can get into the final round.

1024
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:25,664
Even if we make it to that round, I think it's going to be a couple of years before we see the funding for that to happen.

1025
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:30,206
It won't be happening next year, but it'll be probably a couple of years before we actually can get it off the ground.

1026
01:25:30,867 --> 01:25:32,827
There's a motion on the floor from Councilor Knight.

1027
01:25:36,469 --> 01:25:37,370
Madam Vice President.

1028
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:39,751
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

1029
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:47,174
Councilor Carviel, can you just better explain or more in detail explain what's due October, November?

1030
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,981
2016 full application for funding?

1031
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:53,522
Yeah, the application process is quite lengthy.

1032
01:25:53,962 --> 01:25:57,883
And it also requires us hiring a couple of people before it gets done.

1033
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:05,065
And even the library commissioners felt it was a daunting task for us to get done by the end of October.

1034
01:26:05,265 --> 01:26:12,787
And I applaud the mayor for trying to do this and hopefully get it in by the October deadline.

1035
01:26:12,847 --> 01:26:16,188
And I have full confidence that we'll be able to get that done.

1036
01:26:16,876 --> 01:26:22,698
And it'll probably be an expenditure of some money for us for hiring an engineer and a project manager and those type of things.

1037
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:25,879
So again, I would hope that would get done soon.

1038
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,082
But I say, it is, from what I'm saying, I think it was 140 pages of documentation that needed to get done.

1039
01:26:32,662 --> 01:26:37,464
So again, and when I spoke to the mayor, she was working on it and had the staff on it.

1040
01:26:37,504 --> 01:26:41,906
So hopefully we'll have it done by the time to get it in for the funding round.

1041
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:43,906
Thank you, Councilor Cavillo.

1042
01:26:44,026 --> 01:26:45,227
And just on that- And Vice President.

1043
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:53,655
Do you know when they would award the grants?

1044
01:26:53,715 --> 01:27:00,539
I think January was the time when they would discuss who would get the monies that were out there.

1045
01:27:00,919 --> 01:27:11,106
When I was there, we did walk the property with the commissioner, and they agreed that it wasn't that big of a deal to bump out all the walls and put up a full second floor there.

1046
01:27:11,126 --> 01:27:14,247
And they also agreed that the library was in

1047
01:27:15,469 --> 01:27:22,673
In pretty decent shape, it needed a little bit of work here and there, but it wasn't something that was insurmountable with.

1048
01:27:22,954 --> 01:27:24,835
The building had to be torn down and slapped to scratch.

1049
01:27:25,435 --> 01:27:28,737
So there was a lot of positive that came out of that meeting.

1050
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:30,398
Thank you.

1051
01:27:30,418 --> 01:27:44,246
Yeah, I was just trying to get a better timeline on when, if by chance, we were able to get the application in, got the grant, build out, so you're still looking at 2019 by the time you have a second floor in the library, best case scenario.

1052
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:45,147
Yeah, yes.

1053
01:27:47,707 --> 01:27:57,192
I think Councilor Penta has agreed, you know, I think a more centrally located TV station somewhere in the square, somewhere.

1054
01:27:57,632 --> 01:28:02,374
We keep talking about some sort of art center, whether it's at the library or not.

1055
01:28:02,795 --> 01:28:04,355
We want it centrally located.

1056
01:28:05,096 --> 01:28:07,957
Obviously, there's no safety issues with the high school.

1057
01:28:08,017 --> 01:28:09,098
The doors are now locked.

1058
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:11,739
Security cameras are working, thankfully.

1059
01:28:12,183 --> 01:28:16,846
but it is dark, it is not centrally located, it's more in the west.

1060
01:28:16,866 --> 01:28:18,648
Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelley.

1061
01:28:18,868 --> 01:28:38,863
So the viewing public knows the lighting has been upgraded along the building, and the building, if I'm not mistaken, is separate entrance when the plan, if they were to put in public access for the rest of the building, so just to inform the public.

1062
01:28:39,143 --> 01:28:39,944
Thank you, Councilor.

1063
01:28:41,433 --> 01:28:42,614
Madam Vice President.

1064
01:28:42,674 --> 01:28:50,599
I think for many reasons, I think more centrally located TV3 station would be the way I would lean.

1065
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:56,483
And I think that's how I've been hearing when people do discuss possible television station.

1066
01:28:57,124 --> 01:29:03,368
I think the general public is leaning more towards a centrally located station, whether it be the library or somewhere else in the square.

1067
01:29:03,388 --> 01:29:08,672
I understand what you're talking about, and I tend to agree.

1068
01:29:09,348 --> 01:29:16,273
So maybe what we really need to do, we're asking the mayor for an update on the situation.

1069
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:23,638
Councilor Knight asked for what's going on with regards to deed restrictions.

1070
01:29:23,698 --> 01:29:29,381
Maybe we need to have a committee of the whole meeting and discuss a number of things, the library being one.

1071
01:29:29,502 --> 01:29:33,744
In general, the roof, as well as TV3, and just get another few things that are

1072
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:40,882
really hot topics with the, with the council and have another meeting, invite the mayor to come talk to us about it.

1073
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,043
I think that might be the best, our best Avenue.

1074
01:29:43,543 --> 01:29:54,028
So I just amend the paper for a committee, the whole meeting with the mayor to discuss a number of different things that we never weren't able to get to at our last meeting with her.

1075
01:29:54,048 --> 01:29:58,970
Thank you, Mr. President.

1076
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:00,951
I thank a council of Penta for,

1077
01:30:01,725 --> 01:30:04,526
bringing up this important subject.

1078
01:30:05,426 --> 01:30:06,987
I agree also with the location.

1079
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:27,452
I think the high school, although the building is currently underutilized right now and does have the capacity to take on public access and a portion of the building, I think having the building, don't forget the last two community access stations were in the square and they were there for a reason.

1080
01:30:27,892 --> 01:30:29,893
They were there for a reason because of its location.

1081
01:30:30,448 --> 01:30:32,889
and it's easy access into the square.

1082
01:30:33,549 --> 01:30:38,951
And I think the library is one possible item.

1083
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:44,333
I think Springstep, you know, we all talk about Springstep and we'd love to have Springstep.

1084
01:30:44,373 --> 01:30:46,554
It's a stone throw from City Hall.

1085
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:50,876
The building itself is made for the performance and the arts.

1086
01:30:51,456 --> 01:30:58,819
As Councilor Caviello mentioned about having it an art center slash possibly

1087
01:31:00,548 --> 01:31:04,869
community cable would be a great suggestion.

1088
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:18,253
And, you know, I remember back some 10 years ago, maybe even a little longer, Mr. President, you probably remember, when we were looking at merging the yachts and the community access at the Swan building, the Swan School.

1089
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:21,214
And it missed by one vote of this council.

1090
01:31:21,655 --> 01:31:23,415
We almost had that come to fruition.

1091
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:25,196
And I think that's a great marriage.

1092
01:31:25,596 --> 01:31:26,636
And I think it would have worked out.

1093
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:29,497
The Springstep building is ideal for

1094
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:31,231
for that situation.

1095
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:32,752
It's centrally located.

1096
01:31:33,312 --> 01:31:34,573
It steps from City Hall.

1097
01:31:34,853 --> 01:31:35,994
There's ample parking.

1098
01:31:36,614 --> 01:31:44,059
And really, I don't see why, if I were the mayor, I'd be on the phone with the owner of that property.

1099
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:56,466
Mr. President, from what I hear, they're looking to unload that building, and they haven't been too successful because of the setup of the building is conducive to arts and so forth.

1100
01:31:57,347 --> 01:31:59,308
I think that would be a great addition to this city.

1101
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:05,162
So I think what the gentleman at the podium, Counselor Penter, is offering is just another alternative.

1102
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:15,864
You know, I, as one member, and I've stated this loud and clear, I don't want to see our high school used for anything else than its intended purpose to educate our children.

1103
01:32:16,265 --> 01:32:27,627
And in this day and age, with everything that's going on, in my opinion, the least number of people we have up there that aren't students and teachers, the better off and the safer we're going to be, Mr. President.

1104
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,378
And that's a whole other discussion for another time.

1105
01:32:30,438 --> 01:32:36,540
But I don't want to see that building opened up, even though it may be one separate door and at a certain end.

1106
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:44,581
I don't want to see it opened up for anything other than its intended purpose, which is to educate our children, Mr. President.

1107
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,801
So I thank Councilor Penta for offering this.

1108
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:55,163
I look forward to hearing back on Councilor Knight's motion to see if the library could be used for any other purpose.

1109
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:56,083
I didn't realize there was a

1110
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:58,240
a deed restriction on that if there is one.

1111
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:03,401
And you know what, several weeks ago, we had the issue of the Hegner Center before us.

1112
01:33:04,141 --> 01:33:09,303
I mean, here's a small building in the city that could be used for local access.

1113
01:33:09,663 --> 01:33:16,965
It might not be centrally as located as we like, but that may be a great addition if it comes back in the city coffers.

1114
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:22,607
And the one thing Councilor Penta mentioned is when you have a space that you're paying for,

1115
01:33:22,987 --> 01:33:25,969
when you're paying $1,500 or $2,000 a month.

1116
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:35,337
A lion's share of your money goes to housing, community access, and not towards programming and hiring the people to get it up and running.

1117
01:33:36,038 --> 01:33:49,249
And if it wasn't a city building, I think a lot of that money could be put towards programming and hiring the right people to run the access station, rather than on the physical property itself.

1118
01:33:49,389 --> 01:33:52,231
So that's a great point that Councilor Penta mentioned.

1119
01:33:57,576 --> 01:33:59,277
Thank you.

1120
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:00,438
Just was updated.

1121
01:34:00,478 --> 01:34:04,341
It looks like the transcript is due in an article.

1122
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:15,049
It will be in tomorrow's online version with regards to the fact that pre-construction work on the new Access TV studio at the high school began last week.

1123
01:34:15,829 --> 01:34:17,270
So we weren't notified.

1124
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:18,611
I wasn't aware.

1125
01:34:21,834 --> 01:34:33,643
Yes, Mr. President, I think it's also very important for us to point out the fact that every time that the library comes up on our agenda, this council chamber has a good number of people here that are speaking in support of it.

1126
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:39,908
And if we're going to talk about changing the use of the library, the direction the library is going in, I think it's very important to include these individuals as well.

1127
01:34:40,309 --> 01:34:47,234
So I'd ask that the friends of the public library be invited to our next committee of the whole meeting when it does take place to discuss this matter.

1128
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:55,546
I'd also ask that the city clerk compile a list of all the individuals that have come up to speak in favor of issues going on at the library so that an invitation could be extended to them as well.

1129
01:34:56,687 --> 01:34:58,028
As amended by Councilor Knight.

1130
01:34:58,708 --> 01:35:00,590
On that motion, Councilor Caviello.

1131
01:35:02,491 --> 01:35:13,138
I think Councilor Knight, I think we may be a little premature in bringing the library people in to discuss what's going to be going on there because they're a long way away from actually getting anything done in there.

1132
01:35:13,158 --> 01:35:17,281
In fact, one of the suggestions of the library commission was that we actually had two members

1133
01:35:17,608 --> 01:35:26,711
Too many books in there, and that was maybe we should scale down our inventory to garner some more space.

1134
01:35:26,771 --> 01:35:27,572
That was a big thing.

1135
01:35:27,772 --> 01:35:31,913
But again, Councilor Marks is right, we missed the boat buying the property across the street.

1136
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:34,274
I proposed buying it when it was $2 million.

1137
01:35:35,435 --> 01:35:38,036
Now, from what I understand, it recently sold to somebody.

1138
01:35:39,676 --> 01:35:41,377
And now it's back on the market for 4 million.

1139
01:35:42,745 --> 01:35:47,248
But it did, if I'm not mistaken, I was told that it did change hands with another owner.

1140
01:35:47,268 --> 01:35:49,590
It was back on the market before.

1141
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:53,232
But again, that was a spot that we should have taken advantage of some years ago.

1142
01:35:53,552 --> 01:36:02,739
It was ready to go, needed no work, little wiring for the thing, and it sufficed all the space needs for the whole community that was needed.

1143
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:06,962
Again, it was a loss of something that should have been taken advantage of.

1144
01:36:06,982 --> 01:36:08,723
Thank you, Counselor.

1145
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:34,312
And just to be clear, Mr. President, if we're going to, when I said invite the friends of the library and those people who have come down to speak in favor of the needs at the library, it's if in fact this council is going to deliberate a discussion of changing the use of the library and moving it away from just being a library, whether it's to add a second floor, make that TV three, or whatever it is, whatever direction we're going, I think that they should be involved in at least the conversation to provide their input, because those are the people that have supported the efforts of the library.

1146
01:36:34,332 --> 01:36:36,813
When the library went through its worst times, they were the ones that held it up.

1147
01:36:43,611 --> 01:36:51,976
Part of the money that comes from the library association does have provisions on it, on what you can do and what you can't do with it.

1148
01:36:51,996 --> 01:36:53,978
So again, you are correct on that.

1149
01:36:54,478 --> 01:36:57,780
I'm more concerned about the building and the actual use than I am about the money coming from the state.

1150
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:01,982
There are conditions on what you can do with that money if you are awarded it.

1151
01:37:05,044 --> 01:37:05,304
All set?

1152
01:37:08,372 --> 01:37:20,358
Mr. President, as just a point of reference, for the last six years, prior to last year, don't forget the city of Medford got waivers from the Mass Department, State Department of Library Commissioners, because the city did not put enough money in there when, in fact, they did have the money.

1153
01:37:20,438 --> 01:37:34,065
But putting that aside, with all due respect to Councilor Knight, if you look at the Mass Department of Education, cable, public access, and the teaching of public access is an allowable educational product here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1154
01:37:35,217 --> 01:37:42,100
It can't be a deed restriction, or even, I don't know what the deed restriction can be, because the library is an educational thing, and the public access is educational.

1155
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,500
It works hand in hand.

1156
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:53,484
And as I indicated earlier, what Councilor Caviello might have met and talked to those folks from the state, they've never had a co-investing partner like the City of Medford would have.

1157
01:37:53,904 --> 01:38:03,628
And if we could upgrade not only the building, the roof, the second floor, whatever needs to be done with the $500,000 that the city has at the present time, and moving that forward, having a full public access,

1158
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:08,064
here, right here in the city of Medford, centrally located, that would help to expedite.

1159
01:38:08,604 --> 01:38:17,326
If the administration was serious about the public library, as was a campaign issue during this past year, we wouldn't have to worry about 140 pages being done.

1160
01:38:17,626 --> 01:38:20,967
You'd go out and hire someone ASAP and make that presentation.

1161
01:38:21,027 --> 01:38:30,909
And if they knew that the city of Medford was willing to invest its money instead of asking for all of the money from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the board of library commissioners, it's the first of its kind.

1162
01:38:31,178 --> 01:38:34,980
And I think they would be more receptive to that than just the plain grant application.

1163
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,941
I don't see any what the problem would be.

1164
01:38:37,241 --> 01:38:40,883
Because if we want to move this thing forward, we have the money.

1165
01:38:40,923 --> 01:38:42,243
It isn't like we don't have the money.

1166
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:49,087
We're not offering the service that's contractually been obligated for through Verizon and Comcast.

1167
01:38:49,287 --> 01:38:52,148
You do not have public access here in the city of Medford.

1168
01:38:52,788 --> 01:38:54,909
And we can go back to resolutions from 2013 bringing forward

1169
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:01,883
where the votes have been seven to nothing on this council floor to go forward and find out what's going on.

1170
01:39:02,243 --> 01:39:06,066
You can't even get the records back from the former Cable 3, the Channel 3.

1171
01:39:06,926 --> 01:39:10,748
We don't even know if they've actually been formally dissolved by the Karma of the Mass.

1172
01:39:10,788 --> 01:39:12,249
They could still be in operation.

1173
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:13,830
Nobody knows nothing.

1174
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:15,271
We haven't received anything back.

1175
01:39:15,851 --> 01:39:22,175
But the onus of responsibility, with all due respect, Mr. President, right now can come from this council, because I think you're all on the same page.

1176
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:23,742
you want to see something done.

1177
01:39:24,302 --> 01:39:34,304
And to find out that they're doing some work now up at that school, and this council not even being notified or entertained about it, that doesn't speak well about transparency.

1178
01:39:34,904 --> 01:39:38,385
They can do all the restructuring up there they want and do it for another purpose.

1179
01:39:39,045 --> 01:39:40,185
This is more important.

1180
01:39:40,525 --> 01:39:48,447
How and where public access is going to go, how the $500,000 is going to go, how it's going to be centrally located, and how it can be immersed into this community

1181
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:58,379
as an educational product, ready, willing, and able to go locally, not segued in a certain part of this community that has too many obstacles to make the thing work.

1182
01:39:58,999 --> 01:39:59,759
Thank you very much.

1183
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:00,459
Thank you.

1184
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:03,261
There are a number of other citizens who wish to speak.

1185
01:40:03,701 --> 01:40:04,461
Ma'am, welcome.

1186
01:40:04,481 --> 01:40:06,322
Please state your name and address for the record.

1187
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:08,663
Yes.

1188
01:40:08,983 --> 01:40:13,705
My name is Gwendolyn Blackburn, 233 Arlington Street, West Medford.

1189
01:40:15,663 --> 01:40:22,427
I didn't come to speak really, I just came to support those who were here for the West Medford issues.

1190
01:40:23,067 --> 01:40:27,490
But I'm really, really concerned about what is

1191
01:40:28,226 --> 01:40:31,448
going to happen with TV3 and where they're going to put it.

1192
01:40:32,148 --> 01:40:39,273
And I would hope, and I hate to hear what you just said, that they are starting to dig up and do whatever.

1193
01:40:40,073 --> 01:40:43,775
And the city council doesn't know that that's going on.

1194
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:47,477
You cannot, there's no way they can put TV3

1195
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:51,719
up there in the back of that high school.

1196
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:57,965
Having been in the high school for 30 years, I know what it's like up there.

1197
01:40:58,466 --> 01:41:05,192
You cannot, and people are not going to be using it for the same reason, well, not for the same reason.

1198
01:41:05,472 --> 01:41:10,837
They didn't use it down here or whatever the problem was down here on

1199
01:41:12,018 --> 01:41:15,679
It wasn't here very long, here on Riverside.

1200
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,960
So that didn't make any difference.

1201
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:28,904
But there's been a problem ever since they moved from Canal Street many years ago, when it really ran quite well and had a lot of programs.

1202
01:41:29,604 --> 01:41:31,765
All I wanted to say was, please,

1203
01:41:33,036 --> 01:41:39,061
see that it doesn't go up to behind the high school, the vocational school area, because it's dark up there.

1204
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:43,745
Got a lot of senior citizens would like to use TV3.

1205
01:41:44,445 --> 01:41:50,610
They had programs at one time so that a lot of the seniors could go for different things.

1206
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:54,974
And I would hope that you wouldn't deny

1207
01:41:55,634 --> 01:42:06,560
the senior citizens, which I'm going to be one, I would hope you wouldn't deny the senior citizens by putting it up there behind high school.

1208
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:07,961
It's a terrible place.

1209
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:09,502
It's dark up there.

1210
01:42:09,522 --> 01:42:12,663
If they have something up there at night, it's dark.

1211
01:42:12,963 --> 01:42:17,146
And during the day, it's just not the place for it.

1212
01:42:17,206 --> 01:42:24,750
So, counselor, I hope you're wrong, but please, you said it's going to be in the paper tomorrow.

1213
01:42:28,666 --> 01:42:31,148
Yes, the transcript just contacted me.

1214
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:35,811
It's gonna be, that must be why we don't know, because the article's not coming out till Thursday.

1215
01:42:35,851 --> 01:42:41,195
It's sad that we have to find out from the paper what's going on in the city.

1216
01:42:41,235 --> 01:42:43,217
I thought that that was to an end.

1217
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:50,282
But yes, it's gonna be online tomorrow and in the paper on Thursday is what I was just told when the construction started last week.

1218
01:42:51,123 --> 01:42:51,743
I was unaware.

1219
01:42:53,024 --> 01:42:57,788
So, excuse me, but is this something that city council can do something about?

1220
01:42:59,537 --> 01:42:59,817
No?

1221
01:43:00,437 --> 01:43:01,958
You're shaking your head no?

1222
01:43:04,879 --> 01:43:04,999
Oh.

1223
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,300
Well, I hope you can.

1224
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,301
That's all I'm saying.

1225
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:18,165
As a citizen whose money is going into TV3 or whatever, I would hope that city council do something to stop it.

1226
01:43:18,745 --> 01:43:19,165
Thank you.

1227
01:43:22,566 --> 01:43:23,087
Good evening.

1228
01:43:23,107 --> 01:43:24,907
Please state your name and address for the record.

1229
01:43:25,327 --> 01:43:26,788
Hi, Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1230
01:43:27,887 --> 01:43:33,270
So much for transparency, right?

1231
01:43:35,131 --> 01:43:40,515
I'm pretty sure that for quite some time now, a plan's been published that they were going to put the public access station up at the high school.

1232
01:43:40,555 --> 01:43:43,537
So I don't think that this should be a surprise that it's going up the high school.

1233
01:43:43,557 --> 01:43:44,397
It's been in the newspaper.

1234
01:43:44,417 --> 01:43:45,578
It's been in the transcript, right, Alex?

1235
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:47,110
It's been in there, right?

1236
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:49,651
You put it in the paper that it was going to go up the high school, right?

1237
01:43:50,192 --> 01:43:51,293
The public access station.

1238
01:43:51,753 --> 01:43:53,735
Now they start construction, now it's a big surprise.

1239
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:57,177
I mean, you know, I'm a little confused about the disconnect there, Mr. President.

1240
01:43:57,237 --> 01:43:59,479
We've all been well aware that that's the location that they've...

1241
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:00,824
said that they were going to put it.

1242
01:44:00,904 --> 01:44:02,386
Whether we like it or not, it's a different story.

1243
01:44:03,066 --> 01:44:04,548
Whether we like it or not, it's a different story.

1244
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:07,091
But, you know, we know that that's what they're going to do it.

1245
01:44:07,331 --> 01:44:10,254
Now we see progress in them breaking ground, and now we're not happy that they're breaking ground.

1246
01:44:10,434 --> 01:44:13,077
I'm a little confused by this whole thing, Mr. President, to be honest with you.

1247
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:14,398
But that's just me.

1248
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:16,080
Thank you, Councilman Knight.

1249
01:44:16,641 --> 01:44:18,663
The citizen has the floor.

1250
01:44:18,783 --> 01:44:20,445
Point of information, Madam Vice President.

1251
01:44:21,085 --> 01:44:29,250
I think the link, like I said before, 10 years going on with trying to dissolve TV3 and then it's going up to high school.

1252
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:31,711
I mean, I didn't really think the council had to act fast.

1253
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:35,913
I think you'd be notified before any ground was being broken.

1254
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:43,877
So a number of rumors that go around with regards to dates and timeframes.

1255
01:44:43,918 --> 01:44:46,779
I've never heard a timeframe with regards to groundbreaking.

1256
01:44:46,879 --> 01:44:48,380
So, I mean, I didn't feel that

1257
01:44:48,931 --> 01:44:50,873
And we haven't had a public hearing on it.

1258
01:44:50,913 --> 01:44:53,875
And just, you know, the people haven't been able to speak out.

1259
01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:58,699
So, yeah, I'm a little surprised myself that ground was broken last week and that I was unaware of it.

1260
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:00,500
Thank you for that point of information.

1261
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,601
Ma'am, please continue.

1262
01:45:01,721 --> 01:45:02,562
Thank you.

1263
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:08,006
To answer Mr. Knight's point through the chair, that was the old administration.

1264
01:45:08,046 --> 01:45:12,870
And yes, you're absolutely correct that under the old administration, he decided that.

1265
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:17,334
But anyway, one of the problems that I see is that the high school

1266
01:45:18,002 --> 01:45:24,226
There's many, many problems with the high school, public safety being one of them, of having strange adults wandering those halls.

1267
01:45:24,827 --> 01:45:32,192
Also, senior citizens, and you're absolutely correct, Gwen, I've talked to 75-year-old ladies that say, if I got off the bus, I would never make it up that hill.

1268
01:45:32,773 --> 01:45:36,795
And then when you make it up that hill, it's very dark, and it's just not a good place.

1269
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:43,740
What is, who benefits from having it up there, unfortunately, and this is not going to be popular, is the school system.

1270
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,521
The school system gets all those fundings.

1271
01:45:45,862 --> 01:45:47,583
They get that whole bucket of money.

1272
01:45:47,973 --> 01:45:49,493
to put into their art system.

1273
01:45:50,254 --> 01:45:55,795
But as far as feeling like it's a community center, it's a ghost town over there.

1274
01:45:56,176 --> 01:46:01,017
And so it's not going to seem like it's a community center.

1275
01:46:01,457 --> 01:46:02,357
But I do agree.

1276
01:46:02,497 --> 01:46:03,918
Somebody pointed it out to me.

1277
01:46:04,438 --> 01:46:07,099
Handicapped accessibility and shame on me.

1278
01:46:07,539 --> 01:46:08,079
Shame on me.

1279
01:46:08,099 --> 01:46:11,800
Because I didn't think about that when I suggested the theater basement.

1280
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,741
I don't know if it would be wheelchair accessible.

1281
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:17,422
So shame on me for not thinking that through before I suggested it.

1282
01:46:17,856 --> 01:46:26,541
But it needs to go down the Method Square for everybody's benefit, for the community to feel like it's their thing.

1283
01:46:27,061 --> 01:46:31,764
Because if they don't have kids in the high school, they're not going to feel, it's just not up there.

1284
01:46:31,824 --> 01:46:33,365
It's just not a good spot for the hype.

1285
01:46:33,825 --> 01:46:36,407
So I would recommend, oh, and one more point.

1286
01:46:37,347 --> 01:46:39,489
We have an arts council in this city, right?

1287
01:46:40,069 --> 01:46:42,650
So they need to be involved in the process.

1288
01:46:42,991 --> 01:46:46,933
And we have the money right now to hire somebody

1289
01:46:47,513 --> 01:46:50,234
for $500,000 to direct this process.

1290
01:46:50,294 --> 01:46:51,875
And it doesn't have to come from the mayor's office.

1291
01:46:52,175 --> 01:46:54,917
So it doesn't show any bias of who they want to pick.

1292
01:46:55,837 --> 01:46:56,798
There's an arts council.

1293
01:46:57,238 --> 01:47:02,480
And that's what they should be doing is focusing on hiring somebody so that they can oversee this process.

1294
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:05,362
And they could go to a Malden or Melrose or someplace else.

1295
01:47:05,402 --> 01:47:06,462
This has been done before.

1296
01:47:06,742 --> 01:47:07,943
We're not reinventing the wheel.

1297
01:47:08,743 --> 01:47:10,764
We already had that committee and that commission.

1298
01:47:11,384 --> 01:47:12,405
And that went nowhere.

1299
01:47:12,665 --> 01:47:13,946
That went into a drawer someplace.

1300
01:47:14,466 --> 01:47:16,547
So we need to hire somebody to get it done.

1301
01:47:17,392 --> 01:47:19,873
And we have plenty of money in that draw now.

1302
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:22,274
And the Arts Council needs to be on top of this.

1303
01:47:22,514 --> 01:47:27,556
Is there or is there not an appointed Arts Council for the City of Medford through the Mayor's office?

1304
01:47:27,736 --> 01:47:28,036
There is.

1305
01:47:28,636 --> 01:47:32,878
So why not invoke them and get them to start this process?

1306
01:47:33,178 --> 01:47:37,700
Because in any city that I see the community access, it's the arts community that does this.

1307
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:38,901
It's their ball.

1308
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:40,402
It's predominantly their ball.

1309
01:47:40,442 --> 01:47:42,023
They invite everybody else to sports.

1310
01:47:43,144 --> 01:47:45,585
In Everett, they have three cameras on every football game.

1311
01:47:45,886 --> 01:47:46,526
Three cameras.

1312
01:47:46,566 --> 01:47:51,089
They are wicked into football over there, and they have three cameras over there for every football game.

1313
01:47:51,529 --> 01:47:52,390
Why don't we have that?

1314
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:54,311
And we're missing out on all kinds of stuff.

1315
01:47:54,692 --> 01:47:58,034
So I just wanted to thank you very much for listening to me rant on.

1316
01:47:58,274 --> 01:47:58,574
Thank you.

1317
01:47:58,695 --> 01:47:59,295
Thank you, Chief.

1318
01:47:59,735 --> 01:48:01,396
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1319
01:48:01,476 --> 01:48:02,257
Thank you, Mr. President.

1320
01:48:02,277 --> 01:48:06,400
I was just going to make one quick point, and that is I believe someone mentioned earlier that the

1321
01:48:07,827 --> 01:48:11,828
The studio is going to be located in the back of the high school, and it's really in the front.

1322
01:48:12,288 --> 01:48:14,468
If you walk in the front door of the high school, it's on your right.

1323
01:48:14,968 --> 01:48:21,589
So it's in the front end of the location of the school, and there's two classrooms, and then it's set aside for those two people.

1324
01:48:21,669 --> 01:48:25,950
But I just wanted to clarify that it is in the front of the school, so you're on the same page.

1325
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:26,830
Thank you.

1326
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:28,410
Thank you very much, Carl.

1327
01:48:28,971 --> 01:48:31,091
Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

1328
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:31,851
Welcome.

1329
01:48:32,011 --> 01:48:33,871
Please state your name and address for the record.

1330
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:34,512
Thank you.

1331
01:48:35,052 --> 01:48:37,252
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1332
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:48,658
Medford Mass, and board member of Boston Free Radio at Somerville Community Access TV, where, as you probably know, I'm one of the first producers in Somerville dating back to 1979.

1333
01:48:49,258 --> 01:48:50,639
So I know a little bit about this.

1334
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:57,845
Now as for the station being at the high school, Mayor McGlynn decided it would be at the high school.

1335
01:48:58,565 --> 01:49:02,408
I see a person that said he didn't know about the high school is leaving.

1336
01:49:02,927 --> 01:49:10,750
It's interesting because at the school committee meeting of March 28th, that's when it was unveiled that the Muccini-Burke administration would have it at the high school.

1337
01:49:11,731 --> 01:49:15,232
So, and I think the council is sitting here who want to be educated on that.

1338
01:49:15,772 --> 01:49:25,056
Now as for the radio station, I talked to Stephanie Muccini-Burke about three years ago when she was director of personnel and budget, and I explained to her how a radio station is pivotal.

1339
01:49:25,596 --> 01:49:29,278
If there's an emergency, imagine Captain Barry Clemente on

1340
01:49:30,561 --> 01:49:37,828
AM1670 from Medfit, which could be a low-power Part 15 FCC station, which you don't need a license for.

1341
01:49:37,928 --> 01:49:39,309
I ran one of these back in 2000.

1342
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:41,331
I was program director.

1343
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:48,078
Stephanie Buccini-Burke said to me, Joe, we could get money from Homeland Security, so along with our access TV money.

1344
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:52,263
Mrs. Burke told me that we can get money from Homeland Security.

1345
01:49:52,343 --> 01:49:52,684
Who knew?

1346
01:49:52,864 --> 01:49:54,846
I didn't know, and I've been in this a long, long time.

1347
01:49:55,347 --> 01:49:56,768
Now, let's add that money.

1348
01:49:57,028 --> 01:50:01,954
Let's have a radio station, because we have one running at Somerville, which is now in its sixth year.

1349
01:50:02,514 --> 01:50:03,816
I've been on the board for a year.

1350
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:06,471
It's an incredible station.

1351
01:50:06,991 --> 01:50:08,331
We now move to the front.

1352
01:50:08,391 --> 01:50:17,735
So when you go to SCAT in Somerville, which Mr. Capucci did, and I'm so pleased he did, you can see Dan Hurley from Medford doing Somerville Pundits right in the window.

1353
01:50:18,275 --> 01:50:22,217
You can see Joe Vig doing Joe Vig Pop Explosion tomorrow from one to three.

1354
01:50:22,597 --> 01:50:29,980
I have two great guests on, musical guests, and you can see people learning on the computers in the third window.

1355
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:33,842
So the new program director, he's interim, Rob Zargas, great guy.

1356
01:50:34,328 --> 01:50:40,952
He put everything in the windows, so when you're in Union Square, you can feel the vibe of the radio station.

1357
01:50:40,972 --> 01:50:42,412
We're not hidden in the back anymore.

1358
01:50:42,792 --> 01:50:43,833
That is so important.

1359
01:50:44,814 --> 01:50:48,035
Councilor Penta, former Councilor Penta, absolutely correct.

1360
01:50:48,495 --> 01:50:52,077
The high school, and Bob said this to me, could be a good satellite.

1361
01:50:52,818 --> 01:50:55,059
The high school could be a good satellite like they have in Arlington.

1362
01:50:55,199 --> 01:51:00,762
Arlington, which airs my program, has two stations, one across the street from the high school, Arlington High,

1363
01:51:02,186 --> 01:51:05,287
And they have one up in an old library up in the Arlington Heights.

1364
01:51:05,947 --> 01:51:08,548
Now, this is very, very important.

1365
01:51:10,108 --> 01:51:11,188
We need it for the elections.

1366
01:51:11,228 --> 01:51:12,748
We needed it for the last election.

1367
01:51:13,529 --> 01:51:15,109
And Councilor Marks is right.

1368
01:51:15,149 --> 01:51:20,890
Mayor McGlynn, as I heard through my grapevine at Public Access TV, McGlynn was talking to someone.

1369
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:22,751
He just said, I hate public access.

1370
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:26,152
And the guy wanted to work for Mike McGlynn to run the station.

1371
01:51:26,792 --> 01:51:31,073
But this is allegedly— Sir, let's not engage in any hearsay or calumny, please.

1372
01:51:32,426 --> 01:51:32,646
Fine.

1373
01:51:32,807 --> 01:51:33,488
Thank you very much.

1374
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:39,076
Radio station, public access TV, the synergy is important.

1375
01:51:39,937 --> 01:51:42,000
Now, Mr. Capucci said that they run

1376
01:51:43,088 --> 01:51:45,848
the TV in Melrose, on the Internet as well.

1377
01:51:46,609 --> 01:51:47,409
Trimal casting.

1378
01:51:47,989 --> 01:51:52,510
We did one of the first trimal casts in 2000 at the old TV3 on Canal Street.

1379
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:55,770
So we ran on my AM1670 in Boston.

1380
01:51:56,470 --> 01:52:01,631
We ran on the Internet, which was a new thing back then, running on the Internet, and we ran a TV3.

1381
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:02,851
We did that.

1382
01:52:03,412 --> 01:52:07,752
That was in the good old days when people actually wanted stuff at TV3.

1383
01:52:08,152 --> 01:52:10,033
Now, there is a board member here from TV3.

1384
01:52:10,153 --> 01:52:11,213
I think the council would be

1385
01:52:11,947 --> 01:52:15,189
prudent to ask him about the financial status.

1386
01:52:15,249 --> 01:52:17,650
A former board member of TV3IC just entered the room.

1387
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:18,970
This is important.

1388
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:26,114
I've been writing to the Attorney General month after month, and I get information, but they're still not giving us the information.

1389
01:52:26,174 --> 01:52:28,935
Solicitor Mark Rumley said that he's waiting for the Attorney General.

1390
01:52:30,556 --> 01:52:35,998
I implore the city solicitor to understand that the Attorney General's office is running at a snail's pace.

1391
01:52:36,038 --> 01:52:36,919
Maybe they're overwhelmed.

1392
01:52:37,319 --> 01:52:39,220
I think it's time our city solicitor went back to

1393
01:52:40,044 --> 01:52:45,826
The powers that be of TV3, the five board members, and said, come on, give this city the information.

1394
01:52:45,846 --> 01:52:49,527
Because there's 38 grand that wasn't accounted for in the Medford transcript.

1395
01:52:49,907 --> 01:52:50,928
We can use that money.

1396
01:52:51,628 --> 01:52:56,069
I propose a TV station, a radio station, and something like Somerville has.

1397
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:58,230
Thank you very much, City Council.

1398
01:53:02,371 --> 01:53:02,851
Good evening.

1399
01:53:02,911 --> 01:53:03,251
Welcome.

1400
01:53:03,271 --> 01:53:04,872
Please state your name and address for the record.

1401
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:06,000
Good evening.

1402
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,321
My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

1403
01:53:07,341 --> 01:53:08,681
I live at 15 Canal Street.

1404
01:53:09,481 --> 01:53:14,543
As everyone may know, I take the archive meetings, these meetings, and then I put them online.

1405
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:22,465
This evening, I decided to start live streaming our city council meetings, and I was told by someone that what I'm doing is actually theft.

1406
01:53:22,925 --> 01:53:32,448
Now, while I could put archive meetings online, because there's no copyright issue, apparently all of the television stations belong to the cable company, and that's part of our contract.

1407
01:53:33,064 --> 01:53:42,350
So what I can do is, I don't imagine I'd have much luck, but I can try to contact Comcast Cable and look at, try to weed through the case law.

1408
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:51,477
But I was wondering if there's any way we could query City Solicitor Mark Rumley to get a determination on if what I'm doing by live streaming these meetings is actually legal or not.

1409
01:53:52,397 --> 01:53:53,798
Perhaps that could be in a resolution.

1410
01:53:53,858 --> 01:53:54,199
Thank you.

1411
01:54:00,823 --> 01:54:02,044
Amended by Councilor Knight.

1412
01:54:02,445 --> 01:54:13,631
that the city solicitor report back to whether live streaming by a third party constitutes a violation of copyright matter against Comcast and the other cable providers.

1413
01:54:15,452 --> 01:54:16,172
Welcome, citizen.

1414
01:54:16,212 --> 01:54:17,893
Please state your name and address for the record.

1415
01:54:19,694 --> 01:54:21,435
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street.

1416
01:54:24,517 --> 01:54:25,517
How can I phrase this?

1417
01:54:29,479 --> 01:54:29,579
In 1970,

1418
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:35,011
The new high school was built in the West Method Woods.

1419
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:53,859
And I recollect Woolworths and Grants behind you, Candlepen Bowling at Hobbit Vanguard, Method Cinema where the Elephant Store is thereabouts, Pewter Park, Brigham's, Joel's Poolroom below ex-Maki's office.

1420
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:58,461
This place was economically viable.

1421
01:54:58,881 --> 01:55:01,122
Lots of businesses, maybe a bit before your time,

1422
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:11,876
However, it seemed shortly thereafter, 1970, the square economically went south.

1423
01:55:13,477 --> 01:55:14,297
Didn't do very well.

1424
01:55:14,317 --> 01:55:15,778
A lot of businesses closed down.

1425
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:27,166
So I would think if it was a mistake, some of us should learn from our mistakes or other communities can learn from our mistake.

1426
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:30,388
As they say in the real estate business,

1427
01:55:31,876 --> 01:55:34,438
The three words location, location, location.

1428
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:55,855
So I would like to see this at a central location, whether it's at city hall here, I don't know about an extra millions of dollars expenditure next door and who's going to pay that nut every month or the gene brought up Chevalier.

1429
01:55:56,656 --> 01:55:59,498
Maybe we could figure out how long the leases in the basement.

1430
01:56:01,372 --> 01:56:13,060
And of course, if it was rent free, we'd be able to use more of our money that's already collected to do a better job and not have to worry about paying the landlord every month.

1431
01:56:17,923 --> 01:56:20,105
It's been a couple of three years.

1432
01:56:22,046 --> 01:56:23,006
Nothing's going down.

1433
01:56:24,407 --> 01:56:28,210
Hopefully this can be done before Christmas and this Christmas.

1434
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:29,711
Thank you for listening.

1435
01:56:36,411 --> 01:56:45,375
April 12, 2016, were passed to Councilor Knight.

1436
01:56:45,755 --> 01:56:47,776
Mr. Councilor, how do you find those records?

1437
01:56:48,196 --> 01:56:50,277
One minor correction, Mr. President.

1438
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:52,618
Councilor Lungo-Kern and I discussed it earlier.

1439
01:56:52,638 --> 01:56:55,499
She brought to my attention that the St.

1440
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,041
Rayfield's 5th and 6th grade boys basketball team

1441
01:56:59,477 --> 01:57:04,060
were not only the Northeast Regional champions, but they were also the New England CYO champions.

1442
01:57:05,281 --> 01:57:06,982
Outstanding.

1443
01:57:07,082 --> 01:57:11,245
So that those records be amended and approved.

1444
01:57:11,445 --> 01:57:12,365
All those in favor?

1445
01:57:12,806 --> 01:57:13,706
All those opposed?

1446
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:17,769
Meeting to adjourn by Madam Vice President Longo Kern.

1447
01:57:18,189 --> 01:57:19,090
All those in favor?

1448
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:20,331
All those opposed?

1449
01:57:20,351 --> 01:57:20,991
Meeting adjourned.
