The purpose of the meeting is to identify the key indicators on the mass desi superintendent evaluation rubric that will be the basis for the superintendent's evaluation at the end of the school year.

6
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:31,004
The school committee and superintendent will also discuss guidelines for the types of artifacts the superintendent will present to the committee at the formative assessment and summative

7
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:36,619
summative evaluation meetings and how those artifacts will be presented to the committee.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:50,385
Also appoint a designated school community member to calculate the ratings and the key indicators of the DESE approved evaluation tool and compile all the school committee feedback and notes to complete the final evaluation for submission to Mass DESE.

27
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:51,495
Present.

28

Mayor Locker.

29
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:53,596
Present.

30
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:56,458
Seven present, zero absent.

31
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,140
So we can go right into it.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,481
I know

33
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:07,700
We wanted to talk about indicators, how to compile the ratings and guidelines.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,361
So I'll open it up to the floor.

35
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:14,547
Mayor?

36
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,009
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

37
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,233
I was going to suggest if we could just open the document.

38
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,956
Thank you, Sharon, for pointing out the appendix C in the 44.

39
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,993
page document to start with.

40
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:32,534
So I don't know if someone wants to share the screen or what other folks think.

41
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:35,515
That sounds great.

42
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:40,137
Do you want me to share the screen?

43
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:42,877
Oh, yeah, I think I have it.

44
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:57,657
If someone else wants to take the liberty, if they have it up right now, they can, because I have about a million tabs open on my page.

45
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,561
Hold on, I think I have it.

46
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,682
So I'm sharing the screen.

47
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:03,302
Yeah, here it is.

48
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:04,223
Can you guys see my screen?

49
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:05,885
Yes.

50
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:06,986
Okay.

51
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:10,369
You could make it larger if you wanted to.

52
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:10,889
Okay.

53
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,913
Let me just try to make it bigger.

54
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:19,073
I'm going to actually just fix it in a second.

55
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,253
Is that bigger for you guys?

56
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:22,213
OK.

57
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,274
Just move the grid over.

58
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:38,278
OK, so this is the Appendix C. Which is.

59
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,759
In the appendices of the whole document, so page 30.

60
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:47,094
If other folks have the document and they want to look on their own, I guess.

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:04,246
So I just want to make sure I understand what we're doing.

62
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:11,931
We are identifying the one or two focus indicators for

63
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:20,060
section as a first step through like our agenda.

64
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,303
Is that what we should be thinking about thinking through right now?

65
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:28,766
I think that's the first part of this.

66
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:41,714
We also need to decide if we're going to use numbers or the Dorothy's suggested unsatisfactory needs improvement for fish and exemplatory

67
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:49,930
and then figure out if we want a committee or one person to do the ratings and take the notes.

68
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,812
So I agree, let's start with the indicators.

69
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,013
If I can jump in.

70
00:04:56,734 --> 00:05:10,620
So the training that we had with Dorothy Presser about the superintendent evaluation, there were a few things that came up that we just needed to, I guess, update our process in terms of to match the,

71
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:14,216
I think this is, does it say 2019?

72
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:25,309
I don't know if it's a change or not since I wasn't doing it before this, but there's some guidelines in terms of the indicators under each standard.

73
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:28,092
So there's what, five standards?

74
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:51,683
And based on that training, what we were told is that, maybe there's just four standards, that overall there should be six to eight, we should choose six to eight indicators to focus the evaluation on, that there has to be one from each standard.

75
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:55,746
So we have to choose at least one focus indicator from each standard.

76
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,108
But beyond that, you know,

77
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:07,123
And it should match, we should choose the ones that seem to most closely align with the superintendent's goals.

78
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:19,206
Yes, I just was going to say the version that I emailed to the committee is November 2022.

79
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,537
So that there was a 2019 and then Desi updated it.

80
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:37,121
And so I'm not sure if that's the same page member member McLaughlin is on right now.

81
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:43,003
But the let me look at my email and get that one.

82
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:49,846
I tried to print the document that you sent superintendent and it's a mess of a document.

83
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:51,527
Like it doesn't

84
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:58,854
I don't know what happened when they convert, when Jesse converted it to a PDF, but like the words roll off the page.

85
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:03,137
Like I, it's, it's sort of a disaster.

86
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:11,203
So I actually was like wanting to read through that, but I, it just is like sort of impossible to use the way that it was.

87
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,746
Definitely.

88
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,788
I don't think there's anything you can do about it.

89
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:20,270
That's on the Jesse website, but.

90
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:24,895
That's why, yeah, so I obviously, the one I have was out of date.

91
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:28,777
I looked it up, I Googled it just because I found the same thing that Jenny said.

92
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:34,119
I couldn't, there were missing pieces, like it just, you couldn't actually really read all of it.

93
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,382
So I was trying to find a cleaner copy, but I guess I got a wrong, a not completely updated one.

94
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:48,745
I'm looking at the document you guys are talking about and I do see, Mayor, may I, sorry.

95
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:49,863
Absolutely.

96
00:07:50,384 --> 00:08:03,534
I do see what member Graham is mentioning on the first couple of pages, but in the, in the rubric for the superintendent evaluate, I think for the section, the appendices, maybe Jenny, am I wrong?

97
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,916
That the rubric looks okay.

98
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:18,545
It does look like in the, in the text field, the staff didn't look okay, but let me just scroll down and say, I mean, I'm just looking at yet another document because

99
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:47,377
uh you know we like to have lots of documents and these things and like this is one I'm on the DESE website and it's just a document about the standards and the standards are exactly the same yeah as the ones in Sharon's document so even though there is a discrepancy in the date like the the standards themselves are exactly the same

100
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,732
They're the same number, they're the same title.

101
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:54,314
It doesn't look like anything has changed.

102
00:08:54,614 --> 00:09:01,839
So I think wherever you look, the choices in each bucket are the same.

103
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,700
So that's, I guess, good.

104
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:17,570
So does somebody have the document accessible where we can zoom in and kind of go category by category, get Dr. Edward Vincent's input and committee's input so that we can pick these indicators?

105
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:19,517
Yeah, I do, Mayor.

106
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:21,358
That's what we have to open it first.

107
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,320
OK, so it's a little hard to see.

108
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,101
Yeah, I'm going to zoom in in a second.

109
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:32,306
I just got to get my head ticked because I closed it and opened it to look at the other document.

110
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:33,847
So give me a minute.

111
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:38,670
So this is Appendix C. And then let me zoom in.

112
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,273
Whoops, that's really large.

113
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,093
Can you guys see that?

114
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:44,114
Yeah, that's great.

115
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:44,975
That's great.

116
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:46,176
OK, good.

117
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:48,137
Because it's really large for me.

118
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:50,809
And may I, Mayor?

119
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:52,590
I had another question.

120
00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:03,296
And in reading this, I also thought, and maybe this is, if others understand differently, please share.

121
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:12,761
I also thought that the superintendent was gonna pick one set of goals under each of the goal piece or not.

122
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:17,784
I mean, are we starting with step two to look at the four standards and then go back to step one?

123
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:45,113
Well, we already did step one when we approved her goals, like at the beginning of the year, but they're not going to be related to the, the, um, the standards if, unless we have them up as well, or the, you know, we want to identify those so that, so in other words, what Dorothy was saying is that the goals that we approved by the superintendent as, um, you know, earlier in the year.

124
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,382
The standards that we're evaluating her on need to be obviously related to those.

125
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:59,827
And I think, you know, I don't know if people want to bring those up or for, especially for people that are going to view this, that they know what those are so that we're referring to them, or I don't know, how do you guys want to do that?

126
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:07,731
I have a printout of what those were that Maurice sent us.

127
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:10,752
So we have a, like three pages, right?

128
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:11,973
The district improvement goal.

129
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:17,199
an early literacy goal for student learning and then professional practice goal.

130
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,600
Right.

131
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:30,425
So I like before the meeting, I went through and looked at what those were and then looked at the indicator possibilities.

132
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:35,207
And I made some notes about what I think sort of aligns the two.

133
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:37,788
They need to be aligned.

134
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:38,148
Right.

135
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:38,988
So I

136
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:47,454
Like for example, like in instructional leadership, the two that stood out to me as like the most aligned.

137
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:53,017
So Melanie, if you scroll down a little bit to that next section.

138
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:53,638
Yep.

139
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,701
This section?

140
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,522
No, a little bit further down.

141
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:00,223
Page four.

142
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,804
Yeah, page four.

143
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:02,904
Okay.

144
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,668
Page five, sorry.

145
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,431
I think just at the bottom of this page, I think, right there.

146
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:26,580
So in that left column there under instructional leadership, the two that stood out to me as like the most aligned to the overall goals were accepted.

147
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,404
If you go down one more page, if you go down one more page, it actually gives the description of each of those rather than just the titles.

148
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,226
So it gives, yeah.

149
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,047
So Mayor.

150
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,888
Sorry, Jenny, I interrupted you.

151
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,761
Thank you.

152
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,123
I just, this is super helpful.

153
00:12:43,604 --> 00:13:00,201
Thank you to member Graham for sort of going through and, you know, doing this in advance, I just want to make sure that, again for folks who are watching or want to later on that they're understanding the process too so I don't know if somebody wants to do just sort of a brief.

154
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:04,293
description or introduction or what?

155
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:19,396
I don't know if the vice chair wants to do that or if somebody does, but it might just be useful for folks that are watching so that they understand what we're doing and what this process is and what the attachment for the standards to the goals are and why.

156
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,716
Does that make sense?

157
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:23,317
Yeah, I'm happy to do it.

158
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:25,877
Member Graham?

159
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:29,018
Okay, so I think for everyone who's watching,

160
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,202
for context, right?

161
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:33,843
The school committee is responsive.

162
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:37,603
One of our chief responsibilities is to hire and evaluate the superintendent.

163
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,664
So that evaluation process is quite prescriptive.

164
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:43,444
Um, that comes from Jesse.

165
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:57,487
So we can, you know, I think on some level we could do anything we wanted, but ultimately it has to fit into a particular structure in order for us to be able to submit our

166
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:02,750
our annual evaluation to DESTI on behalf of the superintendent.

167
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:14,754
And so as we've done all the years that I've been on, the superintendent presented earlier this year, a set of goals that covers three categories.

168
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:21,396
One is a district improvement goal, one is a student learning goal, and one is a professional practice goal.

169
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:27,718
And so earlier this year, like maybe end of September, Dr. Edward Vincent presented to us

170
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:37,712
Um, a document that lists those goals and like what the key actions are related to the goals and what the outcomes would, might look like.

171
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:42,953
Um, if she has achieved those goals and we approved that unanimously.

172
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:46,794
Either at the end of September or at the beginning of October.

173
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:57,016
Um, we subsequently had, uh, a retreat with somebody from the Massachusetts association of school committees to connect that.

174
00:14:57,722 --> 00:15:07,250
to this like very long set of indicators that DESI asks us to weigh in on.

175
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:12,255
So they are in addition to the goals that we have already approved.

176
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:21,903
And the change for us in terms of how we are doing this to align with the newest latest version of what DESI is asking us to do is to

177
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:46,070
Instead of evaluating the superintendent on each and every one of these rubrics, we are being asked to evaluate, to identify a subset of all of these indicators across four categories that are the ones we want to see focus on this year.

178
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:52,694
And the ideal is that they align with what the goals are that we've already approved.

179
00:15:53,598 --> 00:16:05,401
This meeting is really to say we did not do that piece of work when we approved the goals initially, because we hadn't yet like connected those two things the way that Dessie is connecting them right now.

180
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:12,283
Um, and so we need to go through and up this, um, the top of the screen there, you can see those four columns.

181
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:22,166
It's our collective job to reach consensus on which of the one or two indicators in each column.

182
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:27,296
do we believe are the ones that we will focus on and evaluate the superintendent on?

183
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:50,169
All of those things obviously are things the superintendent's generally expected to do in any given year, but from an evaluation perspective, the goal is to make sure that we are evaluating the superintendent in a way that is focused on what the district's goals are, and that's sort of reflected in the superintendent's goals.

184
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:52,490
So the first thing that we need to do

185
00:16:53,451 --> 00:17:08,956
Um, is go through these indicators and determine in each column, there has to be at least one, but the recommendation is that there are no more than two, um, which ones we are going to evaluate based on when we do a review.

186
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:10,276
Later this year.

187
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:20,019
So I think fast forward to next year, we would do all of this at the time that we, um, go ahead and identify what the goals are for the year.

188
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:26,926
So this step, this interim step that we're taking next year will be done sort of all at once.

189
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:41,734
We just hadn't, as a committee, as a collective, gone through this together to sort of link up the changes that DESE has made in the past year or two with what our process has been over these last few years.

190
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:50,438
So the first thing on our agenda is to decide which of these things most closely aligned with what the goals are that

191
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,080
we've already approved.

192
00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:04,368
So we're not opening up the floor to rehash goals, but instead to say which of these things match those goals that we've already asked the superintendent to work on, and it is halfway through the year, so she's already working on those things.

193
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,270
Great, that's perfect.

194
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,890
Thank you, Jenny.

195
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,452
So first up, we have instructional leadership.

196
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:18,057
A is curriculum, B is instruction, C is assessment, D is evaluation, E, data-driven decision-making, and F, student learning.

197
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,139
So if anybody has any

198
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:30,614
thought on which of these indicators you'd like to choose for this coming evaluation, speak now, please.

199
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:38,820
I don't think I'm able to raise my hand because I'm screen sharing, so I just wanted to say that.

200
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,581
I'm happy to wait.

201
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:41,561
Thank you.

202
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:59,013
I was thinking instruction and or data informed decision making based on, you know, the instructional leadership skills that Dr. Edward Vincent has.

203
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:07,298
you know, talked about in terms of the goals as well for the instructional leadership, but that's sort of where I'm weighing in.

204
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:13,842
I also just wanted to say, again, through the chair, I thought that was an excellent explanation for lay people and appreciated.

205
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:27,169
And also that it's really important that this is done and that this is done, you know, in the future at the beginning of the year, so that the superintendent knows exactly, you know, what the evaluation

206
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:29,996
is going to be at the end of the year and what it's going to be on.

207
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:35,980
So it's very clear for everybody as any employee essentially would want to know what they're being evaluated on very clearly.

208
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:52,252
So I think, you know, this is great and this is a huge help and tool, but I would say instruction, and I know they say one or two at most from each and not in a maximum of not more than six, but those are the two I'm leaning towards and would love to hear what my colleagues think.

209
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:54,894
Okay, so B and E.

210
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,844
If I can, I, I have the same.

211
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:02,025
Also, just to be clear, it's six to eight.

212
00:20:02,105 --> 00:20:16,930
So we can, it could be, we have to have one from each, and then we could have two in some, we could have three in some, depending on what seems to be most aligned to Dr. Edward Vincent's goals and to kind of what we think is

213
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:21,763
most important focus I think for the year two together with the superintendent.

214
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:46,991
I had actually the exact same thing, instruction and data informed decision making based on looking at the early literacy student learning goal that did focus both on looking at our literacy instruction but also using the MAP scores really to focus on

215
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,861
that data-informed instruction.

216
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:51,981
Sounds good.

217
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:52,761
I had the same.

218
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,802
Thank you.

219
00:20:55,442 --> 00:21:01,644
I had just chosen one, but I had chosen data-informed decision-making, but the instruction makes perfect sense.

220
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:09,106
So is there a motion on the floor for instructional leadership that we take categories instruction and data-informed decision-making?

221
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,407
Sure, I'll make that motion.

222
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,528
Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by... Second.

223
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:17,869
Member Hayes, all those in favor?

224
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,100
We'll call them.

225
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:30,844
Just writing things down.

226
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,404
One second.

227
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:40,668
Did we want to, I'm sorry.

228
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:46,990
Did, did we want to talk to the, did the superintendent want to weigh in on it too, or is this something I don't really, I'm not really sure.

229
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,071
Is this something that we just.

230
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:56,056
choose or... Yes, we'll take any input from Dr. Edward-Vincent anytime she wants to chime in.

231
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,018
Just wanted to make sure she had a chance.

232
00:21:58,078 --> 00:22:00,659
I'm just seeing three people each on the side.

233
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:13,709
So if I don't see you raising your hands, anybody, please just... I just was going to comment that I felt both of those indicators are aligned with the work that's taking place, the work that we're doing.

234
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,050
So I do

235
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:32,631
I do feel that that's there, and we'll probably be able to provide additional data, some assessment data for our early literacy assessments, but we're doing that.

236
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:38,454
So indicators B and E, I'm in agreement with those two indicators.

237
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:45,078
And there, I just wanted to show the B and E more sort of broken out as

238
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:47,432
Member Hayes was mentioning.

239
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:51,655
Great, thank you.

240
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:53,296
OK, Member Russo, roll call, please.

241
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:54,537
Yes.

242
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:55,337
Member Graham?

243
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:56,018
Yes.

244
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:57,138
Member Hayes?

245
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:57,959
Yes.

246
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,020
Member Kratz?

247
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,800
Yes.

248
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,221
Member McLaughlin?

249
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:02,082
Yes.

250
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:03,263
Member McStone?

251
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,206
Member McStone?

252
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:12,329
I don't know if she's still on.

253
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:12,789
Let me check.

254
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,451
Member Russo, yes.

255
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:16,827
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

256
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:17,807
Yes.

257
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:20,028
Member Mastone?

258
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:21,488
Yes.

259
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:22,809
Oh, thank you.

260
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:24,529
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

261
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,750
Indicators for instructional leadership have been chosen.

262
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,772
Next up is management and operations.

263
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:41,594
We have environment, HR management and development, scheduling and management information systems, law ethics policies, fiscal systems.

264
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:50,714
A and B, yep, A and B seemed to stick out at me.

265
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,754
Member Graham.

266
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,435
I actually only had A selected here.

267
00:23:56,515 --> 00:24:14,678
Like when I read through B, I felt like it was trying to get at something that arguably like we need to get to as a district, but didn't totally line up with the specific details of what we're asking the superintendent to focus on this year.

268
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:29,432
I totally agree on A. And I think that's really important given like the focus, you know, actually the alignment of the goals that we have and some of the immediate focus that we have, particularly at the high school.

269
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:36,973
But B didn't totally line up for me exactly the way A did.

270
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,914
So, but I could be swayed either way.

271
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:46,111
Okay, so two votes for A, one vote for B. Would anybody like to add anything further?

272
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,672
I had A also.

273
00:24:48,692 --> 00:25:06,597
I had A and I also had, because I felt like we do the budget, I had fiscal systems develops a budget that supports the district's vision, but I don't know if that's gonna come in another section or if it's just not really part of the evaluation.

274
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,974
Yeah, I like the way E is described too.

275
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:20,359
So two votes for E, one for B, four for A. The only thing I would say is I don't see that reflected in her goals.

276
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:27,482
I don't know how tightly we have to stick to that understanding of having it, the focus indicators match to her goals.

277
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:34,206
But if we do, which it says aligned to the superintendent goals, I don't

278
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:40,654
I don't know, unless someone has a different way of looking at it that does make that match some of the goals.

279
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:44,198
I don't really see anything necessarily about budget unless we're talking about buying.

280
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:47,562
I mean, we do talk about buying a new literacy program.

281
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:48,864
Mayor.

282
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:50,426
Member McLaughlin.

283
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:58,558
I also am a vote for environment and I was torn between B and E when we were looking at it.

284
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:07,766
I do think it's interesting as we're going through this and good fodder as we're thinking about September, which is unfortunately right around the corner.

285
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:19,775
And, you know, thinking about how the goals can align with some of the things that we're talking about now, particularly around B, in my opinion, but, and certainly obviously, you know,

286
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:38,342
around E too, but I do think if I had to choose between the three, I would say A would be my top choice and B would be my second with a mind towards understanding that if we're getting too heavy in the eight or so that we're requiring, that I would be okay with dropping off B and considering it for September.

287
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:41,083
Mayor?

288
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:42,344
Yes.

289
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:48,966
I think the other thing, I'm a proponent for just the one in this category, mostly because

290
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:57,010
When we get to the next category, which is really, really aligned with what the superintendent's goals are, I thought they all applied.

291
00:26:57,531 --> 00:27:12,544
So if we're trying to stick to six or eight, like going with one here might make some more sense because that would give us a little bit more freedom to be focused on the communications, the family and community engagement component.

292
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:15,587
So that was my other thought is like,

293
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:17,239
I think it's important for us to.

294
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,840
Go sort of slim here and be focused on those other things.

295
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:26,023
Okay So it sounds like there's a motion on the floor for emotional people for eight.

296
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:31,024
Okay There's a motion on the floor for a and if we need an eighth, then be.

297
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:31,605
How does that

298
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:44,139
And I think we can wait for B, frankly.

299
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:48,701
So I would make a motion to take A for management and operations.

300
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:52,702
And then obviously, if we get to the end and we feel that we can go back, we can make another motion.

301
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:57,323
But I would just make a motion for environment under management and operations.

302
00:27:58,664 --> 00:27:58,964
Second.

303
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:05,566
Motion to include A, seconded by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Hayes.

304
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:06,327
Roll call, please.

305
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:09,708
Member Graham.

306
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:10,528
Yes.

307
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:13,115
Member Hayes.

308
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:13,815
Yes.

309
00:28:15,336 --> 00:28:15,896
Member Katz.

310
00:28:16,476 --> 00:28:16,716
Yes.

311
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,337
Member McLaughlin.

312
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:20,177
Yes.

313
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:22,378
Member Mustone.

314
00:28:22,978 --> 00:28:23,198
Yes.

315
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:25,599
Member Rousseau, yes.

316
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,559
Mayor Longo, current.

317
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,980
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, A is included.

318
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,801
Now we're on to family and community engagement.

319
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:36,902
We have engagement, sharing responsibility, communication, and family concerns.

320
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:40,223
I'll open up to the floor or to Dr. Edward-Woodson.

321
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,187
Can I run down?

322
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:49,788
Yes, member cracks.

323
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:50,628
I mean, member Hayes.

324
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:51,389
Sure.

325
00:28:51,549 --> 00:29:04,417
Um, I just based on what member Graham said just a few minutes ago, I felt the same way about this, I think are both long term, we've been talking about family and community engagement and communication.

326
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:10,241
And now with things that have happened in the past couple of months, I think that's come into a sharper focus of an area of

327
00:29:11,454 --> 00:29:11,875
of growth.

328
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:13,736
So I agree with her.

329
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:22,962
I felt, I mean, when I felt like I had to narrow it down and went with B and C, but I could certainly see all four of those even being a focus.

330
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:25,164
Mayor.

331
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:26,805
Member McLaughlin.

332
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:33,249
I think that this is something that, you know, we have been working on and talking about for a long time.

333
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,951
I think that these need to be a primary focus.

334
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:40,474
I know that we have, what is it, two from the first, one from the second, so three.

335
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,819
if we took four, would be at seven at this point.

336
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:54,743
I do feel like D can be a little bit redundant if you read A, B, and C, because I do think that B addresses family concerns.

337
00:29:54,783 --> 00:30:02,105
I think that the only difference that I see in D might be equitable.

338
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,966
I don't know if I see equity in the other

339
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,460
I don't see the word equitable in the other.

340
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,323
Equity is in all of the superintendent's goals.

341
00:30:11,403 --> 00:30:13,045
It's like the primary focus.

342
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:23,754
So I think we can go with A, B, and C. All right, then I make a motion for A, B, and C under standard three, family and community engagement.

343
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:26,076
Motion by member Glaflin, seconded by.

344
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:27,998
Second.

345
00:30:28,718 --> 00:30:30,560
Member Hayes, roll call, please.

346
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,068
Member Graham?

347
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:52,449
Yes.

348
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,690
Member Hayes?

349
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:55,590
Yes.

350
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:57,351
Member Kratz?

351
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:57,992
Yes.

352
00:30:59,172 --> 00:30:59,933
Member McLaughlin?

353
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:00,973
Yes.

354
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:03,394
Member Rousseau, yes.

355
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,275
Mayor Longo, current?

356
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:05,075
Yes.

357
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:06,996
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

358
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:07,956
Motion passes.

359
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:10,838
And Member McStone?

360
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:11,258
Yes.

361
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,099
Seven, zero.

362
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:22,641
Professional culture, commitment to high standards, cultural proficiency, communications, continuous learning, shared vision, management conflict.

363
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,342
And then thank you for scrolling down.

364
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,082
Member McLaughlin.

365
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:27,083
Mayor?

366
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:29,684
Yes, Member Grim.

367
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:41,489
If I had to prioritize like one of these, it would be, especially since we dropped family concerns out of the last category, I think for me, it would be managing conflict.

368
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:59,327
because I think that ties nicely with all the other communication goals and the challenges with climate and culture that we have right now and with the superintendent's overall district improvement goals.

369
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:09,675
So for me, that one jumps out as perhaps the most pressing thing that hasn't already been covered elsewhere.

370
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:11,417
Mayor?

371
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:12,818
Member McLaughlin.

372
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:28,987
I would agree that F is an important standard, and I would also advocate strongly for B. I think cultural proficiency is really important and something that aligns with our vision of equity and something that needs to be explicit.

373
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:31,007
Thank you.

374
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:37,069
I would also just highlight A, commitment to high standards as well.

375
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:41,390
So I think we have A, B, and F that have been being thrown around.

376
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:44,204
membercrats member.

377
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:44,884
Yeah.

378
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,286
So any comments on those?

379
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:53,250
Yes, I definitely think managing conflict, definite on that.

380
00:32:53,610 --> 00:33:07,060
And it's tough with the A and the B, like, I think I would choose A over B. It's tough because then we're going to get into too many indicators.

381
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,601
But they're both important.

382
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,523
It's very, it's very tricky to narrow it down.

383
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:16,189
And I think the recommendation is somewhere around six to eight.

384
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:18,191
So if we have nine, I think it's fine.

385
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:26,361
And what does the superintendent think so far of, um, of what we've, um, so far approved?

386
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:45,371
I feel, you know, I feel significantly relieved knowing that we're identifying the specific indicators, which are fairly closely aligned to the goals, so that I think this is going to make it more manageable.

387
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:51,133
And I think you said right now we're up to nine I feel like

388
00:33:52,383 --> 00:34:02,892
that's probably a good amount and that I will continue to gather and compile evidence in those areas, you know, to the best of my ability.

389
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:14,481
But I think, you know, when you're looking at every single indicator, it's just too much, it's too much content to be able to cover everything and try to cover it well.

390
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,083
Absolutely.

391
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:17,624
Thank you.

392
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:18,825
I agree.

393
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,506
It was hard to even, you know,

394
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,031
Mark all of these, there was so many.

395
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:28,613
I think we have the most votes for A and F. Is there a motion or any other?

396
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:35,997
I would make a motion for A, B, and F. A motion for A, B, and F. Is there a second?

397
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:37,477
Second.

398
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,119
And Democrats, roll call.

399
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:50,844
Member Rossell, you want me to call the roll?

400
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:53,827
I'm sorry, I was just typing it all out.

401
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:55,167
Member Graham?

402
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:56,087
Yes.

403
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:56,428
Okay.

404
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:57,888
Member Hayes?

405
00:34:58,528 --> 00:34:58,788
Yes.

406
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:00,249
Member Kratz?

407
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:01,109
Yes.

408
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:02,690
Member McLaughlin?

409
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,530
Yes.

410
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,290
Member Mestone?

411
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:05,831
Yes.

412
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:07,451
Member Rossell?

413
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:07,711
Yes.

414
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,532
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

415
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:09,352
Yes.

416
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:10,832
I'm in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

417
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,413
It looks like we have our indicators.

418
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:13,613
Thank you, everybody.

419
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:15,654
That was great teamwork.

420
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:22,179
We have artifacts, superintendent will present to the committee at the formative assessment.

421
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,526
And then we also have, you know, who's gonna, are we gonna create a committee to gather the ratings and the notes?

422
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,028
Or are we gonna have one person do it?

423
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:34,291
So with those two topics left.

424
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:37,253
Mayor, can I stop sharing the screen or do you want me to keep it?

425
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:39,035
I think it's good, thank you.

426
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:51,258
And then I would like, I would, I would think, you know, not that we need more committees, but I think it would be helpful to have a committee doing this just to help ease the process, but that's my opinion.

427
00:35:51,278 --> 00:36:01,022
Okay, so there's one vote for a committee of I'm assuming three people to help calculate the ratings and notes by member McLaughlin.

428
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:04,703
Anybody else have a comment on that?

429
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:08,284
If you think it should be one single person or committee member Hayes.

430
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:16,970
I agree with the committee idea, at least, I mean, maybe at least for this first year as we're since we're looking at some changes, possibly to how we do it.

431
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:29,921
Just to take it off of having one person feeling responsible for it really is a pretty big task that idea of kind of combining everyone's ideas into one.

432
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:31,382
I think it really is a big thing.

433
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:40,752
big thing to do and it's one of our most important roles as a school committee so I would I would agree with the idea of doing it in a smaller subcommittee.

434
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:43,293
Mayor?

435
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:44,873
Member Graham?

436
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:56,358
I think I think the committee could work provided that like at least in terms of like the ranking evaluation that somebody

437
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:02,173
takes on like the compilation of that component of it.

438
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:17,835
And that the focus of the committee is like weeding through everybody's comments and writing like a cohesive comment about like that compiles everybody's comments.

439
00:37:18,515 --> 00:37:23,336
Because I think that's one thing we haven't totally done in the past.

440
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:27,417
Like I think we've tried to present everybody's

441
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:40,432
points of view, and I think that's important, but I think what we heard in our session is like, the goal is really to have a cohesive story that comes out of this evaluation that the superintendent can act on.

442
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:50,077
So I guess, like, I, I can see how we, like, I could see a format in my head about the, the like ranking part, right?

443
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:57,061
So whether it's neat or proficient or exemplary, whatever, whatever those categories are to show like a distribution

444
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:03,491
of, um, how the individual committee numbers sort of landed on each of those indicators.

445
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:25,537
And, but then once you see that distribution, like there could be, you know, one person who thinks one, two people who think two and four people who think three, like, I think it would be ideal if then the committee, the subcommittee could look at that and say, the recommendation is three, for example.

446
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:43,600
And the recommendation is like of all of these comments, which are public record anyway, like this is what we recommend the comment to be so that the output of the committee is like a recommendation about how to take the distribution of everybody's scores to like one, one measure.

447
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:54,183
And then a cohesive narrative, um, that becomes the review that then comes to committee of the whole, we all get a chance to like review it.

448
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,080
And then we can vote to pass it.

449
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:04,005
So I'm wondering like, if that makes sense, I just think somebody is going to have to sit down and like do the number of mechanics.

450
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:05,206
I'm happy to be that person.

451
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:09,689
Like here's what the distribution is so that then the committee has something to act on.

452
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:24,320
Cause I think if three people get in a room and try to create that together, it's, it's going to be really tedious for everybody, or I'd rather the focus of the work beyond like making the review sound cohesive in the end.

453
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:26,595
Mayor.

454
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,598
Member McLaughlin and Member Hayes.

455
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,779
I think Member Hayes had her hand up first.

456
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,681
Member Hayes and Member McLaughlin.

457
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:35,422
Thank you.

458
00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:37,183
I just wanted to clarify.

459
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:46,190
So one of the things we did find in that retreat training was that the numbers are not necessarily what we're supposed to be using.

460
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,433
And I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, Member Graham, when you were saying that.

461
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,894
But in terms of

462
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:56,484
finding that proficient or needs improvement.

463
00:39:56,564 --> 00:40:04,868
Again, I forget exemplary, but that based on the training, it was using those words that each member should be reading.

464
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:09,029
So just want to, again, clarify for people that we have been doing the numbers, I think for years.

465
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:20,714
I know we just did them that way last year, but that moving forward, we were going to use the category names or instead of using the actual one, two, three, four numbers and averaging them.

466
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:22,915
I just didn't remember what the names were.

467
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:26,316
I have the notes from the session.

468
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:34,398
So is there a motion on the floor to use the wording, unsatisfactory, needs improvement, proficient and exemplary versus numbers?

469
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:36,919
Yes.

470
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:38,699
Motion to use those words, yes.

471
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:39,160
Second.

472
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,740
Motion by Member Kratz, seconded by Member Laughlin.

473
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,561
Roll call, please.

474
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:49,963
Member Russo.

475
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:58,449
I'm just trying to figure out what the motion is motion to use words for numbers.

476
00:40:58,469 --> 00:40:58,529
Yep.

477
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:00,490
We never use numbers but I'm happy to do that.

478
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:17,579
So, the words are exemplary for standard, sorry Democrats, we don't get to decide the words directly in the required just to clarify what they were I thought you wanted to know what they were as part of the motion.

479
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:20,045
I don't know, I know it's the wrong time.

480
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:20,766
I'm sorry, thank you.

481
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,527
I just was clarifying what the motion was, sorry.

482
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,409
I was gonna read it out in full if you want me to.

483
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:27,469
No.

484
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:29,690
Oh, okay.

485
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:32,451
Mayor.

486
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:40,654
Yeah, I'm just waiting for a roll call, and then we'll move on to, I think it sounds like we need to have another motion after this to form a committee.

487
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,395
So members of the college.

488
00:41:43,995 --> 00:41:45,056
Sure, member Graham?

489
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:46,356
Yes.

490
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:47,557
Member Haynes?

491
00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:49,015
Yes.

492
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:49,856
Yes.

493
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:49,956
Yes.

494
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:50,216
Yes.

495
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:50,997
Yes.

496
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:52,158
Yes.

497
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:52,258
Yes.

498
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:52,418
Yes.

499
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:52,659
Yes.

500
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:53,259
Yes.

501
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:09,649
Oh, I did, but I wasn't called in that role a moment ago.

502
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:10,911
So I was just saying, yes.

503
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:12,632
Yes, I'm sorry.

504
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:13,553
I didn't mean to skip you.

505
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:14,334
That's okay.

506
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:14,955
No worries.

507
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:21,782
I did want to say before the motion for the subcommittee, I actually also wanted to

508
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:43,902
could ask my colleagues about the consideration for being able to, I know that the subcommittee will make recommendations to the committee as a whole and then we'll take the vote, but also that there is, while we can do wordsmithing on the narrative piece for individuals to make a cohesive statement around that particular

509
00:42:47,382 --> 00:43:09,398
item that we're evaluating on, I would like to have folks consider and leave it up to the committee for discussion right now as to whether, I know that the statements are public anyway, but whether we want to have the statements available if we feel like we need to look at them just to get a further understanding of the wordsmithing of the subcommittee.

510
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:14,102
I don't know that folks want to, but they may want to, so just want to

511
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:16,644
remind people that that might be a factor.

512
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:26,550
So meaning that after the committee does its work it would hand over not just the recommendation but the raw like original documents from each member as well?

513
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:27,531
Raw data.

514
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:29,032
I think it's important for the raw data.

515
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:29,753
Yes, thank you.

516
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:39,019
So I would make a motion that the material includes raw data so that the evaluation includes the recommendation and the raw data at which the recommendation was arrived at.

517
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,341
Can you repeat that please?

518
00:43:42,216 --> 00:43:54,661
and make a motion that the evaluation include the raw data from all members in addition to the summary evaluation of the subcommittee and recommendations of the subcommittee.

519
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:57,742
Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

520
00:43:57,822 --> 00:44:03,244
Roll call vote on evaluation including recommendations and raw data.

521
00:44:03,425 --> 00:44:03,965
Member Graham.

522
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:04,865
Yes.

523
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:06,246
Member Hayes.

524
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:07,006
Yes.

525
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:08,407
Member Krantz.

526
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:09,227
Yes.

527
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:10,687
Member McLaughlin.

528
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:11,768
Yes.

529
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:13,277
Member Musto.

530
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,057
Yes.

531
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:16,358
Member Russo, yes.

532
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:17,458
Mayor Longo, correct.

533
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,018
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

534
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:25,019
I believe there's a motion on the floor to form a three member subcommittee.

535
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:26,600
Mayor?

536
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,420
Yes, Member Russo.

537
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:36,321
If I could make that motion so that I could follow rule 31 in our rules that we adopted last year.

538
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:39,102
Rule 31 says the special subcommittees

539
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:41,452
I'll summarize it.

540
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:47,455
It's always too verbose, but that we can establish special subcommittees by our vote.

541
00:44:48,516 --> 00:45:01,022
We have to include what those, that vote has to include what the membership is, the duties, as well as the duration that we think that this subcommittee will be formed for.

542
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:08,305
So we can't create a special subcommittee that is just until you get it done, like we have for regular committees.

543
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:08,866
So we would just,

544
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:11,037
just from what I've heard.

545
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:17,583
I mean, do we think- So is anybody interested in being on this subcommittee?

546
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:21,846
Member McLaughlin, Member Hayes.

547
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,628
I'm happy to do it.

548
00:45:23,648 --> 00:45:26,811
McLaughlin, Hayes, and Graham.

549
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:31,995
If there's no objections and no further ayes, we have a committee member.

550
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:34,778
So there'll be a three person committee, I think,

551
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:46,278
In my opinion, a committee should just be established until the school committee, whoever they may be at the time, decides to do it in a different format.

552
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:48,740
Mayor?

553
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,160
Member Russo?

554
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:57,124
So you don't want to establish a special subcommittee then, you just want to establish another regular standing subcommittee.

555
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:01,727
Those are the two choices we have.

556
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,808
It's up to the committee.

557
00:46:06,236 --> 00:46:07,277
I don't care either way, actually.

558
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:08,958
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

559
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:09,839
Yeah.

560
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,720
And then you can always make it permanent if it works out.

561
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,322
Yeah.

562
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:15,902
I agree.

563
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:18,524
I just think that it's a complicated process.

564
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:26,149
And having this special, or the subcommittee, I think would be necessary each year, unless it's determined it's not.

565
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:29,691
I would second.

566
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:35,495
You're seconding, member McLaughlin, you're seconding the creation of a subcommittee.

567
00:46:36,573 --> 00:46:42,058
Yes, if that's what Member Rousseau is making the motion for, I should have clarified.

568
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:57,972
Yes, Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin to form a new subcommittee made up of three members to compile the ratings and notes for the superintendent's evaluation.

569
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:00,874
Roll call, please.

570
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:02,536
I need one minute.

571
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:03,777
No problem.

572
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:28,410
Mayor, do you mind if we split the, who the members are into a separate subcommittee, into a separate motion?

573
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,150
Sure.

574
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:50,974
Okay, so then I have the motion is to create a new standing subcommittee with three members for compilation of notes and evaluations of individual members, a compilation of the notes and evaluations of individual members and provide a recommendation to the full committee at evaluation time.

575
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:51,834
Did I miss anything?

576
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:56,551
We already did the one that includes raw data, right?

577
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:57,972
So you don't have to include it.

578
00:47:58,072 --> 00:47:58,412
Okay.

579
00:47:59,152 --> 00:47:59,672
Yes, we did.

580
00:48:00,112 --> 00:48:01,452
Okay, great.

581
00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:03,113
Oops.

582
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:05,473
So let me do that as member Graham.

583
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:06,553
Yes.

584
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:10,754
Member Hayes.

585
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:11,494
Yes.

586
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:13,835
Member Kratz.

587
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:14,515
Yes.

588
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:16,355
Member McLaughlin.

589
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:17,156
Yes.

590
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:18,916
Member McStone.

591
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:19,936
Yes.

592
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:24,257
Mayor Risseau, Mayor Lungo-Kern.

593
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:26,339
You want it, Paul?

594
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:31,202
Yes, seven affirmative, zero negative.

595
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:32,723
No.

596
00:48:32,983 --> 00:48:45,432
Okay, and so the second motion that I'll take a roll for is, let me just update the time, is that members- Graham.

597
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,314
Graham, Hayes, and McLaughlin.

598
00:48:48,174 --> 00:48:48,594
Second.

599
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,378
Graham, Hayes, and McLaughlin.

600
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:59,055
will be assigned to the, oh, we didn't name it.

601
00:49:00,296 --> 00:49:02,538
Should we just name it the Evaluation Subcommittee?

602
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,002
The Evaluation Subcommittee.

603
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:16,530
We should pick a chair probably, or maybe they can do that themselves and let us know.

604
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,159
I mean, it's not how we normally do.

605
00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:20,740
Usually we are.

606
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,801
I nominate Sharon Hayes as the chair.

607
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:24,062
Yeah, I was gonna say that.

608
00:49:24,103 --> 00:49:25,444
She's the one that called this meeting.

609
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:26,084
Okay.

610
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:30,448
We are just doing so good.

611
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:31,449
Can I get a second?

612
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,931
Second.

613
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,272
Second.

614
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:41,317
Member Hayes, if y'all are happy with Member Hayes being chair, thank you for stepping up, Member Hayes.

615
00:49:41,917 --> 00:49:42,718
We appreciate you.

616
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,320
Thank you, Sharon.

617
00:49:47,597 --> 00:49:49,699
So member, I'm sorry, are we ready?

618
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:50,139
I'm sorry.

619
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,121
Yeah, roll call.

620
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:53,122
Thank you.

621
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:54,062
Member Graham.

622
00:49:54,663 --> 00:49:54,883
Yes.

623
00:49:56,144 --> 00:49:56,544
Member Hayes.

624
00:49:57,265 --> 00:49:57,525
Yes.

625
00:49:58,446 --> 00:49:58,906
Member Katz.

626
00:49:59,507 --> 00:49:59,767
Yes.

627
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:01,388
Member McLaughlin.

628
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:02,469
Yes.

629
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,431
Member Mustone.

630
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:05,051
Yes.

631
00:50:06,613 --> 00:50:07,634
Member Russo.

632
00:50:09,415 --> 00:50:09,635
Yes.

633
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:11,297
Sorry, I'm waiting for an answer.

634
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:13,138
Mayor Longo Kern.

635
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:15,820
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

636
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,561
We have a committee.

637
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:20,884
Mayor.

638
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:22,766
Member McLaughlin.

639
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:27,749
I just have to say that felt like the most efficient meeting we've been to.

640
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,290
Thank you, Sharon, for calling that.

641
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,071
We've been good at this.

642
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:32,392
It only took a year, Member McLaughlin.

643
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,214
It only took a year, is that what you said?

644
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:35,875
Three, three of them.

645
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:37,836
Three years, right.

646
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:47,223
I would just ask that if I could, through the chair, if the superintendent is amenable with all of the decisions that were made tonight, if that's feeling okay.

647
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:54,033
