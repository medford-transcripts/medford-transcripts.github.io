Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings. I am John Petrella. This is a show for and about the city of Medford. The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices. First of all, I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving. I hope everyone enjoyed.

00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:17,757
Thanksgiving's over, and we're going to be moving on to Christmas. Tonight's program, we want to start with Mustang football. So we have to talk about the Method Mustangs high school football team. We want to congratulate coach John Curley, his assistants, and every player on this team.

00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:40,555
The Method Mustangs are the Greater Boston League champions for the first time since 1985. And how about quarterback Justin Marino, named GBL Most Valuable Player, named the GBL Player of the Week five times by the Boston Herald.

00:01:41,365 --> 00:02:08,399
the all-time leading rusher with 1,638 yards, the all-time most points in a season with 185, and most touchdowns in a single game with six, if you can believe that. He is also the recipient of the New England Football Officials President Award.

00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:27,350
What an incredible season for the Medford Mustangs and for Justin. And a special thank you for the butt-kicking you guys gave to Malden on Thanksgiving Day. A 34-14 win for Medford.

00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:46,570
It's always great to end the season with a victory on Thanksgiving Day. So a big thank you to the Meffitt football team. Great season, guys. And while we're on the topic of Meffitt sports, I'm going to mention a few things.
