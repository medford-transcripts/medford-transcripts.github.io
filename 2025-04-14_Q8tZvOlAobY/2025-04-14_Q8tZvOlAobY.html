    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=243.76s">Hi,</a>  everyone, we're back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=247.241s">Okay,</a>  before we had to step away and come back, we were talking about the before school program increase, and there was a question by Member Intoppa about the rates looking like they were reversed for the three-day option. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=266.086s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=267.186s">Is</a>  that what you were looking at? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=270.987s">I</a>  believe it's being</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=278.32s">In</a>  before care program school year 2025 2026 the 3% increase for monthly three days should read 122.57 not 112.57. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=286.968s">I'm</a>  just noting that I understand that but I'm just noting that so if this infograph is sent out, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=295.572s">that</a>  we correct that similar to the one that was mentioned for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=298.574s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=299.034s">And</a>  the presentation has been updated with the corrected rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=304.597s">So</a>  if you all can take a look at the screens rather than your handout, that's probably the most accurate picture at this moment.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=317.227s">Could</a>  I ask Will to just enlarge Dr. Cushing's screen in his absence, just to make it a little bit larger for the community in case people are watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=329.213s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=331.414s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=331.815s">Chair?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=341.52s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=344.992s">I</a>  think there's still some problems with these numbers, but I think the motion that I would make is that we would accept the rate card with a 3% increase over whatever it is right now.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=356.655s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=357.175s">There's</a>  a motion to accept a 3% increase for the before care program over current rates <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=365.102s">And</a>  obviously that these charts will be updated accurately before they're posted on the website by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=372.924s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=379.246s">What's</a>  the history of increases here?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=385.08s">Sure,</a>  I'm going to ask, so Director Megan Fidlecari is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=390.804s">So</a>  she's unmuted just to give us a little bit more of a history here.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=395.687s">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=398.869s">We</a>  have in the last two to three years, certainly two years, we've only increased very modestly to account for increases to staff pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=412.459s">But</a>  before that, we went several years without increasing before school pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=416.461s">So</a>  it's only to keep up with the increase in staff pay for before school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=421.804s">Megan,</a>  could you also speak to afterschool care as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=424.446s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=424.826s">Yeah,</a>  afterschool is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=430.609s">Three</a>  years ago, or maybe it was four years ago, right after COVID, we did a considerable jump to right-size our tuition rates to meet tuition and staff rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=442.76s">to</a>  better reflect what our neighbors were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=446.501s">But</a>  since then, it's only been a very modest increase, and it is only to keep up with increasing wages.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=451.543s">Am</a>  I right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=459.325s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=460.205s">And</a>  then I was also wondering how this matches up with some of the right sizing we've been doing on our budget over the last couple of years with our revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=468.588s">I</a>  don't know if that's a question for <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=471.035s">budget</a>  analyst Gerry McCue, but that is my question around this.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=478.467s">I</a>  think what we're, I would probably defer to him for a more detailed, you know, accurate answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=484.852s">But</a>  I think for the purposes here, for us, what we're looking at is, yes, a modest increase to some of the wages, but it's also to increase some of that staffing capability and also for the increases that we've seen in some of the supplies and the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=505.438s">I</a>  mean, I can get you some like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=508.94s">Sorry,</a>  I should have asked for this when I got my packet on Friday, and I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=512.703s">No,</a>  no, no, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=513.624s">But</a>  I can get that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=515.845s">I</a>  can get that to you more specifically in terms of what you're talking about with.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=521.249s">Yeah,</a>  because I'm curious what I know that was one of the accounts that has had a lot of movement over the years.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=529.803s">And</a>  member Reinfeld, I do know that last year, I believe last year was the first year that we started doing chargeback to certain revolving accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=539.426s">And</a>  this was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=540.807s">This</a>  was one of the accounts that already has sort of ingested a chargeback model. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=547.729s">So</a>  yeah, and for that point, Kids Corner is as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=550.87s">Terrific,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=553.391s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=555.032s">Oh,</a>  I made the motion for the 3% for the before program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=559.79s">I'd</a>  also make a motion for 3% for the afterschool program, if there are even separate programs, but.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=567.675s">Member</a>  Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=570.017s">Okay,</a>  so we have a motion on the floor to increase before and afterschool program tuition by 3% for the 25-26 school year by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=582.865s">Are</a>  there any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=587.833s">I'm</a>  not seeing any. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=589.994s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=590.435s">Can</a>  you call the roll, please?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=592.356s">I'll</a>  call it twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=595.178s">Member</a>  Grant, this is for before school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=596.939s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=597.659s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=598.22s">Member</a>  Intoppa? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=598.78s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=599.621s">Member</a>  Olapade? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=600.341s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=600.861s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=601.542s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=602.382s">Member</a>  Rossell? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=602.923s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=603.203s">Mayor</a>  Longo?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=604.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=606.365s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=608.266s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=609.307s">Before</a>  school increase is 3%.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=612.847s">And</a>  for the after school member Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=615.75s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=616.49s">Member</a>  Intoppa?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=617.351s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=617.811s">Member</a>  Olapade?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=618.612s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=619.212s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=620.333s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=620.774s">Member</a>  Rossell? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=621.314s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=621.614s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=624.737s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=626.358s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=628.88s">The</a>  after school program rate increase is 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=631.322s">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=632.243s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=632.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=633.083s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=633.464s">Fidler-Carry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=634.765s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=637.78s">Okay,</a>  we are done with the rate card. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=640.481s">Item</a>  number four, recommendation to approve budget transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=644.722s">Mr.</a>  Noel Velez, director of finance.</p>

    <p>[Noel Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=661.168s">Am</a>  I on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=662.468s">All</a>  right, sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=663.929s">I'm</a>  just as excited as you are, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=665.389s">I</a>  love budget transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=668.496s">So</a>  what you have in front of you is a proposal from the business office as a whole and the superintendent regarding $138,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=679.945s">$431.25</a>  for budget transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=683.468s">What</a>  I did with this budget transfer, I wanted to keep it quarterly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=686.87s">I</a>  like to keep things fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=690.253s">And</a>  my goal was to keep everything within their allotted, I think we call them either codes or program codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=700.279s">I</a>  wanted to keep everything, I wanted to keep everybody within their program codes regarding how they can properly spend their funding, but in some areas they may have overspent in one line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=708.385s">but</a>  they had extra money in other lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=709.945s">So</a>  we kind of use those funds to cover it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=712.526s">And</a>  then in one of the pages, you'll see, I gave a, just a small brief description of what each budget transfer refers to and what, and what these principles and what these directors have done with their finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=723.788s">And</a>  this also gives them a better opportunity as we're, as we're coming towards the end of the fiscal year to see how much they have in each line and really spend accordingly and be fiscally responsible.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=739.989s">Questions.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=740.53s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=741.771s">I</a>  don't have any questions because they're all answered and I appreciate that, but I'll make a motion to approve the budget transfers.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=748.217s">There's</a>  a motion to approve budget transfers by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=754.283s">Are</a>  there questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=758.868s">Seeing</a>  no questions, can you call the roll please?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=998.987s">So</a>  this is a very fancy way of saying our elementary schools are overcrowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1002.549s">We</a>  need to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1003.769s">What</a>  this began as a resolution to undertake those solutions, but very quickly evolved into a report to assemble the data so we can really understand the nature of <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1016.515s">the</a>  problems and the challenges we're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1018.476s">I</a>  apologize, this probably should have been submitted as a report request by the time I was done writing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1026.061s">But</a>  the community, the principals, everyone has come to us, we know this is a challenge, and everyone has an idea of how it ought to be fixed, whether that's through redistricting, restructuring, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1039.54s">changing</a>  how we select students per elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1043.622s">And</a>  so I would like for the district to begin that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1049.065s">I</a>  know we've just had a lot of schedule changes that we've had to implement very quickly, but this is a pressing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1054.988s">And</a>  there are two stages to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1056.548s">One</a>  is to figure out the long-term solutions based on the data that we have, but we also have a very urgent <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1063.732s">issue</a>  of potential kindergarten admissions exacerbating this problem for the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1070.333s">So</a>  I'm looking for some short-term solutions as well as some long-term solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1075.274s">And</a>  I think the district has a lot of this data and can present the challenge and potential solutions before choosing one to really investigate further. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1086.497s">So</a>  that's the goal of this is to begin the process of solving our overcrowding issues.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1093.703s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1094.123s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1094.624s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1095.184s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1095.624s">Brinefeld</a>  member. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1096.105s">So</a>  did you have your I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1098.026s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1098.306s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1099.427s">I</a>  do have a question about the May 19th date. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1101.968s">I'm</a>  wondering if you've talked to the administration yet on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1104.97s">That</a>  was something they said they could do.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1106.611s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1107.212s">Okay,</a>  then I'll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1109.774s">And</a>  I don't want to approve.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1111.635s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1112.795s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1113.016s">I'm</a>  so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1113.656s">I</a>  have like a <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1124.348s">This</a>  is a needed piece of information to look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1127.991s">It</a>  was an ongoing thread in conversation at a lot of my meet and greets at the elementary level as well as at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1137.79s">And</a>  so we have in earnest started a lot of some of this background information that you have outlined here, but it definitely needs to be a greater conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1148.4s">So</a>  I welcome the opportunity to gather this data with my team and come to you by May 19 with a further conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1158.189s">I'm</a>  also very interested <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1160.372s">in</a>  continuing this conversation with varied stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1163.118s">So</a>  I'm really glad to see that one of the pieces here is ongoing conversation with community members.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1172.858s">Member</a>  Reinfeld, if I could potentially offer a friendly amendment to this motion, I think it is certainly well time to do this, and we've sort of been dancing around it for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1187.171s">I</a>  do wonder if bringing this data back to this committee will, like in this sort of broader sense, will <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1197.199s">necessitate</a>  us having to send it somewhere else anyway, because there's a lot of work to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1201.74s">And</a>  our subcommittees are intended to be working committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1205.301s">So</a>  I did have a suggestion, if you are interested, that this be referred to the strategic planning subcommittee, where some of these community-based conversations can be had in advance of all this information coming back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1221.685s">Because</a>  we typically have a really <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1223.825s">ambitious</a>  agenda and don't have time to dig in in those kinds of ways on the floor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1228.891s">So</a>  that was just my suggestion.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1230.253s">I'm</a>  certainly open to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1231.634s">I</a>  am also on that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1233.977s">So</a>  I'll be getting that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1235.839s">So</a>  I might <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1237.295s">confirm</a>  with colleagues who are not, I think any, all right, I'm seeing some unofficial signals that that feels okay, so yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1248.882s">And</a>  my question to the superintendent is, would we need, because that's strategic planning for the longterm, would there need to be, looking at the elementary school for next year, would that need to come to this group sooner, or would that need to go to family engagement?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1270.1s">I</a>  would say just because of the timing of the year, it may need to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1273.863s">And</a>  then I think we could make a decision if we feel that further conversation is needed at that subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1285.734s">Is</a>  it possible to have that conversation about elementary without having had the bigger conversation in the subcommittee meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1293.18s">I'm</a>  thinking about timing here and the May 19th meeting.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1299.247s">So</a>  I think the question is like, can you bring the short-term solution here without that larger conversation around the long-term? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1309.115s">Is</a>  that the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1309.775s">That</a>  is the question.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1313.658s">I</a>  mean, I think clearly the piece here in terms of your talking about overcrowding for the next school year is for the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1328.22s">we</a>  have seen since COVID a need for a fifth kindergarten every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1334.403s">And</a>  so the pressure is most acutely seen there in terms of what the needs are going to be for school year 25, 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1349.87s">I</a>  guess that would depend maybe on the scheduling of when we're doing this because <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1355.338s">we</a>  really, in essence, really have about a month left, month and a half to make a lot of these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1361.803s">And</a>  I believe we have two school committees left. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1366.147s">So</a>  I think it would maybe depend on the timing.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1370.11s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1370.531s">Then</a>  I will accept the amendment to bring it to strategic planning, but I would defer to the superintendent and the team if this piece of it needs to come on the agenda sooner.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1384.634s">Yeah,</a>  I would agree with that because then we can schedule that.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1388.195s">Yeah,</a>  accordingly, when the data is ready, we can schedule strategic planning and see how the kindergarten situation fits into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1395.218s">Well,</a>  we've been closely monitoring everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1397.019s">I'm</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1397.699s">Okay,</a>  so there is a motion on the floor as amended that this data will go to the strategic planning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1410.265s">Motion</a>  by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1411.685s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1412.005s">Is</a>  there a second by Member Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1414.095s">roll</a>  call please.</p>
