1
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone, we're back.

2
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:26,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, before we had to step away and come back, we were talking about the before school program increase, and there was a question by Member Ntapa about the rates looking like they were reversed for the three-day option.

3
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:26,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

4
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you were looking at?

5
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:31,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's being

6
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,528
[SPEAKER_03]: In before care program school year 2025 2026 the 3% increase for monthly three days should read 122.57 not 112.57.

7
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just noting that I understand that but I'm just noting that so if this infograph is sent out,

8
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: that we correct that similar to the one that was mentioned for me.

9
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:58,854
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

10
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:04,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And the presentation has been updated with the corrected rates.

11
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:13,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you all can take a look at the screens rather than your handout, that's probably the most accurate picture at this moment.

12
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:28,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I ask Will to just enlarge Dr. Cushing's screen in his absence, just to make it a little bit larger for the community in case people are watching.

13
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:29,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

14
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:31,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

15
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:41,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair?

16
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo.

17
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:54,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's still some problems with these numbers, but I think the motion that I would make is that we would accept the rate card with a 3% increase over whatever it is right now.

18
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

19
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:04,217
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion to accept a 3% increase for the before care program over current rates

20
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:11,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously that these charts will be updated accurately before they're posted on the website by Member Rousseau.

21
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:13,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

22
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,587
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the history of increases here?

23
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I'm going to ask, so Director Megan Fidlecari is on the call.

24
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:35,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's unmuted just to give us a little bit more of a history here.

25
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

26
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:52,018
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in the last two to three years, certainly two years, we've only increased very modestly to account for increases to staff pay.

27
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,021
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, we went several years without increasing before school pay.

28
00:06:56,461 --> 00:07:01,644
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only to keep up with the increase in staff pay for before school.

29
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Megan, could you also speak to afterschool care as well?

30
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:04,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.

31
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:07,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, afterschool is the same.

32
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:21,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years ago, or maybe it was four years ago, right after COVID, we did a considerable jump to right-size our tuition rates to meet tuition and staff rates.

33
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,821
[SPEAKER_01]: to better reflect what our neighbors were doing.

34
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:31,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, it's only been a very modest increase, and it is only to keep up with increasing wages.

35
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:39,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right now?

36
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:39,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

37
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:48,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was also wondering how this matches up with some of the right sizing we've been doing on our budget over the last couple of years with our revolving accounts.

38
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's a question for

39
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,769
[SPEAKER_04]: budget analyst Jerry McHugh, but that is my question around this.

40
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:04,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we're, I would probably defer to him for a more detailed, you know, accurate answer.

41
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:22,407
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for the purposes here, for us, what we're looking at is, yes, a modest increase to some of the wages, but it's also to increase some of that staffing capability and also for the increases that we've seen in some of the supplies and the materials.

42
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can get you some like.

43
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I should have asked for this when I got my packet on Friday, and I apologize.

44
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:33,604
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, that's okay.

45
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,044
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can get that to you.

46
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:41,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get that to you more specifically in terms of what you're talking about with.

47
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:47,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I'm curious what I know that was one of the accounts that has had a lot of movement over the years.

48
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:59,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Reinfeld, I do know that last year, I believe last year was the first year that we started doing chargeback to certain revolving accounts.

49
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was one of them.

50
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:06,229
[SPEAKER_05]: This was one of the accounts that already has sort of ingested a chargeback model.

51
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, and for that point, Kids Corner is as well.

52
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrific, thank you.

53
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:13,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo.

54
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I made the motion for the 3% for the before program.

55
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also make a motion for 3% for the afterschool program, if there are even separate programs, but.

56
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olopade.

57
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:42,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have a motion on the floor to increase before and afterschool program tuition by 3% for the 25-26 school year by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Olopade.

58
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other questions?

59
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing any.

60
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:50,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

61
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:51,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you call the roll, please?

62
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:53,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll call it twice.

63
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Grant, this is for before school.

64
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:57,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

65
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:57,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

66
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa?

67
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:58,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

68
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:00,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Olopade?

69
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rheinfeld?

71
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:01,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

72
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:02,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rossell?

73
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:03,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

74
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:03,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Longo?

75
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:04,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

76
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

77
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

78
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Before school increase is 3%.

79
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the after school member Graham?

80
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

81
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa?

82
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

83
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Olopade?

84
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:18,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

85
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:19,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rheinfeld?

86
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:20,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

87
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rossell?

88
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:21,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

89
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:22,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Longo-Kern?

90
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:24,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

91
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

92
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,581
[SPEAKER_05]: The after school program rate increase is 3%.

93
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:31,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.

94
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:32,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

95
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:33,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

96
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:33,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

97
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Fidler-Carry.

98
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:34,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

99
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we are done with the rate card.

100
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:44,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number four, recommendation to approve budget transfers.

101
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:47,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Noel Velez, director of finance.

102
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:01,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I on?

103
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:03,449
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, sorry about that.

104
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just as excited as you are, Paul.

105
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I love budget transfers.

106
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:16,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have in front of you is a proposal from the business office as a whole and the superintendent regarding $138,000.

107
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,627
[SPEAKER_00]: $431.25 for budget transfers.

108
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:26,630
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did with this budget transfer, I wanted to keep it quarterly.

109
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep things fiscally responsible.

110
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:40,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal was to keep everything within their allotted, I think we call them either codes or program codes.

111
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:47,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to keep everything, I wanted to keep everybody within their program codes regarding how they can properly spend their funding, but in some areas they may have overspent in one line.

112
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:49,905
[SPEAKER_00]: but they had extra money in other lines.

113
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of use those funds to cover it.

114
00:11:52,526 --> 00:12:03,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in one of the pages, you'll see, I gave a, just a small brief description of what each budget transfer refers to and what, and what these principles and what these directors have done with their finances.

115
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:14,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also gives them a better opportunity as we're, as we're coming towards the end of the fiscal year to see how much they have in each line and really spend accordingly and be fiscally responsible.

116
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions.

117
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

118
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:27,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any questions because they're all answered and I appreciate that, but I'll make a motion to approve the budget transfers.

119
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:34,263
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion to approve budget transfers by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Ntapa.

120
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there questions?

121
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:40,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no questions, can you call the roll please?

122
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

123
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:46,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

124
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa?

125
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:47,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

126
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:48,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Olopade?

127
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:49,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

128
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:49,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rheinfeld?

129
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:50,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

130
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:50,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau?

131
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:51,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

132
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:51,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Longo Kern?

133
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

134
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

135
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:57,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

136
00:12:58,424 --> 00:12:59,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.

137
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:07,394
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have any presentations of the public today, but we do have some continued business.

138
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:13,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the second reading of policy IKF as amended at the April 7th regular meeting.

139
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are requirements for graduation.

140
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:36,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we discussed last week, there were a few, a handful of clarifications made to the previously updated document that laid out participation and graduation activities and commencement decisions around

141
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: around meeting graduation requirements and in some cases being subject to individualized IEP program processes, as well as some updates to math to reflect that we are in transition in the math program.

142
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you all like me to read this or is there a motion?

143
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:04,251
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion to waive the reading by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Ntapa.

144
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:04,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

145
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:10,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

146
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:10,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

147
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:11,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

148
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:11,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

149
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

150
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

151
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:25,518
[SPEAKER_05]: The reading the policy is waived.

152
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:26,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

153
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:36,307
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion on the floor to approve this policy, the second reading by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Ntapa.

154
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:41,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo, will you call the roll?

155
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:45,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

156
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:45,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

157
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:46,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa?

158
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:47,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

159
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:47,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Olopade?

160
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:48,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

161
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:49,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rheinfeld?

162
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:49,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

163
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:50,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau?

164
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:50,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

165
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:51,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Lungo-Kern?

166
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:54,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

167
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

168
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:03,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

169
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:10,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We are on to item number eight, new business, and we have one motion.

170
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 2025-12 offered by member Reinfeld, whereas uneven distribution of students across the city's elementary schools has constrained Medford public schools ability to most effectively use physical spaces, provide transportation and offer specialized services to students.

171
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:31,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas the city of Medford is undergoing reevaluation of zoning and residential areas,

172
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:40,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the district administration will undertake a review of the potential solutions to alleviate issues of overcrowding and associated inequities.

173
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:48,392
[SPEAKER_05]: As such, the administration shall provide no later than May 19, 2025, a summary of the challenges at hand and recommend next steps.

174
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: The report should include the following data.

175
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:54,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Enrollment in general education and specialized programs over the last three years.

176
00:15:55,775 --> 00:16:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Average class size and relative proportion of students in general education classes who require specialized support services projected student population growth within the city space and staffing constraints at each school average number of intradistrict district approvals by school per year.

177
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:25,104
[SPEAKER_05]: impact of sibling preferences on enrollment and space capacity, general fluctuation of the above conditions from year to year, summary of associated transportation constraints, and a list of potential long-term solutions for consideration.

178
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:36,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Next steps may include feasibility studies for one or more long-term solutions, meetings with community members and stakeholders, and a proposed action plan for managing overcrowding at the elementary level for the 25-26 school year.

179
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt.

180
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:42,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very fancy way of saying our elementary schools are overcrowded.

181
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:43,409
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to fix it.

182
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:54,934
[SPEAKER_04]: What this began as a resolution to undertake those solutions, but very quickly evolved into a report to assemble the data so we can really understand the nature of

183
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,456
[SPEAKER_04]: the problems and the challenges we're facing.

184
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:04,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, this probably should have been submitted as a report request by the time I was done writing this.

185
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:18,248
[SPEAKER_04]: But the community, the principals, everyone has come to us, we know this is a challenge, and everyone has an idea of how it ought to be fixed, whether that's through redistricting, restructuring,

186
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,542
[SPEAKER_04]: changing how we select students per elementary school.

187
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:28,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would like for the district to begin that process.

188
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:34,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've just had a lot of schedule changes that we've had to implement very quickly, but this is a pressing problem.

189
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are two stages to this.

190
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:42,652
[SPEAKER_04]: One is to figure out the long-term solutions based on the data that we have, but we also have a very urgent

191
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:50,273
[SPEAKER_04]: issue of potential kindergarten admissions exacerbating this problem for the upcoming school year.

192
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:55,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking for some short-term solutions as well as some long-term solutions.

193
00:17:55,274 --> 00:18:05,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the district has a lot of this data and can present the challenge and potential solutions before choosing one to really investigate further.

194
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:11,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the goal of this is to begin the process of solving our overcrowding issues.

195
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

196
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:14,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:15,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

198
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

199
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:16,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Brinefeld member.

200
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you have your I do?

201
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:18,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

202
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:18,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

203
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a question about the May 19th date.

204
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if you've talked to the administration yet on that.

205
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,111
[SPEAKER_06]: That was something they said they could do.

206
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:26,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

207
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then I'll.

208
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to approve.

209
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:31,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

210
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:32,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

211
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:33,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

212
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like a

213
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:47,971
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a needed piece of information to look into.

214
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:56,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an ongoing thread in conversation at a lot of my meet and greets at the elementary level as well as at the middle school level.

215
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:07,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have in earnest started a lot of some of this background information that you have outlined here, but it definitely needs to be a greater conversation.

216
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:17,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So I welcome the opportunity to gather this data with my team and come to you by May 19 with a further conversation.

217
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also very interested

218
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,038
[SPEAKER_02]: in continuing this conversation with varied stakeholders.

219
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:29,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really glad to see that one of the pieces here is ongoing conversation with community members.

220
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:46,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt, if I could potentially offer a friendly amendment to this motion, I think it is certainly well time to do this, and we've sort of been dancing around it for a really long time.

221
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:55,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I do wonder if bringing this data back to this committee will, like in this sort of broader sense, will

222
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:01,720
[SPEAKER_05]: necessitate us having to send it somewhere else anyway, because there's a lot of work to do here.

223
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And our subcommittees are intended to be working committees.

224
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:21,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did have a suggestion, if you are interested, that this be referred to the strategic planning subcommittee, where some of these community-based conversations can be had in advance of all this information coming back to us.

225
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:23,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we typically have a really

226
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:28,571
[SPEAKER_05]: ambitious agenda and don't have time to dig in in those kinds of ways on the floor here.

227
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was just my suggestion.

228
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certainly open to that.

229
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I am also on that committee.

230
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:35,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be getting that information.

231
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might

232
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:48,642
[SPEAKER_04]: confirm with colleagues who are not, I think any, all right, I'm seeing some unofficial signals that that feels okay, so yes.

233
00:20:48,882 --> 00:21:05,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And my question to the superintendent is, would we need, because that's strategic planning for the longterm, would there need to be, looking at the elementary school for next year, would that need to come to this group sooner, or would that need to go to family engagement?

234
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say just because of the timing of the year, it may need to come here.

235
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:20,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think we could make a decision if we feel that further conversation is needed at that subcommittee.

236
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:32,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible to have that conversation about elementary without having had the bigger conversation in the subcommittee meeting?

237
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about timing here and the May 19th meeting.

238
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:48,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the question is like, can you bring the short-term solution here without that larger conversation around the long-term?

239
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:49,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the question?

240
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,616
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the question.

241
00:21:53,658 --> 00:22:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think clearly the piece here in terms of your talking about overcrowding for the next school year is for the Roberts Elementary School.

242
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,583
[SPEAKER_02]: we have seen since COVID a need for a fifth kindergarten every year.

243
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:24,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the pressure is most acutely seen there in terms of what the needs are going to be for school year 25, 26.

244
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would depend maybe on the scheduling of when we're doing this because

245
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:41,163
[SPEAKER_02]: we really, in essence, really have about a month left, month and a half to make a lot of these decisions.

246
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:45,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe we have two school committees left.

247
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it would maybe depend on the timing.

248
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

249
00:22:50,531 --> 00:23:03,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I will accept the amendment to bring it to strategic planning, but I would defer to the superintendent and the team if this piece of it needs to come on the agenda sooner.

250
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with that because then we can schedule that.

251
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:14,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, accordingly, when the data is ready, we can schedule strategic planning and see how the kindergarten situation fits into that.

252
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:16,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've been closely monitoring everything.

253
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:17,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

254
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:27,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so there is a motion on the floor as amended that this data will go to the strategic planning subcommittee.

255
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:31,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Member Reinfeldt.

256
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:31,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

257
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second by Member Rousseau?

258
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:34,615
[SPEAKER_05]: roll call please.

[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have two condolences this evening, the members of the Medford school committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Constance candy grand a Sullivan, the mother of Brooks Elementary teacher Camille far far ago and grandmother of Jared Fargo former vocational electrical teacher.

267
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:28,946
[SPEAKER_05]: and the members of the Medford school committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Sophie Marie Santoro who self selflessly served as a crossing guard with the Medford police for nearly 30 years watching out for children in our community.

268
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,429
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

269
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:58,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, our next meeting is on our next regular meeting is on May 5th at Alden Memorial Chambers Medford City Hall in addition to zoom.
