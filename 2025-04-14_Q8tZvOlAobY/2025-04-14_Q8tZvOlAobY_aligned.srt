1
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,740
Hi, everyone, we're back.

2
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:26,026
Okay, before we had to step away and come back, we were talking about the before school program increase, and there was a question by Member Ntapa about the rates looking like they were reversed for the three-day option.

3
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:26,906
Is that correct?

4
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,266
Is that what you were looking at?

5
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:31,767
I believe it's being

6
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,528
In before care program school year 2025 2026 the 3% increase for monthly three days should read 122.57 not 112.57.

7
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:54,376
I'm just noting that I understand that but I'm just noting that so if this infograph is sent out,

8
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:58,494
that we correct that similar to the one that was mentioned for me.

9
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:58,854
OK.

10
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:04,377
And the presentation has been updated with the corrected rates.

11
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:13,703
So if you all can take a look at the screens rather than your handout, that's probably the most accurate picture at this moment.

12
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:28,633
Could I ask Will to just enlarge Dr. Cushing's screen in his absence, just to make it a little bit larger for the community in case people are watching.

13
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:29,634
Thank you.

14
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:31,795
Thank you.

15
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:41,359
Chair?

16
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,040
Member Russo.

17
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:54,155
I think there's still some problems with these numbers, but I think the motion that I would make is that we would accept the rate card with a 3% increase over whatever it is right now.

18
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,035
Thank you.

19
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:04,217
There's a motion to accept a 3% increase for the before care program over current rates

20
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:11,904
And obviously that these charts will be updated accurately before they're posted on the website by Member Rousseau.

21
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:13,664
Is there a second?

22
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,587
What's the history of increases here?

23
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,263
Sure, I'm going to ask, so Director Megan Fidlecari is on the call.

24
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:35,667
So she's unmuted just to give us a little bit more of a history here.

25
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,109
Hi, everybody.

26
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:52,018
We have in the last two to three years, certainly two years, we've only increased very modestly to account for increases to staff pay.

27
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,021
But before that, we went several years without increasing before school pay.

28
00:06:56,461 --> 00:07:01,644
So it's only to keep up with the increase in staff pay for before school.

29
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,985
Megan, could you also speak to afterschool care as well?

30
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:04,806
Certainly.

31
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:07,707
Yeah, afterschool is the same.

32
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:21,675
Three years ago, or maybe it was four years ago, right after COVID, we did a considerable jump to right-size our tuition rates to meet tuition and staff rates.

33
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,821
to better reflect what our neighbors were doing.

34
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:31,523
But since then, it's only been a very modest increase, and it is only to keep up with increasing wages.

35
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:39,045
Am I right now?

36
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:39,565
Yes.

37
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:48,347
And then I was also wondering how this matches up with some of the right sizing we've been doing on our budget over the last couple of years with our revolving accounts.

38
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,988
I don't know if that's a question for

39
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,769
budget analyst Jerry McHugh, but that is my question around this.

40
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:04,812
I think what we're, I would probably defer to him for a more detailed, you know, accurate answer.

41
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:22,407
But I think for the purposes here, for us, what we're looking at is, yes, a modest increase to some of the wages, but it's also to increase some of that staffing capability and also for the increases that we've seen in some of the supplies and the materials.

42
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,560
I mean, I can get you some like.

43
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,663
Sorry, I should have asked for this when I got my packet on Friday, and I apologize.

44
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:33,604
No, no, no, that's okay.

45
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,044
But I can get that to you.

46
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:41,209
I can get that to you more specifically in terms of what you're talking about with.

47
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:47,833
Yeah, because I'm curious what I know that was one of the accounts that has had a lot of movement over the years.

48
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:59,366
And member Reinfeld, I do know that last year, I believe last year was the first year that we started doing chargeback to certain revolving accounts.

49
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,547
And this was one of them.

50
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:06,229
This was one of the accounts that already has sort of ingested a chargeback model.

51
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,970
So yeah, and for that point, Kids Corner is as well.

52
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,351
Terrific, thank you.

53
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:13,991
Member Russo.

54
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:18,853
Oh, I made the motion for the 3% for the before program.

55
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,074
I'd also make a motion for 3% for the afterschool program, if there are even separate programs, but.

56
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:28,356
Member Olopade.

57
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:42,845
Okay, so we have a motion on the floor to increase before and afterschool program tuition by 3% for the 25-26 school year by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Olopade.

58
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,207
Are there any other questions?

59
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,694
I'm not seeing any.

60
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:50,375
Okay.

61
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:51,315
Can you call the roll, please?

62
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:53,257
I'll call it twice.

63
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,819
Member Grant, this is for before school.

64
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:57,439
Member Graham?

65
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:57,919
Yes.

66
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,760
Member Ntapa?

67
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:58,860
Yes.

68
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:00,281
Member Olopade?

69
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:00,581
Yes.

70
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,522
Member Rheinfeld?

71
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:01,602
Yes.

72
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:02,903
Member Rossell?

73
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:03,143
Yes.

74
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:03,923
Mayor Longo?

75
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:04,564
Yes.

76
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,226
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

77
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,027
Motion passes.

78
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,748
Before school increase is 3%.

79
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,289
And for the after school member Graham?

80
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,030
Yes.

81
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,111
Member Ntapa?

82
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:17,531
Yes.

83
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:18,472
Member Olopade?

84
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:18,872
Yes.

85
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:19,913
Member Rheinfeld?

86
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:20,513
Yes.

87
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:21,294
Member Rossell?

88
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:21,534
Yes.

89
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:22,295
Mayor Longo-Kern?

90
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:24,977
Yes.

91
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,840
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

92
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,581
The after school program rate increase is 3%.

93
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:31,982
Thank you, everyone.

94
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:32,623
Thank you.

95
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:33,043
Thank you.

96
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:33,444
Thank you, Ms.

97
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,084
Fidler-Carry.

98
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:34,965
Thanks.

99
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,641
Okay, we are done with the rate card.

100
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:44,082
Item number four, recommendation to approve budget transfers.

101
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:47,323
Mr. Noel Velez, director of finance.

102
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:01,548
Am I on?

103
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:03,449
All right, sorry about that.

104
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,129
I'm just as excited as you are, Paul.

105
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,189
I love budget transfers.

106
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:16,132
So what you have in front of you is a proposal from the business office as a whole and the superintendent regarding $138,000.

107
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,627
$431.25 for budget transfers.

108
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:26,630
What I did with this budget transfer, I wanted to keep it quarterly.

109
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,112
I like to keep things fiscally responsible.

110
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:40,179
And my goal was to keep everything within their allotted, I think we call them either codes or program codes.

111
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:47,905
I wanted to keep everything, I wanted to keep everybody within their program codes regarding how they can properly spend their funding, but in some areas they may have overspent in one line.

112
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:49,905
but they had extra money in other lines.

113
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,486
So we kind of use those funds to cover it.

114
00:11:52,526 --> 00:12:03,768
And then in one of the pages, you'll see, I gave a, just a small brief description of what each budget transfer refers to and what, and what these principles and what these directors have done with their finances.

115
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:14,230
And this also gives them a better opportunity as we're, as we're coming towards the end of the fiscal year to see how much they have in each line and really spend accordingly and be fiscally responsible.

116
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,389
Questions.

117
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,090
Member Rousseau.

118
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:27,356
I don't have any questions because they're all answered and I appreciate that, but I'll make a motion to approve the budget transfers.

119
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:34,263
There's a motion to approve budget transfers by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Ntapa.

120
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,484
Are there questions?

121
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:40,970
Seeing no questions, can you call the roll please?

122
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,901
Member Graham?

123
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:46,541
Yes.

124
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,322
Member Ntapa?

125
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:47,743
Yes.

126
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:48,664
Member Olopade?

127
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:49,004
Yes.

128
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:49,805
Member Rheinfeld?

129
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:50,226
Yes.

130
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:50,926
Member Rousseau?

131
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:51,187
Yes.

132
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:51,948
Mayor Longo Kern?

133
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:52,608
Yes.

134
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,873
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

135
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:57,654
Motion passes.

136
00:12:58,424 --> 00:12:59,165
Thank you, everyone.

137
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:07,394
We do not have any presentations of the public today, but we do have some continued business.

138
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:13,321
So we have the second reading of policy IKF as amended at the April 7th regular meeting.

139
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,963
So these are requirements for graduation.

140
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:36,823
And as we discussed last week, there were a few, a handful of clarifications made to the previously updated document that laid out participation and graduation activities and commencement decisions around

141
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:54,063
around meeting graduation requirements and in some cases being subject to individualized IEP program processes, as well as some updates to math to reflect that we are in transition in the math program.

142
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,586
Would you all like me to read this or is there a motion?

143
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:04,251
There's a motion to waive the reading by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Ntapa.

144
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:04,952
Roll call, please.

145
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:10,797
Yes.

146
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:10,978
Yes.

147
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:11,218
Yes.

148
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:11,819
Yes.

149
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,060
Yes.

150
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,533
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

151
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:25,518
The reading the policy is waived.

152
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:26,338
Is there a motion?

153
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:36,307
There's a motion on the floor to approve this policy, the second reading by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Ntapa.

154
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:41,171
Member Russo, will you call the roll?

155
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:45,246
Member Graham?

156
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:45,786
Yes.

157
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:46,607
Member Ntapa?

158
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:47,107
Yes.

159
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:47,887
Member Olopade?

160
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:48,267
Yes.

161
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:49,127
Member Rheinfeld?

162
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:49,447
Yes.

163
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:50,108
Member Rousseau?

164
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:50,348
Yes.

165
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:51,068
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

166
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:54,609
Yes.

167
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,872
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

168
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:03,612
Motion passes.

169
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:10,758
We are on to item number eight, new business, and we have one motion.

170
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:26,662
It's 2025-12 offered by member Reinfeld, whereas uneven distribution of students across the city's elementary schools has constrained Medford public schools ability to most effectively use physical spaces, provide transportation and offer specialized services to students.

171
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:31,484
And whereas the city of Medford is undergoing reevaluation of zoning and residential areas,

172
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:40,208
Be it resolved that the district administration will undertake a review of the potential solutions to alleviate issues of overcrowding and associated inequities.

173
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:48,392
As such, the administration shall provide no later than May 19, 2025, a summary of the challenges at hand and recommend next steps.

174
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,753
The report should include the following data.

175
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:54,875
Enrollment in general education and specialized programs over the last three years.

176
00:15:55,775 --> 00:16:11,192
Average class size and relative proportion of students in general education classes who require specialized support services projected student population growth within the city space and staffing constraints at each school average number of intradistrict district approvals by school per year.

177
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:25,104
impact of sibling preferences on enrollment and space capacity, general fluctuation of the above conditions from year to year, summary of associated transportation constraints, and a list of potential long-term solutions for consideration.

178
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:36,394
Next steps may include feasibility studies for one or more long-term solutions, meetings with community members and stakeholders, and a proposed action plan for managing overcrowding at the elementary level for the 25-26 school year.

179
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:37,475
Member Reinfeldt.

180
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:42,409
So this is a very fancy way of saying our elementary schools are overcrowded.

181
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:43,409
We need to fix it.

182
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:54,934
What this began as a resolution to undertake those solutions, but very quickly evolved into a report to assemble the data so we can really understand the nature of

183
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,456
the problems and the challenges we're facing.

184
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:04,820
I apologize, this probably should have been submitted as a report request by the time I was done writing this.

185
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:18,248
But the community, the principals, everyone has come to us, we know this is a challenge, and everyone has an idea of how it ought to be fixed, whether that's through redistricting, restructuring,

186
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,542
changing how we select students per elementary school.

187
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:28,905
And so I would like for the district to begin that process.

188
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:34,588
I know we've just had a lot of schedule changes that we've had to implement very quickly, but this is a pressing problem.

189
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,428
And there are two stages to this.

190
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:42,652
One is to figure out the long-term solutions based on the data that we have, but we also have a very urgent

191
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:50,273
issue of potential kindergarten admissions exacerbating this problem for the upcoming school year.

192
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:55,134
So I'm looking for some short-term solutions as well as some long-term solutions.

193
00:17:55,274 --> 00:18:05,997
And I think the district has a lot of this data and can present the challenge and potential solutions before choosing one to really investigate further.

194
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:11,398
So that's the goal of this is to begin the process of solving our overcrowding issues.

195
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,103
Thank you, ma'am.

196
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:14,604
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:15,164
Thank you, ma'am.

198
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:15,604
Thank you, ma'am.

199
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:16,085
Brinefeld member.

200
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,986
So did you have your I do?

201
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:18,226
Yes.

202
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:18,726
Thank you.

203
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,748
I do have a question about the May 19th date.

204
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,490
I'm wondering if you've talked to the administration yet on that.

205
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,111
That was something they said they could do.

206
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:26,852
Yes.

207
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,633
Okay, then I'll.

208
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,315
And I don't want to approve.

209
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:31,815
Yeah.

210
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:32,976
Yes.

211
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:33,636
I'm so sorry.

212
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,116
I have like a

213
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:47,971
This is a needed piece of information to look into.

214
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:56,920
It was an ongoing thread in conversation at a lot of my meet and greets at the elementary level as well as at the middle school level.

215
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:07,459
And so we have in earnest started a lot of some of this background information that you have outlined here, but it definitely needs to be a greater conversation.

216
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:17,068
So I welcome the opportunity to gather this data with my team and come to you by May 19 with a further conversation.

217
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,270
I'm also very interested

218
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,038
in continuing this conversation with varied stakeholders.

219
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:29,994
So I'm really glad to see that one of the pieces here is ongoing conversation with community members.

220
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:46,170
Member Reinfeldt, if I could potentially offer a friendly amendment to this motion, I think it is certainly well time to do this, and we've sort of been dancing around it for a really long time.

221
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:55,358
I do wonder if bringing this data back to this committee will, like in this sort of broader sense, will

222
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:01,720
necessitate us having to send it somewhere else anyway, because there's a lot of work to do here.

223
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,241
And our subcommittees are intended to be working committees.

224
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:21,565
So I did have a suggestion, if you are interested, that this be referred to the strategic planning subcommittee, where some of these community-based conversations can be had in advance of all this information coming back to us.

225
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:23,225
Because we typically have a really

226
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:28,571
ambitious agenda and don't have time to dig in in those kinds of ways on the floor here.

227
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,212
So that was just my suggestion.

228
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,474
I'm certainly open to that.

229
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,897
I am also on that committee.

230
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:35,739
So I'll be getting that information.

231
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,440
So I might

232
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:48,642
confirm with colleagues who are not, I think any, all right, I'm seeing some unofficial signals that that feels okay, so yes.

233
00:20:48,882 --> 00:21:05,813
And my question to the superintendent is, would we need, because that's strategic planning for the longterm, would there need to be, looking at the elementary school for next year, would that need to come to this group sooner, or would that need to go to family engagement?

234
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,683
I would say just because of the timing of the year, it may need to come here.

235
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:20,389
And then I think we could make a decision if we feel that further conversation is needed at that subcommittee.

236
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:32,840
Is it possible to have that conversation about elementary without having had the bigger conversation in the subcommittee meeting?

237
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,383
I'm thinking about timing here and the May 19th meeting.

238
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:48,674
So I think the question is like, can you bring the short-term solution here without that larger conversation around the long-term?

239
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:49,755
Is that the question?

240
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,616
That is the question.

241
00:21:53,658 --> 00:22:05,728
I mean, I think clearly the piece here in terms of your talking about overcrowding for the next school year is for the Roberts Elementary School.

242
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,583
we have seen since COVID a need for a fifth kindergarten every year.

243
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:24,448
And so the pressure is most acutely seen there in terms of what the needs are going to be for school year 25, 26.

244
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,372
I guess that would depend maybe on the scheduling of when we're doing this because

245
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:41,163
we really, in essence, really have about a month left, month and a half to make a lot of these decisions.

246
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:45,406
And I believe we have two school committees left.

247
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,910
So I think it would maybe depend on the timing.

248
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,491
All right.

249
00:22:50,531 --> 00:23:03,842
Then I will accept the amendment to bring it to strategic planning, but I would defer to the superintendent and the team if this piece of it needs to come on the agenda sooner.

250
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,755
Yeah, I would agree with that because then we can schedule that.

251
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:14,778
Yeah, accordingly, when the data is ready, we can schedule strategic planning and see how the kindergarten situation fits into that.

252
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:16,999
Well, we've been closely monitoring everything.

253
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:17,679
I'm sure.

254
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:27,403
Okay, so there is a motion on the floor as amended that this data will go to the strategic planning subcommittee.

255
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:31,545
Motion by Member Reinfeldt.

256
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:31,845
Yes.

257
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,466
Is there a second by Member Rousseau?

258
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:34,615
roll call please.

259
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,439

Okay, we have two condolences this evening, the members of the Medford school committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Constance candy grand a Sullivan, the mother of Brooks Elementary teacher Camille far far ago and grandmother of Jared Fargo former vocational electrical teacher.

267
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:28,946
and the members of the Medford school committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Sophie Marie Santoro who self selflessly served as a crossing guard with the Medford police for nearly 30 years watching out for children in our community.

268
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,429
If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

269
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:58,869
Okay, our next meeting is on our next regular meeting is on May 5th at Alden Memorial Chambers Medford City Hall in addition to zoom.

270
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:00,730
