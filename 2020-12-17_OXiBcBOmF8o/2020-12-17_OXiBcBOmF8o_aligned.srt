00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:06,847
Hi, I am here with Stephanie Johnson, who owns SwapIt.

2
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,568
And Stephanie, thank you so much for being here.

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:10,329
Yeah, thanks so much for having me.

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,811
It's really nice that you put together this whole list of local shopping for this holiday.

5
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:18,174
It has been so fun and so fun to meet people, really just a joy.

6
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:22,817
So yeah, can you tell us a little bit about how SwapIt got started?

7
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:24,098
Sure.

8
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:29,647
Um, swap its main mission is to keep clothing out of landfills for as long as possible.

9
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:35,430
And we do that by creating kind of like new and different ways to shop secondhand.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:43,235
Um, and so that all came from the idea of, um, I was struggling like a lot with my wardrobe.

11
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:44,755
I was living in New York city.

12
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,497
I wasn't making any money.

13
00:00:48,435 --> 00:01:13,370
Um, but I was moving up in my career and I was being photographed and I was being seen and talking in front of a lot of people and I was feeling really uncomfortable in my clothes and I, um, wanted to like upgrade my wardrobe, but I didn't necessarily want to go to, um, like a traditional retail store, buy stuff, not know if I was going to wear it, create more waste or even fast fashion, which is like more what I could have afforded back then.

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,351
Um, and so.

15
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:25,313
At the same time, I was doing this fellowship about greening and learning about how much waste there is and how much trash there is.

16
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:30,735
And in New York, they have to ship their trash to Michigan.

17
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:43,400
So not only is it a ton of trash that's taking up space that could be a park or whatever, but also it's huge trash trucks that are now driving from New York to Michigan with all that snog and smoke.

18
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:51,555
So those two things were like swirling around in my head at the same time, but I didn't like shopping secondhand.

19
00:01:52,515 --> 00:02:01,640
Um, I found it challenging and just took like a lot of time and, um, you know, return policies are always kind of iffy.

20
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:14,406
So, um, I ended up like, just, you know, like you do in your twenties, I bribed my friends with pizza and beer and they came over and we had like lots of brainstorming sessions and finally kind of came up with this idea of a.

21
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:23,130
more like an easier shopping experience where SwapFit offers styling and we offer swapping.

22
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:27,153
So you bring in like a bag of clothes and you can take stuff from us.

23
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:30,195
And so it kind of gets rid of that decision-making process.

24
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:33,057
You take it home and then if you find that you don't wear it, you just bring it back.

25
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:35,118
There's no return policy, right?

26
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,119
It's just swapping.

27
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,143
And that's really been able to encourage more people to shop secondhand, it makes it easier.

28
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,784
And so it came from like my own

29
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:50,179
Like most business stories, it came to a problem that I was facing that I decided I wanted to solve.

30
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,881
And that's kind of how we did it.

31
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,082
That's amazing.

32
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:55,183
That is so cool.

33
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,905
Tell me a little bit more about how the styling stuff works.

34
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,066
Sure.

35
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,810
So well, I guess we'll get to COVID in a minute.

36
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,293
But pre-COVID, we had a personal stylist.

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,941
And you could book appointments.

38
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:19,385
And we have three different types of appointments, but basically you come in and the stylist has pre-picked things for you to try on based on your like a questionnaire.

39
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,846
And then you try it on with her and she teaches you style tricks.

40
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:26,948
And oftentimes people walk out with things they never would have taken off the rack.

41
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:29,489
They feel amazing about what they grabbed.

42
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,810
And it's all really affordable.

43
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,411
Our first session, our most popular session was $50.

44
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,973
And that includes five items of clothing we wanted to make

45
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:40,754
personal styling kind of available to the masses.

46
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:46,597
So people that never thought they would have a personal stylist, like got this experience and it's all with secondhand clothing.

47
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:47,977
So there's nothing to feel guilty about.

48
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:51,779
You don't feel guilty about the money and you don't feel guilty about the stuff.

49
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,460
That is amazing.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,442
Sounds so great and an amazing gift for Christmas.

51
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:00,563
Now, how have you guys been doing since COVID?

52
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,904
And I'm sorry, I missed, when did you start?

53
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:19,046
Also a complicated story, but we've been in our Medford storefront for a year and a half, just over a year and a half probably, yeah.

54
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,707
And yeah, how have things been going since COVID?

55
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,308
So they've definitely had to adapt.

56
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:34,211
I had two stylists, and one kind of faded off with COVID, and the other one lives in Rhode Island, so she was taking

57
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,941
trains to get here.

58
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:40,863
And so obviously we stopped that and kind of the one-on-one that really, it's a very close interaction.

59
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:41,843
I mean, she's touching you.

60
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:45,125
She's like, you know, tucking you, rolling your pants, whatever she's doing.

61
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,647
So we have actually like stopped that completely for now.

62
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:55,170
And, um, the only thing that we offer right now is our, is our swap membership.

63
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,972
And we have to, um, people have to book appointments to come in.

64
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,093
We don't let more than five people in the store at a time.

65
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,334
We take everybody's temperature.

66
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:04,733
You have to wear a mask.

67
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:06,934
We have hand sanitizer out.

68
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:12,439
So it's definitely changed the flow of how everything works.

69
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:24,268
But we have very high hopes of being back to whatever the new normal, or hopefully the old normal, we'll be back to after this is all over and bring back our styling services.

70
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,428
I can't wait.

71
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,514
So yeah, just how can people shop with you for the holidays?

72
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:39,350
So the best thing to do for the holidays really would be to get a membership.

73
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:42,212
We offer, it's a year long membership.

74
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:45,293
That's what we've realized is kind of the most valuable for people.

75
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,214
It's $147 for the year.

76
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:51,155
And what that includes is really just an unlimited wardrobe.

77
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:52,916
It's one for one swap.

78
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,317
We're women only.

79
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:58,038
Or like say anyone that wants to wear women's clothing.

80
00:05:59,019 --> 00:05:59,799
And we,

81
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,845
So you bring something in, you get something, you can almost think of it like credits.

82
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:09,587
So you could drop off on your first day, 200 pieces and then have the whole year to use it up.

83
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:14,468
Or on the other end, you could come the first time with nothing and take swaps.

84
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:16,809
And then you have the whole year to kind of catch up.

85
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,271
So, you know, our members don't go to stores anymore.

86
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,032
They can just come in whenever they need anything.

87
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,192
We change our floor.

88
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:35,561
i'm constantly so there's always new stuff out we change it with the season, we have a whole section right now for like holiday where not that anyone's really going anywhere, but doesn't.

89
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,443
You still like to her sequence and read the year.

90
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:40,664
We haven't.

91
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,886
been there your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever yeah.

92
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,707
or your you know your zoom get togethers.

93
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,446
Yeah, for your cat.

94
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:49,087
Why not?

95
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,032
It's funny you say that because so many of our members have cats.

96
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:58,595
It's like this funny trend that they all have.

97
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,676
And do you have a website?

98
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,998
Like how do people make that happen?

99
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:03,619
Yes.

100
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,741
Like if it were like a gift membership for somebody, let's say.

101
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,402
Yes.

102
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:08,683
We have had that too.

103
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:12,967
It's a very, it seems to be a very popular mother-in-law gift because instead of getting like

104
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:18,169
sweater that your daughter-in-law is not going to wear or like and feel really awkward about.

105
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:22,012
You get her this entire wardrobe that she can totally pick out.

106
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:23,573
And even you could go with her.

107
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,334
We have private shopping hours.

108
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:27,156
You could rent out the whole store to yourself.

109
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:32,159
And so you could go with whoever buys you the gift and have like a little get together after.

110
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,564
Um, but our website is, um, the easiest one would be swapit.cool.

111
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:43,008
So S W A P I T dot C O O L.

112
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:57,657
And there we'll have all the membership information and a link if you wanna talk to us, or you can also email us at style at a swappinggoodtime.com if you wanna talk and check out a little bit more.

113
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,342
And I think that's the best way to be with us this season.

114
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:08,968
Awesome, and is there a way to donate to you or like people have clothes or is it mostly just members who come in and bring clothes?

115
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,459
That is also a COVID thing.

116
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:17,263
Pre-COVID, we were taking from everyone, and now we're really in kind of this membership loop.

117
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,404
So if you are a member, you can bring in.

118
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:24,628
And if you know a member, you can probably drop a bag at their house and have them bring it in for you.

119
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:25,629
Got it.

120
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:26,970
Great.

121
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,370
Sounds super exciting.

122
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:31,052
I think it's such a great gift.

123
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:33,894
Very, very fun.

124
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:35,847
Yeah.

125
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:38,209
And so, yeah, thank you so much.

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,511
Great to meet you and great to know about your store.

127
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:41,472
You too.

128
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,615
Thanks for having me and hopefully we'll see some viewers in this year.

129
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:45,836
Absolutely.

130
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:47,858
Bye-bye.

131
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:48,018
Bye.
