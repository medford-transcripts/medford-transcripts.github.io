[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you.

144
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,555
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing on the agenda was a little discussion about social media.

145
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:18,244
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to belay it, but I don't know if you all know that Hendrik has stepped aside.

146
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:34,680
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, when you send something out on social media, you might not intend it to be the way you send it, but once you push that send button and other people read it, you know, they might not take it the way you set it and it can cause problems.

147
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:44,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So to speed things up for tonight, not to lay us down because of that, he's decided he would step aside so we can continue on our work here.

148
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I want to say on that.

149
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:58,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a letter I have to read into record, a letter from the NAACP.

150
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,103
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order, Jim.

151
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:10,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Regarding, I guess, that first agenda item, I mean, is there a specific guideline around the use of social media in terms of what's appropriate or not appropriate or not really?

152
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:12,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

153
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:17,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say a basic guideline, you know,

154
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:22,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, people get on social media and make accusations.

155
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, it caused a lot of problems and I don't know what to say.

156
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:34,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, social media is, everybody knows it's.

157
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:35,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

158
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:46,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I have no idea about this and I'm curious about how, shouldn't we have discussed you asking for his resignation in our meeting?

159
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

160
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,024
[SPEAKER_07]: As the chair, I had that authority.

161
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:58,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We had an email discussion, him and I, so that we didn't have this discussion here on the floor.

162
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:11,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an open meeting, and I was brought, I had other members request executive session, and there's special guidelines to that, and we don't wanna tie this meeting up doing that all night.

163
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't wanna tie this meeting either,

164
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:17,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea that people were calling executive session or anything like that.

165
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:25,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make sure that people understand that there was an executive session, which is the first time I've heard about this.

166
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,136
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no executive session.

167
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,440
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been now tonight if we wanted to discuss this in the open.

168
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,911
[SPEAKER_03]: point of order.

169
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no specific authority just for the chair.

170
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:40,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody on this committee could have requested a resignation from any other member.

171
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all right.

172
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:44,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.

173
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But nothing Jim did was out of line.

174
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,585
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wasn't really questioning whether it was out of line, just that the limitations in the member.

175
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:59,128
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we know if we're in violation of a social media thing?

176
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:02,590
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, do we just get a message saying you need you should resign?

177
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:15,033
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't do a lot of posting on social media, but I don't wanna cross a line, but I don't know where the line is.

178
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:25,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're saying, but- Point of clarification, Lee, just for the record, I wasn't referencing that you were questioning the authority.

179
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:28,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just referencing Matt's comment.

180
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:34,993
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just pointing out that there seems to be a blurry line that none of us know what it is.

181
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of us didn't know it happened.

182
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:43,455
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, you know, we might all be in jeopardy of that, but we don't need it.

183
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

184
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:55,578
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is Mr. Lister, it seemed like, did you ask other people on the committee about their opinions about Hendrick's actions on Facebook?

185
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,659
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I asked the city solicitor.

186
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:06,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was our option or else we could have had an open meeting tonight.

187
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:08,203
[SPEAKER_07]: All about this.

188
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:13,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't want to be all about this, but I want some clarity because I have no clarity except for Hendricks.

189
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

190
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:19,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Hendricks, Hendricks resigned and you can talk to him about why.

191
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:20,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

192
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:28,429
[SPEAKER_20]: And now this piece in the patch that had some details and I did see that.

193
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,130
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

194
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee, can you do me a favor tonight if hands get raised.

195
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:35,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you.

196
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but sure.

197
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:40,583
[SPEAKER_07]: We work well together I'd seem like.

198
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:42,245
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

199
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,426
[SPEAKER_19]: I do see Seth has his hand up.

200
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:45,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

201
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:46,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

202
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:47,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

203
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Seth, would you like to speak.

204
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:10,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Hendrick, he resigned this board and you as chair specifically didn't find specific fault with Hendrick.

205
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,321
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just asked to resign.

206
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Hendrick made accusations.

207
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you wanna go through this now?

208
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he resigned.

209
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if yours were like accusations, maybe we will need to.

210
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: He's already resigned.

211
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:32,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think- Then I think that the word accusation might be too strong to use.

212
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,147
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

213
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be, it's, you know, I told you, it's two different people's interpretation.

214
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people took offense to it.

215
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:56,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he didn't mean them to hurt their feelings, but- You as chair, asking someone to resign and then specifically using the word accusation in reference to the person that you have asked to resign,

216
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, this is out of order.

217
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:09,237
[SPEAKER_07]: He was asked to resign so we didn't get into this discussion and this taking us off point tonight and going in a different direction.

218
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:14,200
[SPEAKER_07]: He felt that he would resign so that this didn't happen.

219
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So that I'm not gonna go in this direction.

220
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,585
[SPEAKER_07]: He resigned so that we could move on with our work.

221
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not gonna keep discussing this.

222
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:32,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of order, this was on the agenda, so it is in fact in order.

223
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, my point stands.

224
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have the floor.

225
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:53,366
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have used a word like accusation in characterizing Hendrick's actions, that is a specific characterization of those actions.

226
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:18,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we need to proceed in discussing whether or not Hendrik made accusations versus Hendrik did not make an accusation, then I think we will need to do that.

227
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Hendrik resigned

228
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:31,096
[SPEAKER_04]: He took it upon himself to write a letter of resignation, whatever the issue is, or the meaning why he did it, or why he felt he should do it.

229
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:35,141
[SPEAKER_04]: He did it, I think we should respect that, and I think we should move on.

230
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:42,079
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of work to do tonight to sit here and still talk about why he resigned, what he did, what he didn't do.

231
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it behind us.

232
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan, I 100% agree.

233
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:47,602
[SPEAKER_04]: 100% agree.

234
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,764
[SPEAKER_04]: If you agree, Seth, let's just move forward.

235
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this done.

236
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:52,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of work to do.

237
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:52,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

238
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:55,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not move forward.

239
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Seth, point of clarification.

240
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:05,487
[SPEAKER_03]: The chair rescinded the comment about accusations and simply said that we received a letter of resignation.

241
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:08,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So that- If that is the case, then I apologize.

242
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

243
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:10,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

244
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:11,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

245
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

246
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

247
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,331
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only thing that I wanted.

248
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:17,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

249
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done?

250
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,110
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not done.

251
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:35,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to take a minute to say that I'm really disappointed in how this has been handled, not only by members of this committee, but also members of our city governing bodies.

252
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:45,416
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an excusable that any governing body would allow members of the public to engage in targeted and bullying behavior towards a member of the committee, ultimately prompting the resignation.

253
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:51,443
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no reason for this to have escalated to this point with proper leadership and mediation.

254
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And this does not help us to bring the community together.

255
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,397
[SPEAKER_15]: We have all come here to do a job to the best of our ability and to do so objectively.

256
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:08,360
[SPEAKER_15]: The pettiness must stop and the distractions and outside interference must also stop.

257
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,221
[SPEAKER_15]: We still have a job to do and it's a tight timeline in which to do it.

258
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:19,342
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's continue to move forward to do the job that was designated to us by the school committee.

259
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:28,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And I implore the rest of my fellow committee members to do so with mutual respect, integrity, and good faith.

260
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:36,389
[SPEAKER_15]: In doing so, we can set an example for the rest of the community and begin to heal the wounds of this divisiveness.

261
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:40,392
[SPEAKER_13]: If those remarks to me, please.

262
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:40,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

263
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:42,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

264
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:45,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

265
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:46,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I see any other hands up?

266
00:14:48,877 --> 00:14:49,618
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's it.

267
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:50,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

268
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,300
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

269
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a letter from the NAACP to the mayor.

270
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to read, read into the record.

271
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:12,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear members of the Medford School Committee, Mayor Brianna Longo-Cohn, Paul Russo, Melanie P. McLaughlin, Jenny Graham, Mia Quinn-Mastone, Paulette Vander Kloot, and Kathy Kretz.

272
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:26,792
[SPEAKER_07]: The Education Committee of the Mystic Valley NAACP would like to express its appreciation for the June 2020 decision of the Medford School Committee to erase and replace the name of Columbus from the Columbus School.

273
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:41,237
[SPEAKER_07]: The education committee agrees the Columbus cruel barbaric treatment of indigenous people disqualifies Columbus from being honored in this way.

274
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:48,943
[SPEAKER_07]: We applaud the democratic search process that has been established to find a more appropriate name for the school.

275
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:55,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Once called the Mystic School in honor of the Mystic tribe who inhabited Medford before the colonial period.

276
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:05,359
[SPEAKER_07]: The education committee also lodged the school committee for the unanimous passage of the resolution, eliminating out of school suspensions.

277
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:14,382
[SPEAKER_07]: For years, this destructive policy has disproportionately victimized black children and other children of color and special needs children.

278
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:21,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Medfit in-school alternatives and mandatory education is positive and walk of evidence of progress in the right direction.

279
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:38,167
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, we understand that there is a commitment to recruit and maintain black, indigenous, and other POC who will more accurately reflect the increasingly diverse Medford community as administrators and teachers.

280
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And the school staff have received anti-racist trainings.

281
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:47,850
[SPEAKER_07]: The success of these initiatives will improve educational quality.

282
00:16:49,648 --> 00:17:07,539
[SPEAKER_07]: While the reevaluation of the clothing code has taken a backseat to the COVID-19 crisis, we trust that the Medford School Committee will, when possible, review and revise the clothing code to avoid the discrimination black students and students of color identified at the Duggar Park rally last summer.

283
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:12,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Sincerely, Mystic Valley NAACP Education Committee.

284
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:16,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Eileen Lerner, Regina Keynes, Wendy Cliggett,

285
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:27,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Pearl Morrison, Vincent Dixon, Virga Purette, Susan Harad, Jillian Harvey, and Greg Botless.

286
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:30,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let that be read into the record.

287
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, I'd like to go to the agenda.

288
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Jim, point of information, I just wanted you to know that Kelly Shaughnessy showed up.

289
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:43,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

290
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:46,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Caitlin.

291
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:50,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

293
00:17:56,626 --> 00:18:05,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next is a resolution by Patrick McCabe.

294
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:11,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a resolution by Grace also.

295
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:15,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the two intertwine with each other, but I'll read the first one.

296
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:32,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion that the committee reduce the list of 18 nominees by starting with the lowest ranked name or names according to the rubric scoring and asking the committee if anyone would include said name in their top three to be submitted to the school committee for consideration.

297
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:39,927
[SPEAKER_07]: If no one on the committee would include said name in their top three, said name is stricken from the list.

298
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:45,692
[SPEAKER_07]: After going through this process, each committee member shall have no more than three minutes

299
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:52,287
[SPEAKER_07]: to discuss which nominee or nominees they think should be sent forward to the school committee.

300
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:59,268
[SPEAKER_07]: After each committee member presents, each committee member shall vote for one nominee.

301
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:07,811
[SPEAKER_07]: If a nominee receives 12 votes, that nominee shall be one of the committee's three recommendations to the school committee.

302
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:14,473
[SPEAKER_07]: If no nominee receives 12 votes on the first ballot, the bottom vote getters

303
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:18,933
[SPEAKER_07]: will be stricken and the committee will vote again.

304
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:23,536
[SPEAKER_07]: This process will continue until a nominee receives 12 votes.

305
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:38,624
[SPEAKER_07]: After selecting one nominee to advance, all nominees will be placed back into the pool and the committee shall repeat the process to select the second nominee and repeat a third time to select the third nominee.

306
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:41,265
[SPEAKER_07]: That's offered by Patrick McKay.

307
00:19:46,333 --> 00:20:00,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Jim, also part of Grace's resolution, I don't know, I think discussed with the mayor that she was gonna extend, she was gonna mention at the school committee to extend.

308
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,500
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct, yes, extend the timeline.

309
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:14,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm not sure all of Grace's resolution might be necessary now because you already discussed part of it with the mayor, but you can address that.

310
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:21,990
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll read Grace's also, and then we'll go back and talk about it.

311
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,451
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the table, Mr. Chair.

312
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:27,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a second on that?

313
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:28,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone second that?

314
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:29,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Or would you like me to read the next?

315
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:31,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I second it.

316
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:32,374
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

317
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion on that?

318
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions?

319
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Laura's hand.

320
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:40,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

321
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:45,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a point of clarification on the motion offered by Patrick McCabe.

322
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:52,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we are starting with the lowest ranked name, I just want to clarify that we are based.

323
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Laura, I can barely hear you.

324
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

325
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,126
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

326
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:58,486
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that?

327
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:58,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that better?

328
00:20:59,086 --> 00:20:59,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, better.

329
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:01,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

330
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:15,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to clarify when we're talking about the lowest ranked numbers that we're using the document that Susan Weiss put together that adds all of the numbers we came up with on the rubric and creates an average.

331
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:21,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the model that we're using in order to start?

332
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:21,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

333
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:27,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in terms of that, I've noticed that there are a few problems with that.

334
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:32,530
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do want to thank Susan Weiss for putting all that together with all the math she had to do.

335
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,012
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are a few problems with the rubric.

336
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's ready.

337
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:40,757
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one is that some scores are missing.

338
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:43,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed that about half of my scores are just missing.

339
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And I noticed that other people had a lot of blanks on there as well.

340
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:50,114
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe some of them didn't transfer over.

341
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:57,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondly, I think the way that we scored, some people were using zero as their lowest number.

342
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I was using a one as my lowest number.

343
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:07,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking at the rubric, which when I looked at it, I read it as saying that the options were a one, two, three, or four for each quadrant.

344
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And so my lowest number was a one.

345
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:14,940
[SPEAKER_11]: meaning that I guess it was a four, right, because there were four quadrants for each person.

346
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:24,385
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the numbers are going to be a little bit off because we weren't all sort of grading them in the same way because some people are using zero as the lowest and others were using one as the lowest.

347
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:28,768
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I just wanted to see how much if we could have a little bit more time.

348
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:31,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I didn't get through all of the public comments.

349
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:39,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I went through about 1,000 something, but I didn't get to read the ones that were handed in on paper and the ones that came in later today I did not get to read.

350
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:43,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to have some time to read those before we finish up that.

351
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

352
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was a lot.

353
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, those were three different points.

354
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:50,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

355
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:53,526
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, Jim, I don't mean to cut you off, but

356
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,721
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to, the mayor is asking for an extension, but this committee has to be prepared with the top three names by the June 7th school committee meeting.

357
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:06,742
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and we have a number of budget hearings in between.

358
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:14,483
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not, I'm just hoping we can get a lot done tonight because I don't know if you'll get another extension.

359
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:15,404
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm trying to say.

360
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:18,264
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just hoping we can get through as much as we can.

361
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:19,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

362
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:23,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace, I don't know that you have the, on the score sheet,

363
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that you have the latest one.

364
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,074
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a couple there, I think.

365
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:33,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the one I pulled, latest one had, everybody had scores across the board.

366
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that, I think some people said there was a couple of scores that didn't match what they had put.

367
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:44,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that was just put in there by error, but.

368
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Laura was right.

369
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,600
[SPEAKER_14]: The lowest number should have been one, not zero.

370
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, on that,

371
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:56,263
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, I had that on my thing here and I looked at that.

372
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:59,445
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't specifically say the lowest number had to be one.

373
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It just said a potential for a four or three.

374
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't say number had to be a one.

375
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:13,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, some people felt zero was appropriate as long as they scored everybody on their same

376
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,307
[SPEAKER_07]: theory, then all their scores should be.

377
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:23,149
[SPEAKER_15]: A point of information, rubrics don't have unstated scores.

378
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,069
[SPEAKER_15]: They're there to fully specify what the score is.

379
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:37,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So if it wasn't working, then everyone, the lowest score total should have been a four because the only option to score would have been a one.

380
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:39,312
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how rubrics work.

381
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:46,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we had gone over that in the beginning then.

382
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Melissa's hand.

383
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:53,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Melissa, would you like to speak?

384
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:55,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

385
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:59,725
[SPEAKER_01]: A point of information building off of Laura's comment of some issues with the sheet.

386
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:10,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had zero access all day to the Google Drive, so I have not been able to check my rankings, and I have not been able to look at any of the community input today.

387
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:23,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Laura, I do not feel prepared today to speak on behalf of any of the top 18 names because I have not had access to any of the information today.

388
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I did email Susan.

389
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:32,077
[SPEAKER_01]: She did say she fixed the situation and I've sent her screenshots that it still says my access is denied.

390
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:34,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Same here, Jim.

391
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the same issue.

392
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Susan was nice enough to send me a PDF of two of the

393
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:50,360
[SPEAKER_04]: the lists, but I was not able to see any of the public, the public, you know, choices, so.

394
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

395
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:55,663
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a motion on the floor.

396
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Patrick, would you like to withdraw your motion?

397
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:02,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that we could, oh, we'll have to go through this.

398
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:03,807
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

399
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:04,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

400
00:26:05,168 --> 00:26:06,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not withdrawing the motion.

401
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:12,496
[SPEAKER_03]: To the point of the rubric, the rubric's inconsequential at this point.

402
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:16,899
[SPEAKER_03]: If we went alphabetical, we could go alphabetical.

403
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:26,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said start at the bottom because I thought that the process would be quicker because less people would be likely to say that someone on the bottom of the list was one of their top three choices.

404
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:28,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think that the rubric

405
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,332
[SPEAKER_03]: has any standing at this point.

406
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:41,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the things that we take into consideration when we're forming our recommendation, but it's not the exclusive one.

407
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do not withdraw.

408
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, any more discussion?

409
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:51,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

410
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:57,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna be working off an incorrect, just a point of clarification, we're gonna be working off an incorrect rubric tonight.

411
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:09,079
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like I said, I could be open to amending the motion so that we start alphabetically.

412
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:12,360
[SPEAKER_03]: The rubric is just used as a guide.

413
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did we do it for?

414
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,261
[SPEAKER_03]: As a guide.

415
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:18,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent a lot of time on that.

416
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:24,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no access to any of the spreadsheet that contains the public input.

417
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:28,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to be able to have that information in front of me when we have this discussion.

418
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:35,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We've noticed, we've had notice, and there's a meeting here tonight to move forward.

419
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,427
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't delay this process any further.

420
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:42,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, point of information, you are- Through the chair, please.

421
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:51,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the chair, point of information, you are censoring then the information that I am being provided to make decisions with tonight, is that what I'm hearing?

422
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:57,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have access to the information, so that means that that's okay and we can move on?

423
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:01,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have access either, Jim.

424
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:06,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to understand if there was, was there anyone else that didn't have access?

425
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:11,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just random that two of us didn't have access?

426
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:20,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I also didn't have access through the chair and she did fix it though.

427
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:28,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, through the chair, it came quite late and I haven't had time to read all of them either, seeing as I was at work all day.

428
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, we're all doing the best we can.

429
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:43,567
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are giving us time and Susie and I are given time too, but there's a balancing act here and you guys are on a time limit.

430
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:44,668
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the other problem.

431
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,311
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want you to keep that in mind, that's all.

432
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:50,013
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not from me, it's from the school committee.

433
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:53,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want you to all try to keep that, you know.

434
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:59,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, for those of you who get to discuss, um, you still have a quorum.

435
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:06,709
[SPEAKER_14]: So you could still discuss without some of you discussing, um, because the meeting, you know, has been called to order.

436
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:12,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and basically is there a way to bring that sheet up on the screen?

437
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't, but I did double check with Susie.

438
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:19,471
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll see if she can do that.

439
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:21,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

440
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:23,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

441
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,581
[SPEAKER_19]: There are lots of hands up, Jim.

442
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa has been up for a while, and so has Ron.

443
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

444
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, you want to go?

445
00:29:35,204 --> 00:29:38,925
[SPEAKER_21]: I yield to Melissa just to continue her thought, and then I can speak.

446
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:40,125
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

447
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:40,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

448
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:41,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Melissa.

449
00:29:42,386 --> 00:29:43,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ron.

450
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:51,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the chair, I'd like to move to the table to resolve this access issue to make sure that we all have fair and equitable access to the information that we are being asked to review.

451
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:54,835
[SPEAKER_01]: to choose three names to put forward to the school committee.

452
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Ron, you wanna speak?

453
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:09,090
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, on Patrick's motion, I just wanna be clear that everybody understands what we voted for back the beginning of the month.

454
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:18,227
[SPEAKER_21]: The decision would be made by consensus weighing the submissions average scores average values of the rubric dimension public input and research.

455
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:22,533
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, I think the rubric has been invaluable.

456
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,100
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand the delays and if you want to delay that, that's fine.

457
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:30,063
[SPEAKER_21]: But I just want to remind everybody that we're not, this is not a rubric.

458
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:32,845
[SPEAKER_21]: The highest scoring rubric wins the top three.

459
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:37,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Patrick's proposal, the way I understand it is, he's just listing off the 18.

460
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,631
[SPEAKER_21]: If that's one of your top three, then it stays in place.

461
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:46,576
[SPEAKER_21]: If nobody wants them in the top three, we can eliminate some and hopefully that would pare down the list.

462
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:52,846
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that was the only purpose of Patrick's resolution, but just a reminder what we voted for at the beginning of May.

463
00:30:53,086 --> 00:30:53,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

464
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:54,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

465
00:30:57,693 --> 00:30:59,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim, just a quick point of clarification.

466
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:14,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not in any way, shape or form trying to delay this process, I would like to, you know, move as quickly as we can, as a matter of fact, but I have not been able to see some of this documentation.

467
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, I got a bunch of emails back and forth with Sue, we tried to work it out.

468
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and I feel horrible for her and Lisa, because

469
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:29,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what they're putting into this, and I know it's difficult for them.

470
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:31,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And frankly, it's not fair.

471
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fair to them either.

472
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But we all got to work through this together.

473
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:40,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to clarify, I'm not trying to hold this up in any way.

474
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:42,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear you.

475
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

476
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:46,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Ken and Seth.

477
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Ken, would you like to speak?

478
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:50,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I would.

479
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:52,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that Patrick's

480
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution says that we have to do this tonight.

481
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:04,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we can agree to the methodology that he puts forward.

482
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And once people have had time to review the information and resolve their access issues, we could then apply his resolution.

483
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:17,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a friendly amendment.

484
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:22,546
[SPEAKER_07]: You all right with that, Patrick?

485
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear the opinion.

486
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:32,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I agree with Ken's assessment that there is no timeline attached to that methodology.

487
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:37,136
[SPEAKER_03]: My preference would be to move forward tonight.

488
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:41,339
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the committee thinks differently, there can be two separate motions, as Ken said.

489
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:44,442
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

490
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:46,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Seth?

491
00:32:50,023 --> 00:33:06,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, I'm speaking to, I guess, Ron's original motion, which I'd like to offer a friendly amendment to move to an alphabetical instead of the ranked as Patrick mentioned, just kind of making that formal.

492
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:11,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a couple of different things going on here.

493
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:13,824
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about waiting.

494
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:19,736
[SPEAKER_07]: and letting the rest of the committee get their information and then putting Patrick's.

495
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:25,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so do we need to vote for the two thirds for tabling it then?

496
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:32,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification, the motion that I put forward does not have a timeline on it as Ken stated.

497
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can vote on this motion as far as our process without saying that we're gonna move forward with that process tonight.

498
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

499
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:46,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also be in favor of moving forward with it tonight.

500
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if we want to, I'm fine with.

501
00:33:51,084 --> 00:34:05,215
[SPEAKER_03]: But to Seth's friendly amendment, I would be in favor of removing the rubric as the method for striking names and just go alphabetical or reverse alphabetical or whatever order folks want to go in.

502
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:08,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's inconsequential to the process.

503
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we still, other people want to wait and review the information.

504
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:22,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, Mr. Chair, I'm saying that agreeing to the process and executing the process are two different things.

505
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:23,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could agree to the process.

506
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:27,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's put it in there, we're gonna agree to it, but not execute it tonight.

507
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:30,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that fair to say?

508
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather treat them as two separate motions, make it cleaner.

509
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, please.

510
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:43,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, if I could just suggest, let's just vote on Patrick's so we know what the process is going to be.

511
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:47,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we're going to, uh, Dr. Grace's, uh, resolution talks about timeline.

512
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:51,589
[SPEAKER_21]: So it seems like it's appropriate that we discuss that under her resolution.

513
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:55,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Very good.

514
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,950
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if they want to speak to the motion on the floor.

515
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,691
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Laura, Seth, your hand is still up.

516
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Melissa, your hand is still up too.

517
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:07,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, breathe it.

518
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:08,503
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, just Laura.

519
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:09,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Laura?

520
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:14,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Bree, I didn't... I just see Laura's.

521
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:14,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

522
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:23,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Just very quickly to add on my agreement that on Patrick's motion, I think it's a really good way of moving forward.

523
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:32,254
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't have to be tonight if we don't feel comfortable with that, but I would like to move on that, vote on that motion as quickly as possible so that we do have a methodology for moving forward.

524
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:34,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

525
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:38,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And did Brie, I'm sorry, did Brie have something to say and I didn't?

526
00:35:39,393 --> 00:35:39,933
[SPEAKER_18]: I did, yeah.

527
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:56,259
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just curious slash wondering, folks who didn't have access issues, Susie and Lisa, maybe just Susie in this case, what they did send over to us was read only, view only.

528
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:03,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it not possible that one of the committee members could just share the screen and then everyone is looking at the same

529
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:09,353
[SPEAKER_18]: alphabetical order or cumulative score or whatever we actually decide on?

530
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:13,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Like we can screen share.

531
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:15,155
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just asking why.

532
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,356
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information?

533
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:27,760
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we run the risk of open meeting, Laura, if we select the input that came in over the last two days and not to the 1,100 other inputs for the public to see.

534
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,022
[SPEAKER_21]: So we just need to make a decision whether, you know, I just don't think we're following the rules if we put

535
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:38,130
[SPEAKER_21]: one 10th of the inputs up for the public review and not everybody's.

536
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:43,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I meant the 18 names.

537
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't suggesting the public input.

538
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:48,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they were asking about the public input also.

539
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:50,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.

540
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,140
[SPEAKER_21]: I apologize.

541
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we vote the motion?

542
00:36:53,642 --> 00:36:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll talk about Grace's motion and we'll agree we're not gonna

543
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:09,682
[SPEAKER_07]: be reducing this list tonight because people on this committee have not had access to all the information.

544
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:14,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't agreed yet, Jim, but I think that that's probably how it's gonna go in the next motion.

545
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:18,425
[SPEAKER_03]: This motion says nothing about doing this tonight.

546
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:20,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

547
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:22,806
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

548
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:26,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a first and a second, I'll do a call a roll call.

549
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:32,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me repeat what we're, can you Patrick, what are we voting for?

550
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:32,877
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to repeat it?

551
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:34,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can, before I call the roll call?

552
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:35,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

553
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:44,480
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it there or you want me to read it?

554
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,580
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have it here.

555
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want, I guess I'll accept Seth's friendly amendment and I'll make that on the fly here.

556
00:37:53,802 --> 00:37:56,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So motion that the committee reduce the list of 18 nominees

557
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:09,593
[SPEAKER_03]: by starting alphabetically and asking the committee if anyone would include said name in their top three to be submitted to the school committee for consideration.

558
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:15,257
[SPEAKER_03]: No one on the committee would include said name in their top three, said name is stricken from the list.

559
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:25,906
[SPEAKER_03]: After going through this process, each committee member shall have no more than three minutes to discuss which nominee or nominees they think should be sent forward to the school committee.

560
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:31,367
[SPEAKER_03]: After each committee member presents, each committee member shall vote for one nominee.

561
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:40,291
[SPEAKER_03]: If a nominee receives 12 votes, that nominee is one of the three recommendations of the school committee.

562
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:46,794
[SPEAKER_03]: If no nominee receives 12 votes in the first ballot, the bottom vote getter or getters

563
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,131
[SPEAKER_03]: will be sitting and the committee will vote again.

564
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:54,472
[SPEAKER_03]: This process will continue until a nominee receives 12 votes.

565
00:38:55,413 --> 00:39:08,297
[SPEAKER_03]: After selecting one nominee to advance, all nominees will be placed back into the pool and the committee shall repeat the same process to select the second nominee and repeat a third time to select the third nominee.

566
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:11,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

567
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:13,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll call a roll call.

568
00:39:13,939 --> 00:39:15,140
[SPEAKER_07]: A yes is to accept this.

569
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Three brothers?

570
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:21,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

571
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Melissa has a hand up.

572
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of order, the vote's been called.

573
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:31,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I was raising my hand before they started.

574
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:36,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Melissa.

575
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:37,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

576
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of clarification through the chair.

577
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:42,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you please explain to me the significance of the number 12?

578
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:50,187
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 is the majority of this board.

579
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:51,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

580
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, back to the roll call.

581
00:39:59,212 --> 00:39:59,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan Puccio?

582
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:00,793
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

583
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:04,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin Genia?

584
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:10,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin?

585
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:10,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

586
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Beth Fuller?

587
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:15,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

588
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:19,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace Caldera?

589
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:23,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

590
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Ken Mallon?

591
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:29,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

592
00:40:32,326 --> 00:40:33,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Kristen Scalise?

593
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:35,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

594
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:39,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Laura Rotolo?

595
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

596
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:46,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Leila Fleur?

597
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:48,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

598
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Lewin-Tapa?

599
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:52,721
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

600
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:57,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Melissa Miguel?

601
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:00,423
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

602
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:04,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Patrick McCabe?

603
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:05,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_16]: No.

606
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:15,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Giovino?

607
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:16,129
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

608
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:19,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth Hill?

609
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy Kaye?

610
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:26,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

611
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt Habistro?

612
00:41:32,184 --> 00:41:32,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

613
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:36,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaitlyn Shaughnessy?

614
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:38,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Kaitlyn, sorry.

615
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:41,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaitlyn?

616
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:46,591
[SPEAKER_15]: She's giving a thumbs up.

617
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:47,592
[SPEAKER_15]: She's giving a thumbs up.

618
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:49,213
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yes.

619
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Janelle Gollin-McKenzie?

620
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:53,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

621
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Josie Dufour?

622
00:41:59,324 --> 00:41:59,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

623
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:03,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and I vote yes also.

624
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:11,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's five noes, four noes, five noes.

625
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:15,737
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest are yes.

626
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:16,038
[SPEAKER_07]: 17 yes.

627
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So it passes.

628
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:21,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we'll go to the next.

629
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:24,286
[SPEAKER_03]: point of order, Mr. Chair.

630
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:26,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 16.

631
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:27,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I think we have one absent.

632
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

633
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:45,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, 16.

634
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:46,678
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

635
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:47,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

636
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

637
00:42:56,522 --> 00:43:01,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Resolution for time change.

638
00:43:03,845 --> 00:43:06,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, the first one is discussion for milestone.

639
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:12,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Discussion timeline for remaining advisory committee milestones offered by Grace.

640
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Would we like to discuss the remaining?

641
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read the whole thing here, the resolution for time change.

642
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:30,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're two separate things, but they do in fact kind of go together, figuring out what timeline, what we need to do in the timeline.

643
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:40,942
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we, as a committee in our charter, if we need more time, we have to actually vote on it to send that request to the school committee.

644
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:42,542
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wrote that up too.

645
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:43,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

646
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:50,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Resolution for the time, be it so resolved that the advisory committee

647
00:43:57,212 --> 00:43:59,893
[SPEAKER_07]: recommends a timeline change to the school committee.

648
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:14,598
[SPEAKER_07]: The advisory committee recommends delaying the presentation of its recommendations for the new name or names of the Columbus Elementary School to a date of the school committee's choosing anytime after June 4th, 2021.

649
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:24,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it further resolved that the chair of his designee provide the following update at the May 24th school committee meeting.

650
00:44:25,673 --> 00:44:42,437
[SPEAKER_07]: The Columbus elementary school renaming advisory committee has met three times since formation on April 26 2021 and has completed several key milestones outlined now a chart specifically establishing criteria to weigh the relative strength of submissions.

651
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:57,154
[SPEAKER_07]: that includes factors such as potential for the name to bring the community together, the ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and the name as a representation of Medford's community's proud history.

652
00:44:57,174 --> 00:45:00,037
[SPEAKER_07]: 21 yay, one nay, one absent.

653
00:45:00,057 --> 00:45:06,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, the advisory committee has narrowed the field of names under consideration down to 18.

654
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:20,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, issuing one public input survey to solicit feedback on the options we are considering as a committee, 22 yay, zero nay, one absent.

655
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:35,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, the advisory committee has finished collecting feedback from the public input survey and is making every effort to complete the vetting process and narrowing the field up to three names in a timely fashion.

656
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,328
[SPEAKER_07]: The advisory committee has made good progress since our formation four weeks ago.

657
00:45:42,428 --> 00:45:48,894
[SPEAKER_07]: We require additional time to deliberate before the field is narrowed up to three names, preferably by consensus.

658
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:56,921
[SPEAKER_07]: The advisory committee has approved this update by majority and hereby recommends to change the timeline for selection.

659
00:45:57,581 --> 00:46:01,564
[SPEAKER_07]: The advisory committee expects to complete its work no later than June 4th, 2021.

660
00:46:03,538 --> 00:46:08,861
[SPEAKER_07]: and is prepared to provide its recommendation at a subsequent meeting of the school committee choosing.

661
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:16,644
[SPEAKER_07]: We respectfully submit this request for your approval in the event the school committee declines to approve this request.

662
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:25,849
[SPEAKER_07]: The advisory committee must regretfully decline to recommend any names as we have not narrowed the field down to three by the majority vote.

663
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:43,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so Jim, I think part of that's been taken care of just by virtue of the mayor is gonna be bringing it up on Monday at the school committee meeting to request.

664
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:45,892
[SPEAKER_15]: We actually have to vote on this.

665
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:47,772
[SPEAKER_21]: I second the motion.

666
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:58,677
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't, they won't like just given the charter that we were given, it says that us as a committee, we need to vote on allowing the extension

667
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,818
[SPEAKER_15]: before it can be brought forth to the school committee.

668
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:15,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I think it's great that they have heads up, but we formally need to do this vote in order to get that extension, which is why I made this resolution and I drafted language for what we can do to update it.

669
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:24,286
[SPEAKER_15]: We can amend the language if need be, but I just wanted to have something ready for us to have to do in compliance with our charter.

670
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:26,987
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, the motion has been seconded.

671
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:28,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any more discussion?

672
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:29,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, do I see your hand?

673
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:31,969
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, sir.

674
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,650
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a couple of comments to make.

675
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:39,934
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, you know, this committee is being characterized as, you know, let's rush to the goal line here.

676
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:44,157
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking at the calendar based on the fact that some people still need data.

677
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:48,240
[SPEAKER_21]: So today is May 21st, May 20th.

678
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,102
[SPEAKER_21]: You need at least 48 hours before you can call the next meeting.

679
00:47:52,242 --> 00:47:56,465
[SPEAKER_21]: So that brings us to the 22nd or more than likely next week.

680
00:47:57,455 --> 00:48:02,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Then the vote is taken on the 24th, and it's not gonna be a five minute vote.

681
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,303
[SPEAKER_21]: After that, we have presentations to prepare.

682
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:16,091
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we think that June 4th, and I make this comment, this decision to rename the school was done in June of 2020.

683
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:35,618
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we're not allowed that the charter that we received said we have until July 31 2021 to present the fact that we're being rushed to June 7, I think is inappropriate, it has a chance to force everybody to rush through this and I think we're looking at.

684
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,680
[SPEAKER_21]: the 14th, you know, a little bit more extension.

685
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:54,689
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand the mayor has, you know, we've got a goal here, but the original charge was July 31st, and I'm looking at the calendar with this new lack of data we've just extended, and we're going to be rushing to get a quality presentation done, and I for one

686
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:58,211
[SPEAKER_21]: think that we need to appeal for a longer date.

687
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:10,620
[SPEAKER_21]: And my other comment is, I'm not so sure that all this work, I appreciate Dr. Grace's negotiating skills for sure, but I don't want to dump this data that we have because we're not getting our way.

688
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:18,607
[SPEAKER_21]: There's got to be something, you know, to say we're not going to submit a name, I think we can work it so that we come up with a, you know,

689
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:22,889
[SPEAKER_21]: a non-threatening way of saying, hey guys, you gotta work with us.

690
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:25,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Give us the 14th, the 17th, whatever it is.

691
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:32,555
[SPEAKER_21]: But to say, I'm not gonna support the, let's dump all this data and we're not gonna do anything if we don't get our way.

692
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:34,456
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are my comments, thanks.

693
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:37,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but July 31st is the absolute last day.

694
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:43,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that the school committee intended for the committee to meet or discuss until July 31st.

695
00:49:45,293 --> 00:49:48,835
[SPEAKER_14]: because at that point, the school committee said that they would take it and run with it.

696
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:56,539
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel that initially, I guess the committee was supposed to present at the meeting on the 24th.

697
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess they're expecting on the seventh.

698
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,461
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I don't know if we have one or two meetings left.

699
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Just point of information.

700
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:08,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate what you're saying, Lisa, I really do.

701
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:14,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Article 14 of the resolution from the school committee said if a majority of the advisory committee

702
00:50:14,922 --> 00:50:18,805
[SPEAKER_21]: votes to recommend a timeline change to the school committee, they may do so.

703
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:22,947
[SPEAKER_21]: At that time, the school committee will vote to approve or decline this recommendation.

704
00:50:23,007 --> 00:50:24,208
[SPEAKER_21]: So they certainly have every right.

705
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:27,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Timeline changes shall not exceed a final date of July 31st.

706
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:31,353
[SPEAKER_21]: I honestly, we've waited since June of 2020.

707
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:36,056
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't understand what happens between June 4th and July 31st.

708
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:39,237
[SPEAKER_21]: that this can't be delayed.

709
00:50:41,098 --> 00:50:53,966
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I can speak on the timeline presented, it was to give us some extended time since we were and are supposed to give them something by the 24th.

710
00:50:54,407 --> 00:51:03,953
[SPEAKER_15]: And very clearly, given the fact that people seem to be having issues with getting the drive, getting into the drive and seeing things, we need some sort of extension.

711
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:18,695
[SPEAKER_15]: The dates that were picked were to extend it out a couple of weeks in order to make that seem like a more reasonable request for the school committee as they are trying to, you know, get it done.

712
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:31,254
[SPEAKER_15]: And also it allows us to have another, like we would have another option to then submit another request to extend it out, right?

713
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:35,337
[SPEAKER_15]: This doesn't have to be the end all be all of this timeline.

714
00:51:35,457 --> 00:51:46,165
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a starting point to get us there that seems like it would be reasonable that the school committee might be amenable to and give us that extension.

715
00:51:46,305 --> 00:51:47,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a rather

716
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:56,894
[SPEAKER_15]: bold and tough call to try and get that extension all the way through July.

717
00:51:57,874 --> 00:52:06,621
[SPEAKER_15]: But if we can do this in little increments and say that we are making progress and show that we are making progress through this, they may be more likely to do so.

718
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:21,496
[SPEAKER_15]: I am open to, I know you did, there was a statement made about the language at the bottom saying, you know, they are

719
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:48,419
[SPEAKER_15]: opposed to the extension that we would then just decline to recommend any names, we can talk about maybe other options to put there if that is something or point of contention to this that may be more amenable to other people that we can vote on to add for takeaway to this resolution.

720
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:50,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

721
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:53,632
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I see a lot of hands raised.

722
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:58,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Kristen Scalise, would you like to speak?

723
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:18,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just wondering, I agree that we need an extension, but I didn't know what the timeline would be for, or if we have any idea of what the timeline would be to fix these tech errors, because I am uncomfortable

724
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:27,984
[SPEAKER_00]: naming a date that's sooner rather than later when there are members of the committee who can't access the data.

725
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's okay.

726
00:53:30,805 --> 00:53:35,067
[SPEAKER_00]: This data has been, there's so much of it, there's so much to get through.

727
00:53:35,187 --> 00:53:39,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been treating it very seriously and reading literally everything.

728
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:45,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody on this committee has that right and the duty to do that.

729
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:53,994
[SPEAKER_00]: know if it's possible to get clarification from anyone in the, you know, the tech support arena, but I think

730
00:53:55,406 --> 00:54:02,750
[SPEAKER_00]: before I could pick a date or vote on a date, I don't get to pick, everybody needs to have access.

731
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:06,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just- I just reset the link to everybody.

732
00:54:06,532 --> 00:54:11,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you can't open it, then you need to let Susie know in the morning.

733
00:54:11,055 --> 00:54:13,877
[SPEAKER_14]: See, Susie gave everyone till five o'clock today to get to her.

734
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:19,280
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that was the problem because she did give everyone a five o'clock.

735
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,121
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're having a problem, let her know.

736
00:54:21,741 --> 00:54:26,624
[SPEAKER_14]: So no, she didn't get any of the people that have said that they've had a problem.

737
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,745
[SPEAKER_14]: So now I just resent the link.

738
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:34,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you cannot access, you need to let her know ASAP in the morning, okay?

739
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:41,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Because worst case, you might even have to pick them up, because she has Xeroxed a number of them just for the file.

740
00:54:42,193 --> 00:54:47,196
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that becomes the worst case, well, that might be the answer.

741
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:59,155
[SPEAKER_14]: I know people don't like paper today, but I'm just saying, if in fact you really can't open it for whatever purpose, you know, we may have to get a packet to you.

742
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:03,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate how much work you guys are doing.

743
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:05,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that again.

744
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:12,644
[SPEAKER_14]: If you just let us know as soon as possible, because if we do have to drop it off, we'd rather do it earlier tomorrow than, you know, later in the day.

745
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:13,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

746
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:14,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let us know.

747
00:55:14,665 --> 00:55:15,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

748
00:55:16,186 --> 00:55:18,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's something that can be resolved pretty quick.

749
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:21,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they can take care of it tomorrow.

750
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:25,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see.

751
00:55:26,712 --> 00:55:27,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace, would you like to speak?

752
00:55:27,913 --> 00:55:28,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have your hand up?

753
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:31,956
[SPEAKER_15]: No, sorry.

754
00:55:32,016 --> 00:55:33,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I just forgot to put it down.

755
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:33,937
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

756
00:55:34,357 --> 00:55:36,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth, do you still have your hand up?

757
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

758
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

759
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:43,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So a few things.

760
00:55:46,002 --> 00:55:56,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is important to consider the spirit of the original charter of the committee.

761
00:55:56,704 --> 00:56:09,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, while we do have an ability to push it out as far as a drop dead date of July 31st, the rest of the charter

762
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:17,527
[SPEAKER_05]: a few days.

763
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:27,812
[SPEAKER_05]: As I stated on our first meeting, one of the primary reasons for me to join this group is my daughter, who's a fifth grader.

764
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:34,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still love to have a new name by the time that she's done with school.

765
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:39,317
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be an important milestone for me.

766
00:56:39,638 --> 00:56:44,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it would be something that the

767
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:47,968
[SPEAKER_05]: advisory committee should work towards.

768
00:56:52,532 --> 00:57:08,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I also wanted to make sure that because of what we voted on last week, we did have a time delineated public feedback

769
00:57:20,027 --> 00:57:24,428
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, new, uh, responses coming in.

770
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:28,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I just, I don't know whether or not that's the case.

771
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:29,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how it was set up.

772
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:35,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but if it wasn't set up that way, we do need to, uh, to shut that off.

773
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:41,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, not out of disrespect to anyone, but just because it was three o'clock today.

774
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:41,571
[SPEAKER_14]: That was it.

775
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:42,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

776
00:57:42,411 --> 00:57:42,771
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

777
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:44,511
Perfect.

778
00:57:45,251 --> 00:57:45,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

779
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:46,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

780
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:47,312
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

781
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:48,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Patrick.

782
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:49,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to speak?

783
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:54,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick?

784
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:57,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to unmute.

785
00:57:58,035 --> 00:57:58,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

786
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:02,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, you know, there's two recommendations.

787
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:11,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one is the potential for us just to have paper copies for people who are having technology problems and then the other

788
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:16,353
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, recommendation is that perhaps we meet two times next week.

789
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:24,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we, we, you know, we delayed this meeting till tonight because we wanted to have the public input.

790
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:29,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're not considering the public input tonight, we could have met, you know, earlier in the week.

791
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:38,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, so I, I think we should meet probably two days next week to meet our, you know, to meet our deadline.

792
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:42,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this motion is to request to extend the deadline.

793
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:44,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

794
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:47,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion on the floor is to ask for another one.

795
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:50,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, but I'm just saying we should meet twice.

796
00:58:50,682 --> 00:58:56,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the deadline that I'm talking about is the new deadline that's been offered up here, right?

797
00:58:56,964 --> 00:59:02,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So the new deadline that Grace offered, people are saying that it's difficult to even meet that deadline.

798
00:59:03,366 --> 00:59:09,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think what Grace said was that if we get to that and we still aren't ready, we could ask for another extension.

799
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:17,184
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think that we can vote on her resolution as it is with that date in it.

800
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:20,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And then hopefully we can meet that date.

801
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:29,249
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, we'll request another extension, but I think we can move ahead with what she's put forward.

802
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, do you have anything else on that?

803
00:59:37,227 --> 00:59:38,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's it.

804
00:59:38,947 --> 00:59:40,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.

805
00:59:40,428 --> 00:59:41,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the motion that she's talking about.

806
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:45,009
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm saying is there's nothing that says we can only meet one day a week.

807
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:46,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

808
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Maria and then Ryan, Jim.

809
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:52,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Maria.

810
00:59:54,312 --> 00:59:57,733
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to reiterate some of the things that have already been said.

811
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:02,094
[SPEAKER_12]: We very obviously need an extension.

812
01:00:02,254 --> 01:00:03,735
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no debate about that.

813
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:19,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that Grace's or Dr. Caldera's resolution is a great middle ground in the sense that yes, if we work hard, meet multiple times next week in order to meet that, then

814
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,811
[SPEAKER_12]: we might even be able to meet that deadline.

815
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:27,672
[SPEAKER_12]: But if not, then it's perfectly reasonable to ask for another extension.

816
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:43,736
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we're already stepping into this with the idea of, oh, July 31st, then that just, to me, feels like stalling, feels like pushing this way beyond what it needs to be.

817
01:00:44,856 --> 01:00:49,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, this is a serious decision that requires serious deliberation, but

818
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:56,382
[SPEAKER_12]: This is also not something that should be taking months upon months upon months.

819
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,764
[SPEAKER_12]: So I definitely agree.

820
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:03,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we should be asking for this extension.

821
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:10,070
[SPEAKER_12]: And we should not be going into this with the idea of automatically getting another one.

822
01:01:10,578 --> 01:01:24,624
[SPEAKER_12]: just simply having that as an option open in case we're not able to, in good faith, doing the work necessary, reach our conclusion by that deadline.

823
01:01:25,365 --> 01:01:25,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

824
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:26,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

825
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:30,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, would you like to speak?

826
01:01:30,802 --> 01:01:32,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I have a couple of points.

827
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:38,543
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, it's easy to download that file if the admin at the school could download it and send it to everybody.

828
01:01:38,923 --> 01:01:40,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like an easy solution.

829
01:01:41,704 --> 01:01:44,624
[SPEAKER_21]: My comment had nothing to do with July 31st.

830
01:01:44,684 --> 01:01:48,425
[SPEAKER_21]: I was reading from the resolution that we received from the school committee.

831
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:55,486
[SPEAKER_21]: I also would ask Dr. Grace, specifically, it says choosing any time after June 4th.

832
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it possible that we can hone in on an exact date

833
01:02:02,905 --> 01:02:04,086
[SPEAKER_21]: would you be amenable to?

834
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:06,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Possibly.

835
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:14,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think it has to, it would have to coincide with what the school committee has scheduled.

836
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

837
01:02:16,531 --> 01:02:20,773
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I don't know if anybody has, can pull up a calendar.

838
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:21,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

839
01:02:22,454 --> 01:02:22,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

840
01:02:22,794 --> 01:02:23,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Earlier.

841
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,795
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's one, maybe.

842
01:02:24,835 --> 01:02:26,215
[SPEAKER_15]: The seventh.

843
01:02:26,315 --> 01:02:28,757
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one on the seventh and another one maybe on the 14th.

844
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:31,958
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, the fourth was picked because the next one's on the

845
01:02:32,528 --> 01:02:36,329
[SPEAKER_15]: This happened, but they may have another one, I think the following week.

846
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:39,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if Lisa has any more details on that.

847
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:43,510
[SPEAKER_14]: We might have one on the 14th and then we might have another one regarding the budget.

848
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:47,851
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's something that hasn't really been etched in stone as yet.

849
01:02:48,552 --> 01:02:55,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Budget process could go up until June 3rd, depending on state, federal.

850
01:02:56,064 --> 01:03:03,850
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just back to my anticipated schedule, remembering that every open meeting we have to give 48 hours notice to the public.

851
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,012
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not like we're gonna be Tuesday and then Wednesday, I don't think.

852
01:03:08,173 --> 01:03:15,899
[SPEAKER_21]: But if we're looking at everybody gathering the data and assuming they'll have it tomorrow, we could have a meeting, I'm okay with that.

853
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think we're underestimating the length of the vote.

854
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:21,671
[SPEAKER_21]: which we haven't really gotten close to doing yet.

855
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:28,076
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do believe that Dr. Grace's next resolution is something we can work on tonight and hopefully we'll do.

856
01:03:29,337 --> 01:03:33,020
[SPEAKER_21]: But how is that, those presentations and what's the schedule?

857
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:38,465
[SPEAKER_21]: And ask Seth, what date is he talking about when he says he would like to get it done by?

858
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:39,906
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know what date the school ends.

859
01:03:39,926 --> 01:03:44,810
[SPEAKER_14]: School ends June 18th, last day of school.

860
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,672
[SPEAKER_21]: June 18th?

861
01:03:49,251 --> 01:03:50,772
[SPEAKER_14]: June 18th is the last day of school.

862
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:51,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, June 18th.

863
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anybody else with their hand up?

864
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:00,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I see two hands.

865
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:01,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they still up?

866
01:04:01,455 --> 01:04:04,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Patrick, you got something else to say?

867
01:04:09,537 --> 01:04:10,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin, would you like to say something?

868
01:04:12,258 --> 01:04:12,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

869
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to follow up on Grace, your point about the

870
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:22,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Last part of your resolution.

871
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:37,398
[SPEAKER_09]: In the event that the school committee declines to approve this request, the advisory committee must regretfully decline to recommend any names as we have not narrowed the field down to three by majority vote.

872
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:45,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering what you might put instead of that, what you're referring to,

873
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:51,799
[SPEAKER_09]: and what your reasoning is behind this part of the resolution?

874
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:54,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

875
01:04:55,042 --> 01:05:02,729
[SPEAKER_15]: So the school committee said they wanted up to three names or else if we don't give it to them, they'll just pick names.

876
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:10,256
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I have no other alternatives in mind.

877
01:05:11,418 --> 01:05:26,034
[SPEAKER_15]: which is why it's stated as is, because if we haven't narrowed it down to three names and they decline, then I'm not entirely sure what we can give them other than maybe give them what we have already compiled.

878
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:26,775
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't...

879
01:05:29,688 --> 01:05:43,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, hence the way it's worded as is, but if anybody has other great ideas on what would be a good substitute, I'm open to hearing them and talking through them and figuring something out that would work.

880
01:05:44,216 --> 01:05:48,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we just strike that part of it?

881
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:58,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just seems like if we've done all of this work and then if they don't approve that, then we'll just

882
01:05:59,928 --> 01:06:02,349
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the work we've done will not go towards.

883
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:09,493
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, yeah, we can remove it.

884
01:06:10,754 --> 01:06:16,837
[SPEAKER_15]: If they say no, they say no, and I think it's out of our hands.

885
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:23,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really know what happens if they say no, but yeah.

886
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:25,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you.

887
01:06:26,602 --> 01:06:28,943
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have one quick suggestion for Dr. Grace.

888
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:40,698
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with you 100%, but I would suggest that we put in there that we would have to reevaluate our options up to and including not submitting any names.

889
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:46,261
[SPEAKER_21]: That gives us a little bit of an opening, not necessarily a strong threat, but it does let them know that we're mean business.

890
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:52,024
[SPEAKER_21]: And I am definitely against sending all this data that we've collected to the school committee unvetted.

891
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:56,267
[SPEAKER_21]: I would be very much against doing that.

892
01:06:56,287 --> 01:06:57,748
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't make sense to me.

893
01:06:59,302 --> 01:06:59,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

894
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:04,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you say that again so that I can just break that down?

895
01:07:04,804 --> 01:07:07,524
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope so.

896
01:07:07,544 --> 01:07:19,688
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just say, if you decline to change the timeline, we will have to examine all our options, including up to declining to submit any name.

897
01:07:20,448 --> 01:07:22,968
[SPEAKER_21]: That gives us a little bit of a softer approach to that.

898
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:27,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you get that, anyone?

899
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Something like that.

900
01:07:29,835 --> 01:07:30,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

901
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:34,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's a friendly amendment and right.

902
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:42,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I see a couple more hands, Seth, were you waiting to talk was Thank you.

903
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:45,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I was.

904
01:07:58,444 --> 01:08:00,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.

905
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep my hand up or perhaps come back to me, I'm sorry.

906
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:05,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

907
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:08,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anybody else?

908
01:08:11,227 --> 01:08:11,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

909
01:08:12,427 --> 01:08:13,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything, Seth?

910
01:08:13,987 --> 01:08:19,028
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna, I guess we'll go back over the date and then we'll move this motion.

911
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been moved and seconded, we'll vote on it.

912
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:26,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanna pull the date up that we're,

913
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:34,233
[SPEAKER_07]: One second.

914
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Choosing a date anytime after June 4th.

915
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:42,955
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you have your.

916
01:08:42,975 --> 01:08:49,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I, it was just a point of information or I apologize.

917
01:08:49,236 --> 01:08:49,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.

918
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:57,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So just from my interpretation of the

919
01:08:58,577 --> 01:08:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: of our charter.

920
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:04,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna read the final selection of the new names directly from the charter.

921
01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:24,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the Medford School Committee has received the names and presentation, the committee will vote either that evening or at a subsequent meeting not later than June 7th, 2021 to approve the recommendation, given the authority for naming of the public school buildings, the school committee's authority alone per Massachusetts General Law.

922
01:09:26,836 --> 01:09:26,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

923
01:09:29,394 --> 01:09:32,945
[SPEAKER_05]: while we are making recommendations and they did.

924
01:09:50,244 --> 01:09:50,825
[SPEAKER_05]: if that happened.

925
01:09:51,806 --> 01:10:05,899
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I understand from the advisory committee's charter, and I'm sure a school committee member might correct me if I'm wrong, but we are under their authority.

926
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:07,060
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the authority.

927
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:15,107
[SPEAKER_05]: We are making and we are advising them, but they could choose a name tomorrow.

928
01:10:18,379 --> 01:10:23,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I believe the motion, I mean, the resolution is making a request to them for extension.

929
01:10:25,561 --> 01:10:31,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so let me, I got one more hand, Patrick, I think, and then we're going to vote on this.

930
01:10:33,303 --> 01:10:35,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I also want to add to Seth's.

931
01:10:39,605 --> 01:10:49,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, point of information that you just added in the charge does say that the school committee shall let select their name by June 7th or the, or the meeting thereafter.

932
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:55,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, their, their intention, I believe is to have this done by June 14th.

933
01:10:55,641 --> 01:11:00,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, sooner we can get this done, the better.

934
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

935
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,207
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information just before we move on.

936
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:13,914
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a conflict between item number 14 and the final statement, so I'm not quibbling over this.

937
01:11:14,134 --> 01:11:18,097
[SPEAKER_21]: We all know the school committee has the power, and I said that.

938
01:11:18,837 --> 01:11:28,165
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just looking for a date that we can all agree we will present a quality process to the school committee, which I believe is in the best interest of the city.

939
01:11:29,406 --> 01:11:29,726
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all.

940
01:11:30,326 --> 01:11:30,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

941
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:31,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

942
01:11:32,686 --> 01:11:34,747
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a request for an extension here now.

943
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:39,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go through a roll call three brothers.

944
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:41,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

945
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan Puccio.

946
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:45,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

947
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:49,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you, can you read it, read out what we're voting on again?

948
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:52,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there was a friendly amendment and I'm not sure what we're voting on.

949
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:53,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace.

950
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:54,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

951
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:55,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Could I have you read it for me?

952
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:03,990
[SPEAKER_08]: You're muted, Grace.

953
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:16,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Grace, we can't hear you.

954
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:17,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Grace is muted.

955
01:12:17,615 --> 01:12:19,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, thought I hit it.

956
01:12:21,116 --> 01:12:28,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so the resolution is be it so resolved that the advisory committee recommends a timeline change to the school committee.

957
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:32,840
[SPEAKER_15]: The advisory committee recommends delaying the presentation of its

958
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:44,676
[SPEAKER_15]: recommendations for the new name or names of the Columbus elementary school to a date of the committee's choosing any time after June 4th, 2021.

959
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:53,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it further resolved that the chair or his designee provide the following update at the May 24th school committee meeting.

960
01:12:54,594 --> 01:13:08,042
[SPEAKER_15]: The Columbus Elementary School Renaming Advisory Committee has met three times since our formation on April 26, 2021, and has completed several key milestones outlined in our charter.

961
01:13:08,422 --> 01:13:18,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Specifically one, establishing criteria to weigh the relative strength of submissions that include factors such as the potential for the name to bring the community together,

962
01:13:19,248 --> 01:13:28,896
[SPEAKER_15]: The ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students and the name as a representation of the Medford community's proud history.

963
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:32,358
[SPEAKER_15]: 21 yay, one nay, one absent.

964
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:38,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Two, the advisory committee has narrowed the field of names under consideration down to 18.

965
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:47,907
[SPEAKER_15]: three, issuing one public input survey to solicit feedback on the options that we are considering as a committee.

966
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:50,068
[SPEAKER_15]: 22 yay, zero nay, one absent.

967
01:13:52,502 --> 01:14:06,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Additionally, the advisory committee has finished collecting feedback from the public input survey and is making every effort to complete the vetting process and narrowing the field up to three names in a timely fashion.

968
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:11,209
[SPEAKER_15]: The advisory committee has made good progress since our formation four weeks ago.

969
01:14:11,749 --> 01:14:18,132
[SPEAKER_15]: We require additional time to deliberate before the field is narrowed up to three names, preferably by consensus.

970
01:14:19,236 --> 01:14:27,722
[SPEAKER_15]: The advisory committee has approved this update by a majority vote and hereby recommends to change the timeline for selection.

971
01:14:28,563 --> 01:14:40,832
[SPEAKER_15]: The advisory committee expects to complete its work no later than June 4th, 2021, and is prepared to provide its recommendation at a subsequent meeting of the school committee's choosing.

972
01:14:41,793 --> 01:14:44,535
[SPEAKER_15]: We respectfully submit this request for your approval.

973
01:14:45,486 --> 01:14:57,716
[SPEAKER_15]: In the event that the school committee declines to approve this request, the advisory committee will have to examine all of our options up to declining submitting any needs.

974
01:15:02,379 --> 01:15:02,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

975
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:07,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin Genia.

976
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:11,366

01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:14,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Beth Fuller.

978
01:15:15,447 --> 01:15:15,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

979
01:15:17,869 --> 01:15:18,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace Caldera.

980
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:19,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

981
01:15:22,112 --> 01:15:22,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Ken Mallon.

982
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:23,653

[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:32,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Laura Rotolo.

986
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

987
01:15:36,923 --> 01:15:37,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Leila Fleur.

988
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:40,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

989
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:43,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Lou Wintarpa.

990
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:44,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

991
01:15:47,371 --> 01:15:48,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria Rosha.

992
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:49,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

993
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:55,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Melissa Miguel.

994
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:56,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

01:15:58,576 --> 01:15:59,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Patrick McCabe.

996
01:16:00,037 --> 01:16:00,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

997
01:16:01,938 --> 01:16:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul Donato.

998
01:16:03,419 --> 01:16:03,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

999
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:06,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Givino.

1000
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:07,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Seth Hill.

1002
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:11,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1003
01:16:14,484 --> 01:16:15,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy Kay.

1004
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:16,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1005
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:19,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt have a stroke.

[SPEAKER_07]: Caitlin Shaughnessy.

1008
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:29,096
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a thumbs up.

1009
01:16:29,156 --> 01:16:30,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't might not seeing it.

1010
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:34,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Caitlin, anybody.

1011
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:38,724
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, yes.

1012
01:16:39,404 --> 01:16:39,705
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1013
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:40,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1014
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:45,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Janelle Garland McKenzie.

1015
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:45,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1016
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:50,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Josie DeFulla.

1017
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:51,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1018
01:16:53,394 --> 01:16:54,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And the chair, yes.

1019
01:16:55,155 --> 01:16:56,096
[SPEAKER_07]: 22 in the affirmative.

1020
01:16:57,236 --> 01:16:57,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Passes.

1021
01:17:00,018 --> 01:17:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1022
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:16,870
[SPEAKER_07]: The next on resolution offered by Grace also, be it so resolved that the advisory committee establish a seven member subcommittee

1023
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,503
[SPEAKER_07]: to draft the presentation to the school committee explaining the advisory committee's three recommended names.

1024
01:17:23,523 --> 01:17:28,586
[SPEAKER_07]: The process by which the recommendations were arrived at and why the selected names were chosen.

1025
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:40,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Subcommittee shall provide a draft of the presentation for advisory committee approval during the final meeting of the advisory committee prior to the school committee presentation.

1026
01:17:42,535 --> 01:17:45,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I get a second on that so we can discuss it?

1027
01:17:47,682 --> 01:17:48,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, any discussion now?

1028
01:17:49,889 --> 01:18:00,351
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say I brought this resolution forward so that we can ensure that our final presentation to the school committee reflects the many perspectives of our committee members.

1029
01:18:01,091 --> 01:18:08,313
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would be impractical for us to create the presentation from a blank slate in a single meeting with the whole advisory committee.

1030
01:18:09,193 --> 01:18:18,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So delegating this to representative subcommittee allows us to reflect on the perspectives while still allowing the whole advisory committee the opportunity

1031
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:36,103
[SPEAKER_15]: to weigh in on the presentation prior to being shared with the school committee and with the formation of the subcommittee now, they can go ahead and start some of that intro work of being able to describe what we've already done so that we can have this kind of concurrent process going on as we narrow the names down.

1032
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:40,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1033
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:43,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more discussion, Kathy Kaye?

1034
01:18:46,669 --> 01:18:56,936
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to ask the question because it was brought up last week and I'm not sure if this is something that's supposed to be a resolution or it's more of a question for me, but I don't know how to proceed quite honestly.

1035
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:06,782
[SPEAKER_19]: It was brought up that the children should have some input in the names and I had said 18 was just way too many for them and I just don't know where we're lying on that.

1036
01:19:10,065 --> 01:19:10,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.

1037
01:19:14,808 --> 01:19:32,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we were going to, well, I thought this meeting you were narrowing down to three and then Kathy, we were gonna give you just a small little couple of lines about each of the top three where the students could vote, whoever, whatever students want to participate, of course.

1038
01:19:33,514 --> 01:19:34,094
[SPEAKER_22]: That's correct.

1039
01:19:34,634 --> 01:19:35,234
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be fine.

1040
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:39,676
[SPEAKER_19]: I just didn't know if it's something we had firmly agreed upon or it was still under discussion.

1041
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:45,612
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what we had talked about doing, but it doesn't seem like we're going to have that list for you tonight.

1042
01:19:45,692 --> 01:19:48,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's further discussion.

1043
01:19:50,054 --> 01:19:50,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, would you like to?

1044
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:54,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, if I could, I have a couple of thoughts.

1045
01:19:54,315 --> 01:19:58,437
[SPEAKER_21]: First to Kathy.

1046
01:19:58,757 --> 01:19:59,638
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that

1047
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:05,670
[SPEAKER_21]: I've asked for valued input from the students for sure.

1048
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:11,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe my suggestion here will include what can be good for you.

1049
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:15,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Dr. Grace, I agree we need to start planning for this.

1050
01:20:15,116 --> 01:20:16,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's my thoughts on it.

1051
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:24,963
[SPEAKER_21]: My thoughts are that part of Patrick's process is going to be that each one of us will give a three minute presentation if we want on a particular name.

1052
01:20:25,815 --> 01:20:46,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead of seven people creating three name deliberation on what to present, my suggestion is that after we have selected the top three, we then vote for two people per name to collaborate to form a presentation of the initial draft for each name.

1053
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:57,689
[SPEAKER_21]: That gives us six members, and I strongly believe that when we're talking about process and who will present process, I think the chairman should be having that role, and he should be the seventh member.

1054
01:20:58,509 --> 01:21:08,653
[SPEAKER_21]: I suggest that in living on the edge, I would love to see us meet in the city hall chamber, but I know that that may be too much to ask for, but to face to face.

1055
01:21:08,713 --> 01:21:14,355
[SPEAKER_21]: But my thought is that if we all have a passion on number one, those are the people that should present.

1056
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:19,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Once we present in the group of seven, everybody gets to read the presentation.

1057
01:21:21,036 --> 01:21:25,278
[SPEAKER_21]: and everybody will have a session of making edits, things you don't like that we need to change.

1058
01:21:25,878 --> 01:21:29,780
[SPEAKER_21]: That gives everybody an opportunity, but I think it keeps us focused on timelines.

1059
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:38,084
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm only focused on the one I'm selected on, and then I'll pass that out as opposed to I have to watch three names that I may have interest or may not.

1060
01:21:38,624 --> 01:21:47,408
[SPEAKER_21]: To the point of Principal Kaye, I think that once the committee gives its final presentation, those documents,

1061
01:21:47,728 --> 01:21:52,031
[SPEAKER_21]: can be given to the school, and the final choice is made by the school committee.

1062
01:21:52,471 --> 01:22:11,702
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can, you, I just don't, I'm not crazy about the idea of this committee sanctioning a survey of the students, but certainly I think it's very valuable, and I would suggest that we take our presentation, you give it, present it in any way you want to the students, and that data can be given to the school committee who have the ultimate say.

1063
01:22:11,863 --> 01:22:13,263
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are my suggestions.

1064
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,525
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that's a lot going on there, but I think

1065
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:20,029
[SPEAKER_21]: just gets us more focused and a quicker timeline.

1066
01:22:20,429 --> 01:22:25,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Those with passions about a name get to write the presentation and everybody else gets to edit it.

1067
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,110
[SPEAKER_21]: That's my thought.

1068
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:39,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information just that there we can't just focus just on the names in that presentation because the school committee did in fact request that we also include the process that it took for us to get to those names.

1069
01:22:40,393 --> 01:22:47,236
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we need to make sure that it's a holistic presentation, and we can point of point of information.

1070
01:22:48,077 --> 01:22:53,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Dr. Grace, I did mention that I think the chairman should be in charge of writing that

1071
01:22:54,213 --> 01:22:57,794
[SPEAKER_21]: portion of the presentation, which we can all edit after that to our liking.

1072
01:22:57,814 --> 01:22:59,654
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, I didn't ignore that piece.

1073
01:22:59,694 --> 01:23:01,875
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a big piece of their charges.

1074
01:23:02,195 --> 01:23:03,015
[SPEAKER_21]: How did we do this?

1075
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:03,935
[SPEAKER_21]: What was involved?

1076
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:10,357
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the chairman preferably should be, you know, leading the way for us and we can edit his as well.

1077
01:23:10,377 --> 01:23:17,579
[SPEAKER_21]: But putting Jim in charge of that piece and three other people, you know, have a vote of two people per name just seems to me more efficient.

1078
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:20,399
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're not in a seven person debate for each name.

1079
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:21,960
[SPEAKER_21]: That was my point.

1080
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:22,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1081
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody has to keep in mind the last day of school is June 18.

1082
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:31,047
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last couple of days, a lot of the kids don't, you know, really need to show up.

1083
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:34,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I shouldn't speak for elementary, I'm more of a middle or high school.

1084
01:23:36,351 --> 01:23:39,433
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm just saying so that the timeline is very tight.

1085
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:41,135
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to show up for us.

1086
01:23:42,776 --> 01:23:43,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they do.

1087
01:23:43,557 --> 01:23:44,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Cass.

1088
01:23:46,059 --> 01:23:46,960
[SPEAKER_14]: But still, it's tight.

1089
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Timeline's tight.

1090
01:23:49,642 --> 01:23:49,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1091
01:23:51,788 --> 01:23:52,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick, would you like to speak?

1092
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:54,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1093
01:23:56,150 --> 01:24:04,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So under the original resolution establishing this committee, I don't think this group has the authority.

1094
01:24:04,115 --> 01:24:08,898
[SPEAKER_03]: If Principal Kaye wants our input, then we can give her our input.

1095
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:12,620
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think we have any authority to bind her to any sort of process.

1096
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:20,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So under participation by the Columbus School staff and students, it says, additionally, student input is highly desirable.

1097
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:30,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.

1098
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:44,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So the committee is willing to help, but I don't think the committee has anything necessarily to do with the presentation of the students or how it's conducted or anything like that.

1099
01:24:45,816 --> 01:24:52,543
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but I do think having the information that we're vetting from whatever presentation we put, I can then adjust it.

1100
01:24:53,725 --> 01:25:00,930
[SPEAKER_19]: for the elementary school students so that they know what those three names are and what it is we've found out rather than the teachers having to do the work on their own.

1101
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:05,473
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it might not correlate exactly the way the committee.

1102
01:25:06,174 --> 01:25:11,537
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I think it's important we have it from the committee that I could then put forward in a child-friendly way.

1103
01:25:11,557 --> 01:25:15,340
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not ready yet from us, maybe another week.

1104
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,761
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, I understand.

1105
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:17,661
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's okay.

1106
01:25:18,342 --> 01:25:21,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Just as long as I know something's forthcoming, I think that's a good point.

1107
01:25:21,744 --> 01:25:22,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1108
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:24,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee, would you like to speak?

1109
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:32,205
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I was just going to say, Kathy, that I know we talked about some sort of little bios for the students.

1110
01:25:32,245 --> 01:25:40,009
[SPEAKER_20]: And while the committee might not be in a position to provide that, the Medford Public Library might, or the Medford Historical Society, once we get to those names.

1111
01:25:40,509 --> 01:25:46,232
[SPEAKER_20]: Because some of the names, we don't know what they will be, might not be in encyclopedias or something.

1112
01:25:46,552 --> 01:25:51,275
[SPEAKER_20]: But because of the relationship for Medford, the Historical Society,

1113
01:25:52,331 --> 01:26:02,017
[SPEAKER_20]: or the public library might be willing to, or the Columbus library might be willing to provide some background on those names.

1114
01:26:02,057 --> 01:26:06,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Susan and I just take it from, I mean, a lot of people did a lot of work.

1115
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:13,584
[SPEAKER_14]: She can't really, Kathy, I don't think you want a bio, I don't want a couple of lines on each of the top three, I would think, right?

1116
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:16,846
[SPEAKER_14]: The kids aren't gonna, I mean, you tell me, Kath.

1117
01:26:17,358 --> 01:26:27,789
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I think if we do have a presentation to put forward, and I would have a copy of that, then I can take what we have put together and, like I said, make it child-friendly.

1118
01:26:27,809 --> 01:26:34,656
[SPEAKER_19]: I think reaching out to the library and the Historical Society are both great ideas, but is it going to be timely?

1119
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:36,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Will we get the information back in enough time?

1120
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,581
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think if I was to take

1121
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:45,459
[SPEAKER_19]: what we have, and then, like I said, you know, make it child-friendly, then I think that would be enough.

1122
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:57,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I'm using the information we have gathered, and so I know I'm on the same page with you, as opposed to expressing my own opinion, or maybe what the opinion might be of the people in my staff, if that makes sense.

1123
01:26:58,826 --> 01:27:05,672
[SPEAKER_14]: So whatever top three names that the group comes up with, there would at least be some info.

1124
01:27:06,052 --> 01:27:09,696
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would have to, I mean, you couldn't just blindly pick a name, right?

1125
01:27:10,056 --> 01:27:10,817
[SPEAKER_14]: No, correct.

1126
01:27:11,077 --> 01:27:13,939
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that's what we would be putting together in the presentation.

1127
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:17,463
[SPEAKER_14]: But the whole complete presentation, I don't think would be ready in time.

1128
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:24,318
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, for the kids to vote and for the committee to get to the school committee for consideration.

1129
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:35,444
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, that's- I would just need why the person, you know, the rubric, how does the person fit four characteristics of the rubric and perhaps some of the public information as to why we feel it would be a good name for the school.

1130
01:27:36,644 --> 01:27:45,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So once the top three names come to the top, maybe I can just, you know, work with you and Susie to get it to you, okay?

1131
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,680
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be perfect.

1132
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1133
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:48,702
[SPEAKER_14]: That's amenable to the committee.

1134
01:27:49,782 --> 01:27:50,823
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the point of information.

1135
01:27:50,863 --> 01:27:52,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I just, I agree with that.

1136
01:27:52,804 --> 01:27:53,545
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm fine with that.

1137
01:27:53,605 --> 01:27:55,346
[SPEAKER_21]: It just can't be sanctioned by this committee.

1138
01:27:58,247 --> 01:27:59,328
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm okay with sharing data.

1139
01:27:59,388 --> 01:28:04,892
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't want anybody to feel like the advisory committee is sponsoring.

1140
01:28:04,972 --> 01:28:07,153
[SPEAKER_21]: This should be independent and that's fine.

1141
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:09,554
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm just looking for shared information.

1142
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:10,115
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

1143
01:28:10,135 --> 01:28:10,995
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

1144
01:28:11,015 --> 01:28:12,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1145
01:28:12,656 --> 01:28:14,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Maria.

1146
01:28:14,317 --> 01:28:15,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have your hand up?

1147
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:29,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, um, I was, I had the question of Dr. Caldera, as you were writing this, how exactly did you envision the seven committee members being picked for the subcommittee?

1148
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:38,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Would that be something volunteer based, randomized, or what process?

1149
01:28:40,595 --> 01:28:43,678
[SPEAKER_15]: We can discuss how we want to do that.

1150
01:28:43,938 --> 01:28:53,427
[SPEAKER_15]: I had envisioned volunteers, since this will be like additional work, and I want to make sure that we are mindful and respectful of people's time.

1151
01:28:54,588 --> 01:29:03,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't want to have somebody on the committee, who is then on the subcommittee who doesn't have have the time to do that.

1152
01:29:05,077 --> 01:29:18,800
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we can start with who's willing to do it, and then if we have more than seven people, we can, you know, I'm open to suggestions on how to narrow it down from there to make sure we do have the seven-member committee.

1153
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:19,680
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of order.

1154
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,621
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an amendment on the floor.

1155
01:29:21,641 --> 01:29:25,141
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds like it's not going to be a friendly amendment, so we'll need to vote on that.

1156
01:29:27,602 --> 01:29:28,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you repeat the amendment?

1157
01:29:30,415 --> 01:29:46,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm asking to amend it to charge two members per name of the top three names and have the chairman write the portion about the process.

1158
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:59,062
[SPEAKER_21]: And the two per... Two committee members per name based on nominated and voted on by the committee, I guess.

1159
01:29:59,888 --> 01:30:04,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that would have been a friendly amendment to- No, it's not friendly yet.

1160
01:30:05,591 --> 01:30:07,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, nobody seconded it either, so.

1161
01:30:07,672 --> 01:30:10,734
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I know, but we haven't determined whether it's a friendly amendment.

1162
01:30:10,754 --> 01:30:14,176
[SPEAKER_21]: Dr. Grace, do you accept this amendment?

1163
01:30:16,197 --> 01:30:22,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't because I would like this to start as soon as possible because it can be done.

1164
01:30:22,941 --> 01:30:26,163
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no reason for us to wait until

1165
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:31,555
[SPEAKER_15]: we have the three considering we have other stuff that we can add in.

1166
01:30:31,936 --> 01:30:45,308
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think I mean, I don't want to put Mr. Lister in a spot where he's responsible to put together everything if he is if that's not what he wants to do.

1167
01:30:45,868 --> 01:30:51,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think any one of us are capable of putting together, you know, starting the presentation and putting together

1168
01:30:52,220 --> 01:31:00,664
[SPEAKER_15]: what we've done with the process, and it doesn't necessarily have to fall on Mr. Lister's shoulders if he, you know, doesn't want to do it.

1169
01:31:02,065 --> 01:31:17,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see the process as being a hard thing to follow through here, but as far as the names that we choose, I thought that Ron was kind of saying that the two people that were chosen for each name maybe had

1170
01:31:20,478 --> 01:31:25,362
[SPEAKER_07]: some passion about that name were spoke on that name's behalf.

1171
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:30,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was a good match is what I think he wanted to do.

1172
01:31:31,506 --> 01:31:38,651
[SPEAKER_21]: And point of clarification, it's only writing a draft that will be first vetted by the seven and then vetted by the 22.

1173
01:31:39,051 --> 01:31:41,172
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's only a starting point.

1174
01:31:47,176 --> 01:31:49,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're back to, is that a friendly amendment, Grace?

1175
01:31:52,029 --> 01:31:53,230
[SPEAKER_16]: I second Ron's amendment.

1176
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:56,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1177
01:31:59,733 --> 01:32:00,914
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll vote the amendment now.

1178
01:32:03,055 --> 01:32:04,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth, would you like to say something?

1179
01:32:09,538 --> 01:32:09,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth?

1180
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:13,920
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe he said no, but your hand's still up, Seth.

1181
01:32:14,341 --> 01:32:15,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry about that.

1182
01:32:15,961 --> 01:32:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Patrick, do you have your hand up?

1183
01:32:17,642 --> 01:32:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1184
01:32:20,383 --> 01:32:30,532
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to Ron, I think, you know, what you're bringing up, I mean, I think if the committee decides that that's something they want to adopt, then they could adopt that methodology.

1185
01:32:30,552 --> 01:32:36,096
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I agree they should, you know, take everybody's statements.

1186
01:32:36,937 --> 01:32:40,080
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was prepared tonight to have a three minute statement on someone.

1187
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:46,065
[SPEAKER_03]: If, you know, they should take everybody's statements and use that to build, you know, what their,

1188
01:32:46,546 --> 01:32:47,527
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're putting forward.

1189
01:32:48,508 --> 01:32:57,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I also wanted to sort of, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure about seven being necessarily being the right number.

1190
01:32:57,378 --> 01:33:03,885
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if eight people want to volunteer, I would be okay with eight people volunteering or nine people want to volunteer.

1191
01:33:03,905 --> 01:33:05,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I'd

1192
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:13,443
[SPEAKER_03]: think we should ask for the, you know, how many people wanna volunteer for this rather than set, you know, set a limit on seven.

1193
01:33:14,143 --> 01:33:31,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand sort of, you know, part of the reason why I do in this, it's tough to get 23 people to put together a presentation if 23 people volunteer, but I guess I'd like to see how many people wanna volunteer before committing to the seven number.

1194
01:33:32,015 --> 01:33:35,938
[SPEAKER_15]: And also this would, right, we need to be,

1195
01:33:36,705 --> 01:33:40,348
[SPEAKER_15]: mindful of quorum and open meeting law too with that.

1196
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:46,672
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we have 23 people volunteer, then we all need to be doing this publicly in a, in a meeting.

1197
01:33:47,653 --> 01:33:48,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Great point.

1198
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:49,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1199
01:33:52,316 --> 01:33:54,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So Maria, did you want to say anything?

1200
01:33:55,078 --> 01:33:55,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1201
01:33:55,538 --> 01:34:02,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say to Ron's amendment that to frame the work of this committee as though

1202
01:34:03,223 --> 01:34:22,883
[SPEAKER_12]: like we should only be presenting on the names that we have a passion for is counter to the mission because we are supposed to be an objective entity, regardless of, yes, we all do have opinions, we all have our favorite names.

1203
01:34:24,265 --> 01:34:25,666
[SPEAKER_12]: But that should not.

1204
01:34:27,146 --> 01:34:39,951
[SPEAKER_12]: If that is limiting our scope or our ability to consider one name or another, then I don't think that that person should be on the committee.

1205
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:40,832
[SPEAKER_12]: But

1206
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:59,145
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're going to be presenting, then all volunteers on the subcommittee should be able to present on every name equally as opposed to only feeling able to speak on those that they're passionate about.

1207
01:34:59,165 --> 01:35:04,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, my point again was that in the interest of time,

1208
01:35:05,943 --> 01:35:21,914
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't make sense to me to form the draft should be somebody, if it was, you know, I understand what you're saying, we should all be unbiased, but we all have our passion and we all have come here with, you know, we're all gonna stand up soon to say our three names.

1209
01:35:22,935 --> 01:35:29,399
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm saying in the interest of time, coming up with a comprehensive presentation

1210
01:35:30,132 --> 01:35:36,118
[SPEAKER_21]: then everybody in the seventh committee gets to read them and edit, and then the 22 get to read them and edit.

1211
01:35:36,138 --> 01:35:40,622
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no, there's no, you know, coercion.

1212
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:42,043
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just that

1213
01:35:43,157 --> 01:35:51,924
[SPEAKER_21]: To me, having seven people write three names takes a lot more time than it does to break it down to each name.

1214
01:35:52,124 --> 01:35:53,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, it's a draft.

1215
01:35:53,726 --> 01:35:54,586
[SPEAKER_21]: It can be edited.

1216
01:35:54,927 --> 01:35:56,007
[SPEAKER_21]: We can have a discussion.

1217
01:35:56,388 --> 01:35:58,770
[SPEAKER_21]: But we've been talking all night about interest of time.

1218
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:00,171
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I'm trying to provide.

1219
01:36:00,351 --> 01:36:01,111
[SPEAKER_21]: No coercion.

1220
01:36:01,852 --> 01:36:06,836
[SPEAKER_21]: And I do think that we should all be able to make this presentation.

1221
01:36:07,316 --> 01:36:09,358
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not so sure that everybody wants to.

1222
01:36:09,718 --> 01:36:10,079
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1223
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:15,338
[SPEAKER_15]: who has a strong opinion and a.

1224
01:36:16,576 --> 01:36:21,621
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, I would strongly suggest they volunteer to be on the committee to do this.

1225
01:36:22,201 --> 01:36:35,152
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, or, you know, at any, when we are doing the walkthrough presentation in front of the committee, we can propose amendments to make sure that we add content about an individual, right?

1226
01:36:35,252 --> 01:36:41,298
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's always, if something is missing, we have a chance as a committee to add onto it.

1227
01:36:42,078 --> 01:36:42,318
[SPEAKER_15]: And so,

1228
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:52,444
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we're not, the final draft isn't necessarily what that seven member committee has come up with.

1229
01:36:53,545 --> 01:37:07,372
[SPEAKER_15]: We will have the ability to add additional information if we feel like it needs to be added when it is presented for everybody as a whole to then walk through and add it and we can do it in real time right on the slides.

1230
01:37:09,474 --> 01:37:10,254
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is

1231
01:37:10,812 --> 01:37:21,597
[SPEAKER_15]: again, just trying to get things started so that we're not at a point where we have three names and now we're starting from scratch and trying to get a presentation done for the committee.

1232
01:37:21,677 --> 01:37:27,520
[SPEAKER_15]: We can start kind of doing this in parallel with the information that we already have.

1233
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:33,883
[SPEAKER_15]: And then as we get those names in, we can add, you know, start working on those particular names.

1234
01:37:36,624 --> 01:37:36,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1235
01:37:37,805 --> 01:37:38,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth, you have something?

1236
01:37:42,426 --> 01:37:43,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

1237
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:55,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Really just bridging what Dr. Caldera was saying in response to Ron, it seems like the, the subcommittee of

1238
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:17,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it made sense to do two by two by two on each individual name so that they would be able to do it more quickly rather than having round and round with seven, that would be a decision that the subcommittee could make.

1239
01:38:18,748 --> 01:38:20,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if one person

1240
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:35,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Theoretically, uh, uh, chair Lister, uh, wanted to take over, um, writing about procedures and that theoretically, if chair Lister was on the subcommittee, that would be a decision that the subcommittee could make.

1241
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:47,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it just seems like to some extent, uh, Ron, your concerns are, are, we could just kind of fold it into what's already there.

1242
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:50,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and that's it.

1243
01:38:51,357 --> 01:38:51,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1244
01:38:54,358 --> 01:38:55,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, did I see anybody else?

1245
01:38:55,599 --> 01:38:56,279
[SPEAKER_07]: No more hands.

1246
01:38:58,380 --> 01:38:58,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee?

1247
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:05,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I thought I saw Ken too at some point, but I was just also going to agree with that.

1248
01:39:05,784 --> 01:39:16,588
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we're getting into the details of how the subcommittee would do its work, and I don't know that we need a resolution or a motion specifically about that once the subcommittee is formed.

1249
01:39:18,293 --> 01:39:19,474
[SPEAKER_20]: perhaps a friendly amendment.

1250
01:39:19,694 --> 01:39:21,936
[SPEAKER_20]: We might not have three recommended names.

1251
01:39:22,296 --> 01:39:23,617
[SPEAKER_20]: We might only have one or two.

1252
01:39:24,078 --> 01:39:26,700
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't know if we need to specify the number three.

1253
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,562
[SPEAKER_20]: It could just be recommended names.

1254
01:39:30,183 --> 01:39:43,173
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'm not sure if I heard that seven is the magic number for staying under a open meeting law, but whatever that magic number is, is probably the one we should use for ultimate flexibility.

1255
01:39:44,614 --> 01:39:44,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1256
01:39:47,197 --> 01:39:47,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1257
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:51,651
[SPEAKER_07]: We had an amendment and we had it second.

1258
01:39:52,731 --> 01:39:56,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, do you still want this amendment?

1259
01:39:57,352 --> 01:39:57,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1260
01:39:57,692 --> 01:40:01,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we'll have to vote on the amendment first, okay?

1261
01:40:01,452 --> 01:40:08,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Aren't there two amendments on the floor, Grace's and Ron's, and both were seconded?

1262
01:40:08,934 --> 01:40:11,734
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a resolution, he's an amendment to her resolution.

1263
01:40:12,354 --> 01:40:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna vote his amendment first.

1264
01:40:14,334 --> 01:40:17,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought she didn't accept it.

1265
01:40:18,152 --> 01:40:18,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Did she?

1266
01:40:19,153 --> 01:40:20,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I could have lost them.

1267
01:40:20,274 --> 01:40:22,976
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't accept it as a friendly amendment.

1268
01:40:23,016 --> 01:40:24,357
[SPEAKER_07]: But we still have to vote on it.

1269
01:40:24,377 --> 01:40:26,119
[SPEAKER_14]: She didn't accept it.

1270
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:27,420
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll vote it separately, okay.

1271
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:27,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1272
01:40:28,421 --> 01:40:28,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1273
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:30,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1274
01:40:30,843 --> 01:40:31,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee, you got one more question?

1275
01:40:35,646 --> 01:40:35,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee?

1276
01:40:37,088 --> 01:40:37,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1277
01:40:37,888 --> 01:40:39,189
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1278
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:44,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, can you repeat your amendment one more time for me, please?

1279
01:40:46,104 --> 01:41:03,191
[SPEAKER_21]: My amendment is to assign the group of two committee members per name of the top three and have the chairman be responsible for the process piece of the presentation as only the beginning of a first draft process.

1280
01:41:04,752 --> 01:41:05,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1281
01:41:07,013 --> 01:41:07,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Brie Brothers?

1282
01:41:07,653 --> 01:41:10,454
[SPEAKER_18]: I abstain.

1283
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:15,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan Puccio.

1284
01:41:15,499 --> 01:41:15,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1285
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron Genia.

1286
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:21,041
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1287
01:41:26,403 --> 01:41:27,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Beth Fuller.

1288
01:41:31,105 --> 01:41:31,305
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1289
01:41:36,607 --> 01:41:37,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace Caldera.

1290
01:41:38,268 --> 01:41:38,508
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1291
01:41:42,269 --> 01:41:42,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Ken Mallon.

1292
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:43,830
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1293
01:41:48,632 --> 01:41:49,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Kristen Scalise.

1294
01:41:55,155 --> 01:41:58,616
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't understand it completely, so I'm going to say abstain.

1295
01:41:59,117 --> 01:41:59,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1296
01:42:00,397 --> 01:42:00,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1297
01:42:02,978 --> 01:42:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Laura Rotolo?

1298
01:42:05,379 --> 01:42:05,519
No.

1299
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:07,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I hear a no?

1300
01:42:09,141 --> 01:42:09,301
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1301
01:42:10,322 --> 01:42:10,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1302
01:42:10,662 --> 01:42:10,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1303
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:11,862

[SPEAKER_07]: Paul Donato.

1316
01:42:48,819 --> 01:42:49,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1317
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:52,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron?

1318
01:42:54,191 --> 01:42:54,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1319
01:42:57,234 --> 01:42:57,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth?

1320
01:42:58,875 --> 01:42:59,075
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1321
01:43:02,178 --> 01:43:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy Kay?

[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1325
01:43:13,367 --> 01:43:14,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaitlin Shaughnessy?

1326
01:43:18,731 --> 01:43:19,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Can anybody help me there?

1327
01:43:19,551 --> 01:43:20,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see her.

1328
01:43:20,412 --> 01:43:21,373
[SPEAKER_19]: I think she's saying no.

1329
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:22,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that correct, Caitlin?

1330
01:43:23,892 --> 01:43:24,373
[SPEAKER_19]: She said no.

1331
01:43:27,817 --> 01:43:29,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Janelle Garland-McKenzie?

1332
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:30,941
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1333
01:43:33,223 --> 01:43:34,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Josie DeFore?

1334
01:43:34,925 --> 01:43:35,146
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1335
01:43:37,368 --> 01:43:38,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I vote yes.

1336
01:43:40,872 --> 01:43:42,294
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on to team.

1337
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:57,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1338
01:43:57,843 --> 01:44:02,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's 12.8 with two extensions.

1339
01:44:04,928 --> 01:44:05,428
[SPEAKER_06]: 12.8, yep.

1340
01:44:08,831 --> 01:44:10,752
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got 12.8 with two extensions.

1341
01:44:12,313 --> 01:44:12,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1342
01:44:14,074 --> 01:44:15,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So that amendment doesn't pass.

1343
01:44:15,955 --> 01:44:17,356
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, now on the resolution.

1344
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:24,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Grace, can you read

1345
01:44:24,763 --> 01:44:27,504
[SPEAKER_07]: your resolution one more time and we can vote on it.

1346
01:44:27,524 --> 01:44:29,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, not a problem.

1347
01:44:31,205 --> 01:44:50,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it so resolved that the advisory committee establish a seven member subcommittee to draft a presentation to the school committee explaining the advisory committee's three recommended names, the process by which the recommendations were arrived at and why the selected names were chosen.

1348
01:44:50,815 --> 01:45:00,641
[SPEAKER_15]: This subcommittee shall provide a draft of the presentation for the advisory committee approval during the final meeting of the advisory committee prior to the school committee presentation.

1349
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:01,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1350
01:45:02,282 --> 01:45:02,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of order.

1351
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:05,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Lee have some friendly amendments for that?

1352
01:45:09,427 --> 01:45:16,251
[SPEAKER_20]: I only mentioned that we might not have three recommended names so that we could just strike three and say the recommended names.

1353
01:45:16,744 --> 01:45:21,107
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I mentioned the magic number, which maybe it is seven so then it should stay.

1354
01:45:22,528 --> 01:45:25,410
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can i'm okay with a.

1355
01:45:26,285 --> 01:45:40,228
[SPEAKER_15]: since we need to stay under quorum and we're at 22 now, we can say, change it so that it will be established subcommittee of up to 10 members.

1356
01:45:40,348 --> 01:45:45,670
[SPEAKER_15]: That would give us some wiggle room and still keep us under quorum for open meeting loss.

1357
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:54,312
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, I can also change the three to explaining the advisory committees

1358
01:45:56,721 --> 01:45:58,122
[SPEAKER_15]: recommended names.

1359
01:45:58,162 --> 01:46:00,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we can just pick out the three.

1360
01:46:01,144 --> 01:46:05,108
[SPEAKER_15]: So Lisa, would you like me to reread that with the changes?

1361
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:09,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, and then we'll vote on it.

1362
01:46:09,391 --> 01:46:10,412
[SPEAKER_21]: Just clarification.

1363
01:46:10,872 --> 01:46:19,178
[SPEAKER_21]: First, since we're visiting this and don't want to revisit it again, can we determine how the members will be elected to this committee?

1364
01:46:20,019 --> 01:46:22,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Appointment, volunteer, vote,

1365
01:46:23,152 --> 01:46:26,173
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if we have 14 people who want to do it, how do we decide?

1366
01:46:26,193 --> 01:46:30,735
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think we should put a bow on this before we have to go back and revisit it.

1367
01:46:30,895 --> 01:46:31,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1368
01:46:32,276 --> 01:46:32,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1369
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:37,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other hands up?

1370
01:46:38,939 --> 01:46:42,900
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could just say, Grace, whatever you've rewritten, you can just forward whenever.

1371
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:45,261
[SPEAKER_14]: You can just forward it all together tomorrow sometime.

1372
01:46:45,521 --> 01:46:45,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fine.

1373
01:46:46,542 --> 01:46:52,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoever, like I said, whoever makes a resolution or amendment, if you can just forward it to me after the meeting, it's appreciated.

1374
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:57,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Patrick.

1375
01:46:57,182 --> 01:47:00,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have something to say just to Ron's concern?

1376
01:47:00,303 --> 01:47:10,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we could easily vote that as a second amendment rather than trying to vote it again or included as part of this rather.

1377
01:47:13,609 --> 01:47:13,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1378
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian, you good?

1379
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:19,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Fine.

1380
01:47:20,972 --> 01:47:27,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the on the resolution put forth by grace.

1381
01:47:27,375 --> 01:47:27,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1382
01:47:30,917 --> 01:47:35,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry brief.

1383
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:48,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just so we theoretically and I don't want to necessarily hold things up further but we could take a straw poll to see whether or not it would be an issue of 10 or not.

1384
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:56,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But, or we could move on to actually voting on it.

1385
01:48:01,347 --> 01:48:02,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we vote on it?

1386
01:48:03,549 --> 01:48:05,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we're going to come up with enough people.

1387
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:09,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Question may be, we may have to limit it is what the problem may be.

1388
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:11,974
Correct.

1389
01:48:12,895 --> 01:48:13,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1390
01:48:14,836 --> 01:48:15,117
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1391
01:48:16,137 --> 01:48:17,558
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to move the motion now.

1392
01:48:20,844 --> 01:48:21,324
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

1393
01:48:23,185 --> 01:48:25,667
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what I'm voting on at the moment.

1394
01:48:27,088 --> 01:48:27,428
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1395
01:48:29,809 --> 01:48:35,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace, could you read it one more time now?

1396
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:35,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1397
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:35,633
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1398
01:48:35,653 --> 01:48:40,996
[SPEAKER_15]: So be it so resolved that the advisory committee establish a subcommittee

1399
01:48:41,694 --> 01:48:59,165
[SPEAKER_15]: of up to 10 committee members to draft a presentation to the school committee explaining the advisory committee's recommended names, the process by which the recommendations were arrived at, and why the selected names were chosen.

1400
01:48:59,786 --> 01:49:06,490
[SPEAKER_15]: This subcommittee shall provide a draft of the presentation for the advisory committee approval

1401
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:13,093
[SPEAKER_15]: during the final meeting of the advisory committee prior to the school committee presentation.

1402
01:49:14,713 --> 01:49:15,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1403
01:49:16,654 --> 01:49:19,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, can I just ask a point of procedure?

1404
01:49:20,556 --> 01:49:29,299
[SPEAKER_21]: If we're doing this presentation and the public watches us do this presentation, do we not lose some impact when we actually make the presentation?

1405
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:35,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a way of deliberating or just doing this clerical piece in an executive or private session?

1406
01:49:36,424 --> 01:49:40,565
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I mean?

1407
01:49:42,045 --> 01:49:44,386
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm more about the impact of a presentation.

1408
01:49:44,406 --> 01:49:47,226
[SPEAKER_21]: We lose it if we rehearse it in front of the audience.

1409
01:49:51,027 --> 01:49:53,528
[SPEAKER_20]: Just a question, maybe a response to that.

1410
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:58,649
[SPEAKER_20]: The amendment says to provide a draft of the presentation for committee approval.

1411
01:49:58,669 --> 01:50:02,590
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't know if that means an actual live demonstration of it or

1412
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:09,355
[SPEAKER_20]: a PowerPoint presentation, for instance, or a recording, which could go on the share drive.

1413
01:50:09,775 --> 01:50:16,636
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we could discuss it here if we wanted to, or not, but we could have a draft of it without it being public.

1414
01:50:18,297 --> 01:50:25,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, irregardless, Jim Lister would make the presentation, whether it's a PowerPoint or not, because he is the chair.

1415
01:50:25,438 --> 01:50:30,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So to be fair, he would probably be the one that would address the school committee with the presentation.

1416
01:50:31,311 --> 01:50:52,918
[SPEAKER_07]: and the rest of you would be at the meeting and the committee members could, you know, take pieces during the powerful- The way I envisioned it was yes, I'm gonna go through the procedure and then we're gonna have three groups of two or more do a presentation on the three people is what I thought we agreed on here tonight.

1417
01:50:56,462 --> 01:50:58,403
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was Ron.

1418
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:06,167
[SPEAKER_19]: What he meant, though, is if we're presenting it here for us before we go to school committee, that that presentation loses its impact.

1419
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:07,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Ron, is that correct?

1420
01:51:07,128 --> 01:51:07,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1421
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:15,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it would need to be made public either way under the open meeting laws.

1422
01:51:15,152 --> 01:51:19,895
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I'm just asking for parliamentary process if there's a way to do it the other way.

1423
01:51:22,875 --> 01:51:25,396
[SPEAKER_19]: We, I'm sorry, through the chair, I have a question.

1424
01:51:26,176 --> 01:51:26,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1425
01:51:27,036 --> 01:51:39,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So we would not be able to look at the presentation in a PowerPoint kind of like we're going to do with all the public information we got and then have a conversation like we're doing now on that PowerPoint without showing it.

1426
01:51:40,681 --> 01:51:41,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that something we can do?

1427
01:51:41,781 --> 01:51:46,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think we should be able to do that.

1428
01:51:48,763 --> 01:51:49,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my question.

1429
01:51:50,735 --> 01:51:53,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's that's probably the best idea.

1430
01:51:53,158 --> 01:51:53,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1431
01:51:56,302 --> 01:51:57,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Then yeah, we just won't.

1432
01:51:58,365 --> 01:52:01,689
[SPEAKER_07]: We can discuss it at meeting, but we won't actually execute.

1433
01:52:01,709 --> 01:52:04,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1434
01:52:05,874 --> 01:52:09,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone get that any any Patrick I see a hand up.

1435
01:52:10,806 --> 01:52:14,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not sure the clarification on that.

1436
01:52:14,067 --> 01:52:16,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the concern is open meeting law.

1437
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:23,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how are we, you're saying like we would just get like a copy of the PowerPoint and review that on our own?

1438
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:26,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, on the file, on the share drive.

1439
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:35,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would say, so for example, we'd say Grace talks about this candidate and we're not going to have Grace do a presentation.

1440
01:52:37,755 --> 01:52:39,115
[SPEAKER_07]: she's not gonna do a presentation.

1441
01:52:39,136 --> 01:52:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: She's gonna write her presentation for you to read individually, and then we'll discuss in a meeting.

1442
01:52:45,578 --> 01:52:45,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

1443
01:52:46,478 --> 01:52:47,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the clarification.

1444
01:52:48,099 --> 01:52:52,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be a way we could do that and have some suspense in the delivery.

1445
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:56,522
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, back to the motion.

1446
01:52:59,923 --> 01:53:00,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we vote this?

1447
01:53:02,963 --> 01:53:06,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Grace, did you finish reading it again for me, correct?

1448
01:53:06,627 --> 01:53:07,067
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

1449
01:53:07,087 --> 01:53:07,868
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1450
01:53:08,289 --> 01:53:10,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria's hand just went up though.

1451
01:53:11,272 --> 01:53:11,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1452
01:53:12,032 --> 01:53:22,904
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just a logistical aspect of the, if we're not going to have like an actual presentation verbally.

1453
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:43,068
[SPEAKER_12]: In Google Slides, there's the speaker notes option, so we could write everything that we're going to say and have it available there for everyone to read so that we all know what is going to be said, just we won't hear it verbally.

1454
01:53:43,088 --> 01:53:47,453
[SPEAKER_21]: As long as that includes no deliberation, then I guess that's okay.

1455
01:53:47,932 --> 01:53:48,512
[SPEAKER_21]: That's excellent.

1456
01:53:48,712 --> 01:53:49,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1457
01:53:49,172 --> 01:53:54,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it also depends too, how high tech you want to get, because you can do voiceover in a power point.

1458
01:53:55,255 --> 01:53:56,835
[SPEAKER_19]: You just have to know which keys to click.

1459
01:53:56,995 --> 01:54:01,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to have somebody do that for me.

1460
01:54:02,797 --> 01:54:04,838
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Patrick, did you have something else to say?

1461
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:08,199
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just didn't take my hand down.

1462
01:54:08,499 --> 01:54:08,739
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1463
01:54:08,779 --> 01:54:09,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1464
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:10,260
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1465
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:11,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to the vote now.

1466
01:54:12,941 --> 01:54:14,001

01:54:48,949 --> 01:54:49,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Maria.

1487
01:54:52,951 --> 01:54:53,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1488
01:54:59,234 --> 01:54:59,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Melissa.

1489
01:55:00,774 --> 01:55:01,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

01:55:03,756 --> 01:55:04,256

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1494
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:12,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

1495
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:13,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1496
01:55:16,442 --> 01:55:16,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Seth.

1497
01:55:20,452 --> 01:55:21,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy Kaye.

1498
01:55:21,712 --> 01:55:21,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1499
01:55:24,973 --> 01:55:25,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt Habistro.

1500
01:55:26,513 --> 01:55:26,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1501
01:55:28,514 --> 01:55:29,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaitlin Shaughnessy.

1502
01:55:29,954 --> 01:55:31,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Can somebody tell me if she's got a thumb up?

1503
01:55:33,175 --> 01:55:34,015
[SPEAKER_19]: I think she said yes.

1504
01:55:34,115 --> 01:55:34,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1505
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:34,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1506
01:55:35,135 --> 01:55:35,415
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1507
01:55:35,435 --> 01:55:35,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1508
01:55:37,495 --> 01:55:38,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Janelle Gollin-McKenzie.

1509
01:55:39,536 --> 01:55:39,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1510
01:55:41,896 --> 01:55:42,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Josie DeFore.

1511
01:55:43,697 --> 01:55:43,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1512
01:55:45,897 --> 01:55:46,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1513
01:55:46,397 --> 01:55:47,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jim Lister.

1514
01:55:47,157 --> 01:55:49,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1515
01:55:49,478 --> 01:55:50,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So 22 in the affirmative.

1516
01:55:54,107 --> 01:55:54,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1517
01:55:54,947 --> 01:55:55,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1518
01:55:55,788 --> 01:55:58,810
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1519
01:56:03,892 --> 01:56:04,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1520
01:56:10,856 --> 01:56:13,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe we have anything else on our agenda.

1521
01:56:14,398 --> 01:56:19,661
[SPEAKER_07]: We go to whole business or anything else you'd like to discuss tonight.

1522
01:56:23,463 --> 01:56:23,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Ken.

1523
01:56:27,466 --> 01:56:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: To Ron's point, can we now figure out how people are going to get onto the subcommittee?

1524
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:37,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1525
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:49,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, would I have volunteers and then we'll have to discuss if we don't have enough or if we have too many, then we'll have to find a narrowing process.

1526
01:56:52,643 --> 01:57:07,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Just to make a suggestion, I don't wanna see the people who, if Vito Corleone gets picked as one of the three, I may not wanna be on the committee.

1527
01:57:07,715 --> 01:57:10,397
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I think we need to do the top three.

1528
01:57:10,638 --> 01:57:15,521
[SPEAKER_21]: We can determine that it'd be done by volunteer, appointment or vote, that's fine.

1529
01:57:15,582 --> 01:57:22,167
[SPEAKER_21]: But to do this prior to the top three being selected, I think it does a disservice to the quality of the process.

1530
01:57:26,844 --> 01:57:36,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that the point of deciding to do this right now was so that people could start doing the work and start building the presentation and getting the draft together.

1531
01:57:36,653 --> 01:57:40,016
[SPEAKER_21]: But what would you build it on, 18 people?

1532
01:57:40,277 --> 01:57:41,858
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't decided who the three are.

1533
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:48,865
[SPEAKER_15]: You can still start this process without having the three names, right?

1534
01:57:51,087 --> 01:57:54,790
[SPEAKER_21]: So we should write about all 18 then?

1535
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:55,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PowerPoint.

1536
01:57:56,211 --> 01:58:08,541
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting the bones of the PowerPoint together, figuring out how the pages are going to look, doing the process part of it.

1537
01:58:08,821 --> 01:58:11,583
[SPEAKER_15]: The subcommittee can work on figuring out

1538
01:58:12,248 --> 01:58:16,312
[SPEAKER_15]: what the outline of the presentation is going to be.

1539
01:58:16,712 --> 01:58:27,142
[SPEAKER_15]: We can figure out exactly what Ken had stated, what the slides are going to look like, how we want to go about writing the script, if that's what we're doing, what are we using.

1540
01:58:27,782 --> 01:58:44,054
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also the subcommittee can also start working on talking and putting together things about the process, what we've talked about how we got to the place, we don't have to have the three names yet in order to start some of the beginning work that that needs to be done.

1541
01:58:44,524 --> 01:58:45,584
[SPEAKER_15]: for this presentation.

1542
01:58:45,984 --> 01:58:49,345
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't have to wait until we have those three names.

1543
01:58:49,465 --> 01:58:52,946
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get everything done up to those three names.

1544
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:57,007
[SPEAKER_15]: We can just have slides as placeholders, name one, name two, name three.

1545
01:58:57,307 --> 01:59:03,368
[SPEAKER_15]: And then as those names are decided, we can go ahead and start filling in all of those details.

1546
01:59:09,329 --> 01:59:09,889
[SPEAKER_20]: Anybody else?

1547
01:59:10,289 --> 01:59:10,529
[SPEAKER_20]: Lee?

1548
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:13,990
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just also add that, you know,

1549
01:59:14,902 --> 01:59:16,543
[SPEAKER_20]: we could do the volunteers tonight.

1550
01:59:16,663 --> 01:59:24,487
[SPEAKER_20]: And if it turns out that somebody is really enthusiastic about being on the subcommittee, once they know the names, the membership could change.

1551
01:59:24,547 --> 01:59:30,990
[SPEAKER_20]: So it doesn't, deciding tonight doesn't prevent us from swapping the membership as long as we stay under the number.

1552
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:32,570
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1553
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:33,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1554
01:59:33,091 --> 01:59:33,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Good point.

1555
01:59:35,232 --> 01:59:35,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1556
01:59:36,992 --> 01:59:41,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So volunteers, can I, I guess,

1557
01:59:42,996 --> 01:59:44,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see, Maria's got her hand up first.

1558
01:59:44,557 --> 01:59:48,279
[SPEAKER_07]: You volunteer, Maria, or are you... No, I'm volunteering.

1559
01:59:49,219 --> 01:59:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Volunteering?

1560
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:51,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1561
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:55,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if there's anybody that wants to volunteer, raise your hand and I'll make a list.

1562
01:59:57,243 --> 01:59:58,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Josie has her physical hand up.

1563
01:59:59,484 --> 01:59:59,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1564
01:59:59,904 --> 02:00:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

1565
02:00:00,364 --> 02:00:03,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me... I gotta get to the... Yeah, okay.

1566
02:00:03,606 --> 02:00:06,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read them, and anybody, if I don't read your name off, let me know.

1567
02:00:06,988 --> 02:00:07,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria?

1568
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:12,050

02:00:24,293 --> 02:00:24,914

[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Jovino.

02:00:30,278 --> 02:00:38,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Melissa Miguel.

1573
02:00:44,549 --> 02:00:45,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul Donato.

1574
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:49,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Josie has her physical hand up, so you may not see that.

1575
02:00:50,521 --> 02:00:50,901
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1576
02:00:51,481 --> 02:00:52,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Bree does as well.

1577
02:00:52,922 --> 02:00:53,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1578
02:00:54,103 --> 02:00:54,583
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1579
02:00:56,544 --> 02:00:57,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Josie.

02:01:01,146 --> 02:01:02,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And Laura Rotolo.

1581
02:01:05,909 --> 02:01:06,809
[SPEAKER_19]: And did you get Bree too?

1582
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:08,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Bree Brothers.

1583
02:01:13,633 --> 02:01:13,753
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

[SPEAKER_07]: That's 10.

1585
02:01:18,143 --> 02:01:21,345

[SPEAKER_07]: Did I miss anybody?

1588
02:01:39,412 --> 02:01:42,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, Jim, don't you make 11?

1589
02:01:44,434 --> 02:01:45,835
[SPEAKER_07]: 11, yes, well.

1590
02:01:47,446 --> 02:01:48,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of order.

1591
02:01:48,806 --> 02:01:49,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my presentation.

1592
02:01:50,707 --> 02:01:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of order.

1593
02:01:51,707 --> 02:02:00,249
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing in the charter that the chair actually has to be a part of the presentation.

1594
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:02,009
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1595
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:04,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1596
02:02:07,150 --> 02:02:07,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions?

1597
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:08,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Ron and Melissa.

1598
02:02:11,431 --> 02:02:11,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions?

1599
02:02:11,951 --> 02:02:12,791
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just your hand up.

1600
02:02:14,792 --> 02:02:15,312
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.

1601
02:02:17,622 --> 02:02:18,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1602
02:02:20,024 --> 02:02:21,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else under old business?

1603
02:02:22,025 --> 02:02:31,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just say that as chairperson, he would introduce, Jim would introduce, whether it's a PowerPoint or whatever you present to the school committee.

1604
02:02:32,593 --> 02:02:34,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of order, there's nothing in the charter.

1605
02:02:34,774 --> 02:02:37,336
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't have to say that, he's the chairperson.

1606
02:02:37,876 --> 02:02:43,881
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the respect you would give him as a chairperson to address the school committee and say, this is our presentation.

1607
02:02:44,001 --> 02:02:45,342
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't have to talk for 10 hours,

1608
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:51,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I think by virtue of being chairperson, that's respectful.

1609
02:02:51,055 --> 02:02:55,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Respect, I mean, that's an opinion, but it's, and I may share it.

1610
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:58,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it is not part of our specific.

1611
02:02:59,223 --> 02:03:00,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Matt has his hand up.

1612
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:21,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – he, him, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his,

1613
02:03:21,877 --> 02:03:22,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot.

1614
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:26,922
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a subcommittee meeting that I have to attend.

1615
02:03:27,182 --> 02:03:30,045
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to meet Tuesday, you have to advertise it tomorrow.

1616
02:03:30,546 --> 02:03:37,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So you would have to have all resolutions to Susie by, I don't know if it's 11 a.m.

1617
02:03:37,272 --> 02:03:41,116
[SPEAKER_14]: tomorrow, if you're going to meet on Tuesday, because I think it has to be posted by 4.30 tomorrow.

1618
02:03:45,115 --> 02:03:46,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not available Monday or Tuesday.

1619
02:03:46,856 --> 02:03:48,657
[SPEAKER_14]: The only day I'm available is Wednesday.

1620
02:03:48,677 --> 02:03:50,318
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to be clear.

1621
02:03:50,358 --> 02:03:57,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but I already made plans to take Friday off and it's a long weekend, so I'll be heading away.

1622
02:03:58,143 --> 02:03:59,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I do a quick point of information?

1623
02:04:00,184 --> 02:04:01,365
[SPEAKER_15]: The resolution that we

1624
02:04:02,563 --> 02:04:10,169
[SPEAKER_15]: just passed regarding the subcommittee for the presentation doesn't actually say anything about who is presenting it.

1625
02:04:10,589 --> 02:04:12,411
[SPEAKER_15]: So that can be decided at a later date.

1626
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:14,132
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just doing the draft.

1627
02:04:15,655 --> 02:04:22,761
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't know if that will change anybody, but I just wanted to clarify that this is just simply getting together a presentation and a draft.

1628
02:04:22,881 --> 02:04:26,544
[SPEAKER_15]: We can discuss who's doing what, when, at a later time and date.

1629
02:04:26,564 --> 02:04:28,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's a good point, Grace.

1630
02:04:28,966 --> 02:04:34,991
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will just add to that, that 10 was a consideration for not violating open meeting law.

1631
02:04:35,311 --> 02:04:40,115
[SPEAKER_20]: If the presentation is at the school committee, the final presentation, maybe it doesn't matter.

1632
02:04:40,816 --> 02:04:43,358
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not an issue for the draft team committee.

1633
02:04:45,868 --> 02:04:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification here.

1634
02:04:48,729 --> 02:04:50,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone that volunteered is now on the committee.

1635
02:04:50,789 --> 02:04:52,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we said that subcommittee was seven.

1636
02:04:54,850 --> 02:04:58,271
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that number was changed to less than a quorum.

1637
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:00,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a friendly amendment.

1638
02:05:01,452 --> 02:05:01,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1639
02:05:08,473 --> 02:05:08,813
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1640
02:05:09,354 --> 02:05:09,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

1641
02:05:12,674 --> 02:05:15,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we already talk about meeting twice a week, or did we just?

1642
02:05:15,973 --> 02:05:19,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we started talking Tuesday and then Tuesday's out.

1643
02:05:19,696 --> 02:05:22,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday is not a night for me next week, I'm sorry.

1644
02:05:22,759 --> 02:05:26,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Monday night, we can't do Monday night, because we don't have enough time to advertise.

1645
02:05:27,703 --> 02:05:29,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus we have school committee, so I couldn't attend.

1646
02:05:30,686 --> 02:05:32,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, this is what I mean with the meeting.

1647
02:05:32,687 --> 02:05:34,449
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have one Monday, Tuesday.

1648
02:05:34,769 --> 02:05:36,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Wednesday is my only open day.

1649
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:38,833
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do have a meeting, but I don't have to be at it.

1650
02:05:39,695 --> 02:05:41,396
[SPEAKER_14]: and Thursday night I'm gonna head out.

1651
02:05:41,676 --> 02:05:51,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless you wanted to meet at four, like from four to like 3.30, four, I can do that, but I can't stay later than six.

1652
02:05:52,481 --> 02:05:54,402
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a quick question.

1653
02:05:54,602 --> 02:06:02,305
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure who to direct this to, but is it possible that the superintendent appoint a different note taker for us?

1654
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Lisa can't do that.

1655
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,221
[SPEAKER_15]: And if not, is there?

1656
02:06:07,681 --> 02:06:12,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it would be Susie and she would have to do the meeting on Wednesday and Thursday she's taking off.

1657
02:06:13,423 --> 02:06:14,083
[SPEAKER_14]: She won't be in.

1658
02:06:14,223 --> 02:06:17,384
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's one of us, like we piggyback on each other.

1659
02:06:17,984 --> 02:06:21,585
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the problem.

1660
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:28,067
[SPEAKER_14]: So really I should be covering three meetings with her Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, but I can bump out the Wednesday.

1661
02:06:29,287 --> 02:06:30,207
[SPEAKER_14]: She can handle that one.

1662
02:06:31,027 --> 02:06:33,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Thursday she's taking off and I'm taking off

1663
02:06:34,103 --> 02:06:36,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Friday, but I'm leaving Thursday night.

1664
02:06:36,105 --> 02:06:38,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So I could do Thursday, like a four to six.

1665
02:06:40,870 --> 02:06:41,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I could head.

1666
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:48,397
[SPEAKER_14]: So the only night you're available Wednesday or at four o'clock on Thursday, I could do a four to six.

1667
02:06:50,499 --> 02:06:52,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you weren't available on Tuesday, Lisa.

1668
02:06:53,201 --> 02:06:54,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not we have a subcommittee.

1669
02:06:57,624 --> 02:06:59,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I think you'd probably have to be at that one too.

1670
02:07:02,368 --> 02:07:04,249
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the strategic plan.

1671
02:07:04,990 --> 02:07:08,073
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if you'd have to be there, Kath, but I know I do.

1672
02:07:11,355 --> 02:07:16,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Jim, I was just going to suggest maybe we just get a poll out and with as many times as possible.

1673
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:20,102
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounds like for this next meeting, if we're voting, we're going to need all of us.

1674
02:07:21,243 --> 02:07:24,466
[SPEAKER_20]: So it just might be difficult to find that time here.

1675
02:07:25,327 --> 02:07:32,613
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, for instance, I sometimes have time during the day or could move things around, but a poll would, like a Google poll would be helpful for that.

1676
02:07:32,913 --> 02:07:36,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Can anyone meet during the day or at a certain time during the day?

1677
02:07:36,937 --> 02:07:42,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I obviously could fit that in on Thursday, but if not, or Wednesday, but.

1678
02:07:44,203 --> 02:07:46,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, sorry, long weekend, sorry.

1679
02:07:46,765 --> 02:07:48,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Apologize.

1680
02:07:48,246 --> 02:07:49,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'm sorry.

1681
02:07:57,835 --> 02:07:59,035
[SPEAKER_05]: things are recorded.

1682
02:07:59,876 --> 02:08:13,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And so from a technical standpoint, I'm not sure how much of the of an actual note taker we need because theoretically notes could be taken after the fact.

1683
02:08:18,542 --> 02:08:19,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I suppose that's fine.

1684
02:08:19,863 --> 02:08:20,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have to

1685
02:08:21,979 --> 02:08:28,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to do that I guess I would have to check with the superintendent what she wants to do about that but I guess I could do that I get I just don't know.

1686
02:08:28,323 --> 02:08:32,345
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be away the weekend so.

1687
02:08:36,488 --> 02:08:36,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1688
02:08:36,728 --> 02:08:43,692
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll have to get back to everybody on when we're going to have the next meeting.

1689
02:08:51,513 --> 02:08:52,134
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor.

1690
02:08:54,879 --> 02:08:57,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded I thank you.

1691
02:08:58,725 --> 02:08:59,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everybody.

1692
02:08:59,607 --> 02:09:00,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night everyone.

1693
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
