1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey everybody, this is the Medford Historical Commission.

2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:05,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight is Monday, August 12th.

3
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:11,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read our statement and then I will open the meeting.

4
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:19,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:24,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,195
[SPEAKER_03]: No in-person attendance or members of the public will be permitted.

7
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:33,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Any public participation for this hearing will be by remote means only.

8
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:37,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of procedural things off the top here.

9
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:42,119
[SPEAKER_03]: As of right now, I do not have a quorum for this meeting.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take some items out of order.

11
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:47,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told that I would have a quorum tonight.

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for one member.

13
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:55,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So as of right now, we will not be kind of taking any votes or accepting any

14
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:58,994
[SPEAKER_03]: new applications, et cetera.

15
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:12,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Attorney Desmond, I wanted to let you know that as it pertains to 38 Pearl Street, Kit has to recuse herself because she has a conflict of interest.

16
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:18,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will not have a quorum for tonight to vote to lift that demo delay.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, we will have to table that to next month.

18
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:29,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there's no way to table up to another time to take vote separate from that.

19
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:33,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't make that decision right now because I don't have enough people here.

20
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:45,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I would need to try to see if I could gather, you know, the three, three of the other members between now and the next meeting, which I'm happy to try and do.

21
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't answer that question right now.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

23
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:49,145
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

24
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:56,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will work on that, and I will let you know, and we will do everything we can to try to get it done before our September meeting.

25
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

26
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:59,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

28
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

29
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I saw Ed come in.

30
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:08,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Ed, thank you so much.

31
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:10,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

32
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:12,933
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's okay.

33
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:23,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to let you know that for tonight, 38 Pearl Street will be tabled because Kit has to recuse herself, so we don't have enough people to vote on that.

34
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:32,010
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll try to pull together maybe a one-off meeting for that to get that property owner going on that project.

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that and see if we can get that scheduled before our September meeting.

36
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:48,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let me just kind of back up here and just start at the top of our agenda.

37
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: As it pertains to 18 Wedgmere Road, I just wanted to put this one to bed officially.

38
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:01,601
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not be having a preferably preserved hearing here.

39
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:04,724
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant has withdrawn their request

40
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:11,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Demolition request officially it was a little kind of back and forth there for a couple of months.

41
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:15,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have asked to withdrawn and they may or may not come before us in the future.

42
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:19,413
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're getting an architect and trying to figure out what they're going to do there.

43
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:26,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just wanted to, since that's been hanging on our agenda for a few months, just wanted to officially let folks know that there will not be a vote there.

44
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:31,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And that 1 is pretty much complete at this point.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,321
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the homeowners are willing to take it.

46
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:44,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, tonight we are going to accept an application for 18 Cherry Street.

47
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioners, I did send around the link to accept the application.

48
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:54,731
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody would like to make a motion for that one, I will take it when someone's ready.

49
00:03:54,751 --> 00:04:06,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I move that we accept the application of 18 Cherry Street.

50
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:07,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Doug.

51
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:08,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a second?

52
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:13,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second.

53
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I heard you first, Kit, so thank you.

54
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:21,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, motion on the table to accept the demolition application for 18 Cherry Street.

55
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do a roll call vote as I see people on my screen.

56
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:26,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Kit?

57
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:27,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

58
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:28,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug?

59
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:29,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

60
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:30,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed?

61
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:31,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

62
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:33,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am a yes as well.

63
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will be a 4-0 acceptance.

64
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So next month, we will have a significance hearing for that property.

65
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be continued to next month.

66
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:59,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to skip over the Form Bs for now, just because we have some other that's more administrative work.

67
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug, do you want to do 56 Wareham now?

68
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can put it on screen.

69
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a second.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sid and Yale, welcome.

72
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:14,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you guys.

73
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:24,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And also said just for clarity, we will put Alexander on next month.

74
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:33,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take the application and do significance for Alexander since we missed the agenda, but we'll order the form B so we can do both next month.

75
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we'll do significance for Cherry and Alexander next month.

76
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:38,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

77
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:39,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

78
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:40,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Yale is here.

79
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:41,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

80
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:41,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Yale.

81
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:41,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

82
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:48,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, are you okay to take minutes?

83
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:51,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

84
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:52,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I am taking them.

85
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:57,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having some problems with the audio, so I may stop and ask for some repeats, but yes.

86
00:05:57,718 --> 00:05:58,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

87
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:05,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Sid Gelot and Yale Gates from Tree Top Development here to talk about 56 Wareham Street.

88
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sid and Yale, I apologize because we only have Doug here tonight from the,

89
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,739
[SPEAKER_03]: subcommittee, Peter and Eleni are both out.

90
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:28,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can definitely kind of look at where we're at with the plans and get you on your way to your next iteration.

91
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:40,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I mean, yeah, you can talk more about whatever feedbacks were given the previous meeting, we'll try to incorporate.

92
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:42,796
[SPEAKER_06]: most of them or all of them.

93
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if this is something to your liking.

94
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:51,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

95
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug, do you want to just go over this one a little bit?

96
00:06:55,864 --> 00:07:00,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So this property is under demo delay, just to give a recap.

97
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:05,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to work on some demolition mitigation here.

98
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Are these the plans you want to see or do you want to see the three-dimensional view?

99
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:15,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the exteriors, the elevations.

100
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:16,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

101
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:17,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

102
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:30,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the last email that I saw, last email I saw from Peter said, I like the design direction.

103
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the roof decks and the roof cutout.

104
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:33,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It breaks down the massing.

105
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember that as well.

106
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:43,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the subcommittee had a consensus that this was a good direction.

107
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not a literal historic restoration.

108
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:56,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It was trying to do something a little creative, which we thought was very successful for both amassing and connecting basically the volumes of the building.

109
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:03,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pretty sure the subcommittee was satisfied with the last version, Jen, based on the emails that I think you were copied on as well.

110
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:14,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I just, Ryan did email in some feedback, so I'd like to just share that with Yale, since I know that we're still kind of in the preliminary designs here.

111
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan's feedback was, I feel the new addition is eating the existing house.

112
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see more of the forward mass retained.

113
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay that there are large additions on the rear.

114
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:27,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no issues with those.

115
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,216
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure how much,

116
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we can do there, but I know that, you know, Peter and Eleni and I, it sounds like Doug to for the most part we're generally okay with this direction.

117
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:48,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's, I think that's the case.

118
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:52,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I think actually I mostly defer to Eleni on this one.

119
00:08:53,274 --> 00:09:06,317
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I remember correctly, the only comment I saw was it was a, you can see here on the top of the three elevations, I think we'd requested some small windows be added.

120
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,858
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a staircase there on that elevation.

121
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:15,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, there are no windows there now, but we thought with the prominence of that elevation, we wanted to see

122
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,088
[SPEAKER_07]: just a little bit more of a breakup of that one.

123
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:25,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you take obviously Ryan's comments as well.

124
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:37,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure exactly if that's enough direction for the architect here to do, but I think there's one last iteration here.

125
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:45,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll be ready to close this out, but I think you got to take Ryan's comments into consideration and then I think we'll be done.

126
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:57,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I'm happy to Yale or said if you have anything to go back to him with or want to think about it and then just, you know, send in a little bit more based on that comment, you know, happy to.

127
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:04,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, could you repeat that and yell if you are able to understand it correctly?

128
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:05,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me hear it again.

129
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

130
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:07,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

131
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:11,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan's comment was, I feel the new edition is eating the existing house.

132
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:16,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see more of the forward mass retained.

133
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:20,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no problem with the large additions on the rear.

134
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:29,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, Yale is the architect.

135
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:37,807
[SPEAKER_06]: But looking at what she has done, I know maybe he's talking about the side view, the addition.

136
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:44,910
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're looking from the front, it blends in from whatever the front is and the side and this.

137
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:52,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we having a higher height yield in the back?

138
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it bigger or taller or something?

139
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,113
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit taller so we can use an attic because the attic is non-usable.

140
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:04,314
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think I understand, remember this is the second iteration.

141
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:10,577
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that you saw where I kept the facade the way it is, there was a small dormer here close to

142
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:17,121
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the facade of the existing house, which I kind of kept.

143
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:23,205
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as I reworked the layout and where I placed my stairs, it kind of didn't work.

144
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:28,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took that small, maybe you can look at those drawings, the previous one.

145
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:34,232
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe he's trying to say keep that, but that's not going to work with

146
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:37,985
[SPEAKER_00]: the layout and the stair because I need the head height, right?

147
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:47,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he's telling me that he wants to keep that dormer, it tells me that I have to reshuffle all the layout of the first unit, like the front unit.

148
00:11:48,851 --> 00:12:01,517
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is that really needed because that dormer does not repeat again and then it's gonna look different height and a little bit different dimensions from the other more modern dormers that are,

149
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:05,599
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the language but are different dimensions, right?

150
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,140
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that it's not going to look like a mess if I have two different ones.

151
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to understand if that's what he meant because I am keeping, you know, not just the facade.

152
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:24,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping, you know, a few feet in of that, you know, of that original mass of the house, right?

153
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I can try to find on my computer what it was.

154
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to hazard a guess here.

155
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:44,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard for me to read Brian's brain here, but I think when I look at the image on the top of the screen here, is that there's a blend between the two masses.

156
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:51,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the three vertical windows are like a bridge.

157
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:55,323
[SPEAKER_07]: If I were to infer what he said, I think he's saying almost like,

158
00:12:57,082 --> 00:13:01,965
[SPEAKER_07]: define the end of the existing mass a little bit without changing the plan.

159
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:04,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about articulation, at least I think it is.

160
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:05,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can confirm with him.

161
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:14,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that the front mass has a definition to it where it ends, so to speak.

162
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:18,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's the blending is what he's referring to.

163
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,794
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my take on this comment.

164
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:25,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe if you want to put something on the screen to compare what we had last time to this,

165
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:29,391
[SPEAKER_07]: We can take another look and see if we can infer any more.

166
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:35,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also happy to clarify that with him and send you some notes tomorrow, Yael.

167
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:36,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

168
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:36,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

169
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:47,644
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the blending between the two kind of fissures, you know, the existing historic one and the new one, which I'm showing in a kind of almost black, right?

170
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:52,688
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you mean, or if he means keeping that mass of the dormer,

171
00:13:54,276 --> 00:14:01,120
[SPEAKER_00]: off the exit, because if I push back the new house even more, then yes, that dormer would appear, right?

172
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the dormer was right there.

173
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:06,844
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work with my layout, and the layout is nice.

174
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,986
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you looked at it, but it's a nice layout.

175
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:15,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the different dormers will look a little strange, in my opinion.

176
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't want this to look too messy.

177
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,173
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already dormers, roof decks, a lot going on on the roof level.

178
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:24,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually agree with you.

179
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think dormer types are the answer.

180
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you have a language here.

181
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:35,719
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a language of shared dormers around the first floor on multiple sides on both pieces, which I think is successful.

182
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The two dormers being the same on both, I don't think that's a problem.

183
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:43,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see that being an issue.

184
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:44,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think Ryan is either.

185
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:48,065
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's get his comments to you.

186
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:53,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll clarify that with him, and then I can send a follow-up email tomorrow.

187
00:14:54,669 --> 00:15:03,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, hopefully, if you guys wanna do another, you know, we'll do the final pass, and then maybe we'll be ready to vote next month.

188
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:05,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

189
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:06,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

190
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:07,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

191
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:08,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

192
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, awesome.

193
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

194
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:11,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

195
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:12,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

196
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:13,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

197
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think, Sid, we're good with all your stuff for tonight.

198
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

199
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you everybody for that.

200
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:31,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So 56 Wareham, hopefully we'll be able to vote to lift that demo delay next month.

201
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will follow up with Ryan on his comments to clarify and get those notes to Yale for next month, for this week.

202
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

203
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:54,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Nelson, I, I just gonna, uh, God, before I move on to the next thing, Nelson, I just wanted to let you know that we had to table 38 Pearl tonight.

204
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because I don't, Kit has to recuse herself with a conflict.

205
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I don't have enough people to take a vote.

206
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just spoke to attorney Desmond and we're going to try.

207
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:08,388
[SPEAKER_03]: to squeeze you in before the September meeting so that we can lift that.

208
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:11,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to let you know that that was happening.

209
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:19,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will follow up with Attorney Desmond in the next couple of days to see if we can get something scheduled before the September meeting.

210
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

211
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm so sorry.

212
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an unexpected absences from three commissioners tonight.

213
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:29,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, awesome.

214
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:29,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.

215
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

216
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:37,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, you want to talk about the Riverside Ave Plaza?

217
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:40,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that would be great.

218
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, welcome.

219
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:42,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

220
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:44,839
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

221
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for having me.

222
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Amanda Centrello.

223
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office.

224
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:56,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And do I have permission to share my screen?

225
00:16:56,206 --> 00:17:02,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have a little presentation just to have visuals to talk to, if you all would find it helpful.

226
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,201
[SPEAKER_03]: We would find it helpful.

227
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, you should be able to share your screen now.

228
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:10,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's give that a try.

229
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:27,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's my understanding that you're looking for a letter of support for this project from us.

230
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,492
[SPEAKER_03]: That is our takeaway.

231
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:49,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, or or comments about the project and so basically to give a little context, we are office applied for a parkland acquisition and renovation for communities grant park grant state program to kind of.

232
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,263
[SPEAKER_01]: implement some like targeted treatments to the existing Riverside Plaza.

233
00:17:55,764 --> 00:18:03,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of that application process, we submit a description of the project and some materials to the State Historical Commission.

234
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:15,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they sent us a response, which I forwarded to you all, which asked for a couple of things, namely that we come before this commission

235
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:28,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And they asked for some more detailed documents, which I'll make a note at the beginning of this that part of our grant application was actually funding to create those documents.

236
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:36,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have detailed designs or construction documents to show, but we do have some conceptual designs.

237
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:44,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're happy to talk through questions or see what information we can provide.

238
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:46,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right.

239
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:50,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, and can folks see my screen?

240
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:51,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

241
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:51,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

242
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:52,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

243
00:18:53,571 --> 00:19:01,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give a little overview, Riverside Plaza is in Medford Square, as I'm sure you guys are familiar.

244
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:05,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nestled up against the Salem Street Burying Ground historic site.

245
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of surrounded by a business district.

246
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:16,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are lots of little shops and some great restaurants right nearby.

247
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:20,250
[SPEAKER_01]: You will frequently find me at the Ebisu Japanese Market across the street.

248
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:32,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see from the overhead shot here that there's the patio and then sort of adjacent to the patio on the right hand side is this kind of lawn area where there are some mature oak trees.

249
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,955
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about both of those areas.

250
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:41,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a couple of shots of the existing plaza as you can see the patio.

251
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:48,619
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really beautiful space and it is used so frequently during the shoulder seasons to summer.

252
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So spring and fall when temperatures are just a little bit more mild.

253
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great spot with a lot of seating and

254
00:19:57,332 --> 00:20:02,416
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could easily see someone grabbing lunch at one of the places nearby and bringing it here.

255
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:17,966
[SPEAKER_01]: The left-hand photo shows sort of the other side of the plaza that there's like a walkway that goes along this like lawn area that we're going to be referring to, which is adjacent to the cemetery.

256
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:23,350
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more photos just to kind of give a feel.

257
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:31,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what we have in mind is we think that the plaza operates really well.

258
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:38,577
[SPEAKER_01]: It's again a great spot that is used actually very heavily throughout the shoulder seasons of the year.

259
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:45,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the main challenges that we think that this spot has is that there is no shade.

260
00:20:45,613 --> 00:21:03,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've observed periodically throughout the past year is that the way that most people use it during hot days is to pull the mobile chairs and tables underneath the lawn area where there are those existing trees, understandably, because there's great shade.

261
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,080
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge, let me see if I can just zip ahead a little bit.

262
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:14,007
[SPEAKER_01]: is that there's not an accessible route to that space.

263
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead, there's just this sad patch of dirt.

264
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass can't really establish there because people are constantly traversing back and forth.

265
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:35,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not great for the trees that are in that area to have erosion of that soil and also compaction of what's there and some exposed tree roots.

266
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:37,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go back here.

267
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:44,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're thinking about is the way that people are already using the plaza is to go under those trees.

268
00:21:44,183 --> 00:22:00,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could provide a floating deck around the base of the trees into part of that area and a ramp up to there so that there's an accessible route to that space, maybe some additional mobile furniture for people to use in place up there.

269
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:05,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in addition to that, to create some shade in the patio area because it is so nice.

270
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:13,380
[SPEAKER_01]: We would certainly be keeping some sunny spots, but we were proposing to add some shade sails.

271
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little bit better, more clear graphic.

272
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is just sort of a conceptual plan.

273
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:26,123
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a couple of posts where these shade sails, they are commercial grade, so they could stay up throughout the year.

274
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:31,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be taken down maybe for winter, although you can leave them up.

275
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:34,325
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably just might wear a little bit faster that way.

276
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a rendering again to kind of give us a sense of what that could look and feel like.

277
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:45,569
[SPEAKER_01]: The deck is about 1,000 square feet.

278
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:50,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's in this sort of area off of the walkway.

279
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:56,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a rendering just again to give us a feel of what that could look like.

280
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:59,594
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks great.

281
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:07,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a couple of, you know, again, our grant application included a couple of these furniture pieces.

282
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:11,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some existing light bollards already in the area.

283
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:16,139
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would, you know, use the same style of bollards to light the back end of the deck.

284
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:26,184
[SPEAKER_01]: We were considering a drinking fountain and water bottle filler, given that it gets so hot in that area, and it's actually part of what the state calls a hot spot.

285
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:33,174
[SPEAKER_01]: daytime temperatures reached reach a certain point for you know periods of the year, typically in the summer.

286
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:42,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So having water there could be really, I think, a helpful public health amenity, and then some more table seating.

287
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:50,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll pause a bit and kind of pivot to the 2017 renovation.

288
00:23:50,679 --> 00:24:01,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So y'all may remember better than I do that this area used to be kind of like a underutilized bus stop with brick paving, I want to say.

289
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:06,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the renovation in 2016 was informed by community input.

290
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:15,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And was possible through a land and water conservation fund grant, which is actually a very similar grant program to the one we're applying to.

291
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:24,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the, the project team went through the same process of providing project materials to the state historical commission.

292
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,079
[SPEAKER_01]: describing the project.

293
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,760
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, for whatever reason, no comments were received at that time.

294
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:44,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But this renovation was much, I think, I would argue, much more disruptive and bigger in scale and scope than what we're thinking about, which is, I would like to say, a bit more targeted.

295
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:53,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to kind of give you all a feel, so in this existing plaza, there are a lot of footings that are already there.

296
00:24:54,578 --> 00:25:00,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to name a few, we have these chimes that are actually in the area that we're talking about for the lawn area.

297
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:09,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And those footings are, I think, traditional, just like concrete cylinders that are about three feet deep and a foot wide.

298
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:14,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see more of that for other types of fixtures within the patio area.

299
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like a interpretive

300
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:21,574
[SPEAKER_01]: sign panel and those light bollards.

301
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:36,020
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, I think, some wall seating, all of which require footings at and around the depths that we're talking about for the treatments we have in mind, the shade sails and the decking.

302
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:44,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a couple of photos from that time that kind of show all of the work that was underway there.

303
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:57,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is my last bit, and then we can pause for questions and go over any of what I've already talked about.

304
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:08,097
[SPEAKER_01]: But the duck product that we're looking at, we chose initially because it was meant to limit the disruption to the soil.

305
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:16,583
[SPEAKER_01]: We were most concerned initially about the existing tree roots that are there in that lawn area, and the way that these

306
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:25,690
[SPEAKER_01]: diamond pier pilings work is you sort of have this like node through which you have these bearing pins that go into the ground at angles.

307
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:33,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually to install them, you don't have to excavate, you don't need any heavy equipment, which is kind of wonderful.

308
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:40,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And you install them with this sort of like, I'll show you in a very small video clip, but like a hand tool.

309
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:45,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I have that.

310
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right here.

311
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:51,536
[SPEAKER_02]: The diamond pier is a totally new way to think about engineered footings.

312
00:26:52,796 --> 00:27:00,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Like tree roots, the load bearing pins and systems are not the sort of tool that pushes the bearing pins in.

313
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Each diamond without having to actually dig into the soil.

314
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:11,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And Amanda, those pier foundations are purely for the wood deck, the 1,019 square foot wood deck, right?

315
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's correct.

316
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:21,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the shade sails, which is the other half of this conversation, I would imagine we would do a traditional footing.

317
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:26,274
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't been designed yet because, again, we're sort of just at a conceptual point.

318
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:39,457
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did notice that there are light posts in the plaza that are at the same sort of height around which we'd have the posts for these shade sails.

319
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:47,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think because I counted five posts per sale times two.

320
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have 10 new foundations.

321
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:52,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think, look, this is a great design.

322
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:58,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's all additive, which is great about this, is that you're building on the success of this space already.

323
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:04,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there for a mini concert and a beer garden and a bunch of events.

324
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that it could use a little bit more real estate and obviously adding shade.

325
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: both under the existing trees, usable area, and on the open plaza, which is baked spot.

326
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:19,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, every single day it's sunny because it's almost due south.

327
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great addition to tweak this space.

328
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:29,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure this is going to continue over the years, but this to me looks like a really good start.

329
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:36,985
[SPEAKER_07]: The only question I had is I saw that little, I guess it was a plaque on a rock on the right in the middle of the wood stuff.

330
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:43,256
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have to be raised, I would think, if it would be visible, because you're up about a foot or so, I think.

331
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:48,019
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to put some kind of new foundation, I think, under that to make that work.

332
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,141
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.

333
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:58,628
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that I had noticed last week as I was going through all the materials, there is this memorial plaque boulder in that area.

334
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:00,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think.

335
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:08,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It's small enough that I think we would need to raise it as opposed to having the deck go around it.

336
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, yeah.

337
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:11,313
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it for, do we know?

338
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,163
[SPEAKER_03]: For the whole plaza?

339
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:14,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

340
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:17,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the other option is maybe you move it.

341
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if it's possible to move the stone.

342
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:23,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be a better choice.

343
00:29:23,871 --> 00:29:29,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I think moving it is worth considering it because it's going to be really hard to build that foundation and the wood around it's going to be very uneven.

344
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:31,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, Jen.

345
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:34,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we put it a little further down the pathway.

346
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:39,108
[SPEAKER_07]: along the linear path that goes in the direction towards City Hall.

347
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:48,301
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 50 feet there where it could probably just be right on the side and be fully accessible like it is now from ADA perspective, et cetera.

348
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:50,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would clean it up a little bit.

349
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:54,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't be this tripping hazard in the middle of the deck also.

350
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a good idea, Jim.

351
00:29:56,515 --> 00:30:03,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and if it's in a better visible spot so that people will stop and read it and kind of pay attention to what it's for.

352
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:09,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And you won't need a foundation, Rob, more than just a really simple one.

353
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

354
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great idea.

355
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm scarred by the marker at the POMS wall.

356
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:22,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like anytime we have a marker, we need to make sure it's in a good spot for people to access it.

357
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:23,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.

358
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:29,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

359
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think this looks great.

360
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:34,346
[SPEAKER_03]: The shade sails are obviously very much needed.

361
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:38,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the deck over that dirt patch looks great.

362
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:53,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think this with, you know, all the renovations happening at the high rise building there, where the seniors live, you know, it's just going to be, you know, a lovely outdoor space for people to use and to continue to use.

363
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:57,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

364
00:30:57,642 --> 00:31:01,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Amanda, could you go back to the rendering, the three-dimensional rendering, looking at that wood deck?

365
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:03,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a few slides back, I think.

366
00:31:05,624 --> 00:31:06,024
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

367
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:11,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the deck will actually be above on the left side.

368
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,006
[SPEAKER_07]: You see where the brick piers are?

369
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:18,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be able to see under that deck, I think, at the high points.

370
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:22,429
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll have to be some kind of closure piece there, because it would look a little weird from the cemetery side.

371
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,550
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a detail you guys can figure out.

372
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:26,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

373
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need any railings because it's one to 20 or less.

374
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,977
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't fall off the edge of it very far.

375
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:34,418
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need any guardrails either.

376
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a very simple and minimal design, but it gets you a lot of bang for that buck.

377
00:31:42,555 --> 00:31:56,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we so I think I think in with Doug's comment to on that side if there's if it's open, you know, you don't like if they're leaf blowing or if there's any maintenance in the territory, you don't want stuff kind of getting under that is that cause it to rot.

378
00:31:58,307 --> 00:31:59,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to from like a.

379
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:03,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe you want critters under there if they're trying to get to them.

380
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:08,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But there could be some critter management that needs to happen under here.

381
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:18,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's going to be, especially with the access by the tree, it's going to be just a sweet little spot for little things to borrow and make a home, which maybe is OK.

382
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:19,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's what we want.

383
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, I don't know, maybe just talk

384
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if something has to go down on the ground first to make it less inviting environment.

385
00:32:30,963 --> 00:32:32,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that's not really our purview.

386
00:32:32,823 --> 00:32:42,905
[SPEAKER_03]: But just thinking from, obviously, the conversations around critters are high and mighty these days in Medford.

387
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:47,526
[SPEAKER_07]: So just thinking through when you have- There'll be a condo of rabbits.

388
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:47,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

389
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:48,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

390
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:49,627
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've seen around Medford.

391
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

392
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:57,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, you know, thinking when you have that void, that'll be a little home for things.

393
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:57,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

394
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:58,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

395
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:01,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can give some thought to how we treat that.

396
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:09,562
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an open edge, it looks like it would be based on this rendering, at least along the cemetery wall there.

397
00:33:09,622 --> 00:33:12,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also like where the tree bases are.

398
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:16,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you might need an access panel to be able to see.

399
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:18,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say it's only a foot higher?

400
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what all it is?

401
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like 13 inches.

402
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,502
[SPEAKER_07]: With the framing, it's going to be like four inches below the framing.

403
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:34,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really small in there, so it's going to be hard other than a rodent or a muskrat to get in there or something.

404
00:33:37,026 --> 00:33:39,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't want trash getting under there either.

405
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:42,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think the way you closed it off is good.

406
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,208
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got to continue it.

407
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:53,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there adequate, I think this looks fantastic, and I've been there in the summer and it definitely needs some shade.

408
00:33:54,669 --> 00:34:03,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Just looking at this deck and looking at that tree though, I'm wondering if there's adequate, if that tree's going to get any water.

409
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:08,878
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing about, so the deck will be able to infiltrate.

410
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:18,146
[SPEAKER_01]: This rendering doesn't do the kind of panel type structure that I think we have in mind justice.

411
00:34:18,586 --> 00:34:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of just looks like a block.

412
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:25,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But there will be, it's the part of our concern

413
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:38,775
[SPEAKER_01]: which was communicated to the design team we're working with is that water be able to get through and that we'd be able to not disrupt the tree roots and not disrupt the soil too much.

414
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is part of the design intent.

415
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:48,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can stress that with the design team as we move into more detailed design.

416
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:55,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a, do we know what kind of tree that is, is a Norway maple?

417
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're both oak.

418
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

419
00:34:59,361 --> 00:34:59,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

420
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:03,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

421
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:07,124
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks lovely.

422
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we could write up our comments if that would be helpful.

423
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:18,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then get you over a letter that you can submit with your, um,

424
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:23,054
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you need for your next phase.

425
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan did have a comment.

426
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:28,897
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not here tonight, but he did email me a comment to read.

427
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:31,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And he writes, I support this project.

428
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:41,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We should help her make it clear to Mass Historical that the disturbance to the soils will be minimal, which I think we can all agree with those pylons it will be.

429
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Historical will likely not budge on their requests.

430
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,507
[SPEAKER_03]: The sooner you get them their info, the sooner you'll get your approval.

431
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:58,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug, would you be able to start a draft letter?

432
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm happy to do so.

433
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

434
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, what is your deadline?

435
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:12,505
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.

436
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:15,908
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't really given us one.

437
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:23,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grant submission was due July 11th, which is around when we sent in all of our stuff.

438
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:26,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, I guess, in sort of a decision-making phase.

439
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:34,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly when they make final decisions, but I will reach out to them just for an update on that timeline and can communicate that to y'all.

440
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the sooner, the better.

441
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:39,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand, too, that

442
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:41,887
[SPEAKER_01]: you have plenty of things to do.

443
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:44,729
[SPEAKER_07]: This won't take long.

444
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:47,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

445
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:55,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if Ed, I know Ed's here.

446
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:57,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have any other comments?

447
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:00,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we good with this project?

448
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:03,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks terrific.

449
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:04,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It does look terrific.

450
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:07,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

451
00:37:08,322 --> 00:37:09,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Amanda.

452
00:37:09,863 --> 00:37:10,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.

453
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hearing us on short notice.

454
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:13,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, no worries.

455
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:20,725
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to help and we'll get you that letter and let us know if we can help you with anything else as it pertains to this project.

456
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:21,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

457
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:22,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

458
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:23,686
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

459
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:27,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

460
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:32,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, up next we have Teresa, our friend, Teresa DuPont.

461
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:38,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everybody.

462
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it took forever for me to move that three inches.

463
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:41,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.

464
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:43,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

465
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:47,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have a couple things to update us on.

466
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:53,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you'd like to go forward and yeah.

467
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:55,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

468
00:37:55,361 --> 00:38:00,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those who don't know me, Theresa DuPont, I am the City's Community Preservation Act Manager.

469
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked

470
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:08,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I know everybody, but what brings me here tonight is we are at the beginning of our application round.

471
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:17,525
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of things, I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have on some CPA projects that the Historical Commission is undergoing.

472
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:20,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that that was in like old business, so if we

473
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:23,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm here to answer any questions on that.

474
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I would really love for this commission to consider tonight is one of the applications we received was to do some restoration at the Hegner Center at 15 Maple Park Avenue.

475
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:41,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Historically, it's known as the Ralph L. Kendall Fieldhouse, I believe it was his middle initial.

476
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:48,531
[SPEAKER_05]: This commission did order a Form B assessment done by our friend Mr. Clemson in the fall of 2019.

477
00:38:51,294 --> 00:39:05,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a new to this board request here, but when I reached out to Ryan, lo and behold, at that time, it was verbally discussed as being significant, but there wasn't the paperwork end of it done.

478
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here tonight to ask, administratively, does it need to be sussed out again or can that just be picked back up from 2019?

479
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:22,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, again, I'm looking for that letter to accompany the application to the CPC.

480
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:28,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we need to start over.

481
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we determine significance, I would just double check.

482
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:40,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go back and check our minutes, just double check that we actually voted and that we deemed it significant.

483
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:47,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And assuming we did, we can definitely fire off a letter so that you have that for your application.

484
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:49,155
[SPEAKER_05]: fantastic.

485
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's our applications are due.

486
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:58,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the day after the body meets in September.

487
00:39:58,143 --> 00:40:00,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I was really hoping to get onto this agenda.

488
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for taking the time there.

489
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:11,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy to answer any questions that anybody has on it, but especially about the project, in particular, because it has been a

490
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:18,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Unused, I wouldn't even say underutilized, but just straight up unused building in the city's inventory for many years.

491
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:19,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

492
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:24,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you want to give us a little rundown, I remember.

493
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,992
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the athletic center or the old.

494
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:33,846
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little, yeah, I remember seeing the form B on this.

495
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:35,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember discussing it for sure.

496
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:39,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely before kids time on our commission.

497
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed might have been on as well.

498
00:40:42,694 --> 00:40:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but if you want to refresh us, that would be great.

499
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:47,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, yes.

500
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a building that is attached to Gillis Field over in North Medford area.

501
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:02,195
[SPEAKER_05]: It was built, I believe, in 1927 as to be used as the field house for the athletic operations for Gillis Field.

502
00:41:03,056 --> 00:41:12,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 93 came through in the 50s, and it got kind of repurposed, I believe, over the course of many, many decades.

503
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:19,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe in the 80s or 90s, it landed in the ownership of Hegner.

504
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:24,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Bridgewell was the private home

505
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:31,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was home care for adults with physical and mental needs.

506
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:40,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was taken by the city in the early mid 2000s and been kind of sitting, doing nothing since then.

507
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,216
[SPEAKER_05]: The building itself needs a lot of work.

508
00:41:44,856 --> 00:41:52,639
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can imagine, when you leave a building alone for 15, 20 years, it was often unused by the city for various operations, trainings and whatnot.

509
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:56,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't been properly maintained for many years.

510
00:41:56,797 --> 00:42:05,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So roof, what CPC will be reviewing is for roof repairs, windows, as well as doorways.

511
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:13,928
[SPEAKER_05]: There is much work to be done inside in terms of interior restoration, HVAC, the whole shebang.

512
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And the future of this building is going to be the home for Medford Rec, is that correct?

513
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:22,648
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the goal is to move.

514
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:25,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if it'll be like the home base.

515
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not privy to that quite yet.

516
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:30,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still up in there, but it absolutely will be used for recreational use.

517
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:36,757
[SPEAKER_05]: They're thinking of moving a lot of the afterschool programming to the center, which would be great.

518
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:47,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It would also be used as the city's resiliency hub, which is a fancy phrase for basically whenever there is any sort of emergency to be able to deploy

519
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:49,990
[SPEAKER_05]: supplies to our residents.

520
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:57,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will be a resiliency hub slash recreational usage center, which is great.

521
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,674
[SPEAKER_05]: As a resident of North Medford, I welcome it, so.

522
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

523
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioners, does anybody have any questions for Teresa on this?

524
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a couple of things.

525
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Teresa, I know that about

526
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:23,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Or 5 years ago, I wasn't sure if it was cash or somebody asked me to look at that building or adaptive reuse.

527
00:43:23,592 --> 00:43:25,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they were looking for a center.

528
00:43:26,352 --> 00:43:29,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember, like, uh, I thought.

529
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:36,815
[SPEAKER_07]: But the 2nd floor wasn't worth putting an elevator because it was such a small footprint and not really much.

530
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:43,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Available real estate, I don't know if any kind of that analysis has been done or not, but the 1st floor obviously has.

531
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Tremendous value, you know, the infrastructure is there to do a lot of good things in the, in the.

532
00:43:49,123 --> 00:43:55,009
[SPEAKER_07]: The ground floor, but the 2nd, 2nd floor looks looked really tough to me to get make it work on a couple of different fundamental levels.

533
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:55,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone look at that?

534
00:43:56,731 --> 00:44:00,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that they have it was a cache.

535
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:01,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It may have been in conjunction with our.

536
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:06,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford collaborative, they were looking for an art center.

537
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:10,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a feasibility study in hand as part of their efforts there.

538
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:18,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are borrowing that intelligence that they gathered to utilize the final plan for the inside there.

539
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think anybody's really planning on blowing out any dormers and really making that second floor significantly usable.

540
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody might have a fancy office up there, but it would just be a very small footprint.

541
00:44:34,102 --> 00:44:40,265
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was the elevator that I was concerned about because you're going to spend a quarter million dollars to get an accessibility up there for a tiny real estate.

542
00:44:40,325 --> 00:44:41,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what the plan is now?

543
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:52,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked about an elevator usage because that would be an eligible CTA expense, and I was informed that they're not considering it at this time.

544
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

545
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:56,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that really the plan is to

546
00:44:57,888 --> 00:44:59,649
[SPEAKER_05]: utilize the first floor there.

547
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And then second floor, we're always looking for places to put files.

548
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:17,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we, yeah, we can definitely get you a letter for that one for significance.

549
00:45:18,261 --> 00:45:19,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

550
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:19,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

551
00:45:19,942 --> 00:45:21,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

552
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:27,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The Curtis Tufts Tufts School, we sent you that letter, I think.

553
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:28,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

554
00:45:28,613 --> 00:45:30,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have everything you need for that.

555
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

556
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:33,455
[SPEAKER_05]: The fires have been put out.

557
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for your help with that.

558
00:45:36,056 --> 00:45:36,396
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

559
00:45:37,837 --> 00:45:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah.

560
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:40,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can definitely do that.

561
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:44,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will let you know if for some reason a vote wasn't taken.

562
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:52,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But we might be trying to squeeze in a demo, lifting a demo delay since we did not have a quorum tonight.

563
00:45:55,032 --> 00:46:01,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can all like if we're getting another group together, we can vote on that if we have to as well.

564
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:07,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that based off of this conversation, it sounds like the board is in favor of supporting this.

565
00:46:07,255 --> 00:46:09,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of less pressure right now.

566
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:15,256
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably wait and put like the September regular meeting for this board.

567
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:17,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't want to make that meeting any longer.

568
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:22,113
[SPEAKER_05]: then it needs to be, but we can wait till September.

569
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

570
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:28,775
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do end up getting together and it's just a matter of officially voting, we can probably make it happen.

571
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

572
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:39,638
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get the letter drafted in the meantime and just make sure procedurally things are buttoned up before we give it to you.

573
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:39,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

574
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

575
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:43,501
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, great.

576
00:46:44,662 --> 00:46:45,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a great project.

577
00:46:45,682 --> 00:46:47,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to hear that that's moving forward.

578
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:51,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we talked about that a hundred years ago, so nice to see some movement on it.

579
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:53,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're excited as well.

580
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:54,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

581
00:46:55,485 --> 00:46:56,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else for us?

582
00:46:58,926 --> 00:47:09,050
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, the DPW crew was able to get up to Thomas Brooks Park and Grove Street and do some cleanup along the stone wall that was there.

583
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:09,990
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out really nice.

584
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It does look good.

585
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:23,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely we're going to set up a meeting with Tim because there definitely needs to be some clearing behind the wall as well, because the growth is also out of control on the backside of the wall.

586
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you know, like we talked about, these are long term maintenance issues that need to come up with.

587
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:45,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think between that and Brooks Estate, we'll get a meeting with him to talk about how we can get on their kind of regular schedule or, you know, somewhat regularly, a couple of times a year to keep that maintained.

588
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:47,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but it does look a lot better.

589
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:49,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for helping with that.

590
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:50,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

591
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:56,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have been tag teaming with, just to get ahead of the agenda, I have been working with Ryan on Cross Street.

592
00:47:56,952 --> 00:48:04,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll hang back if you get to that later in the meeting, and I'll chime in if I have anything I can add to that conversation.

593
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:12,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, I can just give an update real quick, because he sent me some notes on that, just while we're talking about CP.

594
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:13,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not really it.

595
00:48:13,996 --> 00:48:15,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that really a CPC project?

596
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:18,558
[SPEAKER_05]: We're involved with the back end.

597
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:19,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

598
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: But the update that he sent me for that project, just to keep everybody in the loop, this is the Cross Street Cemetery.

599
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:33,698
[SPEAKER_03]: The archeological field work quotes are in and we're working on awarding the project.

600
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:37,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The excavation fees came in too high at over 30,000.

601
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:40,984
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to rebid to be in compliance with procurement.

602
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:45,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that I saw some emails that you guys were chatting about potentially

603
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:55,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a second conversation about trying to bring that back in-house so that, you know, the city gets the work instead of a vendor.

604
00:48:56,417 --> 00:49:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think more kind of ongoing conversations there to see if that's feasible or not.

605
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:05,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, we'll go back out to bid since it's more than 10,000.

606
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're in compliance with procurement.

607
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:15,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And then his last note was that the headstone study is underway.

608
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:19,748
[SPEAKER_03]: The final cost will not be ready for CPC applications in the fall.

609
00:49:20,348 --> 00:49:22,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll miss this year's cutoff, but that's okay.

610
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:26,290
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll work on getting that done and then we'll focus on next year.

611
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is ongoing, which is great.

612
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:34,846
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

613
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:35,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Teresa.

614
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:39,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for having me.

615
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:40,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night.

616
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:40,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you.

617
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:41,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

618
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:44,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see you too.

619
00:49:46,658 --> 00:49:47,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

620
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I will work with Ryan on that letter for that case for Teresa.

621
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:53,985
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my to-do there.

622
00:49:58,723 --> 00:50:00,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to throw this out.

623
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:16,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Teresa had sent around an email to our email about the preservation and changing climate event, which is taking place at the Peabody Essex Museum.

624
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:20,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it is September 18th.

625
00:50:21,831 --> 00:50:22,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me on that.

626
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:25,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just check to see if I have it in the email.

627
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, oh, here we go.

628
00:50:35,374 --> 00:50:36,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, yeah, September 18th.

629
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:36,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So we...

630
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:51,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can go at no, yeah, there is a registration fee, but it can be reimbursed for CPC members and CPA folks.

631
00:50:51,492 --> 00:51:02,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody would like to go, again, the topic is preservation in a changing climate, let me know and I can put you in touch with Teresa to get you registered.

632
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:05,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to put that out there to everybody.

633
00:51:05,504 --> 00:51:10,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll remind folks at the next meeting too, since we're a little light of commissioners this month.

634
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Just super quick, I had a meeting with Meg Bowen from the Medford Historical Society to talk about joint promotions between us and them.

635
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:35,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk more about this next month, because I'd like to talk about it with everybody here, but just trying to kind of revive our networking between our group and their group.

636
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:42,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually working on a fantastic calendar for the next 18 months of events that they would love us to help

637
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:53,801
[SPEAKER_03]: um, kind of co-sponsor and, you know, help with some, um, just to help getting the word out, which I think we're really good at doing on our socials, on our websites and just in our network as well.

638
00:51:54,262 --> 00:51:56,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can talk a little bit more about that next month.

639
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:58,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to continue that, um, to next month.

640
00:52:03,982 --> 00:52:17,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, our last bit of new business, we do need to order some form Bs, both for properties that came in tonight and some of ones that we know that we are getting a heads up on.

641
00:52:18,356 --> 00:52:23,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to read off the addresses so that we can put those into the meeting minutes.

642
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:35,434
[SPEAKER_03]: So kit, okay, form, and then I'll take a motion from somebody to spend the $500 for each of these Form Bs.

643
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:46,721
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 Cherry Street, 110 Brooks Street, 39 Wilson, 39 Marion, and 106 Alexander.

644
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:52,584
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all being considered for demo, and we need to have Form Bs on hand.

645
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:57,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Form Bs, so that would be $2,500.

646
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:00,430
[SPEAKER_03]: You said 18 Cherry, 110 Brooks, 39 Wilson, 39 Marion, and 106 Alexander.

647
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:00,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

648
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Does somebody want to make a motion to spend $2,500 for Form Bs for those five properties?

649
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:23,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a move.

650
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

651
00:53:24,514 --> 00:53:24,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ed.

652
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:25,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

653
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:29,255
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, Ed and Kit, thank you.

654
00:53:29,755 --> 00:53:31,516
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, $2,500 for five form Bs.

655
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote.

656
00:53:33,356 --> 00:53:33,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Kit?

657
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:34,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

658
00:53:35,197 --> 00:53:35,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug?

659
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

660
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:37,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed?

661
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:40,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

662
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a yes as well.

663
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will pass 4-0.

664
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,280
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

665
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:57,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody else have any new business for tonight?

666
00:54:01,461 --> 00:54:02,181
[SPEAKER_03]: No, okay.

667
00:54:02,662 --> 00:54:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we will move on to old business.

668
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:06,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

669
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:11,069
[SPEAKER_03]: We already talked about our demo delay properties tonight.

670
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So 56 Wareham is ongoing, 38 Pearl tonight is tabled, but we'll try to get that scheduled before September 9th.

671
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:23,666
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not heard from the folks at 27 Allmont.

672
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have not heard from anybody regarding 91 Winchester, the carriage house.

673
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:31,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So not too much update there.

674
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:39,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Permitting subcommittee, we are starting to get permits again.

675
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:48,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone back and forth between the building commissioners in terms of what they're inviting us to look at and what we're not being invited to look at.

676
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:54,515
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back on the more than not kind of track these days.

677
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:58,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ryan and I are going through the permits typically.

678
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: at least once a week, if not a little bit more frequently, depending on our schedules, so keeping those moving.

679
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:14,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's how some of the Form Bs that we have ordered, some projects that are kind of out there and starting to be discussed, which is a good thing.

680
00:55:15,126 --> 00:55:21,229
[SPEAKER_03]: The more we can have a heads up, the better, so that we can move folks along as quickly as possible through the process.

681
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:37,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So nothing too crazy there, just everybody's acquiring their properties and getting their permitting ready for the fall in anticipation of next spring for selling their renovations.

682
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:44,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross Street Cemetery are already updated folks on.

683
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:48,099
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have the update for Thomas Brooks.

684
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:50,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one other update for Thomas Brooks Park.

685
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:57,502
[SPEAKER_03]: As Teresa mentioned, we got the DPW out there to kind of clear some of the growth that was overtaking the curb.

686
00:55:58,362 --> 00:56:03,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We are trying to set up a meeting with Peter Hedlund, a public meeting to talk about

687
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:09,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, kind of the historic design that he floated by us and some of those.

688
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:16,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Caps so that we can move on for phase 2 of the project there.

689
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:22,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought we had a room for September 17th and it turns out we don't.

690
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:26,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the library is also booked.

691
00:56:26,965 --> 00:56:29,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking to bump that meeting.

692
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:37,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm working on getting a room and then working with Peter to find out his schedule so that we can get that scheduled so that we can give

693
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:51,316
[SPEAKER_03]: especially all the immediate neighbors, some notice so that they can come out and have their voices heard, and certainly anybody else in town that would like to come out and talk about the next phase of the project there.

694
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to be working on that date.

695
00:56:54,396 --> 00:57:00,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working with the library on an evening date, and that will be forthcoming.

696
00:57:00,758 --> 00:57:02,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we can lock that down this week.

697
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:07,160
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, that is the update for Thomas Brooks Park.

698
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:13,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan finished up the survey work for Fulton Heights.

699
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:14,374
[SPEAKER_03]: The project is done.

700
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to upload all the inventory forms to the drive when we have a minute, but we'll be able to close that out.

701
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:24,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do not have a survey product for the rest of this fiscal year.

702
00:57:24,616 --> 00:57:29,917
[SPEAKER_03]: We will pick up a new one next spring for the following fiscal year.

703
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:31,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a little bit of a break there.

704
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:37,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forgot to send around the meeting minutes.

705
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:39,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I have those in the email.

706
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:41,565
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you know what?

707
00:57:41,585 --> 00:57:45,790
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just gonna table the meeting minutes and we will approve them next month.

708
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,312
[SPEAKER_03]: We will approve July and August next month.

709
00:57:50,194 --> 00:57:53,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit of a mishmash of an event tonight.

710
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:57,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all thrown off since we are missing three people.

711
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:07,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was not expecting to have as robust of agenda as we did for the second week of August.

712
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:10,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize to everybody.

713
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:12,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little off my game tonight.

714
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have anything else for tonight?

715
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:24,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like for our agenda that flew by really fast.

716
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:29,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll circulate that letter.

717
00:58:29,736 --> 00:58:33,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already started writing it tomorrow just to get it going on Riverside.

718
00:58:33,861 --> 00:58:35,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be that hard to put that one to bed.

719
00:58:35,623 --> 00:58:37,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

720
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:41,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I have a question.

721
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, I'm the CPC liaison.

722
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:47,617
[SPEAKER_07]: When Teresa's here, she can update people, but do people want to have

723
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:51,020
[SPEAKER_07]: like a regular report.

724
00:58:51,220 --> 00:59:01,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really typically done that unless people have asked about specific projects because there's usually 10 or 15 applicants at least.

725
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:04,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes the money is there, sometimes it's a stretch.

726
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:11,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to know what degree people are interested in just in terms of my keeping them

727
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:12,663
[SPEAKER_07]: inform.

728
00:59:12,703 --> 00:59:20,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I could email minutes or I could email vacations to the people interested or it all depends what you're looking for me to share.

729
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:26,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I don't know that I'm lacking anything.

730
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:30,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the information that's out there is pretty available.

731
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:41,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, I don't know, maybe if there's anything of a heads up of things like this that you're like, well, we might get asked for support, because that's what affects us here.

732
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be so selfish that it has to be all only about historical commission and what we're doing, but.

733
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm always fascinated by CPC projects.

734
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:52,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So on one hand, I'm super interested.

735
00:59:52,793 --> 01:00:04,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the other hand, I feel like, you know, on social and kind of everywhere else, the information is pretty available once applications come in, or they're talking about or there's meetings, you know, just discuss these projects.

736
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd love to hear what everybody else has to say.

737
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:10,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly not on the right socials.

738
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:16,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I just need to do a little more perusing.

739
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:23,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I would be interested, but I don't think it should add to your workload, Doug.

740
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:31,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think if there's something that you could readily share or maybe just in the right direction.

741
01:00:31,901 --> 01:00:33,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I can probably pull together an executive summary.

742
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:38,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we get all the applications, there's a detailed process where they present

743
01:00:40,497 --> 01:00:47,241
[SPEAKER_07]: know, they get asked questions and usually there's an executive summary of the spreadsheet of like what is there.

744
01:00:47,261 --> 01:00:50,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's worth sharing because that gives you a sense.

745
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:55,226
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to see all the how the sausage is made perhaps, but at least you'll see what's coming.

746
01:00:55,867 --> 01:01:05,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you have any thoughts about priorities, you know, I could represent that obviously because, you know, sometimes we don't have enough money and we have to make choices and we don't fund

747
01:01:06,883 --> 01:01:09,664
[SPEAKER_07]: everything 100% if we don't have enough money.

748
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:13,045
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last couple of years, for the first time, that's been true.

749
01:01:14,346 --> 01:01:27,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the six cycles we've had, only one or two of them we've had to make some haircuts with some people wanting, say, 600,000, they got 400,000 for a park or even Brooks Estate.

750
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Brooks Estate took an $80,000 hit one year because there was just not enough money.

751
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:40,644
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll keep it open and look for the kind of the high level stuff and share it as people are interested.

752
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:45,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit preserve Medford is the name of the Facebook page.

753
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:51,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely like that page if you don't already like it.

754
01:01:56,668 --> 01:01:58,608
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, great.

755
01:02:00,409 --> 01:02:01,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like

756
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:03,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.

757
01:02:04,035 --> 01:02:05,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have anything else?

758
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:07,256
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a social gathering coming up soon or something like that?

759
01:02:07,296 --> 01:02:07,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

760
01:02:07,856 --> 01:02:10,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, our summer get together.

761
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:15,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan and I were chatting today about a location, so stay tuned.

762
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:21,242
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think we said the Tuesday the 27th for some cocktails.

763
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:23,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug's paying.

764
01:02:23,123 --> 01:02:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

765
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:25,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

766
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:26,205
[SPEAKER_07]: What, 7, 6? 6.30.

767
01:02:30,523 --> 01:02:31,404
[SPEAKER_03]: when people get there.

768
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:35,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Dennis, make sure I'll send you an email, but make sure you come if you can.

769
01:02:36,027 --> 01:02:39,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You're around.

770
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We were tossing around Long Cross.

771
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:45,733
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a great bar and a great patio.

772
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:49,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll confirm that with everybody.

773
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Spread the wealth around Medford since we've already hit a few different places.

774
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:01,115
[SPEAKER_03]: between the holidays and summer.

775
01:03:04,758 --> 01:03:06,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have anything else?

776
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:11,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll take a motion to adjourn.

777
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:15,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Ed.

778
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:19,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Doug.

779
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, motion to adjourn at 8.08 PM.

780
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:22,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Kit?

781
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:24,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

782
01:03:25,015 --> 01:03:25,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed?

783
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:27,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

784
01:03:27,797 --> 01:03:28,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug?

785
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:28,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

786
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:31,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am also a yes.

787
01:03:32,834 --> 01:03:33,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

788
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:35,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.

789
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.

790
01:03:37,496 --> 01:03:39,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was a tough night with three people down.

791
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:41,578
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will see you all.

792
01:03:41,638 --> 01:03:43,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next meeting is September 9th.

793
01:03:44,259 --> 01:03:46,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we'll try to do one in between.

794
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:47,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll email about that.

795
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So for Pearl Street.

796
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Is September 9th Labor Day?

797
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,942
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Labor Day is early this year.

798
01:03:52,982 --> 01:03:53,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the second.

799
01:03:53,782 --> 01:03:54,683
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

800
01:03:55,243 --> 01:03:55,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

801
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:57,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So all right.

802
01:03:57,524 --> 01:03:58,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night, everybody.
