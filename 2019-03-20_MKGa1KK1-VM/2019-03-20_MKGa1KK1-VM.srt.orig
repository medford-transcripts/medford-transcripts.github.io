1
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,882
[SPEAKER_07]: present, seven present, none absent, all please rise and salute our flag.

2
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:33,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

3
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Approval of the minutes of the March 6, 2019 meeting.

4
00:52:41,212 --> 00:52:43,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

5
00:52:43,353 --> 00:52:43,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Kretz.

6
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:44,474
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

7
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:45,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

8
00:52:45,968 --> 00:52:46,369
[SPEAKER_07]: DiBenedetto.

9
00:52:46,409 --> 00:53:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: On the back of our agenda, there's a... We didn't suppose we'd put that up.

10
00:53:02,499 --> 00:53:03,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We tabled it.

11
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:04,140
Tabled it?

12
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So we added 12 listings, we see that.

13
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:11,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the motion that that be put on reports due?

14
00:53:12,709 --> 00:53:13,449
[SPEAKER_07]: the health policy.

15
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,712
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to approve the minutes as amended, all those in favor?

16
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,373
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

17
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:20,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

18
00:53:21,614 --> 00:53:23,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

19
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto.

20
00:53:26,217 --> 00:53:27,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second on the floor?

21
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:29,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo has a question.

22
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:31,960
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an echo happening in here.

23
00:53:37,303 --> 00:53:42,486
[SPEAKER_13]: The $400 to Eastern Bus three different times for Brooks, what is that for?

24
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,872
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are not like PTO events?

25
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:53,613
[SPEAKER_14]: No, student activities.

26
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:53,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

27
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:55,514
[SPEAKER_13]: From their separate accounts.

28
00:53:55,914 --> 00:54:02,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Also on page five, universal screening is under athletic services.

29
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:13,648
[SPEAKER_14]: That is part of the pool account, I believe, the 361.

30
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:23,954
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be the screening that they would need for STL, but I can get further clarification for all totals.

31
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:24,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

32
00:54:38,718 --> 00:54:54,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I waive that report being read and take item number two, report on upcoming MBTA role closures as priority?

33
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:56,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion on the floor for suspension of the rules.

34
00:54:56,978 --> 00:54:57,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

35
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:00,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

36
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,094
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed, suspension is granted.

37
00:55:03,114 --> 00:55:06,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Item number two, report on upcoming MBTA road closures.

38
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:14,376
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Mr. Terry McCarthy with us of the team, who has been the main point person for the GLX project in the city of Medford.

39
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,056
[SPEAKER_07]: You notice he's wearing green.

40
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a reason.

41
00:55:16,556 --> 00:55:21,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not the president of the team.

42
00:55:21,758 --> 00:55:23,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not doing mine.

43
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:31,759
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't.

44
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:04,617
[SPEAKER_08]: you

45
00:56:50,185 --> 00:56:53,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you, Mayor Burke, Superintendent, committee members.

46
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:59,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, I'm gonna try and keep an abbreviated version.

47
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:04,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you have a lot of items on tonight, but I'll quickly go through a little scope of the project.

48
00:57:09,831 --> 00:57:16,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And a very quick status of the project, and then I'll get right into the maintenance of traffic around the Broadway Bridge.

49
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:22,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So the MBTA is building seven light rail stations.

50
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:34,142
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a project about $2.3 billion and we've also purchased 24 new light rail cars as part of the project.

51
00:57:36,573 --> 00:57:41,277
[SPEAKER_10]: has many benefits of bringing public transit to the area.

52
00:57:41,997 --> 00:57:49,844
[SPEAKER_10]: They're expecting it to be able to grow to about 45,000 riders from this area.

53
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:55,048
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the project map.

54
00:57:56,089 --> 00:57:58,250
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the existing Lechmere Station.

55
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:04,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's two branches of the Green Line extension, one short branch to Union Square,

56
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this is the Medford Line, which runs within the low-lying commuter rail.

57
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:14,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the College Ave Station that is right outside of Tufts University.

58
00:58:15,187 --> 00:58:23,652
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Ball Square, where the traffic detours are coming up for the closure of the Broadway Bridge.

59
00:58:25,528 --> 00:58:29,069
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just kind of the status of where we are in design.

60
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:39,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, we have about 60 to 70% of the project design work completed and less than 10% on the construction at this juncture.

61
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:45,253
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a slide of begin with the end in mind.

62
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:54,956
[SPEAKER_10]: When the green line extension is complete, the commuter rail, the low line, will be running in this corridor.

63
00:59:00,226 --> 00:59:10,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And the new light rail transit system will be there, and this is the cut through to where the community path is down the line.

64
00:59:12,588 --> 00:59:15,168
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the original configuration of the corridor.

65
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:23,110
[SPEAKER_10]: This past summer, we removed this rail and excavated out this side of the alignment.

66
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:36,131
[SPEAKER_10]: which allowed us to move the commuter rail over so we could complete the excavation and install this wall.

67
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:52,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And then 2020, 2021, we'll be excavating on this side to install the light rail transit and the remaining retaining walls.

68
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:58,513
[SPEAKER_10]: So this comes into the issues of bridge closures.

69
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:10,782
[SPEAKER_10]: The Broadway Bridge in Ball Square will be closing this Friday and will be closed for a year.

70
01:00:12,963 --> 01:00:17,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a pretty long duration closure.

71
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:23,891
[SPEAKER_10]: There are also other bridges, but this is the main one that affects the city of Medford

72
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:32,627
[SPEAKER_10]: So the reason we haven't closed the bridge for a year, this is the red outline is the existing bridge.

73
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:38,089
[SPEAKER_10]: It only has room for the two commuter rail lines that run through it presently.

74
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:45,231
[SPEAKER_10]: We're tearing that entire, let me just go back one.

75
01:00:46,632 --> 01:00:50,273
[SPEAKER_10]: We're removing in its entirety this bridge.

76
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:58,277
[SPEAKER_10]: and installing a brand new bridge with new abutment foundations.

77
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:07,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually the length is going from about 54 feet to 89 feet long.

78
01:01:08,304 --> 01:01:15,029
[SPEAKER_10]: With that, we've had to install a center pier to account for the increased length of the bridge.

79
01:01:17,629 --> 01:01:19,971
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is Broadway Bridge.

80
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:21,672
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the dialysis center.

81
01:01:22,192 --> 01:01:26,034
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where the bowling alley was.

82
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:29,557
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Ball Square, Kelly's Diner.

83
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:36,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the main reason for coming today.

84
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:40,424
[SPEAKER_10]: The bridge will be shut down this Friday.

85
01:01:43,161 --> 01:02:04,542
[SPEAKER_10]: essentially traffic coming up Broadway would come down Cedar, Highland Ave, the Davis Square area, then College Ave, to Powder House, Circle, and then going up to Warren and Harvard, and then down Main Street to go back around.

86
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:06,183
[SPEAKER_10]: It

87
01:02:08,147 --> 01:02:23,955
[SPEAKER_10]: The Harvard Street area is a truck exclusion area, which your traffic engineers and Mayor Burke was very much supportive of and advocated for.

88
01:02:25,035 --> 01:02:28,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get back to the truck detour.

89
01:02:28,877 --> 01:02:30,098
[SPEAKER_10]: My slides are out of line.

90
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:30,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

91
01:02:31,819 --> 01:02:36,321
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the local pedestrian detour.

92
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:41,603
[SPEAKER_10]: So folks and bicyclists would walk and go around.

93
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:44,305
[SPEAKER_10]: There is going to be a shuttle service.

94
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:50,010
[SPEAKER_10]: The city of Somerville is going to have a shuttle service, and they're going to open it up to all.

95
01:02:50,890 --> 01:03:03,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone will be able to get on board and take a shuttle basically around here for anybody who needs to utilize the shuttle.

96
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:21,376
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Washington Street Bridge, which... I have another slide.

97
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:24,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, okay.

98
01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:39,882
[SPEAKER_10]: These are other bridges that will not cause great effect to the city of Medford, but I'd like to quickly go through them just to show that we're closing the Broadway Bridge in...

99
01:03:40,928 --> 01:03:46,655
[SPEAKER_10]: March, and then we'll be closing the Washington Street Bridge in April.

100
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:52,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Then in June or July, we'll be closing the Medford Street Bridge.

101
01:03:53,456 --> 01:04:03,241
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, in working with the city and delegation, we're creating three loops of detoured traffic.

102
01:04:03,962 --> 01:04:11,506
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't affect Medford as much, but as you'll see, there's other projects in the area that are going to be going on.

103
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:17,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So we all have to kind of prepare for very different traffic patterns, almost regionally.

104
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the pedestrian.

105
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:23,724
[SPEAKER_10]: bike detour.

106
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:34,176
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Medford Bridge, which is almost dead center between Washington and Broadway Bridge.

107
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:39,983
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Somerville High School area, and the bridge is here.

108
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:43,759
[SPEAKER_10]: This detour in itself is not that disruptive.

109
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,303
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no busing or alternate route work there.

110
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:53,889
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that it ties in with the other detours.

111
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:59,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll show you where this connection, Pearl Street ties into McGrath Highway.

112
01:05:00,035 --> 01:05:01,196
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I go back to

113
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:16,102
[SPEAKER_10]: the Washington Street, the Pearl Street area which ties in, and at McGrath Highway they kind of circle in.

114
01:05:17,062 --> 01:05:22,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a detour here, and then the Medford Bridge detour is located here.

115
01:05:27,655 --> 01:05:30,457
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the pedestrian and bike path.

116
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:39,605
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all available online, and I also, if anybody wants this particular presentation, I can certainly email it to you.

117
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:45,430
[SPEAKER_10]: The other disruption that's occurring with all this is the bus routes.

118
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:54,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Bus route 80 and 89, that service ball square, and it's just easier to see the map.

119
01:05:56,192 --> 01:06:06,094
[SPEAKER_10]: The 80 bus normally would travel this path, and here's where the bridge is closed, and along and then up Boston Ave.

120
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:11,455
[SPEAKER_10]: We're diverting it up Main Street.

121
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:21,657
[SPEAKER_10]: With the support of the city council, we've added, actually, temporary bus stops, temporary being they'll be there for a year.

122
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:30,907
[SPEAKER_10]: The 80 bus will also stop at the seven other stops along Main Street.

123
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:39,600
[SPEAKER_10]: So the folks in Medford who live approximately in this area, they will

124
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:43,213
[SPEAKER_10]: get on the 80 bus by going to Main Street.

125
01:06:44,214 --> 01:06:59,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of the Ball Square residents we've talked to are talking about either using this set at Magoon Square or at this location we have two bus stops.

126
01:06:59,863 --> 01:07:07,928
[SPEAKER_10]: It will serve as Tufts University and the residents like at the end of Frederick Street and Stanley and alike.

127
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:18,123
[SPEAKER_10]: The 89 that goes to Clarendon Hill, it has no temporary bus stops.

128
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:23,166
[SPEAKER_10]: It's utilizing existing bus stops to tie in.

129
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:33,694
[SPEAKER_10]: The main area it affects with Medford would be along these neighborhoods here, which are very similar.

130
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:44,084
[SPEAKER_10]: We're predicting that we're going to see people switching from the 80 or 89 and making possibly some other transfer at one of the stations.

131
01:07:46,805 --> 01:07:59,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the Sullivan to Davis Square is a shortened route, but it will basically follow along the detours that were put in place for traffic.

132
01:08:02,603 --> 01:08:06,125
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the detours for the Washington Street Bridge.

133
01:08:07,026 --> 01:08:10,608
[SPEAKER_10]: No bus stops are being eliminated.

134
01:08:10,808 --> 01:08:20,834
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just being relocated for the 86, 91, and the Crosstown to bus.

135
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:30,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's still, for example, underneath the Washington Street Bridge, there are stops here, but they're just moving to either side.

136
01:08:33,207 --> 01:08:48,666
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing I wanted to quickly talk about, we've done a significant amount of outreach for the project and this is just a quick view of the public meetings and the flyering effort, robocalls.

137
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:55,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Clemente has been just phenomenal with helping us out.

138
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:11,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've, South Medford, we took a heavy leafleting and had a lot of conversations with business owners along Main Street and alike.

139
01:09:12,556 --> 01:09:18,038
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a community working group that has just been outstanding helping the project

140
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,922
[SPEAKER_10]: and getting information out to the community.

141
01:09:21,982 --> 01:09:29,808
[SPEAKER_10]: They were here last Tuesday advocating for bus stops and the like, and they're really good.

142
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:36,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim Silver and Laura Wimmel have been just phenomenal, as well as Fred Doerzel.

143
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:42,677
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've been utilizing social media.

144
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:48,599
[SPEAKER_10]: We have 6,500 members on our email blast list.

145
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,102
[SPEAKER_10]: The MBTA uses Twitter for service announcements and the like.

146
01:09:55,242 --> 01:09:58,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did also regional outreach.

147
01:09:58,723 --> 01:10:04,646
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing that was expressed to us is the cut through traffic is the biggest issue in this area.

148
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why I mentioned about the three bridges.

149
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:08,373
[SPEAKER_10]: looping into us.

150
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:18,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Our whole goal with what we call our Reboot the Commute campaign was to eliminate as much cut-through traffic as we can.

151
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:28,707
[SPEAKER_10]: And if anyone's driven down I-93 today, there's big signs that say Somerville backslash Bedford bridges closing and effective date.

152
01:10:29,568 --> 01:10:30,068
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just

153
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:37,733
[SPEAKER_10]: In collecting regional outreach, we actually collected a list of over 1,000 different entities.

154
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:50,177
[SPEAKER_10]: And we made contact with 987 of them, predominantly through emails, but left voicemails and web formats and the like.

155
01:10:51,798 --> 01:10:57,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And this one was important to bring to folks' attention in the area.

156
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:06,481
[SPEAKER_10]: DCR has their Foss Park project that's going on right in the middle of our large detours.

157
01:11:07,522 --> 01:11:19,649
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the Union Square area that has infrastructure, sewer, water, and things being landscape and streetscape type elements.

158
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:25,652
[SPEAKER_10]: The US2 development is not going full bore now, but it has a potential to.

159
01:11:26,638 --> 01:11:35,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Then MassDOT just announced that they are taking a lane on Route 1, Tobin Bridge renovations, and the Chelsea off-ramp.

160
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:41,009
[SPEAKER_10]: So that will affect the area regionally.

161
01:11:41,489 --> 01:11:45,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Alfred Street Bridge, which is being worked on now, will be completed in May.

162
01:11:46,853 --> 01:11:49,055
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the North Washington Street Bridge

163
01:11:50,162 --> 01:11:52,463
[SPEAKER_10]: was originally closing completely.

164
01:11:52,943 --> 01:12:01,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And when the state looked at all the closures, they decided a temporary bridge would be needed at North Washington Street.

165
01:12:01,248 --> 01:12:04,490
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the bridge located right at Boston Garden.

166
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:08,071
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the main entry points into the city.

167
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:13,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the big elephant in the room, the Encore Casino,

168
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:26,287
[SPEAKER_10]: scheduled to open on June 23rd, which is a Sunday, and they expect a crowd as large as a Patriots Day parade type event, so they're prepping for that.

169
01:12:26,548 --> 01:12:30,631
[SPEAKER_10]: They still have some approvals to go, but they're, you know.

170
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:34,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty much it, in a nutshell.

171
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:35,374
Yep.

172
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

173
01:13:03,891 --> 01:13:06,593
Okay.

174
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:37,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And if, I mean we coordinate all the efforts if National Grid needs to work in some place and we have to

175
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:39,557
[SPEAKER_10]: do some contingency.

176
01:13:39,617 --> 01:13:49,541
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually have been working with Chief Buckley extensively on Medford police details being in the area.

177
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:54,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we have 22 scheduled for when the bridge is closed.

178
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:58,265
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the big points of that is community policing.

179
01:13:58,826 --> 01:14:01,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And in speaking with

180
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:10,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Christine, you know, we've already discussed school buses will be getting through in the small school vans.

181
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:15,110
[SPEAKER_10]: The MBTA has their ride system that a lot of people use.

182
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:24,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've taken a lot of time to coordinate on what is going to happen and basically getting anybody where they need to be.

183
01:14:24,453 --> 01:14:29,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, deliveries, anything in the area will be there to help.

184
01:14:31,878 --> 01:14:32,919
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't have a question.

185
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:36,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I just appreciate the information.

186
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:42,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we spoke the other night at the open house for the Green Line extension and all the road closures.

187
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:52,809
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern is with the rerouting of a lot of this traffic is on Main Street and the Columbus School I spoke to you about is a few blocks away from there.

188
01:14:53,209 --> 01:14:54,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm worried.

189
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,032
[SPEAKER_06]: First, we talked about the backup, and I'm glad that you addressed that with Kirstine

190
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:08,956
[SPEAKER_06]: the school buses and our parents being directed so that they can drop off their children in a safe, appropriate way and not get stuck in the commuter traffic.

191
01:15:09,477 --> 01:15:13,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But my other concern is how many of our students walk to school.

192
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:24,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not so much concerned on Main Street, it's just those people that go into the back streets to get around the traffic and the frustration level of the drivers in that area.

193
01:15:24,427 --> 01:15:28,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want maybe an announcement made to our families from the Columbus School

194
01:15:29,163 --> 01:15:30,504
[SPEAKER_06]: that this change is happening.

195
01:15:30,524 --> 01:15:31,825
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a traffic change.

196
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:41,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Please advise your children to be more aware of cars in the neighborhood, as well as having our police force updated with that.

197
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a chance to talk to the chief the other night regarding this issue, but some of our students do walk in those neighborhoods, especially our fifth graders that may walk by themselves.

198
01:15:52,497 --> 01:15:54,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want them to come between two cars

199
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,012
[SPEAKER_06]: an aggravated driver going long way down the street.

200
01:15:58,032 --> 01:16:01,095
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could, the chief has been extremely involved in this process.

201
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:07,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I think pretty much weekly at this point they've been meeting with Todd Blake and Tim McGibbon, our engineer.

202
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:15,033
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the streets that might be cut through now will have postings on them, and there will be officers at the other end enforcing it.

203
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:24,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of the streets to the right of Main Street, I guess, if you were going to Somerville, a lot of them will be limited to just neighborhood traffic, so not cut-through traffic.

204
01:16:25,156 --> 01:16:31,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the schools, I know we moved a bus stop up a little farther up, a new crosswalk we put in.

205
01:16:31,339 --> 01:16:36,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can get a message out to the schools, but certainly the police are well informed.

206
01:16:38,622 --> 01:16:42,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Kaye to actually send an announcement to families just to be aware.

207
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:49,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're not, so there's a lot of people aren't really wondering what's going on in Somerville with bridge closures.

208
01:16:49,353 --> 01:16:52,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just a new awareness for those families.

209
01:16:52,937 --> 01:16:53,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

210
01:16:55,139 --> 01:16:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

211
01:16:55,499 --> 01:16:56,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other questions?

212
01:16:58,502 --> 01:17:01,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for coming, Mr. McAuliffe, and we will see you soon.

213
01:17:01,745 --> 01:17:02,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

214
01:17:10,463 --> 01:17:11,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he just here for the one thing?

215
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:15,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, while we're under suspension, Ms.

216
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:22,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Mustone has asked us to take item 3, recommendation to approve donation to McGlynn Middle School by Medford Engineering and Survey, Mr. Tucci.

217
01:17:25,654 --> 01:17:26,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

218
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:27,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

219
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:35,417
[SPEAKER_11]: The McGill Middle School has received a donation in the amount of $500 from Medford Engineering and Survey in support of the Mustang Way initiative that rolled out last year.

220
01:17:36,097 --> 01:17:43,039
[SPEAKER_11]: The donation is going to be used to purchase prizes to incentivize students to enter into the Mustang Way essay competition and media contest.

221
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:45,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And the following is a description of this contest.

222
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:46,300
[SPEAKER_11]: It will take place in the spring of 2019.

223
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,041
[SPEAKER_11]: In Medford, we're all Mustangs.

224
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,602
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mustang Way is a philosophy or a way of mind that brings all students and staff together.

225
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:53,882
[SPEAKER_11]: In an essay,

226
01:17:54,777 --> 01:17:58,400
[SPEAKER_11]: approximately about a page long, or a video production, or a voice recording.

227
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:04,004
[SPEAKER_11]: The students are going to be competing in order to share their own personal reflections.

228
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:11,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And this money will be used in order to incentivize their participation in this competition and contest.

229
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:19,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd love to broadcast it to our school community to show how much our new philosophy and way of doing things at McGlynn is the way of the school system.

230
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:21,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice, Mr. Tucci.

231
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it Mr. Veneziano?

232
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:29,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Veneziano, I want to thank him and Medford Engineering and Survey for their generous donation.

233
01:18:29,403 --> 01:18:30,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also want to thank Ms.

234
01:18:30,324 --> 01:18:35,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Hong Lu, a retired teacher at the McGlynn, for helping to get this donation our way.

235
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:36,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

236
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:41,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval of the donation by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

237
01:18:41,535 --> 01:18:42,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Mustone?

238
01:18:42,576 --> 01:18:43,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please.

239
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

240
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:54,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

241
01:18:54,722 --> 01:18:55,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

242
01:18:55,723 --> 01:18:58,305
[SPEAKER_07]: How about number four too?

243
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:03,628
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a recommendation to approve a scholarship.

244
01:19:03,929 --> 01:19:08,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Toomey, Curtis Top School.

245
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

246
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Toomey could not be here, so I am presenting on his behalf.

247
01:19:17,983 --> 01:19:22,526
[SPEAKER_14]: This is regarding scholarship for a Curtis Tufts senior.

248
01:19:23,266 --> 01:19:32,693
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was the intent is for a $500 scholarship for a trade school or technical program.

249
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:37,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone that the faculty feels has potential as a post high school student.

250
01:19:37,696 --> 01:19:42,139
[SPEAKER_14]: So this scholarship would be, the intent would be to begin with the class of 2019.

251
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:48,946
[SPEAKER_14]: And they would like to continue into future years as an ongoing $500 scholarship.

252
01:19:49,426 --> 01:19:57,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is requested to approve the scholarship for the Donna Palumbo program at the Curtis Tufts.

253
01:19:57,914 --> 01:19:58,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

254
01:19:58,355 --> 01:20:00,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ernice Sauer graduated last year.

255
01:20:00,557 --> 01:20:00,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

256
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:01,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

257
01:20:02,018 --> 01:20:03,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval by Ms.

258
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto?

259
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:06,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, please.

01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.

263
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:19,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, letter.

264
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:21,916
[SPEAKER_07]: To both of those.

265
01:20:21,936 --> 01:20:27,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Item five, recommendation to approve commencement exercises at Tufts University.

266
01:20:27,182 --> 01:20:27,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. DeLava.

267
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:34,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening committee and Mayor Burke and

01:21:22,909 --> 01:21:23,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be.

276
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:24,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be.

277
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:24,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be.

278
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:25,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

279
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:26,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Fingers crossed.

280
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:28,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only March.

281
01:21:28,412 --> 01:21:29,033
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

282
01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:30,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.

283
01:21:33,775 --> 01:21:34,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

284
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

285
01:21:35,716 --> 01:21:37,817
[SPEAKER_07]: The school year calendar, would you like to take that as well?

286
01:21:38,218 --> 01:21:41,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Recommendation to approve 19-20 school year calendar.

287
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:41,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

288
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Caldwell.

289
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:45,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

290
01:21:45,922 --> 01:21:46,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

291
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:48,924
[SPEAKER_05]: In your package you should have our 2019-2020

292
01:21:52,044 --> 01:21:52,904
[SPEAKER_05]: school calendar.

293
01:21:52,925 --> 01:22:01,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I have asked all the administrators to take a look at it to see if there are any mistakes made, and I'm hoping there are none.

294
01:22:02,154 --> 01:22:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But I sent it to you as well.

295
01:22:05,277 --> 01:22:13,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And interestingly enough, if all goes well next year, we'll get out on June 12th, I think, if we take away those seven snow days.

296
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:17,823
[SPEAKER_05]: But you do remember the April 1st snowstorm, right?

297
01:22:17,843 --> 01:22:18,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

298
01:22:18,403 --> 01:22:19,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not remind us of that.

299
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:24,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

300
01:22:24,067 --> 01:22:24,908
[SPEAKER_06]: DiBenedetto.

301
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:30,112
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I would like to make a motion to approve the calendar.

302
01:22:30,172 --> 01:22:41,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, I would like this calendar as well as the last day of school put up on the website so people are very clear as to how early our last day of school is.

303
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:45,836
[SPEAKER_06]: due to the fact that a lot of camps don't open that early.

304
01:22:46,276 --> 01:23:02,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what we have scheduled for our summer fun camp, but having such an early estimated last day of school, maybe we could talk to people about even services throughout the city, recreation programs.

305
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:10,983
[SPEAKER_06]: We need this communicated throughout so parents aren't left without care for their children in an unusual year like this.

306
01:23:11,615 --> 01:23:13,056
[SPEAKER_06]: So those two motions.

307
01:23:14,697 --> 01:23:15,058
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

308
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:15,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

309
01:23:15,578 --> 01:23:15,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Vander Ploot.

310
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:16,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

311
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:17,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Ruggiero, I think.

312
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Ruggiero.

313
01:23:18,741 --> 01:23:19,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor.

314
01:23:20,682 --> 01:23:27,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I just would like to also recommend that we put the lottery date for the middle school selection also on this calendar, if possible.

315
01:23:28,228 --> 01:23:29,569
[SPEAKER_05]: For next year, you're talking about?

316
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:30,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

317
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:33,693
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as we know which date it will be.

318
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:38,536
[SPEAKER_07]: This is broad, as opposed to high school.

319
01:23:38,576 --> 01:23:39,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand.

320
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:40,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to put that.

321
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:45,904
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, there's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

322
01:23:46,345 --> 01:23:47,106
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

323
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:47,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

324
01:23:48,348 --> 01:23:49,009
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

325
01:23:49,069 --> 01:23:49,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

326
01:23:52,635 --> 01:23:53,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

327
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:03,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Mr. Benedetto.

328
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second on the floor?

329
01:24:06,012 --> 01:24:06,752
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

330
01:24:07,033 --> 01:24:07,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

331
01:24:07,533 --> 01:24:08,293
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

332
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:09,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

333
01:24:09,915 --> 01:24:13,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Report of committee, special ed subcommittee, February 5, 2019.

334
01:24:13,497 --> 01:24:14,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

335
01:24:26,926 --> 01:24:29,288
[SPEAKER_06]: First meeting for our community

336
01:24:29,715 --> 01:24:33,397

[SPEAKER_06]: Neil Osbon, Director of Diversity and Inclusion for the City of Medford.

339
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:43,541

340
01:24:44,061 --> 01:24:46,802

01:24:47,442 --> 01:24:48,943

[SPEAKER_06]: Tony Ray, Supervisor of Health Services.

343
01:24:51,964 --> 01:24:57,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Megan Fidler-Carrie, Director of Medford Before and After School Program.

344
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Kate Quinn,

345
01:24:59,429 --> 01:25:06,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Method Recreational Department, Emily Lazaro, Executive Assistant to the Superintendent, and thank you for taking the notes.

346
01:25:07,056 --> 01:25:23,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, Superintendent of Schools, Tanya Sullivan, CPAC Co-Chair, Melanie McLaughlin, CPAC Co-Chair, Patricia Kane, Della Grace, that's Dr., from Lesley University, Beverly Evelance,

347
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:29,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Evans from Lesley University, Lauren Carlin, ETL from the Andrews Public School.

348
01:25:31,164 --> 01:25:33,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Our committee had two focuses for this year.

349
01:25:34,026 --> 01:25:38,370
[SPEAKER_06]: One is out-of-school time, and the second is disability awareness.

350
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:46,277
[SPEAKER_06]: At this meeting, we were focusing on out-of-school time planning and coordination for vacations and summer programs.

351
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:54,370
[SPEAKER_06]: We started by describing our current programs, our before and after school program, our summer fun camp, and the city recreational program.

352
01:25:54,790 --> 01:26:01,774
[SPEAKER_06]: We discussed staffing and training for all staff and what types of accommodations are made for students with disabilities.

353
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:09,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Before and after school program has a wait list and suggestions were made to work with Lesley University to try to fill

354
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,461
[SPEAKER_06]: some staffing needs so we can move that wait list along.

355
01:26:13,962 --> 01:26:23,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a great idea was to have CCSR and honor students from Meffitt High School to volunteer to help the program more often.

356
01:26:24,406 --> 01:26:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: The summer fund camp was discussed and the idea of an earlier registration for programs so we can meet the needs and numbers of the campers

357
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:34,240
[SPEAKER_06]: was also discussed.

358
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:41,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Three-tiered pricing for early registration, regular registration, and late registration was offered.

359
01:26:41,606 --> 01:26:49,912
[SPEAKER_06]: A handbook is being created for the staff, one for staff and one for families, so everybody has all the information necessary.

360
01:26:51,233 --> 01:26:54,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's clear how our summer fund clamp runs.

361
01:26:54,416 --> 01:27:00,941
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an EMT on staff, a nurse distributing medications, but training for the staff has been minimal.

362
01:27:01,351 --> 01:27:03,553
[SPEAKER_06]: We are working to increase that option.

363
01:27:04,475 --> 01:27:07,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The camp does not ever turn anyone away.

364
01:27:07,698 --> 01:27:10,101
[SPEAKER_06]: They do their best to accommodate all needs.

365
01:27:10,301 --> 01:27:17,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if a parent needs last minute registration, no child has ever been turned away from the camp.

366
01:27:18,283 --> 01:27:25,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Students with disability may qualify for ESL in order to maintain and not lose social emotional skills during the summer.

367
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:33,209
[SPEAKER_06]: IEPs of those students are shared with the camp administration by our special education department in early June.

368
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:44,294
[SPEAKER_06]: They're changing the registration form to encourage all participants' parents to provide IEPs and 504s for any student coming to the camp.

369
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:45,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're able to

370
01:27:46,705 --> 01:27:51,967
[SPEAKER_06]: prepare for every student's need and make accommodations when necessary.

371
01:27:52,627 --> 01:27:59,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Method Recreation is also present at the meeting and they have a staff member who has a long history of working with students with disabilities.

372
01:27:59,929 --> 01:28:02,850
[SPEAKER_06]: They are open to attend any trainings offered.

373
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:06,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt like it was a very productive meeting.

374
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:12,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Many steps have been taken already to improve our programming and our communications with families.

375
01:28:13,148 --> 01:28:16,991
[SPEAKER_06]: The meeting minutes have been attached to these notes as well.

376
01:28:17,552 --> 01:28:22,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions, please let us know.

377
01:28:25,218 --> 01:28:30,262
Motion to accept this report, please call the vote.

378
01:28:30,322 --> 01:28:32,744
Mr. Brousseau, seconded by Ms.

379
01:28:32,844 --> 01:28:32,944
Haley.

380
01:28:32,964 --> 01:28:33,385
All those in favour?

381
01:28:33,405 --> 01:28:33,465
Aye.

382
01:28:33,585 --> 01:28:34,325
All those opposed?

383
01:28:34,605 --> 01:28:35,246
Motion passes.

384
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,027
Thank you very much, Ms.

385
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:36,247
Devita.

386
01:28:36,287 --> 01:28:37,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Community participation.

387
01:28:38,008 --> 01:28:42,172
Report of the superintendent.

388
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:48,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, everyone.

389
01:28:50,728 --> 01:28:53,569
[SPEAKER_16]: The Roberts School, I want to give an update.

390
01:28:53,729 --> 01:29:03,892
[SPEAKER_16]: On Thursday, March 7th, the Roberts School experienced an unanticipated event that involved the Medford Police and the school being required to shelter in place.

391
01:29:04,913 --> 01:29:10,274
[SPEAKER_16]: This was done in order to ensure the safety of all of the children and adults in the after-school program.

392
01:29:11,155 --> 01:29:15,416
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to personally thank the after-school team, school administration,

393
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:22,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford Police parents and students for their cooperative spirit during such a serious time.

394
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:32,273
[SPEAKER_16]: At that time I released a statement stating that all families had been notified and in fact an attempt was made but not all families were contacted.

395
01:29:32,794 --> 01:29:38,220
[SPEAKER_16]: For that I sincerely apologize for providing misinformation.

396
01:29:39,135 --> 01:29:43,698
[SPEAKER_16]: I was greatly relieved when the serious issue was resolved by the Medford Police.

397
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:53,485
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not have any other information regarding the incident and I would ask families to reach out to the Medford Police for additional information regarding that.

398
01:29:54,526 --> 01:30:05,594
[SPEAKER_16]: That situation was a learning experience for all of us and we have made immediate internal security changes to ensure rapid communication to all families.

399
01:30:07,165 --> 01:30:13,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, last Monday at the high school, we had our Black History Month assembly.

400
01:30:14,891 --> 01:30:19,814
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School celebrated Black History Month.

401
01:30:20,455 --> 01:30:29,421
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to thank Assistant Principal Dr. Stacey Mulligan, who took the lead on this project, and she told me the students took the idea and ran with it.

402
01:30:30,222 --> 01:30:33,144
[SPEAKER_16]: They really planned an incredible and entertaining event.

403
01:30:33,765 --> 01:30:36,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank all of the students who took part in the program.

404
01:30:38,167 --> 01:31:03,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Ebion Abshir, who acted as MC, Jovia Morambe, who performed an Alicia Keys song while playing the keyboard, Chioma Opara, our own student representative on the school committee, she read an original poem, Antonia Collins and Nadia Farmer gave the history of West Medford, and Edwins Bozeal discussed the history of African American music from 1919 to 2019.

405
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:11,986
[SPEAKER_16]: And he was assisted by Shane Colbert, who also DJed for the event.

406
01:31:12,987 --> 01:31:16,811
[SPEAKER_16]: The students also participated in a fashion show.

407
01:31:17,532 --> 01:31:21,796
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would also like to just extend a special thank you to Headmaster DeLeva.

408
01:31:22,783 --> 01:31:26,384
[SPEAKER_16]: and the Director of Diversity, Neil Osborne, for their remarks.

409
01:31:27,305 --> 01:31:37,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd also like to thank Tony Fonseca, a former Mustang Method High School graduate, along with the students who provided a great multicultural drum performance.

410
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:39,930
[SPEAKER_16]: So it truly was a wonderful event.

411
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:43,491
[SPEAKER_16]: I also would like to take this opportunity to thank

412
01:31:44,173 --> 01:31:52,018
[SPEAKER_16]: the Citywide Elementary PTO group which put together a wonderful evening with the Harlem Wizards.

413
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,261
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm told that they sold over 800 tickets for the event.

414
01:31:56,822 --> 01:32:00,024
[SPEAKER_16]: The gymnasium was packed and it was truly a fun event for all.

415
01:32:01,361 --> 01:32:07,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that they worked very hard on getting this fundraising event together, so congratulations to them, and thank you.

416
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:25,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week, on March 14th, it was Pi Day, and I had the opportunity to celebrate Pi Day at the McGlynn Middle School, and seventh grade teachers Robin Irving and Patty Haas, they had multiple hands-on activities for students.

417
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:30,875
[SPEAKER_16]: They invited many members of central office to come and participate

418
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:37,189
[SPEAKER_16]: and it was a wonderful learning event, and they got to see how Pi could relate to the real world.

419
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:40,792
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was a fun learning time for all that were involved.

420
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:44,374
[SPEAKER_16]: An update on Tristan Howard.

421
01:32:45,074 --> 01:32:50,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Last Friday, Tristan traveled to New York City to compete in the New Balance Nationals.

422
01:32:50,597 --> 01:32:53,259
[SPEAKER_16]: He competed in the emerging elite division.

423
01:32:53,879 --> 01:32:57,701
[SPEAKER_16]: In the 55 meter dash, Tristan finished in 11th place,

424
01:32:58,946 --> 01:33:01,970
[SPEAKER_16]: completing it in 6.57 seconds.

425
01:33:02,691 --> 01:33:04,433
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's pretty fast.

426
01:33:05,094 --> 01:33:08,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, only the top eight moved on to the finals.

427
01:33:08,959 --> 01:33:11,402
[SPEAKER_16]: However, we're very proud of that accomplishment.

428
01:33:12,143 --> 01:33:17,430
[SPEAKER_16]: And in addition to that, in the 200 meter, Tristan finished in ninth place.

429
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,481
[SPEAKER_16]: completing it in 22.3 seconds.

430
01:33:21,122 --> 01:33:23,323
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, only the top eight moved on.

431
01:33:23,983 --> 01:33:26,444
[SPEAKER_16]: But we want to say congratulations to Tristan.

432
01:33:27,665 --> 01:33:30,206
[SPEAKER_16]: It was truly a great learning experience for him.

433
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:38,070
[SPEAKER_16]: And the good news is he is only a junior, so we have another year to continue to see what wonderful things he will do.

434
01:33:39,651 --> 01:33:46,695
[SPEAKER_16]: This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to attend the Japanese Learning School graduation ceremony.

435
01:33:47,914 --> 01:34:02,442
[SPEAKER_16]: They hosted their ceremony at the high school and I wanted to thank Japanese Consul General Michi and Principal Ishikawa for inviting Mayor Burke and myself to participate in that ceremony.

436
01:34:02,702 --> 01:34:03,783
[SPEAKER_16]: There were many graduates.

437
01:34:04,183 --> 01:34:09,806
[SPEAKER_16]: The Japanese Learning School, which takes place at the high school, educates approximately 800 students

438
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:14,431
[SPEAKER_16]: per year from kindergarten through high school.

439
01:34:14,931 --> 01:34:17,732
[SPEAKER_16]: It also teaches Japanese as a second language.

440
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:23,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So they have been with Medford High School for the past 45 years.

441
01:34:23,614 --> 01:34:26,455
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is truly a longstanding partnership.

442
01:34:26,918 --> 01:34:30,683
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was a pleasure to share in that special day with them.

443
01:34:30,743 --> 01:34:32,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, some upcoming events.

444
01:34:33,066 --> 01:34:35,709
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a transition fair getting ready to happen.

445
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:41,897
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's going to take place on Wednesday in our wonderful Bistro 489 from 6 to 9 p.m.

446
01:34:44,694 --> 01:35:01,027
[SPEAKER_16]: and the Medford Public Schools and Winchester Public Schools Offices of Special Education are holding their annual transition fair designed for students 14 years of age and older with disabilities to help plan for life after high school.

447
01:35:01,948 --> 01:35:12,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Parents, guardians, and students are encouraged to attend this free event to learn about community-based services available for adults with disabilities.

448
01:35:13,114 --> 01:35:27,202
[SPEAKER_16]: The exhibitors will include information regarding support for independent living skills, vocational training, adapted educational programs, and recreational opportunities, and also supportive housing.

449
01:35:27,945 --> 01:35:30,586
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the transition fair, so please spread the word.

450
01:35:31,286 --> 01:35:36,987
[SPEAKER_16]: And also on Wednesday of this week, it's our early release day, Wednesday, March 20th.

451
01:35:37,668 --> 01:35:44,790
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that the McGlynn Middle School is hosting a free ice skating event at La Conte for middle school students.

452
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:49,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And at Medford High School, Priscilla's Pantry will offer rice and beans

453
01:35:50,207 --> 01:35:54,871
[SPEAKER_16]: from 12 to 1230 and CAF 3 for any student who might be interested.

454
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:58,214
[SPEAKER_16]: And those are my updates for this week.

455
01:36:03,038 --> 01:36:04,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you for that.

456
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:14,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Could we get a report that presumably would have to be given an executive session on the incident and what went well with our procedures and what improvements we would need to.

457
01:36:21,871 --> 01:36:23,412
[SPEAKER_03]: A little light that I have.

458
01:36:24,272 --> 01:36:31,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I had spoken to the chief of police last Friday because parents at the Roberts had just talked to me while I was at school.

459
01:36:32,455 --> 01:36:37,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I spoke to him on Friday, he said the man was in custody.

460
01:36:38,157 --> 01:36:39,898
[SPEAKER_03]: He was being held until today.

461
01:36:39,918 --> 01:36:41,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And today he was being arraigned.

462
01:36:42,039 --> 01:36:43,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do not have an update.

463
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chief

464
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: thought he could possibly get a 30 or a 60-day psych evaluation.

465
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:53,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully, there'll be an email when I get home.

466
01:36:53,225 --> 01:37:01,012
[SPEAKER_03]: But the police are very on top of it and want to make sure the Roberts parents know that they are following it very closely.

467
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:04,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

468
01:37:04,094 --> 01:37:07,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rousseau, you'd like to request a confidential document?

469
01:37:07,957 --> 01:37:08,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

470
01:37:09,992 --> 01:37:15,514
[SPEAKER_13]: The school's handling, but also how we interfaced with the police, if there's any improvements we need to make to procedure.

471
01:37:15,574 --> 01:37:18,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there was any issues between police and school.

472
01:37:18,495 --> 01:37:19,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was just notification.

473
01:37:19,796 --> 01:37:24,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, and there were a lot of inquiries, but we truly, I didn't have that information.

474
01:37:24,497 --> 01:37:25,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, Ms.

475
01:37:25,978 --> 01:37:27,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Stone had more information than me.

476
01:37:27,658 --> 01:37:34,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm just not really clear what our procedures are for how we're supposed to actually handle it.

477
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:36,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that the staff doesn't know, but.

478
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:48,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Item seven, on 2018, analysis and curriculum initiatives.

479
01:37:49,006 --> 01:37:49,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

480
01:37:49,106 --> 01:37:49,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Kahn.

481
01:37:49,987 --> 01:37:50,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

482
01:37:50,227 --> 01:37:51,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Kahn's coming forward.

483
01:37:51,687 --> 01:37:54,448
[SPEAKER_16]: The following three presentations from Ms.

484
01:37:55,188 --> 01:38:11,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Kahn, Rocco Sieri, and Dr. Chiesa are going to address a follow-up to our presentation that had taken place in the fall, kind of where we were and what have we been doing strategically as a district,

485
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:17,302
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe that all of these reports are going to be quite informative for you.

486
01:38:19,003 --> 01:38:19,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

487
01:38:19,523 --> 01:38:20,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everybody.

488
01:38:21,784 --> 01:38:25,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll start from what I have on page 1.

489
01:38:25,646 --> 01:38:28,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Item 1.A gives a brief overview of the report.

490
01:38:31,849 --> 01:38:35,071
[SPEAKER_09]: a test layout of grades 3 through 8 MCAS.

491
01:38:36,551 --> 01:38:43,615
[SPEAKER_09]: This layout with the question type, the table that you see at the bottom, question type, total points, and grade levels.

492
01:38:44,996 --> 01:38:48,317
[SPEAKER_09]: This test was conducted the first time in 2018, so last year

493
01:38:50,839 --> 01:38:59,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Our students took it the very first time with this different kind of questioning format.

494
01:39:01,046 --> 01:39:06,450
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we go to page 2, you will see the rest of the table.

495
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:14,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you will see item 1.B, which is legacy grade 10 MCAS, and students took it.

496
01:39:15,237 --> 01:39:18,201
[SPEAKER_09]: in 2018 for Grade 10 only.

497
01:39:18,321 --> 01:39:22,486
[SPEAKER_09]: So their format still stayed the same, Legacy 1.

498
01:39:22,886 --> 01:39:30,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And this year, in 2019, they will be taking it in the new format, which you will see on page 3.

499
01:39:32,362 --> 01:39:40,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So that layout on page 3 is in line with what our students in grades 3 through 8 took last year.

500
01:39:40,268 --> 01:39:54,380
[SPEAKER_09]: So we see that all grades from 3 through 8 and grade 10 will finally be taking it in the new format for the very first time this year altogether.

501
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, grades 3 through 8 have already taken it.

502
01:39:58,283 --> 01:40:05,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Then in item 2, this table was also in my October results table.

503
01:40:06,971 --> 01:40:11,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we go to page 4, I believe, I hope my pages are matching with yours.

504
01:40:12,977 --> 01:40:25,123
[SPEAKER_09]: We see 2018 Next Generation Mathematics MCAS elementary performance levels, and then we see middle school performance levels, and then so on and so forth.

505
01:40:25,183 --> 01:40:32,747
[SPEAKER_09]: We see high school performance levels, and followed by the CUSP scores by the grade.

506
01:40:33,587 --> 01:40:41,391
[SPEAKER_09]: This table is of special interest because it shows that the students who scored from

507
01:40:43,245 --> 01:40:44,426
[SPEAKER_09]: to $4.99 were there per gram.

508
01:40:45,948 --> 01:40:46,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

509
01:41:03,533 --> 01:41:10,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you see at the CUSP scores by grades, you see the CUSP data right in the middle.

510
01:41:11,346 --> 01:41:14,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on the left-hand side, you see how many

511
01:41:16,342 --> 01:41:19,305
[SPEAKER_09]: met expectations on the left-hand side of that.

512
01:41:19,405 --> 01:41:26,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the right-hand side, you will see if these CUSP students would have made it.

513
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:30,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And 490 to 499 is really pretty close.

514
01:41:30,874 --> 01:41:38,940
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a matter of sometimes having one, two questions, two and a half questions correct, if it's a constructed response.

515
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:50,806
[SPEAKER_09]: We noticed that, and then we moved on to the next table, elementary school standards slash domains, district versus state performance.

516
01:41:51,547 --> 01:42:04,293
[SPEAKER_09]: You see that in grade three, we are mostly on the positive side, but when it comes to grade four and grade five, we are seeing a negative differential.

517
01:42:05,061 --> 01:42:10,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll come back to it in just a couple of minutes.

518
01:42:10,885 --> 01:42:19,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to move on to page 6, where we see grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8 also on a similar table.

519
01:42:21,129 --> 01:42:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also see grade 10.

520
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:31,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I just did some study of the history of the mathematics program that was adopted, envisions.

521
01:42:32,233 --> 01:42:46,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems, and it appears, and I'm quite confident that's what happened, is that the grade three that we are seeing here with positive results, that's the first class that started using envisions at the kindergarten level.

522
01:42:47,331 --> 01:42:55,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So then grade four at that time, this current grade four was using everyday math, and so was grade five.

523
01:42:56,634 --> 01:43:05,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So it could be that particular class, those two cohorts,

524
01:43:06,678 --> 01:43:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: did not emphasize on the curricular frameworks at that point because the program probably was out of date.

525
01:43:18,064 --> 01:43:24,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, in grade four, we see fractions take over big time.

526
01:43:24,967 --> 01:43:26,048
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big concept.

527
01:43:26,488 --> 01:43:28,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And we see a differential of negative 11.

528
01:43:30,059 --> 01:43:39,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not surprised because as a high school teacher, I have seen students struggle with fractions even when Algebra 1 is being taught to them.

529
01:43:40,181 --> 01:43:45,582
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'll see what steps we have taken, but we noted that.

530
01:43:45,922 --> 01:43:51,503
[SPEAKER_09]: We also noted that the similar trend stayed in grade 4, in grade 5, I apologize.

531
01:43:52,243 --> 01:43:58,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we are also seeing numbers and operations that students are having difficulty in base 10.

532
01:44:01,429 --> 01:44:04,372
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, we move on to grades 6, 7, and 8.

533
01:44:06,054 --> 01:44:09,437
[SPEAKER_09]: We continue to see mostly negative differentials.

534
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:22,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we go to grade 10, which is where we see smaller differential in the district possible points and state possible points.

535
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:32,908
[SPEAKER_09]: What is of special interest to us and will probably help us feeling

536
01:44:34,073 --> 01:44:47,665
[SPEAKER_09]: feel a little better about our scores is that our students, the district means student growth percentile stayed within line of state means, student growth percentile.

537
01:44:48,306 --> 01:44:59,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So if a district student growth percentile of certain classes, SGP stays within 40 to 60, that's considered a good one year growth.

538
01:45:01,117 --> 01:45:10,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of our, with the exception of 39.9, it's .1 differential, most of our student growths are there.

539
01:45:10,959 --> 01:45:14,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And in fact, we see at grade 10, it has far exceeded 40 to 60.

540
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:19,661
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's probably almost a year and a half worth of growth.

541
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:25,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Next pages have what we have done for

542
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:30,841
[SPEAKER_09]: the readiness this year and will continue to work on those.

543
01:45:32,302 --> 01:45:34,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We have K through 5.

544
01:45:35,763 --> 01:45:37,604
[SPEAKER_09]: We have taken quite a few steps.

545
01:45:37,684 --> 01:45:38,824
[SPEAKER_09]: They are all listed there.

546
01:45:40,165 --> 01:45:45,707
[SPEAKER_09]: We have also done data coordination for grades 3 through 5, grades who are taking MCAS.

547
01:45:47,367 --> 01:45:54,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have also done quite some work in in-district collaboration and out-of-district collaboration at

548
01:45:55,783 --> 01:45:58,426
[SPEAKER_09]: this level, elementary level specifically.

549
01:45:59,907 --> 01:46:07,374
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have taken action items at the middle school level and at the high school level.

550
01:46:08,536 --> 01:46:16,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have listed the future steps as I foresee for mathematics department for the district.

551
01:46:23,138 --> 01:46:24,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

552
01:46:24,078 --> 01:46:25,239
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

553
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:29,681
[SPEAKER_13]: You gave me plenty of opportunity for questions, but I don't want to keep us here all night.

554
01:46:31,922 --> 01:46:34,723
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I look at these variations between 2017 and 2018,

555
01:46:38,673 --> 01:46:43,114
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know whether or not there's any statistical significance to the differences.

556
01:46:43,955 --> 01:46:50,157
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think the state's website provides that information as I've looked at it endlessly.

557
01:46:50,557 --> 01:46:52,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And they don't tell you anything about whether it means anything.

558
01:46:53,017 --> 01:46:53,998
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

559
01:46:54,978 --> 01:47:01,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have the details to be able to know does a change from 6% to 7%?

560
01:47:03,681 --> 01:47:07,382
[SPEAKER_13]: It's easy to get excited when we go up 2% and then get all depressed when we go down 2%.

561
01:47:08,444 --> 01:47:13,688
[SPEAKER_13]: But they could be completely meaningless and have nothing to do with anything other than it's a different set of kids who took the test.

562
01:47:13,948 --> 01:47:15,269
[SPEAKER_13]: That is true.

563
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:25,136
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's where I struggle with all this information, is that what's actually important is the state doesn't seem to really be interested in that.

564
01:47:25,598 --> 01:47:28,220
[SPEAKER_13]: But do you have more details that help to understand that?

565
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:33,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't mind telling me the page number and the table number, that will help.

566
01:47:33,403 --> 01:47:35,284
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on page 4, the first table.

567
01:47:35,704 --> 01:47:36,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

568
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:45,890
[SPEAKER_13]: So looking at third grade, exceeding expectations, we went from 6% to 8%, which sounds good.

569
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:47,611
[SPEAKER_13]: The state went from 7% to 10%.

570
01:47:47,811 --> 01:47:48,311
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

571
01:47:48,571 --> 01:47:52,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you didn't know anything about math, you'd say, well, we didn't increase as well as we should have.

572
01:47:52,894 --> 01:47:54,375
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

573
01:47:55,315 --> 01:47:59,558
[SPEAKER_13]: how many kids actually took the test, and it's a different set of kids.

574
01:48:02,381 --> 01:48:06,624
[SPEAKER_09]: There are way too many factors that go into play into that.

575
01:48:06,924 --> 01:48:18,994
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we – it's like it's 1 percent growth, but when you really – or 2 percent growth, but when you really look into it, it could have been a variety of factors.

576
01:48:19,054 --> 01:48:20,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So it could have been

577
01:48:21,431 --> 01:48:23,092
[SPEAKER_09]: As you said, demographics changed.

578
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:29,315
[SPEAKER_09]: It could have been a certain set of students were just not feeling it that day.

579
01:48:29,395 --> 01:48:31,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they didn't have a good night's sleep.

580
01:48:31,356 --> 01:48:39,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, you know, we failed to identify a particular kind of problem, so they missed one problem.

581
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,281
[SPEAKER_09]: They may have been CUSP students.

582
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:49,247
[SPEAKER_13]: So we shouldn't get too excited by up and down a few percent is how I take that data.

583
01:48:50,547 --> 01:48:53,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Going up a couple percent doesn't mean we necessarily started doing something better.

584
01:48:54,488 --> 01:48:58,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like going down a couple percent doesn't mean we started doing something worse.

585
01:48:58,769 --> 01:48:59,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

586
01:49:08,248 --> 01:49:10,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is referenced in a couple of places.

587
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:14,873
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be quarterly Envisioned Benchmark Assessments.

588
01:49:14,993 --> 01:49:15,994
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

589
01:49:16,154 --> 01:49:22,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Are those assessments something we – have we been doing them at less frequency, or is it all new that we're going to start doing them?

590
01:49:23,652 --> 01:49:26,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So we started it this year.

591
01:49:26,614 --> 01:49:29,335
[SPEAKER_09]: We started the assessments this year.

592
01:49:30,036 --> 01:49:38,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have taken them right out of envisions because we did not invest in another program that would mimic MCAS-like

593
01:49:39,769 --> 01:49:40,290
[SPEAKER_09]: questions.

594
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:42,692
[SPEAKER_09]: The best we could do this year was envisions.

595
01:49:43,232 --> 01:49:54,263
[SPEAKER_09]: We took it from them, but we supplemented the multiple choice benchmarks with a constructed response question, which would be more in line with MCAS questions.

596
01:49:54,943 --> 01:49:58,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So the coaches put it together so that the students have a good combination.

597
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:03,431
[SPEAKER_13]: And are these tests the tests that the teachers are using to assess grades?

598
01:50:06,184 --> 01:50:07,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you mind repeating that, please?

599
01:50:07,785 --> 01:50:10,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Are these the same tests that a teacher would use to assess the grade?

600
01:50:11,047 --> 01:50:11,828
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

601
01:50:11,868 --> 01:50:14,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers are using unit tests for that.

602
01:50:14,729 --> 01:50:23,215
[SPEAKER_09]: These are benchmarks so that we know where a student is in terms of a particular concept and teachers can work on it.

603
01:50:26,075 --> 01:50:37,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes we have tested students on a benchmark, on a question in a benchmark, just to see where a student initially is, where a class is initially.

604
01:50:37,989 --> 01:50:41,673
[SPEAKER_09]: How much should a teacher, how much of a time should a teacher dedicate?

605
01:50:41,983 --> 01:50:43,423
[SPEAKER_09]: to that particular concept.

606
01:50:43,503 --> 01:50:44,723
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they coming in with?

607
01:50:45,164 --> 01:50:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So benchmarks serve many, many purposes.

608
01:50:48,864 --> 01:50:51,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be just to figure out where the class is.

609
01:50:51,485 --> 01:50:57,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be to figure out certain, you know, certain subgroups of students.

610
01:50:57,586 --> 01:51:04,587
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have used it for many, many, like the coaches and I actually sit down and analyze the data to see what's going on.

611
01:51:04,887 --> 01:51:10,768
[SPEAKER_09]: And then coaches go back and talk to the teachers about the particular concept that wasn't

612
01:51:11,683 --> 01:51:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: that we didn't see much performance on in the benchmarks.

613
01:51:16,026 --> 01:51:16,306
Okay.

614
01:51:17,507 --> 01:51:22,950
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, one thing that I worry about is that we spend all of our time testing the kids and not teaching them.

615
01:51:24,451 --> 01:51:34,257
[SPEAKER_13]: And between MCAS prep tests or whatever the proper terminology is, and these tests, these are all in addition to unit tests teachers are doing.

616
01:51:34,277 --> 01:51:35,758
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

617
01:51:35,998 --> 01:51:37,319
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'd like to make a motion

618
01:51:37,998 --> 01:51:56,063
[SPEAKER_13]: that a report be provided to the committee by April 8, detailing all tests, including practice tests given to students K through 8th grade, broken down by grade level and school, exempting tests teachers give to assess grades, so those unit tests are not included.

619
01:51:56,863 --> 01:52:02,585
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like this report to include frequency and duration of the tests, and practice tests need to be clearly demarcated.

620
01:52:05,726 --> 01:52:06,846
[SPEAKER_16]: How long should the test take?

621
01:52:08,862 --> 01:52:19,970
[SPEAKER_16]: So the only thing with duration would be some students need more time than others, but the intention could be one instructional period that the students are allowed to have.

622
01:52:20,131 --> 01:52:23,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean not actual duration, just expected duration.

623
01:52:24,494 --> 01:52:27,456
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have it printed so you don't have to... Oh, okay.

624
01:52:27,876 --> 01:52:28,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

625
01:52:28,737 --> 01:52:29,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

626
01:52:29,478 --> 01:52:30,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

627
01:52:32,897 --> 01:52:33,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

628
01:52:33,938 --> 01:52:36,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is really good data.

629
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:56,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though a small variable or, you know, different kids or different classes or different people taking the test at different times, it gives us a broad area of which areas, like, which concepts in math we're stronger at and which ones we aren't.

630
01:52:57,667 --> 01:53:00,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like seeing some of this data.

631
01:53:01,557 --> 01:53:16,862
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if this is broken down by subgroups and what groups of students need more time, more attention, more tutoring for these types of evaluations.

632
01:53:17,442 --> 01:53:31,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering if you have that data that might be beneficial for people, for us to make future determinations on what subgroups might need, if they need more time,

633
01:53:31,502 --> 01:53:50,156
[SPEAKER_06]: If they need more practice, if they need more facilitators giving the exam or small groups or whatever, we just want to make sure that those students are also progressing and are successful in this and have every opportunity to be successful in this way.

634
01:53:50,697 --> 01:53:57,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So for future reference, some subgroup information when this is presented would be helpful.

635
01:53:58,223 --> 01:53:58,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

636
01:54:02,172 --> 01:54:03,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for this report.

637
01:54:04,193 --> 01:54:19,100
[SPEAKER_02]: On page 5, one of the things I noticed, and you sort of did a side throwaway comment, was that, in fact, at the grade 4 level and grade 5, there really seems to be some struggle with fractions.

638
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:19,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

639
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said, and I noticed this as a high school teacher.

640
01:54:23,122 --> 01:54:29,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of that is, and I do see some of your action items do include remedial help.

641
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:38,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it seems like that this is something that we might need to work into some regular classrooms just to make sure that our students really are getting it.

642
01:54:39,002 --> 01:54:48,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So apart from the remedial MCAS sessions, is there possibility to bring this into the regular math classrooms?

643
01:54:48,525 --> 01:54:48,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

644
01:54:49,045 --> 01:54:51,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the coaches are already doing that.

645
01:54:51,345 --> 01:54:57,267
[SPEAKER_09]: They have been in the classrooms modeling how to teach lessons that pertain to fractions specifically.

646
01:54:58,059 --> 01:55:15,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are also doing some professional development with the teachers to coach them how to deliver the information to the students in a smaller setting with manipulatives or using different hands-on activities.

647
01:55:16,037 --> 01:55:17,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

648
01:55:17,178 --> 01:55:21,181
[SPEAKER_02]: The follow-up then also was on page 10.

649
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:31,948
[SPEAKER_02]: For your future items, I see you wrote, adopt an inquiry-based mathematics program that will increase higher-level thinking for a more successful mathematics experience at the high school.

650
01:55:32,028 --> 01:55:32,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

651
01:55:32,648 --> 01:55:34,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be a very important piece.

652
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:38,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering whether you're thinking that adoption would take place.

653
01:55:39,193 --> 01:55:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about it yet, so I'm not thinking you're suggesting this coming year, or are you?

654
01:55:46,519 --> 01:55:55,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a great question, and thank you for asking, because it has been at the heart and soul of what I have been thinking about for middle school.

655
01:55:57,408 --> 01:56:05,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe there are many, many programs out there, and teachers have been piloting for quite some time, as you all know probably already.

656
01:56:05,594 --> 01:56:13,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And now there are a few programs that are very inquiry-based, very explorations-based, rather than

657
01:56:13,985 --> 01:56:21,175
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the heavy textbooks from which a teacher could just stand and teach.

658
01:56:21,515 --> 01:56:22,737
[SPEAKER_09]: These programs actually

659
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:25,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Let students explore.

660
01:56:26,674 --> 01:56:31,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Let the teacher bring the whole class to a conclusion, because the students are already getting there.

661
01:56:32,756 --> 01:56:38,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And then send them back in small groups, then back again together, and then a bigger group summary.

662
01:56:38,737 --> 01:56:41,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a couple of programs out there.

663
01:56:41,878 --> 01:56:45,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I am definitely looking more seriously into it.

664
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:47,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I have asked the teachers to pilot it.

665
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,961
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of them have been piloting it for a couple of years now.

666
01:56:51,721 --> 01:56:52,822
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have good data.

667
01:56:52,942 --> 01:56:59,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I have gone to other districts and seen the other teachers teach off of that program.

668
01:56:59,886 --> 01:57:06,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And the name of the program is Illustrative Math by Open Up Resources.

669
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:15,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And I invite everybody to give it a try if you are interested in finding out more.

670
01:57:15,655 --> 01:57:20,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there is Big Ideas book, and then there is, of course, Envision's program as well.

671
01:57:21,016 --> 01:57:21,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

672
01:57:21,616 --> 01:57:24,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that something you're going to be bringing to us during budget time?

673
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:28,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

674
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:28,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

675
01:57:28,541 --> 01:57:28,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

676
01:57:29,061 --> 01:57:29,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

677
01:57:30,142 --> 01:57:31,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

678
01:57:31,282 --> 01:57:32,583
[SPEAKER_02]: We have yet to get this.

679
01:57:32,823 --> 01:57:33,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

680
01:57:33,464 --> 01:57:33,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.

681
01:57:33,924 --> 01:57:35,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll be on the lookout for it.

682
01:57:35,185 --> 01:57:35,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

683
01:57:35,325 --> 01:57:36,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I want to bring it up.

684
01:57:36,245 --> 01:57:36,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

685
01:57:36,706 --> 01:57:36,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

686
01:57:36,846 --> 01:57:37,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

687
01:57:37,266 --> 01:57:43,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, I just wanted to mention that this Saturday I was driving in my car and I was listening to NPR and there was a TED Talk on.

688
01:57:44,032 --> 01:57:46,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And the TED Talk was on teaching mathematics.

689
01:57:46,553 --> 01:57:50,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And the particular part that I happened to be listening to was the importance of struggle.

690
01:57:50,896 --> 01:58:02,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because I had the opportunity to go with the superintendent to do one of the walkthroughs in math, and that was one of the criteria that we looked at and that I saw and understood.

691
01:58:03,302 --> 01:58:11,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought that it was just a great thing then to be sitting and listening to the TED Talk about how we should be teaching math.

692
01:58:11,206 --> 01:58:12,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to mention that.

693
01:58:12,934 --> 01:58:13,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

694
01:58:13,795 --> 01:58:28,584
[SPEAKER_16]: I also just wanted to make one comment back on page 5 when we were looking at the difference when you talked about number and operations fractions, and that definitely was something that, you know, stuck out.

695
01:58:30,105 --> 01:58:38,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And the fact that in third grade the students seem to have truly mastered it, so it did make us really think about what

696
01:58:40,983 --> 01:58:41,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

697
01:58:41,183 --> 01:58:54,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Kahn said earlier about the third grade students had the benefit of using this particular curriculum since kindergarten, where the fourth grade had a different start.

698
01:58:54,547 --> 01:59:03,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm very curious to see how the students will do, now that we're armed with this information, we're able to kind of be strategic and intentional.

699
01:59:03,997 --> 01:59:05,578
[SPEAKER_16]: about our instruction of fractions.

700
01:59:06,058 --> 01:59:15,663
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to say that it is something that we are aware of and we're paying close attention to continue to make data-informed decisions for our students.

701
01:59:16,584 --> 01:59:16,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

702
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:21,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

703
01:59:22,287 --> 01:59:23,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I've noticed this on page five here.

704
01:59:24,008 --> 01:59:24,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

705
01:59:24,888 --> 01:59:28,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a significant drop from grade three to grade four.

706
01:59:29,491 --> 01:59:30,871
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you believe?

707
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:31,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is that?

708
01:59:34,356 --> 01:59:38,197
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a significant drop overall.

709
01:59:38,417 --> 01:59:44,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what the superintendent said, is that we are keeping an eye in geometry.

710
01:59:44,999 --> 01:59:49,741
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking at all these different strands that are listed here.

711
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:55,823
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are also keeping in mind that these students were using everyday math.

712
01:59:57,955 --> 02:00:01,377
[SPEAKER_09]: So the program could have been very outdated.

713
02:00:01,597 --> 02:00:07,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not too sure what curriculum frameworks was it using.

714
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe 2006, I'm going to assume, or maybe 2011.

715
02:00:09,341 --> 02:00:11,882
[SPEAKER_09]: But these students were tested on 2017 frameworks, not on 2011.

716
02:00:19,305 --> 02:00:22,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So the difference from 2011 to 2017 was huge.

717
02:00:23,068 --> 02:00:29,653
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have taught them from a program for like three, four years from 2011 framework.

718
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:33,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one year of teaching on 2017, and now we are testing them on 2017.

719
02:00:35,317 --> 02:00:37,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that also probably has to do something with it.

720
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:45,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have a sense of, in the past when we've had these breakdowns, we've been able to see which schools have been performing at what levels.

721
02:00:46,226 --> 02:00:48,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have a sense, are there any,

722
02:00:49,208 --> 02:00:51,370
[SPEAKER_15]: disparities between different schools on these?

723
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:52,591
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in the first report.

724
02:00:54,913 --> 02:00:57,555
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but do you have the per subject breakdown on that?

725
02:00:58,696 --> 02:00:58,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

726
02:00:59,877 --> 02:01:00,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

727
02:01:00,057 --> 02:01:03,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Lazaro left the original, the fall reports.

728
02:01:04,081 --> 02:01:04,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

729
02:01:04,902 --> 02:01:07,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the new one that was on the desk.

730
02:01:07,063 --> 02:01:07,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

731
02:01:07,404 --> 02:01:08,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

732
02:01:08,605 --> 02:01:08,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

733
02:01:09,265 --> 02:01:10,646
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't catch it in the envelope.

734
02:01:16,463 --> 02:01:17,084
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a follow-up.

735
02:01:17,144 --> 02:01:18,586
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot to ask this one question.

736
02:01:18,606 --> 02:01:35,327
[SPEAKER_13]: On page nine for future steps, I was a little surprised to see the idea of kindergartners through fifth graders doing 70 minutes of uninterrupted mathematics instruction.

737
02:01:35,876 --> 02:01:40,859
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, when I was in college, we took a break in 70-minute classes.

738
02:01:41,479 --> 02:01:42,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you explain that?

739
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:45,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't think it means exactly what I think it means.

740
02:01:45,581 --> 02:01:45,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

741
02:01:46,121 --> 02:01:47,222
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you for that.

742
02:01:47,662 --> 02:01:50,704
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, again, another excellent question.

743
02:01:51,292 --> 02:02:12,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this first year that I'm learning a lot about mathematics being taught at, you know, from different levels, what I'm noticing at different schools is that there are lots, sometimes there are two different breaks during a math block.

744
02:02:12,497 --> 02:02:16,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So we say we are giving them, we are giving our students 65 or 60 minutes of

745
02:02:19,119 --> 02:02:31,593
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's sometimes being split in like 10 or 15 minutes and then we teach something else and then we come back to it and then we take another break and then we teach mathematics again.

746
02:02:32,154 --> 02:02:35,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it could be mixed with snack and what not.

747
02:02:36,666 --> 02:02:50,394
[SPEAKER_09]: When we really look at the studies that have proven students to make significant difference in mathematics and have learned math,

748
02:02:52,472 --> 02:03:02,976
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a different way of teaching rather than, or I should say math block can be interrupted, but it should not be such that the whole flow is broken.

749
02:03:03,216 --> 02:03:12,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you do it and then maybe sometimes even a different teacher picks up, what happens is that the coherence is interrupted.

750
02:03:12,279 --> 02:03:14,100
[SPEAKER_09]: So that takes away from focus.

751
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:18,822
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe another way of looking at it is that

752
02:03:20,295 --> 02:03:31,479
[SPEAKER_09]: do device a mathematics block that keeps student learning and focus at the center of that learning.

753
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:33,880
[SPEAKER_09]: That's probably a better way of putting it.

754
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:41,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if I may take that back and put it there, that was my equivalent version of it.

755
02:03:41,123 --> 02:03:44,404
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe again I had my high school mathematics hat on.

756
02:03:44,704 --> 02:03:45,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

757
02:03:45,444 --> 02:03:46,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

758
02:03:46,125 --> 02:03:46,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

759
02:03:49,158 --> 02:03:50,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yeah, follow-up question.

760
02:03:51,038 --> 02:03:53,199
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much for this that you give us today.

761
02:03:53,239 --> 02:04:03,481
[SPEAKER_15]: But is it possible that we could look at, in the future, or perhaps with the report that you're sending to Member Rousseau, is it possible you could do a per-subject breakdown per school?

762
02:04:03,661 --> 02:04:09,102
[SPEAKER_15]: So we could see that maybe we could get a couple more measurement and data specialists at the Columbus.

763
02:04:09,122 --> 02:04:10,522
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be useful for me to see.

764
02:04:10,843 --> 02:04:11,683
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

765
02:04:11,823 --> 02:04:17,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like you've provided the aggregate data per school, it would be very useful for me to know per subject on each school.

766
02:04:18,484 --> 02:04:24,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So, by per subject, what do you... Oh, by... By strength, you mean by domain standard?

767
02:04:24,286 --> 02:04:29,828
[SPEAKER_15]: By strength, like geometry, measurement data, fractions, all of these, I guess, subtopics.

768
02:04:29,848 --> 02:04:32,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be nice to know the breakdown per school as well.

769
02:04:32,709 --> 02:04:32,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

770
02:04:33,569 --> 02:04:33,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

771
02:04:34,549 --> 02:04:36,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Rousseau, would it be okay if I added that to your motion?

772
02:04:42,104 --> 02:04:42,765
[SPEAKER_15]: make another motion.

773
02:04:42,785 --> 02:04:45,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, then I'd like to, or unless we have to, sorry, excuse me.

774
02:04:46,427 --> 02:04:52,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to make a motion that we have the breakdown for schools that are at the convenient, by topic, thank you.

775
02:04:53,373 --> 02:05:07,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

776
02:05:08,324 --> 02:05:09,225
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we remember.

777
02:05:12,554 --> 02:05:24,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Let a report be provided to the committee by April 8, detailing all tests, including practice tests given to students K-8, grades broken out by grade level and school, exempting unit test teachers to assess grades.

778
02:05:24,829 --> 02:05:30,797
[SPEAKER_07]: This report shall include frequency and planned duration of tests, and practice tests shall be clearly demarcated.

779
02:05:33,318 --> 02:05:35,019
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a second on the floor by Ms.

780
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Mustone.

781
02:05:35,659 --> 02:05:36,480
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

782
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:36,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

783
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

784
02:05:38,661 --> 02:05:52,047
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm concerned just about the timetable, not getting the information, but getting that information and just thinking in terms of everything else that's being done to have it by April 8th is very quick.

785
02:05:52,927 --> 02:05:57,750
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you said not including the unit assessments, but I would prefer to give you a more

786
02:05:58,973 --> 02:06:02,014
[SPEAKER_16]: accurate list, a more thorough list.

787
02:06:02,034 --> 02:06:05,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you be more flexible with the date that the superintendent?

788
02:06:05,474 --> 02:06:06,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

789
02:06:06,614 --> 02:06:20,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we have two meetings back-to-back in April, and with back-to-back meetings, that ties up central office very... The time demand is... As soon as possible?

790
02:06:20,057 --> 02:06:20,837
[SPEAKER_08]: May 6th.

791
02:06:21,817 --> 02:06:22,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

792
02:06:22,477 --> 02:06:23,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, May 6th.

793
02:06:23,337 --> 02:06:24,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Amended to May 6th.

794
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:26,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, all those in favor?

795
02:06:26,956 --> 02:06:28,477
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed, motion carries.

796
02:06:29,318 --> 02:06:33,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And on Mr. Ruggiero's, that this be broken out by school by topic.

797
02:06:34,302 --> 02:06:34,482
Correct?

798
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:35,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

799
02:06:36,063 --> 02:06:37,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by Mr. Benedetto.

800
02:06:37,384 --> 02:06:38,084
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

801
02:06:38,845 --> 02:06:39,566
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

802
02:06:39,966 --> 02:06:40,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

803
02:06:41,447 --> 02:06:41,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

804
02:06:41,907 --> 02:06:42,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Kahn.

805
02:06:42,348 --> 02:06:42,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

806
02:06:42,968 --> 02:06:43,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

807
02:06:43,308 --> 02:06:43,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

808
02:06:45,810 --> 02:06:46,371
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

809
02:06:49,473 --> 02:06:53,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Report on 2018 Science MCAS Strategic Analysis and Curriculum Initiatives.

810
02:06:54,036 --> 02:06:54,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Cieri.

811
02:06:55,515 --> 02:06:56,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

812
02:06:56,496 --> 02:06:58,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope everyone is doing well.

813
02:06:58,117 --> 02:06:59,618
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you've been here for some hours.

814
02:07:00,298 --> 02:07:07,383
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try to string together some of the strands that are in the report rather than read right from it.

815
02:07:07,483 --> 02:07:11,786
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you bear with me, I'll try to look up at my audience.

816
02:07:12,727 --> 02:07:18,830
[SPEAKER_12]: look back down at the report, make sure I don't miss anything, and then open up the floor for questions that you have on the report.

817
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:23,512
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll begin with test design just as Ms.

818
02:07:23,552 --> 02:07:24,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Kahn had.

819
02:07:24,733 --> 02:07:26,514
[SPEAKER_12]: There are two test designs currently.

820
02:07:27,734 --> 02:07:32,096
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the legacy MCAS that all the students took this past year in 2018 at grades 5, 8, and 9 or 10.

821
02:07:36,933 --> 02:07:46,135
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there is the next generation MCAS, which will be administered for the first time in grades five and eight this year.

822
02:07:48,996 --> 02:07:52,616
[SPEAKER_12]: In grades nine and 10, we'll still be with the legacy MCAS.

823
02:07:53,757 --> 02:07:59,438
[SPEAKER_12]: The other component of the next generation MCAS, which makes it a little bit different than the legacy,

824
02:08:00,045 --> 02:08:02,488
[SPEAKER_12]: is that the fact that these are computer-based tests.

825
02:08:03,249 --> 02:08:09,196
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to keep that in mind that a grade 5 and a grade 8 test in a subject area will be for the first time.

826
02:08:09,717 --> 02:08:15,644
[SPEAKER_12]: They've taken it on computers, but this is the first time that they have a computer-based test in a subject area.

827
02:08:16,407 --> 02:08:22,769
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing that we want to keep in mind is that the question types change at grades 5 and 8 on this test.

828
02:08:23,229 --> 02:08:30,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's a chart to explain the next generation MCAS exam and the types of questions that the students will face.

829
02:08:32,092 --> 02:08:37,333
[SPEAKER_12]: They will have selected response, which is the term that they use for a multiple choice question.

830
02:08:38,494 --> 02:08:41,975
[SPEAKER_12]: There are multiple select answers,

831
02:08:42,689 --> 02:08:47,358
[SPEAKER_12]: that the students choose from among several answer options.

832
02:08:48,039 --> 02:08:53,790
[SPEAKER_12]: It may have two answers that are correct, and the students have to choose both correct answers.

833
02:08:54,845 --> 02:09:00,770
[SPEAKER_12]: There are technology enhanced questions where students may drag and drop answers onto a picture.

834
02:09:01,951 --> 02:09:04,192
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be hotspots that they'll have to click.

835
02:09:04,873 --> 02:09:09,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And there'll also be drop-down menus where they'll have to click, drag, and select the answers.

836
02:09:10,617 --> 02:09:18,844
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to that, it goes to a traditional constructed response, which will be a hand-scored component of the test.

837
02:09:19,733 --> 02:09:25,696
[SPEAKER_12]: And that particular part is similar to what was an open response item in the past.

838
02:09:26,057 --> 02:09:32,860
[SPEAKER_12]: However, you'll notice that the points allocated for that particular type of question is different.

839
02:09:33,201 --> 02:09:34,321
[SPEAKER_12]: It used to be four points.

840
02:09:34,942 --> 02:09:39,784
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gone over to two or three points, depending on the type of question.

841
02:09:41,365 --> 02:09:46,528
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing that you'll notice on the chart, and I'm on page two just in case you're trying to keep up

842
02:09:47,918 --> 02:09:51,601
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a set of common items for the grade 5 and grade 8 exam.

843
02:09:52,802 --> 02:10:01,408
[SPEAKER_12]: The breakdown tells you exactly how many questions will be of the different types of questions and how many total raw points each student will have to accumulate.

844
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:06,172
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they also add in what they call matrix questions.

845
02:10:07,053 --> 02:10:13,278
[SPEAKER_12]: And matrix questions are the questions that the testing will use but they won't report.

846
02:10:14,012 --> 02:10:25,801
[SPEAKER_12]: to the student or to districts, but they use them to field test a particular type of question in a topic or also for equating purposes.

847
02:10:25,821 --> 02:10:40,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe what that means is they're trying to make sure that there's some internal consistency among different versions of tests and how the test questions are being asked within a cohort of people that take an exam.

848
02:10:42,477 --> 02:10:46,902
[SPEAKER_12]: The reporting categories will more or less remain the same for grades five and eight.

849
02:10:47,042 --> 02:10:58,334
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a breakdown of 25% for each of the content areas in science, earth and space science, life science, physical science, and technology engineering.

850
02:10:59,675 --> 02:11:00,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year,

851
02:11:02,038 --> 02:11:08,467
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to the content reporting categories, they also are reporting on the science and engineering practices.

852
02:11:09,809 --> 02:11:18,520
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of these items will be double-coded when the reporting comes out, and the students will be given a content

853
02:11:19,878 --> 02:11:22,799
[SPEAKER_12]: score and also how they do on their science practices.

854
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:27,381
[SPEAKER_12]: This is all new to us in the science world.

855
02:11:28,202 --> 02:11:34,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be kind of our first exploration in the data in the upcoming school year.

856
02:11:35,725 --> 02:11:41,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll have to see how it all sort of plays out in terms of understanding what that data will tell us.

857
02:11:42,583 --> 02:11:49,471
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing that I would like you to notice is that after the table on page 3, there's a little statement about the benchmarking.

858
02:11:50,252 --> 02:11:53,636
[SPEAKER_12]: And the benchmarking won't happen until this summer for the first time.

859
02:11:54,237 --> 02:11:59,663
[SPEAKER_12]: So grade 5 and grade 8 exams, the first time these exams will be benchmarked to the

860
02:12:00,537 --> 02:12:15,483
[SPEAKER_12]: MCAS 2.0 like achievement standards that you're used to seeing, exceeding expectations, meeting expectations, partially meeting expectations and not meeting expectations, they will be benchmarked the first time this year.

861
02:12:16,563 --> 02:12:24,967
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a lot that's going to change very rapidly during this testing period and through the next year.

862
02:12:26,056 --> 02:12:37,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that tells us is that our data analysis for this year probably will have to change for next year based on these new data points that we're going to have.

863
02:12:39,022 --> 02:12:54,709
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to kind of keep that in mind that we're trying to adapt to a new testing type and also make sure that we understand how there's some kind of consistency within the curriculum and within the testing world.

864
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:58,291
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are new changes and something we need to think about.

865
02:13:01,831 --> 02:13:05,752
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go down to the second section, the data analysis.

866
02:13:06,373 --> 02:13:15,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I reported the achievement data summary table, and I simply summarized it based on this past year's data.

867
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:25,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's essentially a repeat of the report from October 2, but it just takes this year's data and gives you the grade level achievement and the state achievement.

868
02:13:25,793 --> 02:13:38,016
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the stories that we need to pull from that, and we noticed it back then, was that the grade five scores were significantly different at grade five from the state.

869
02:13:38,856 --> 02:13:44,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that we wanted to look at was what does that mean from the district standpoint.

870
02:13:45,827 --> 02:13:52,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I looked at different types of standards and CUSP data, very much like Ms.

871
02:13:52,053 --> 02:14:07,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Kahn had done, just to see if there were areas within the content that were a challenge for kids, a particular challenge, and also whether the CUSP data could glean some information from that particular report.

872
02:14:08,852 --> 02:14:22,555
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll notice that that next table from grade five provides you with information on how the district and state did in comparison to one another on the, I guess you could call them the bottom five or the

873
02:14:23,725 --> 02:14:32,288
[SPEAKER_12]: top five most difficult question types of the 2018 exam in grade five, and that's the report that you see.

874
02:14:32,328 --> 02:14:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: So you see the differential between the district and the state score.

875
02:14:37,210 --> 02:14:47,114
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, at item number 14, that's a multiple choice item, the district scored 66%, the state scored a 76%, correct, and there's a difference of 10%.

876
02:14:47,614 --> 02:14:51,396
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I reported which domain and cluster that ended up in.

877
02:14:52,837 --> 02:15:00,723
[SPEAKER_12]: There were two areas, two domains that really showed some discrepancy, and that would be the life science and the earth science.

878
02:15:01,323 --> 02:15:08,168
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's going to kind of inform the next part of the report, like what do we do with that information and how can we use it moving forward?

879
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:19,817
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll also notice one of the open responses on that particular test, item number 42, across the state was a very difficult question.

880
02:15:20,375 --> 02:15:25,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Students achieved less than 50% on that, so a 1.84 out of 4.0 scale.

881
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:32,081
[SPEAKER_12]: We achieved 1.58 out of a 4.0 scale, and that was in Earth and Space, Earth Systems.

882
02:15:33,041 --> 02:15:38,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, we're seeing a pattern of content that we want to pay attention to.

883
02:15:39,864 --> 02:15:40,905
[SPEAKER_12]: In the CUSP data,

884
02:15:41,864 --> 02:15:50,388
[SPEAKER_12]: I reported by school, and I included the proficient or above, the needs improvement that were high scores, 236 to 238, and then 230 to 236.

885
02:15:50,428 --> 02:15:50,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

886
02:15:50,628 --> 02:15:50,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Russo?

887
02:15:51,048 --> 02:15:52,869
[SPEAKER_12]: On the CUSP scores, wouldn't it be 236 to 239, and also 230 to 235?

888
02:16:09,169 --> 02:16:11,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that they score in two-point increments.

889
02:16:12,512 --> 02:16:13,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, oh, oh.

890
02:16:13,933 --> 02:16:14,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

891
02:16:14,314 --> 02:16:14,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

892
02:16:15,335 --> 02:16:16,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's kind of unusual.

893
02:16:16,796 --> 02:16:18,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Two-point increments.

894
02:16:18,518 --> 02:16:19,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

895
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:20,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

896
02:16:21,337 --> 02:16:39,245
[SPEAKER_12]: When we look at the needs improvement high-scaled scores, we're really talking about a one to three questions point swing, if a student would get one to three questions on that test or points, raw points from the exam to move them into the proficient range for these particular students.

897
02:16:39,425 --> 02:16:44,347
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be slightly more, maybe four questions for that lower group, the 230 to 236, but for that high group,

898
02:16:46,201 --> 02:16:51,305
[SPEAKER_12]: It's anywhere from one question or an extra point on an open response to two questions.

899
02:16:52,106 --> 02:16:59,972
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason I'm reporting it out is so that we can get a sense of how close students were to achieving a proficient or higher score.

900
02:17:00,452 --> 02:17:06,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll notice that the percentages of students, when we add it all together, puts us in a really different place.

901
02:17:08,432 --> 02:17:14,136
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's kind of important because, again, this is a strand that we want to think about from an instructional standpoint.

902
02:17:14,596 --> 02:17:23,482
[SPEAKER_12]: What is it that we can do to try to bolster a one or two question swing by students while they're taking the test?

903
02:17:24,062 --> 02:17:24,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll leave that.

904
02:17:24,823 --> 02:17:32,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'm going to let it hang for a little bit, and then I'll pick it up a little later in the explanation.

905
02:17:36,593 --> 02:17:45,137
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that we like to do is to get students familiar with tests, test format, the types of questions that they will face.

906
02:17:45,718 --> 02:17:59,324
[SPEAKER_12]: But unfortunately, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education increased the number of questions that they were releasing from 15 to 25 in December of this year, of last year, December of 2018.

907
02:18:01,011 --> 02:18:02,813
[SPEAKER_12]: So the teachers have had very little time.

908
02:18:02,853 --> 02:18:04,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was after a request.

909
02:18:05,655 --> 02:18:10,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I was at a meeting where they were explaining that they were going to release more questions.

910
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:13,943
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was in early November, the very beginning of November.

911
02:18:14,323 --> 02:18:17,225
[SPEAKER_12]: And it took until December to get those questions released to us.

912
02:18:18,527 --> 02:18:21,129
[SPEAKER_12]: So they increased it to one test session.

913
02:18:21,189 --> 02:18:22,350
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what that represents.

914
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:26,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Those 25 questions are a release of one test session.

915
02:18:28,135 --> 02:18:30,896
[SPEAKER_12]: with the hope that this could be useful to students.

916
02:18:31,396 --> 02:18:43,261
[SPEAKER_12]: However, if you think about how many questions that is, in practice it's very few to begin to think about a strategy around getting students ready.

917
02:18:43,442 --> 02:18:44,142
[SPEAKER_12]: What it can do

918
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:54,785
[SPEAKER_12]: is allow us to do some kind of mock or practice of one session just to see how the computer works with those particular questions.

919
02:18:54,885 --> 02:19:05,432
[SPEAKER_12]: But other than that, you're really not going to get depth of understanding of whether a student is showing a weakness or a struggle with a particular test type or content area.

920
02:19:05,733 --> 02:19:07,233
[SPEAKER_12]: There's simply not enough questions.

921
02:19:08,374 --> 02:19:13,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving forward, the FOSS program includes an online assessment tool for us.

922
02:19:14,597 --> 02:19:20,789
[SPEAKER_12]: that is coded and we could use that, we could leverage that purchase in that program.

923
02:19:21,282 --> 02:19:27,124
[SPEAKER_12]: to allow us to collect some additional data as students move through our curriculum from K to 5.

924
02:19:27,624 --> 02:19:30,985
[SPEAKER_12]: So this can be used as a tool for us.

925
02:19:31,485 --> 02:19:34,646
[SPEAKER_12]: At the lower elementary grades, I wouldn't recommend that process.

926
02:19:34,686 --> 02:19:46,849
[SPEAKER_12]: They're a little young and far enough away from testing that we can find other ways to assess them that is not a computer screen or a paper test to be able to gather some data.

927
02:19:46,869 --> 02:19:49,210
[SPEAKER_12]: There are lots of other alternatives that we can use.

928
02:19:50,270 --> 02:20:07,135
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, students will be doing a lot of notebooking, and that record of scientific knowledge will be there for them, and we can use that to kind of correlate data and see where students' struggles might be on a particular unit or topic.

929
02:20:08,721 --> 02:20:14,570
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the great things that this body has done is adopted the FOSS program.

930
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:16,612
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a fantastic program.

931
02:20:17,374 --> 02:20:20,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I congratulate you on choosing this program for our students.

932
02:20:20,438 --> 02:20:20,999
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great.

933
02:20:21,549 --> 02:20:23,550
[SPEAKER_12]: It includes everything, soup to nuts.

934
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:35,534
[SPEAKER_12]: There were over 35 pallets of equipment sent on December 20th to Medford High School and the McGlynn School, of which we unpacked and got to classrooms.

935
02:20:35,614 --> 02:20:48,699
[SPEAKER_12]: So every classroom now, we're about 99.99% delivered with all of the content materials that we will be paying for in the next couple of years.

936
02:20:51,303 --> 02:20:55,110
[SPEAKER_12]: It's there, and this is an extraordinary opportunity.

937
02:20:55,693 --> 02:21:04,677
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that we have done in addition to having this program is that we provided training on March 12th for the teachers on how to use that first unit.

938
02:21:05,217 --> 02:21:08,819
[SPEAKER_12]: And we thought, based on our data, let's go with earth science.

939
02:21:09,039 --> 02:21:11,120
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the area of challenge.

940
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:13,481
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the best area to begin.

941
02:21:14,041 --> 02:21:15,822
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an exciting topic for the kids.

942
02:21:15,882 --> 02:21:17,102
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very hands-on.

943
02:21:18,243 --> 02:21:23,165
[SPEAKER_12]: And the materials that the kids will use are absolutely developmentally appropriate.

944
02:21:23,685 --> 02:21:28,007
[SPEAKER_12]: And the teachers are really excited to be able to go through and use this stuff.

945
02:21:28,147 --> 02:21:30,749
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a great benefit.

946
02:21:31,809 --> 02:21:37,853
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing that will come of this is next year, when we start school, we're going to start with earth science.

947
02:21:38,333 --> 02:21:46,757
[SPEAKER_12]: So even though we're switching the order of things for this first year, last earth science and first earth science, this is a huge benefit.

948
02:21:47,177 --> 02:21:50,159
[SPEAKER_12]: And the teachers having that familiarity with it this year

949
02:21:50,893 --> 02:22:00,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And going into next year with the training and having the familiarity is going to make it that much quicker for them to comprehend what's going on and being more comfortable with the materials.

950
02:22:01,556 --> 02:22:05,437
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll then move to physical science and then to life science in the spring.

951
02:22:06,357 --> 02:22:10,838
[SPEAKER_12]: It has many, many living things that'll be in the classroom.

952
02:22:11,677 --> 02:22:21,961
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are a bit difficult to keep alive and to keep in a classroom in the fall or in the winter just because, you know, the springtime is when all of these things are born.

953
02:22:22,541 --> 02:22:28,603
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to order in the spring and teach life science in the spring, but it's a great time to be doing that particular unit.

954
02:22:28,663 --> 02:22:32,985
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to match up with so many exciting things for K to 5.

955
02:22:34,234 --> 02:22:39,958
[SPEAKER_12]: At the 6th through 12th level, we are refining some of our curriculum topics.

956
02:22:40,938 --> 02:22:55,107
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I want to advise against is using the grade 5 data exclusively to move forward and look at the deficits, because the standards change when you go to grade 6 and grade 8.

957
02:22:55,986 --> 02:23:03,710
[SPEAKER_12]: And they change to a degree that they're not necessarily connected in the same way that they are in a mathematics or an ELA curriculum.

958
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:08,733
[SPEAKER_12]: They change and they're new in some cases.

959
02:23:08,813 --> 02:23:23,200
[SPEAKER_12]: There are strand maps available to make conceptual connections, but that's a really difficult thing for both a teacher and a student to follow what that sort of theoretical connection is between one content area and another.

960
02:23:23,759 --> 02:23:32,562
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the grade 5 exam, while an important data point, doesn't really serve a forward-looking curriculum.

961
02:23:32,602 --> 02:23:34,562
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd have to look ahead to that.

962
02:23:34,923 --> 02:23:41,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we work on curriculum with grade 6 and grade 7 in particular at that grade level.

963
02:23:42,625 --> 02:23:47,987
[SPEAKER_12]: As we said before, the MCAS exam is still giving us some limited information to be able to use.

964
02:23:48,647 --> 02:23:51,368
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll work on that as more test questions are released.

965
02:23:55,542 --> 02:23:55,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me.

966
02:23:57,523 --> 02:24:02,124
[SPEAKER_12]: In grades 6 through 12, I'm on page 7, just if you're following along with me.

967
02:24:03,745 --> 02:24:06,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I'll start at the top at the future steps.

968
02:24:06,666 --> 02:24:10,387
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll move to page 7, future steps.

969
02:24:10,487 --> 02:24:15,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Grades K to 5, we have a challenge.

970
02:24:16,349 --> 02:24:23,372
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to know what the early indicators on struggling is.

971
02:24:24,061 --> 02:24:27,503
[SPEAKER_12]: because we wait until grade five to take that test.

972
02:24:28,063 --> 02:24:34,245
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's hard to know at grade three and grade four what content areas the students struggle in.

973
02:24:35,046 --> 02:24:39,328
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're going to try to leverage those FOSS materials.

974
02:24:40,048 --> 02:24:43,930
[SPEAKER_12]: A second thing that we want to think about, which I think I mentioned before with the CUSP score,

975
02:24:45,058 --> 02:24:49,100
[SPEAKER_12]: If students are one or two questions away, that's test-taking strategy.

976
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:52,081
[SPEAKER_12]: That's eliminating choices.

977
02:24:52,622 --> 02:24:53,742
[SPEAKER_12]: It's narrowing down.

978
02:24:53,882 --> 02:24:54,643
[SPEAKER_12]: It's highlighting.

979
02:24:54,843 --> 02:25:06,168
[SPEAKER_12]: It's looking at what the question is asking and using all of those skills to make sure that you understand what that one question is trying to get in terms of an answer.

980
02:25:06,608 --> 02:25:18,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there are writing, very simple writing things like restating what the question is asking your answer, providing the evidence that is found in the question to support an argument.

981
02:25:18,582 --> 02:25:21,525
[SPEAKER_12]: These are really simple things that kids can do and that they're taught.

982
02:25:21,585 --> 02:25:23,487
[SPEAKER_12]: They're taught by teachers.

983
02:25:23,527 --> 02:25:24,969
[SPEAKER_12]: They're test-taking strategies.

984
02:25:24,989 --> 02:25:26,010
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not necessarily

985
02:25:26,508 --> 02:25:31,450
[SPEAKER_12]: content or curriculum-based decisions, they're done right in the classroom.

986
02:25:31,830 --> 02:25:51,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And just bringing that to the surface as we instruct and we encourage kids will be a strong, hopefully a positive way of making sure that the students move from that needs improvement category of what will be partially meeting expectations to the meeting expectations.

987
02:25:54,421 --> 02:26:12,193
[SPEAKER_12]: In the grade 6 through 12, middle school, again, we've talked a little bit about content and curriculum review, but we also want to think about perhaps investing in a new program at some point for middle school.

988
02:26:12,513 --> 02:26:14,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And the teachers have expressed that interest.

989
02:26:15,015 --> 02:26:21,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So this year, as the year kind of wraps up, we're going to have a committee that comes together to review what's available.

990
02:26:22,277 --> 02:26:27,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I've given you the name of the one program that came back with the green light.

991
02:26:27,539 --> 02:26:29,039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called Amplify Science.

992
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:33,340
[SPEAKER_12]: The good thing is this is directly connected to the FOSS program.

993
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:36,181
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same people that developed Amplify Science.

994
02:26:36,681 --> 02:26:41,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're looking at maybe refining some things.

995
02:26:43,033 --> 02:26:50,060
[SPEAKER_12]: keeping a program that started in K-5 moving into grades 6 through 8 with some modifications.

996
02:26:50,481 --> 02:26:54,705
[SPEAKER_12]: The challenge of an amplified science program is that it does require technology.

997
02:26:54,805 --> 02:26:59,049
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've got to think about, do you go with a FOSS program that has dual

998
02:26:59,908 --> 02:27:05,851
[SPEAKER_12]: type opportunities, or do you invest in technology and go with a program like an Amplify Science?

999
02:27:06,492 --> 02:27:08,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that you'll think about down the road.

1000
02:27:08,153 --> 02:27:13,876
[SPEAKER_12]: It's distant away, but something that we want to keep on our radar as we move forward.

1001
02:27:16,678 --> 02:27:19,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, we're not going to tie ourselves to a program.

1002
02:27:19,519 --> 02:27:20,440
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to investigate.

1003
02:27:21,323 --> 02:27:31,934
[SPEAKER_12]: the best of the best, bring them in, have them present their programs, and then make a recommendation to this body, and then decide whether we want to pilot this year or not.

1004
02:27:32,795 --> 02:27:36,098
[SPEAKER_12]: We can make a decision not to and wait it out, or we can go with a pilot.

1005
02:27:37,167 --> 02:27:50,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually when you tie yourself into a pilot, the expectation from the vendor side that I've learned this year is that you will purchase a program, one or another, and you will give them some guidance about your decision making.

1006
02:27:50,894 --> 02:27:56,557
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's important to provide them that information, which I did for McGraw-Hill last year and for FOSS this year.

1007
02:27:59,038 --> 02:28:02,360
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are sort of the big pieces that are in the report.

1008
02:28:03,317 --> 02:28:06,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I do give you a list of some of the out-of-district initiatives.

1009
02:28:06,783 --> 02:28:10,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to go through them all, but I do want to just acknowledge the partners.

1010
02:28:11,350 --> 02:28:15,377
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Tufts University, you can tell, the chemistry department, the engineering department.

1011
02:28:16,307 --> 02:28:24,172
[SPEAKER_12]: the Office of the President, have been very big supporters of what goes on in Medford, in particular in the Department of Science.

1012
02:28:24,652 --> 02:28:36,199
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we want to continue that and nurture that partnership because it's very, very beneficial from an instructional standpoint, from a student experience standpoint, and from all kinds of other

1013
02:28:36,841 --> 02:28:49,806
[SPEAKER_12]: opportunities that they have, that they've provided to us, specifically to Somerville and to the Chinatown community, where their three locations are found, their three campuses are found.

1014
02:28:50,766 --> 02:28:56,289
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing that you'll notice is something that we have put together through an NSF-funded program.

1015
02:28:56,469 --> 02:28:59,790
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in year three of a project called Precipitating Change.

1016
02:29:00,446 --> 02:29:07,708
[SPEAKER_12]: This particular project is enormously innovative because it uses near real-time data.

1017
02:29:07,828 --> 02:29:17,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It teaches kids how to analyze weather events first, and then uses data, and tries to simulate on paper and using technology

1018
02:29:17,971 --> 02:29:21,213
[SPEAKER_12]: how a weather event is tracked.

1019
02:29:21,773 --> 02:29:36,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we've noticed the past few months of data, even maybe the past two weeks of some of the weather events that have occurred, we know that this is sort of a very rich area of finding information.

1020
02:29:36,341 --> 02:29:37,682
[SPEAKER_12]: And so arming our kids with

1021
02:29:38,313 --> 02:29:47,916
[SPEAKER_12]: the ability to understand how that data is collected, analyzed, and looked at from a broad scale is a really powerful thing.

1022
02:29:48,296 --> 02:30:01,620
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is going to be shared nationally once it's done with other school districts, and also it comes home to us as a completed project so we can continue to use it.

1023
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:05,263
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, really amazing what's going on.

1024
02:30:05,623 --> 02:30:19,355
[SPEAKER_12]: And the data that Millersville University is involved in the data analysis, they've noticed some off-the-chart data with what the kids are performing on tests that look at them.

1025
02:30:21,024 --> 02:30:25,806
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're a district, I feel like, that has made some really positive moves.

1026
02:30:26,246 --> 02:30:29,727
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hoping to see some positive moves in the data.

1027
02:30:29,787 --> 02:30:34,448
[SPEAKER_12]: We know where our weaknesses are and where our strengths can be.

1028
02:30:35,228 --> 02:30:37,349
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully, we can move forward.

1029
02:30:37,969 --> 02:30:40,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to conclude my report there and leave it open for questions.

1030
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:41,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Giro.

1031
02:30:41,650 --> 02:30:43,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, make sure you have them.

1032
02:30:43,511 --> 02:30:44,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the report.

1033
02:30:44,491 --> 02:30:46,532
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciated the executive summary here.

1034
02:30:47,712 --> 02:30:49,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we just go to page four of your report, please?

1035
02:30:49,533 --> 02:30:49,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1036
02:30:50,784 --> 02:30:54,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So just sort of walk me through this table at the bottom of page four.

1037
02:30:54,708 --> 02:31:01,375
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are a number of domains and clusters that are associated with them, and these are the highlights, the areas that we need work.

1038
02:31:01,395 --> 02:31:02,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that basically the end?

1039
02:31:03,617 --> 02:31:03,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1040
02:31:04,217 --> 02:31:15,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we were to look at a strand, at the test itself, what we try to cull is the questions that the students struggled most on.

1041
02:31:15,605 --> 02:31:19,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And the top five on the list are reported to you.

1042
02:31:20,348 --> 02:31:27,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Those particular ones are showing some weakness as a group on the earth science and life science questions.

1043
02:31:27,373 --> 02:31:28,934
[SPEAKER_15]: But you don't get a whole table that says item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?

1044
02:31:31,416 --> 02:31:37,282
[SPEAKER_12]: We could do that, but these are the ones that are the most revealing to us as a district.

1045
02:31:38,403 --> 02:31:48,933
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we want to make sure that if there's only one question in a particular cluster, that we don't take that as the rule of what goes on for that particular topic.

1046
02:31:49,431 --> 02:31:50,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, right.

1047
02:31:50,392 --> 02:31:51,432
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be just useful to me.

1048
02:31:51,492 --> 02:32:04,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's no rush on this, but if we could get like a PDF, save the paper of all the different items and the districts and state scores, it would just be helpful for me just to get a more complete sense of what's going on.

1049
02:32:04,181 --> 02:32:09,384
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the executive summary and not like a thick binder of problem, you know, issues that we can look on now.

1050
02:32:09,444 --> 02:32:13,947
[SPEAKER_15]: But at home, it would be nice for me to look over these domain by domain.

1051
02:32:14,647 --> 02:32:20,172
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could break that down by school, I mean, is it challenging to break down by school or just a printout?

1052
02:32:20,712 --> 02:32:33,203
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be really helpful to me to see what areas that we could, perhaps there might be an environment that we could leverage someone in the community that has experience with something, for example, molecules to organisms.

1053
02:32:36,786 --> 02:32:39,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, all set.

1054
02:32:39,248 --> 02:32:40,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo, point of information?

1055
02:32:40,589 --> 02:32:40,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1056
02:32:41,815 --> 02:32:47,239
[SPEAKER_13]: We, when we get the item number, we get item number, we don't actually get what the question was, right?

1057
02:32:47,820 --> 02:32:49,201
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the question.

1058
02:32:49,301 --> 02:32:49,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

1059
02:32:49,461 --> 02:32:52,904
[SPEAKER_12]: So in these particular instances, you can actually see the question.

1060
02:32:52,944 --> 02:32:56,827
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you went to grade five MCAS, you can get the question.

1061
02:32:57,107 --> 02:32:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1062
02:32:57,187 --> 02:32:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get the question?

1063
02:33:00,049 --> 02:33:00,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1064
02:33:00,569 --> 02:33:01,190
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1065
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:01,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1066
02:33:02,751 --> 02:33:03,091
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1067
02:33:03,131 --> 02:33:03,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

1068
02:33:04,132 --> 02:33:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1069
02:33:05,193 --> 02:33:07,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you for the report.

1070
02:33:08,476 --> 02:33:11,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited about the new science program, I'm sure.

1071
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:16,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Other members are thrilled that we're going to be getting that as well.

1072
02:33:16,582 --> 02:33:30,890
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also would like, not for this report, but in future reports, subgroup categories as well as school categories, just to make sure that all of our subgroups are meeting similar benchmarks to our

1073
02:33:34,408 --> 02:33:34,988
[SPEAKER_06]: to each other.

1074
02:33:35,568 --> 02:33:37,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, CUSP scores.

1075
02:33:37,969 --> 02:33:50,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I know all of you present CUSP scores, and I know that that data is important and informative for planning purposes, but I also want to know, I want people to know, yeah, we were two or three questions away.

1076
02:33:50,792 --> 02:33:57,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to, not that you are, because I don't think you are, but in general, in past years, it was like, oh, but we were so close.

1077
02:33:59,052 --> 02:34:03,275
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to name what we are so we can move forward.

1078
02:34:03,756 --> 02:34:07,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get too tied up on CUSP scores, like we're almost there.

1079
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:19,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to use it for data purposes to build and think, but I also want to acknowledge this is what we are and own what we are, so that way we make concrete steps to move forward.

1080
02:34:21,617 --> 02:34:22,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1081
02:34:22,158 --> 02:34:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Kloop.

1082
02:34:24,039 --> 02:34:25,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocco, thank you for your report.

1083
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a little bit concerned and I just hope that the requests that members have made are not going to tie you up for hours and hours and hours to generate additional data.

1084
02:34:36,589 --> 02:34:37,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a problem?

1085
02:34:38,409 --> 02:34:39,390
[SPEAKER_12]: We can pull the report.

1086
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:45,275
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not entirely sure how long it will take, but we can get it done.

1087
02:34:45,856 --> 02:34:46,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1088
02:34:46,896 --> 02:34:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes I think that there's a problem wanting additional data, but also wanting to make sure that we're not tying up our professionals for doing the work that they need to do.

1089
02:34:57,745 --> 02:34:58,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a little concerned about that.

1090
02:34:59,066 --> 02:35:09,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly exciting in your report was the suggestion that there was a middle school program that would build on what we have just adopted with the Amplify Science.

1091
02:35:11,311 --> 02:35:13,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look forward to hearing that.

1092
02:35:13,292 --> 02:35:14,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that possibly?

1093
02:35:14,753 --> 02:35:17,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be tried out next year?

1094
02:35:18,114 --> 02:35:19,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you were suggesting?

1095
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:22,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I'll do is I'll bring together a group.

1096
02:35:22,981 --> 02:35:27,362
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be an open group, the same way that we did for the elementary program.

1097
02:35:28,342 --> 02:35:32,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully members from a variety of constituents will come together.

1098
02:35:32,923 --> 02:35:47,967
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll look at programs from vendors that provide them, review them, rank them, and then provide you with what we think are the top programs.

1099
02:35:49,544 --> 02:35:53,808
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming that this one will come rise to the top.

1100
02:35:54,389 --> 02:36:00,514
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't say that for certain, but this is the one that has gotten the green light from Ed Reports.

1101
02:36:01,235 --> 02:36:05,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So would that happen by the beginning of next September?

1102
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:12,225
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I brought a report of that type, it would probably come out in June.

1103
02:36:13,266 --> 02:36:13,706
[SPEAKER_12]: This June?

1104
02:36:13,766 --> 02:36:14,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1105
02:36:14,467 --> 02:36:14,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1106
02:36:16,206 --> 02:36:21,547
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I spend the summer just trying to work out some kind of plan if that's the direction we want to go.

1107
02:36:21,647 --> 02:36:22,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's exciting.

1108
02:36:22,668 --> 02:36:24,488
[SPEAKER_02]: We can build on the momentum we have.

1109
02:36:25,108 --> 02:36:27,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thank you very much.

1110
02:36:28,529 --> 02:36:28,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1111
02:36:29,029 --> 02:36:34,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to accept this report, place it in the file, and follow up from some of the data points?

1112
02:36:34,510 --> 02:36:38,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that the superintendent will be in touch with you on what's been requested.

1113
02:36:39,391 --> 02:36:40,132
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1114
02:36:40,152 --> 02:36:40,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1115
02:36:41,072 --> 02:36:41,812
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1116
02:36:42,192 --> 02:36:42,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1117
02:36:43,812 --> 02:36:44,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Seery.

1118
02:36:44,773 --> 02:36:45,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1119
02:36:50,468 --> 02:36:56,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Item 9, report on 2018 English Language Arts MCAS strategic analysis and curriculum.

1120
02:36:57,094 --> 02:36:58,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Chiesa.

1121
02:37:04,901 --> 02:37:06,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everybody.

1122
02:37:07,163 --> 02:37:11,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. DeLave is going to set up my projector, because I have a few things to showcase for you.

1123
02:37:11,667 --> 02:37:14,049
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wait one minute for him to set it up.

1124
02:37:14,069 --> 02:37:14,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that OK?

1125
02:37:32,185 --> 02:37:32,766
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

1126
02:37:33,986 --> 02:37:34,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1127
02:37:34,547 --> 02:37:34,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind.

1128
02:37:34,907 --> 02:37:37,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone move suspension and we can take some of the other.

1129
02:37:37,148 --> 02:37:38,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1130
02:37:38,669 --> 02:37:39,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Suspension by Ms.

1131
02:37:39,529 --> 02:37:41,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloet, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1132
02:37:41,610 --> 02:37:43,171
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor of suspension?

1133
02:37:44,531 --> 02:37:45,292
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1134
02:37:45,432 --> 02:37:46,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Suspension is granted.

1135
02:37:47,373 --> 02:37:54,056
[SPEAKER_07]: New business school committee resolution be resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Dorothy Palladino.

1136
02:37:54,692 --> 02:37:54,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1137
02:37:54,932 --> 02:38:00,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Palladino was the mother-in-law of City Council President and former school committee member John Falco, Jr.

1138
02:38:00,654 --> 02:38:00,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1139
02:38:00,914 --> 02:38:08,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Palladino was an active member of the Friends of the Medford Public Library, and we also have two under suspension.

1140
02:38:09,277 --> 02:38:14,419
[SPEAKER_07]: We have resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Anthony Staffier.

1141
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:18,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Staffier was a security officer for Medford Public Schools for over 30 years.

1142
02:38:20,452 --> 02:38:26,137
[SPEAKER_07]: and also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Phyllis Louise McCormick.

1143
02:38:26,677 --> 02:38:26,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1144
02:38:26,857 --> 02:38:33,703
[SPEAKER_07]: McCormick was a first and second grade teacher at the Osgoode School in Medford for many years and received a key to the city when she retired.

1145
02:38:34,904 --> 02:38:42,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Osgoode was my home school, so I had the privilege of knowing Mrs. McCormick and her sister, Mrs. Carroll, and just amazing teachers.

1146
02:38:43,391 --> 02:38:47,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran into her often around the community, so she will be missed.

1147
02:38:48,323 --> 02:38:50,385
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1148
02:38:58,091 --> 02:38:58,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1149
02:38:58,471 --> 02:39:04,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

1150
02:39:04,836 --> 02:39:05,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Van De Kloet, seconded by Ms.

1151
02:39:05,857 --> 02:39:06,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Di Benedetto.

1152
02:39:06,397 --> 02:39:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1153
02:39:07,578 --> 02:39:08,318
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1154
02:39:09,239 --> 02:39:09,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1155
02:39:09,419 --> 02:39:09,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Chiesa.

1156
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:10,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1157
02:39:11,521 --> 02:39:14,443
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to be here tonight.

1158
02:39:18,456 --> 02:39:21,757
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an opportunity in the fall to present you with the initial data.

1159
02:39:22,317 --> 02:39:24,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that Ms.

1160
02:39:24,518 --> 02:39:35,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Kahn, Mr. Seery, and I are excited to be here tonight so we can showcase to you what we do after that initial meeting, which, as you've seen from both of them, is quite a lot.

1161
02:39:36,602 --> 02:39:43,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to begin tonight by providing you with some information about the ELA MCAS test design.

1162
02:39:43,564 --> 02:39:47,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And similar to mathematics, we are dealing with two different exams.

1163
02:39:47,982 --> 02:39:51,085
[SPEAKER_01]: one at the three through eight level, and one at the high school level.

1164
02:39:51,605 --> 02:39:57,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you know, the elementary is involved in the next generation ELA MCAS.

1165
02:39:58,451 --> 02:40:05,957
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an extremely comprehensive assessment, and it's taking into account multiple layers of ELA skills.

1166
02:40:06,558 --> 02:40:10,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing, language, reading comprehension, and analytical skills.

1167
02:40:11,302 --> 02:40:16,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Students in grades three through five are assessed using the pre-K through five learning standards,

1168
02:40:16,887 --> 02:40:18,388
[SPEAKER_01]: and three content strands.

1169
02:40:18,789 --> 02:40:30,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So in front of you up there, you have four of the different, what they refer to as anchor standards, that encompass our entire English language arts state curriculum.

1170
02:40:30,938 --> 02:40:33,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading, writing, speaking and listening, and language.

1171
02:40:34,461 --> 02:40:39,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And of those four anchor standards, we are assessed at the MCAS on three out of the four.

1172
02:40:40,961 --> 02:40:42,822
[SPEAKER_01]: which is reading, writing, and language.

1173
02:40:43,222 --> 02:40:47,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And all three are present within all of the exams.

1174
02:40:48,864 --> 02:41:05,531
[SPEAKER_01]: The reading anchor standards, I'm sorry it's small, but I know you have this information in your report, but what I want to emphasize here is that the reading standards are much more than just decoding and fluency and the ability to decipher those words.

1175
02:41:05,731 --> 02:41:07,132
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the reading standards

1176
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:14,364
[SPEAKER_01]: encompass key ideas and details, craft and structure, integration of knowledge, and ideas.

1177
02:41:15,305 --> 02:41:17,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a level of complexity.

1178
02:41:18,107 --> 02:41:22,410
[SPEAKER_01]: The writing anchor standards similarly... Is that writing or is that language?

1179
02:41:22,510 --> 02:41:28,514
[SPEAKER_01]: The writing anchor standards talk about much more than just the ability to write a paragraph.

1180
02:41:29,054 --> 02:41:33,197
[SPEAKER_01]: They are saying, does the student know the different text types and purposes?

1181
02:41:33,995 --> 02:41:37,619
[SPEAKER_01]: The student has to show the ability to produce and distribute writing.

1182
02:41:38,239 --> 02:41:42,284
[SPEAKER_01]: The student has to show the ability to research and build present knowledge.

1183
02:41:43,385 --> 02:41:46,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And the student also has to have a range of writing.

1184
02:41:48,717 --> 02:41:50,938
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, we have the language standard.

1185
02:41:51,298 --> 02:42:08,083
[SPEAKER_01]: And the language standard is not just standard English conventions, which is what we normally think of when we hear language, but it's conventions of standard, but it's also knowledge of language, such as figurative language, and also vocabulary acquisition and use.

1186
02:42:09,283 --> 02:42:17,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And students in grades 6 through 12, although what you're looking at in front of you is elementary, students in grades 6 through 12 have the same anchor standards and the same

1187
02:42:18,443 --> 02:42:19,244
[SPEAKER_01]: domains there.

1188
02:42:22,466 --> 02:42:24,048
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen the assessment as well.

1189
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:24,848
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that.

1190
02:42:24,888 --> 02:42:26,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I provided that to you this weekend.

1191
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:34,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you did some homework, you may have understood from that that this is much more than just the ability to read the passage and answer a few questions.

1192
02:42:34,817 --> 02:42:37,119
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's quite difficult in nature.

1193
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:44,465
[SPEAKER_01]: When taking the assessment, students have to read multiple passages and answer challenging multiple choice questions.

1194
02:42:45,063 --> 02:42:51,188
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to give you an overview of the general sense of how a next-generation test is broken up.

1195
02:42:51,928 --> 02:42:54,871
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a variety of one-point questions.

1196
02:42:55,091 --> 02:42:58,093
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there, there's 21 to 27 one-point questions.

1197
02:42:58,133 --> 02:43:00,275
[SPEAKER_01]: This is approximate, but it gives you a sense.

1198
02:43:00,835 --> 02:43:06,500
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also a number of two-point questions, so the student will get two points for answering those questions correctly.

1199
02:43:07,206 --> 02:43:10,870
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three essays that the students are graded on.

1200
02:43:11,030 --> 02:43:17,556
[SPEAKER_01]: However, often students will have to answer four essays over a two-course day, over a course of two days.

1201
02:43:19,198 --> 02:43:21,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has the total points on the test.

1202
02:43:22,141 --> 02:43:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading, language, and writing is divided into different percentages.

1203
02:43:27,686 --> 02:43:29,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, and again this is general,

1204
02:43:30,181 --> 02:43:36,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, reading accounts for 50%, language 20%, and writing 30%, giving us that 100%.

1205
02:43:37,107 --> 02:43:43,812
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see it's encompassing a variety of different standards, reading, writing, and language.

1206
02:43:49,656 --> 02:44:04,665
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we want to keep in mind is when we're thinking about reading comprehension, the test itself, when we switch to the next generation, had a renewed emphasis on looking at two, and sometimes at these upper levels, three passages when answering questions.

1207
02:44:05,325 --> 02:44:08,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Several questions that these students take are multi-tiered.

1208
02:44:08,667 --> 02:44:12,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could say, what is the main idea of this passage?

1209
02:44:12,689 --> 02:44:18,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's part A. And then part B may be, what is the textual evidence that brought you to that response?

1210
02:44:20,082 --> 02:44:23,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's obviously, bullet three, a new emphasis on textual evidence.

1211
02:44:24,685 --> 02:44:26,546
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some examples of questions.

1212
02:44:26,966 --> 02:44:34,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, which statement best describes a major difference between the author's purposes in two different excerpts?

1213
02:44:34,670 --> 02:44:45,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So the child is looking at two excerpts, having to understand what the author's purpose is in both, and then being able to decipher what the major difference is between the two.

1214
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:57,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I provide this example to show you that there are many steps in answering these questions, and that's another reason why I gave you a version of a few different grade levels.

1215
02:44:57,883 --> 02:45:03,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, there's a question that says, read the sentence from paragraph 13 of this passage.

1216
02:45:03,825 --> 02:45:11,027
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you the sentence, and then it says, which sentence from the other passage, instead of detention, makes the same point?

1217
02:45:11,707 --> 02:45:15,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, a lot of comparing between different passages.

1218
02:45:15,189 --> 02:45:18,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a shift for us at the elementary, middle, and high school level.

1219
02:45:19,112 --> 02:45:28,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shift we've prepared for over the past couple of years because we had this exam last year, but it's something that we are looking at when we prepare for this exam.

1220
02:45:29,959 --> 02:45:38,645
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two-part questions, as I mentioned, what ideas presented in both passages, and then choose the set of details that best supported your answer.

1221
02:45:40,982 --> 02:45:44,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is that new emphasis on textual evidence, which I already talked about.

1222
02:45:46,923 --> 02:46:02,026
[SPEAKER_01]: You received in your packets the paper version of the test, but our kids receive, except if you were a third grader last year, received the... take the... the test is administered, excuse me, obviously, on the computer.

1223
02:46:02,426 --> 02:46:07,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm taking the test as a fourth grader, I am seeing two different passages pop up.

1224
02:46:08,890 --> 02:46:10,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have my little pointer here.

1225
02:46:10,952 --> 02:46:16,236
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice, sometimes we deal with some technological issues.

1226
02:46:16,316 --> 02:46:23,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that sometimes a child would think that that stopped there, but they had to scroll down to see more.

1227
02:46:23,902 --> 02:46:24,663
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I'm saying there?

1228
02:46:24,743 --> 02:46:30,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a technology component that we're working with as well that often will hinder someone.

1229
02:46:30,327 --> 02:46:31,868
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say, oh, this is in front of me.

1230
02:46:32,249 --> 02:46:37,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, we have to get them used to the fact that, no, you need to scroll down to see the end of the story.

1231
02:46:39,865 --> 02:46:45,167
[SPEAKER_01]: When they are answering questions, students have the ability to toggle between the two passages.

1232
02:46:45,227 --> 02:46:47,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is tab one, and then this would be tab two.

1233
02:46:49,108 --> 02:46:53,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can go back and forth when they have different sets of questions.

1234
02:46:53,609 --> 02:47:02,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, taking into consideration that that is not always an easy thing for a fourth grader, an eight-year-old, to do.

1235
02:47:02,672 --> 02:47:04,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had my own eight-year-old practice

1236
02:47:04,813 --> 02:47:06,714
[SPEAKER_01]: He's back and forth, toggling back and forth.

1237
02:47:06,815 --> 02:47:07,735
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be challenging.

1238
02:47:07,815 --> 02:47:11,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So we deal with these technology issues as well when we think about the MCAS.

1239
02:47:14,140 --> 02:47:17,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's late, so I won't go through all these questions.

1240
02:47:17,823 --> 02:47:30,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to show you that we also, in addition to textual evidence questions and analytical questions, they also have something called technology enhanced questions, which are generally two points.

1241
02:47:31,165 --> 02:47:40,490
[SPEAKER_01]: A technology enhanced question is going to have the student answer a question about the reading passage, but now they're going to have to maybe drag and drop a response.

1242
02:47:41,250 --> 02:47:50,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Or here they're going to have to choose different pieces using the trackpad on the Chromebook or the mice on the desktop.

1243
02:47:53,477 --> 02:47:58,759
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at writing, so those are the reading comprehension questions, the multiple choice questions.

1244
02:47:59,099 --> 02:48:00,000
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at writing,

1245
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:06,143
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to keep in mind that we are dealing with writing now in response to the text.

1246
02:48:06,584 --> 02:48:14,669
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the writing that is asked of the next generation test relates back to an excerpt and often excerpts that they will read.

1247
02:48:15,489 --> 02:48:21,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing types can include argumentative, informative or explanatory, and a narrative.

1248
02:48:22,533 --> 02:48:29,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is one rubric used for all writing types, which is, let me find it, I'm going to go out of order for a minute, the rubric.

1249
02:48:30,325 --> 02:48:36,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's small, but the rubric grades you on idea development and standard English conventions.

1250
02:48:37,066 --> 02:48:41,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So two separate scores, one for idea development and one for standard English conventions.

1251
02:48:42,467 --> 02:48:56,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I share this with you because these are things that we look at with my staff, K through 12, three through 12, to figure out where are we falling down in the writing or where are we doing well.

1252
02:48:57,430 --> 02:48:58,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's split up.

1253
02:48:59,496 --> 02:49:01,717
[SPEAKER_01]: The essay questions can range.

1254
02:49:01,937 --> 02:49:03,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few examples for you here.

1255
02:49:04,878 --> 02:49:12,120
[SPEAKER_01]: The second bullet says, based on drive-ins, the last great picture show, write an essay explaining why drive-in movie theaters appeal to families.

1256
02:49:12,580 --> 02:49:15,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to use information from the article to develop your essay.

1257
02:49:16,642 --> 02:49:26,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Another essay could ask the child to write an essay explaining the themes in Celeste's heart and principles and principles, and be sure to use how they are similar.

1258
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:30,812
[SPEAKER_01]: and be sure to use information from both passages to develop your essay.

1259
02:49:31,032 --> 02:49:45,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really giving the kids not just superficial knowledge of reading an essay and giving me the main idea, but digging deeper, getting into that analytical, not just what is the theme, but how is it similar and what can I do to get there.

1260
02:49:46,702 --> 02:49:55,027
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm answering an essay online, if I'm asked to answer between two passages, I'll have this ability to toggle.

1261
02:49:55,601 --> 02:49:58,102
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I'll have my space to write.

1262
02:49:59,743 --> 02:50:05,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students, especially at the elementary and middle school, have to be reminded that they can go beyond this box.

1263
02:50:06,126 --> 02:50:11,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another technology issue that may seem obvious to us, but certainly not to a child.

1264
02:50:11,849 --> 02:50:16,351
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work with them on that, in addition to, obviously, the writing ability.

1265
02:50:17,131 --> 02:50:20,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of an informative explanatory essay.

1266
02:50:22,955 --> 02:50:36,900
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are seeing at the grades 3 through 8 has been a narrative essay where the child is asked to continue writing a story using dialogue or retelling a story in a different point of view.

1267
02:50:38,801 --> 02:50:39,661
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our narrative.

1268
02:50:41,162 --> 02:50:41,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is again.

1269
02:50:43,488 --> 02:50:54,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing for our other type of essay is we're seeing that analytical piece where they're reading one or two essays, identifying perhaps the theme, the mood.

1270
02:50:55,132 --> 02:50:58,853
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the examples in your packages, so you can see different types of questions.

1271
02:50:59,293 --> 02:51:03,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're writing about that, always using textual evidence to support.

1272
02:51:04,635 --> 02:51:10,216
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school, this will be the first year we're using next generation tests, we're seeing them use editorials.

1273
02:51:10,276 --> 02:51:11,917
[SPEAKER_01]: But the state has made it very clear

1274
02:51:12,454 --> 02:51:14,676
[SPEAKER_01]: that any writing genre is up for grabs.

1275
02:51:14,896 --> 02:51:16,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to plan accordingly.

1276
02:51:16,517 --> 02:51:30,069
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just focus, you know, when we're preparing for that MCAS, we need to be aware that all the genres in our sequence need to be, the child needs to be exposed to them throughout the year, which they are.

1277
02:51:35,593 --> 02:51:40,998
[SPEAKER_01]: When they were graded, as you know, they're graded on exceeding expectations, meeting expectations,

1278
02:51:41,583 --> 02:51:44,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Progressing to expectations or not meeting expectations.

1279
02:51:46,624 --> 02:51:50,805
[SPEAKER_01]: The test includes common and matrix questions, as Mr. Seery talked about.

1280
02:51:51,265 --> 02:51:54,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Common questions are counting to the score, and matrix are not.

1281
02:51:54,565 --> 02:52:04,987
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know which is which, so we could have that kiddo at the end of that second day just complain old exhausted when they're writing that fourth essay over the course of two days.

1282
02:52:05,067 --> 02:52:09,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So we deal with the issues of stamina as well when we're preparing for a test such as this.

1283
02:52:11,661 --> 02:52:22,508
[SPEAKER_01]: At the last school committee meeting when we talked about the MCAS, Mr. Russo, you asked me why grade 3 said reading instead of English language arts.

1284
02:52:22,588 --> 02:52:29,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you recall that question, but on the school report card, it lists grade 4 English language arts, grade 5 English language arts.

1285
02:52:29,792 --> 02:52:35,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're going to the school report card, we are seeing how our school performed in the English language arts.

1286
02:52:35,416 --> 02:52:36,977
[SPEAKER_01]: But grade 3 said reading.

1287
02:52:37,882 --> 02:52:39,863
[SPEAKER_01]: misnomer, which we talked about.

1288
02:52:40,244 --> 02:52:49,771
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I did is I took it upon myself to email the state and ask them, why are you listing this as reading when clearly there are many different anchor standards you are noting?

1289
02:52:50,431 --> 02:52:57,937
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually responded to me late tonight, or earlier today, and they have said, and I have a copy if anyone's interested, which maybe, can I pass it to you?

1290
02:53:16,445 --> 02:53:33,893
[SPEAKER_01]: What they said was that this wasn't a misnomer, that they thank Medford for calling this to their attention, and that they will be submitting a request to change grade three to read as English Language Arts and not reading, because as I said in my email to them, I was correct that it is much beyond just reading.

1291
02:53:35,013 --> 02:53:40,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can read from this email, it says, reading is one of the three reporting categories in addition to language and writing.

1292
02:53:41,392 --> 02:53:46,454
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be very clear that we are looking at a multi-tiered exam.

1293
02:53:49,935 --> 02:54:06,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So tonight, when I go over the analysis, what I'm looking at is the overall analysis which you had provided to you in the fall, the cusp analysis, the anchor standard analysis, the domain and standard analysis, and the student growth percentile.

1294
02:54:06,621 --> 02:54:10,382
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just examples of some of the analyses that we do as a

1295
02:54:11,512 --> 02:54:11,972
[SPEAKER_01]: three through 12.

1296
02:54:12,532 --> 02:54:18,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say 12 because we do have 12th graders that are still sometimes working to achieve that competency determination.

1297
02:54:19,514 --> 02:54:21,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard subgroups come up a few times tonight.

1298
02:54:21,675 --> 02:54:25,296
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something we look at, but I don't have it in this report provided tonight.

1299
02:54:25,816 --> 02:54:29,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want the committee to know that that is something that we look at as a staff.

1300
02:54:31,137 --> 02:54:41,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I look at the grade level, the first page three of your document has how these are pieces of information that you were provided with

1301
02:54:41,508 --> 02:54:46,030
[SPEAKER_01]: at the fall report, how we did overall in comparison to the state.

1302
02:54:48,532 --> 02:54:52,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that one of the questions looked at statistically significance.

1303
02:54:53,534 --> 02:54:58,857
[SPEAKER_01]: You can recall that in grades three and four we were above the state.

1304
02:54:59,738 --> 02:55:01,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go over that with you all.

1305
02:55:01,359 --> 02:55:02,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's late and you've had a long night.

1306
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:07,662
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the things I might call out to refer to

1307
02:55:08,463 --> 02:55:13,464
[SPEAKER_01]: What does this percentage mean is if we look at grade three, for example.

1308
02:55:15,505 --> 02:55:19,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Grade three in 2018, we're dealing with almost the same amount of kids in 2018 versus 2017.

1309
02:55:20,126 --> 02:55:21,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 339 third graders in 2017.

1310
02:55:22,026 --> 02:55:22,366
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, we had 332.

1311
02:55:22,506 --> 02:55:25,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I share that with you because in 2018, we had 183 kiddos

1312
02:55:34,597 --> 02:55:36,698
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve exceeding and meeting expectations.

1313
02:55:36,778 --> 02:55:38,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2017, we had 153.

1314
02:55:38,198 --> 02:55:47,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give you some numbers there to see that we really moved that dial about 30 kids into that meeting and exceeding expectations.

1315
02:55:48,122 --> 02:55:51,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just giving you some numbers instead of just the percentages.

1316
02:55:52,044 --> 02:56:01,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, in grade four, we had 28 students in our district exceed expectations in fourth grade in 2018.

1317
02:56:03,307 --> 02:56:05,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2017, we only had 17.

1318
02:56:06,469 --> 02:56:13,613
[SPEAKER_01]: For meeting expectations in 2018, you see it's 45% of our district met expectations, which equates to 149.

1319
02:56:14,534 --> 02:56:18,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2017, we had only 34%, equating to 96.

1320
02:56:19,477 --> 02:56:26,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have some jumps in number, and I don't know if that helps answer some of the concerns in terms of what is statistically significant.

1321
02:56:30,447 --> 02:56:37,412
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already seen data on pages 4 and 5, but I included it there just to remind you.

1322
02:56:38,473 --> 02:56:48,421
[SPEAKER_01]: A reminder that the high school took the legacy MCAS this year, which had really very little to do with referring to an excerpt when they were writing the long composition.

1323
02:56:48,481 --> 02:56:53,865
[SPEAKER_01]: The writing was more about pulling from their prior knowledge of novels or different excerpts.

1324
02:56:54,846 --> 02:57:04,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this year, the high school is moving to the same format that the elementary and middle school have been accustomed.

1325
02:57:04,973 --> 02:57:06,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are preparing for that.

1326
02:57:10,177 --> 02:57:21,645
[SPEAKER_01]: When I look at the CUS scores, which is on page 6, what I've done for you is I have provided you with the percentage of students in each grade level that met or exceeded expectations.

1327
02:57:22,613 --> 02:57:29,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I then looked at the CUSP, which was the range of 490 to 499, and looked at that percentage of students.

1328
02:57:31,001 --> 02:57:41,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that third column, which says meets expectations performance level with CUSP differential, will show you what it would have been had those CUSP kids

1329
02:57:41,705 --> 02:57:43,947
[SPEAKER_01]: achieved the 500 mark.

1330
02:57:44,687 --> 02:57:52,534
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I know Rocco has mentioned this, this is not where we were, but you can see it would have made a significant difference.

1331
02:57:53,034 --> 02:58:02,221
[SPEAKER_01]: If our CUSP kiddos had met that 500 mark, we would have had 78% of our third graders meeting or exceeding expectations, which is quite significant.

1332
02:58:02,621 --> 02:58:06,625
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have had 68% of our fourth graders, 67 of the fifth, 64 of the sixth,

1333
02:58:10,595 --> 02:58:13,717
[SPEAKER_01]: 57 of the 7th graders, and for 8th grade, 62%.

1334
02:58:17,218 --> 02:58:34,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Further into this report, I'm going to provide you with additional information on the various initiatives that we do to support these students, including departmental-specific interventions and deficit analysis to try to move the needle and support them into getting into the meeting expectations range.

1335
02:58:39,985 --> 02:58:48,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to some of the other reports, the ELA MCAS, as I showed you earlier, is broken into what we call the anchor standards.

1336
02:58:48,550 --> 02:58:56,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we do as a department at the first stage of analysis is we look at how we performed in the three different anchor standards.

1337
02:58:57,295 --> 02:59:00,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is provided for you grade by grade.

1338
02:59:03,718 --> 02:59:08,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go over all of it, but the last column shows you how the district did

1339
02:59:08,875 --> 02:59:10,296
[SPEAKER_01]: in comparison to the state.

1340
02:59:10,416 --> 02:59:14,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're looking at grade 3, we see that we have a good story there.

1341
02:59:14,499 --> 02:59:15,980
[SPEAKER_01]: We are plus 3 in language.

1342
02:59:16,020 --> 02:59:17,541
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on par for reading.

1343
02:59:17,641 --> 02:59:19,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are plus 2 for writing.

1344
02:59:19,743 --> 02:59:23,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Grade 4, we have some minor deficits in reading and writing.

1345
02:59:24,446 --> 02:59:28,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go through the different grade levels to see how we stand.

1346
02:59:28,249 --> 02:59:28,969
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're minor.

1347
02:59:28,989 --> 02:59:35,454
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like 1 percentage point above, 1 percentage point below as you go through the different grade levels.

1348
02:59:36,755 --> 02:59:38,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some variances in there as well.

1349
02:59:45,882 --> 02:59:46,883
[SPEAKER_01]: have it for every grade.

1350
02:59:46,943 --> 02:59:47,984
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I know it's late.

1351
02:59:48,004 --> 02:59:48,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've had a long night.

1352
02:59:48,964 --> 02:59:50,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to answer any questions on this.

1353
02:59:52,407 --> 02:59:59,772
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to mention is that as we go forward, this for us as a department is just stage one.

1354
03:00:00,292 --> 03:00:03,354
[SPEAKER_01]: What we then do is we dig deeper as much as we can.

1355
03:00:03,895 --> 03:00:06,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look at the domain and standard analysis.

1356
03:00:06,697 --> 03:00:08,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when we're digging into the questions.

1357
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:13,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look at what the type of question was, what exact

1358
03:00:14,453 --> 03:00:18,755
[SPEAKER_01]: standard it was and where the deficit lied.

1359
03:00:18,775 --> 03:00:25,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we try to go to the question if it's available by the state and see, you know, is this something that's going on with our curriculum?

1360
03:00:25,177 --> 03:00:28,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we not teaching figurative language early enough?

1361
03:00:30,659 --> 03:00:35,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the question, was the question just very wordy and confuse the students?

1362
03:00:35,941 --> 03:00:37,921
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the issue with the standard?

1363
03:00:37,981 --> 03:00:39,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you see on the screen,

1364
03:00:40,243 --> 03:00:43,706
[SPEAKER_01]: is just a basic example of where we might begin as a group.

1365
03:00:43,786 --> 03:00:54,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may start pulling out, okay, this is our area of strength, this is our area of weakness, and then pulling into the standard and seeing, was it the question or was it the standard?

1366
03:00:54,955 --> 03:00:57,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it something in our journeys curriculum that we need to

1367
03:00:58,104 --> 03:00:59,085
[SPEAKER_01]: change the sequence of?

1368
03:00:59,185 --> 03:01:03,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it something at our middle school level that we need to move around or we need to add to?

1369
03:01:03,868 --> 03:01:05,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are where we make some decisions.

1370
03:01:05,510 --> 03:01:08,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we say, you know what, it was just the question.

1371
03:01:08,432 --> 03:01:16,698
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at some of these examples, you'll see the same standard could be a strength in one example, and it could be a weakness in another.

1372
03:01:16,758 --> 03:01:21,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So grade four, we have a strength of 1.01, but it's also a weakness.

1373
03:01:21,522 --> 03:01:24,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, sometimes it depended on the type of question.

1374
03:01:26,629 --> 03:01:30,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's very important to me is the student growth percentile.

1375
03:01:32,714 --> 03:01:36,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll see here is looking at the mean SGP.

1376
03:01:37,118 --> 03:01:45,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So at each grade, the mean SGP was strong for Medford students in grades three through eight, taking the next generation ELA MCAS.

1377
03:01:45,525 --> 03:01:48,227
[SPEAKER_01]: In each grade, we were higher or equal to 48%.

1378
03:01:49,168 --> 03:01:51,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our fourth grade's mean SGP at 49%.

1379
03:01:54,742 --> 03:02:05,644
[SPEAKER_01]: 5th grade, 49, 6th grade, 48, 7th grade, 51, 8th grade, 61, and 10th grade, 58%.

1380
03:02:08,945 --> 03:02:11,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are growing as a district year by year.

1381
03:02:17,327 --> 03:02:21,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions I can answer before I move to what we do next with this data?

1382
03:02:25,853 --> 03:02:33,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what we do next, working with myself and my two lead teachers, Mr. Bowen Flynn and Ms.

1383
03:02:33,938 --> 03:02:40,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanford, one of whom is here tonight, we look at, we do a variety of different things.

1384
03:02:40,442 --> 03:02:45,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of going through each piece, what I want you to think about this is themes.

1385
03:02:45,966 --> 03:02:47,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first step is data analysis.

1386
03:02:47,907 --> 03:02:51,990
[SPEAKER_01]: The data I'm sharing with you is really the first layer for them.

1387
03:02:53,106 --> 03:03:08,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Every teacher at the secondary, middle, and high school level have a data drive that I've established for them where they have the MCAS data, data from Study Island, other pieces of data to make data-informed decisions in their classroom.

1388
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:18,987
[SPEAKER_01]: And what those drives may look like, for example, would be they would have the item analysis, so step-by-step of how each of their students, their former students did,

1389
03:03:19,736 --> 03:03:25,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can see where the curriculum areas are where we struggled and where we were strong.

1390
03:03:26,199 --> 03:03:28,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also have their current students.

1391
03:03:28,940 --> 03:03:35,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So we build a macro in order for them to see how their students that are in front of them are doing.

1392
03:03:35,783 --> 03:03:38,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can work on deficits with the children.

1393
03:03:38,604 --> 03:03:41,045
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an easy task, but I believe it's very important.

1394
03:03:41,085 --> 03:03:44,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single teacher has that there.

1395
03:03:44,666 --> 03:03:48,348
[SPEAKER_01]: At the elementary level, I personally go and meet with each grade level.

1396
03:03:48,744 --> 03:03:59,069
[SPEAKER_01]: and go through with them the different kids that are on the cusp, the areas where we saw strengths, the areas where we saw weaknesses, and how we can grow from there.

1397
03:04:00,369 --> 03:04:08,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly at the high school level, although we're switching, moving courses, we're doing a similar amount of work.

1398
03:04:08,093 --> 03:04:10,694
[SPEAKER_01]: The second theme would be professional development.

1399
03:04:10,874 --> 03:04:17,997
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at where, once we've dug very deep, we look at where we need additional support.

1400
03:04:19,118 --> 03:04:23,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the elementary level, we may say, you know what?

1401
03:04:23,459 --> 03:04:28,160
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to look more at what our online platform for journeys has.

1402
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:29,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done some PD on that.

1403
03:04:30,521 --> 03:04:34,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we might say we need more support on our response to intervention.

1404
03:04:34,342 --> 03:04:37,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've brought in professional development for that as well.

1405
03:04:39,003 --> 03:04:48,365
[SPEAKER_01]: At the middle school, we recently just had somebody come in and do power writing strategies for us because we saw that we needed a little bit more support for writing.

1406
03:04:49,224 --> 03:05:02,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We also dig very deep with the analysis, and we've had different PDs led by myself and also led by the lead teachers on looking, how do we really analyze this data and take the next steps?

1407
03:05:03,131 --> 03:05:16,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the high school, we've similarly had PD on writing, and we have one coming up this week on instructional strategies for poetry and student-led discussions, which is an MCAS, but again,

1408
03:05:17,074 --> 03:05:18,615
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not driven by that.

1409
03:05:18,715 --> 03:05:20,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a piece of what we do.

1410
03:05:22,398 --> 03:05:24,679
[SPEAKER_01]: We then also look at instructional shifts.

1411
03:05:25,100 --> 03:05:30,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may say, you know what, we need to do a little bit more analytical piece at the middle school.

1412
03:05:31,524 --> 03:05:33,105
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to move more to excerpts.

1413
03:05:33,926 --> 03:05:44,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Or certainly the high school is having some dramatic shifts as they move away from the long composition, and we looked at refining our writing sequences to support the students.

1414
03:05:45,061 --> 03:05:46,862
[SPEAKER_01]: and a variety of different pieces.

1415
03:05:47,842 --> 03:05:50,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we look at what materials we need.

1416
03:05:52,083 --> 03:06:13,249
[SPEAKER_01]: You may notice that at the elementary level, to support both our wind block and beyond, we have purchased learning A to Z for our first and second grade kiddos, allowing them to, those independent readers that want to do a little bit more can do that with that, and then the ones that are struggling, we can do a little bit

1417
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:15,821
[SPEAKER_01]: more practice with them.

1418
03:06:17,562 --> 03:06:20,824
[SPEAKER_01]: We also look at schedule changes, which is very important.

1419
03:06:20,965 --> 03:06:26,208
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done quite a lot of work on our WIN group, which is at the elementary level.

1420
03:06:26,348 --> 03:06:39,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I run, not only have we fully implemented WIN in grade one and two, we have also, I am also running the WIN advisory committee, where we are looking at what are we going to need to focus

1421
03:06:39,913 --> 03:06:40,393
[SPEAKER_01]: more on?

1422
03:06:40,513 --> 03:06:42,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need more on blending segmenting?

1423
03:06:42,495 --> 03:06:46,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Were our assessments on the blending, segmenting, decoding enough?

1424
03:06:46,938 --> 03:06:55,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been able to carve out time in the elementary schedule to support those kiddos more effectively and efficiently.

1425
03:06:56,324 --> 03:07:03,869
[SPEAKER_01]: At the middle school level, we've looked at what our reading specialists, what students they serve, and we've made some changes as well.

1426
03:07:04,050 --> 03:07:08,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't always have the reading specialists targeting intervention groups at grade 6.

1427
03:07:09,354 --> 03:07:10,334
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done that now.

1428
03:07:10,434 --> 03:07:12,975
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a deficit in our sixth graders this year.

1429
03:07:13,075 --> 03:07:15,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a deficit, but we've seen some extra needs for intervention.

1430
03:07:16,676 --> 03:07:27,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have made some steps working with Mr. Tucci and Mr. Downs to allow for that schedule shift so the sixth grade readers can have a little bit more support if they need that.

1431
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:35,122
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, at the high school level, I've worked with Mr. DeLeva quite a bit on how are we supporting the ELA

1432
03:07:36,327 --> 03:07:40,268
[SPEAKER_01]: literacy piece for those kids that need some additional support.

1433
03:07:40,669 --> 03:07:47,511
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an MCAS challenge class for our 10th graders at the high school who have shown that they need a little more support.

1434
03:07:49,872 --> 03:07:58,654
[SPEAKER_01]: We do practice to reduce test anxiety and to try to overcome some of those technological issues that we are seeing come up.

1435
03:07:59,715 --> 03:08:03,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have recently, with the support of central administration,

1436
03:08:04,755 --> 03:08:20,527
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented in ELA Enrichment Academy, which looks at the literacy needs of our kids in elementary grades 3, 4, and 5, middle school 6, 7, and 8, and really working to hone in on those students that need some additional support.

1437
03:08:22,269 --> 03:08:31,015
[SPEAKER_01]: The last piece, and again, I'm trying to summarize because I'm sure you're all very tired, is we do look at the technology piece as well.

1438
03:08:31,416 --> 03:08:32,777
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do we need...

1439
03:08:33,568 --> 03:08:37,090
[SPEAKER_01]: something as simple as a mouse for those kids to take that test.

1440
03:08:37,190 --> 03:08:40,092
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw problems on our drag-and-drop questions.

1441
03:08:40,472 --> 03:08:47,497
[SPEAKER_01]: When we went to the question to say, why are we struggling here, we found out it was a drag-and-drop question.

1442
03:08:47,977 --> 03:08:52,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the question, the kids, it was not a difficult question.

1443
03:08:52,620 --> 03:08:57,423
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have performed a little bit better on that.

1444
03:08:57,883 --> 03:09:01,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we look at providing some additional supports.

1445
03:09:01,542 --> 03:09:03,003
[SPEAKER_01]: in those areas as well.

1446
03:09:04,003 --> 03:09:04,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?

1447
03:09:08,846 --> 03:09:10,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, thank you.

1448
03:09:10,587 --> 03:09:14,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised at what the fourth graders are expected to do with the technology.

1449
03:09:15,290 --> 03:09:24,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the computer teacher at the elementary schools do any of those preps or practice, or is it only in the classroom?

1450
03:09:25,255 --> 03:09:27,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've worked with, I've worked with Ms.

1451
03:09:28,057 --> 03:09:28,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Layden to

1452
03:09:30,935 --> 03:09:36,799
[SPEAKER_01]: determine what piece of, like the keyboarding, for example, is a real struggle for the little guys, right?

1453
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:45,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And how, what is going on in their classroom to support the general classroom teacher.

1454
03:09:45,526 --> 03:09:46,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do do some of that.

1455
03:09:47,247 --> 03:09:57,455
[SPEAKER_01]: The practice tests that are available online, which I could send you all a link to, because it is quite different from taking that paper version, we do have the kids do, there's three sections to it, and so throughout the year,

1456
03:09:57,851 --> 03:10:05,758
[SPEAKER_01]: we have them spend one literacy block only, because we don't want to take too much of the time, but we feel it's important for them to see it.

1457
03:10:06,318 --> 03:10:11,763
[SPEAKER_01]: One literacy block, three times a year, to actually do the practice test, so they're seeing those areas.

1458
03:10:12,083 --> 03:10:14,305
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one, the teachers walk them through.

1459
03:10:14,846 --> 03:10:21,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you've had a chance to see it, but there are different tools, like a highlighting tool, and so the teacher can walk through some other

1460
03:10:22,202 --> 03:10:23,803
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces that may not be as obvious.

1461
03:10:24,183 --> 03:10:24,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.

1462
03:10:24,663 --> 03:10:29,226
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, you know, is something that we struggle with, particularly in the English standard conventions.

1463
03:10:29,686 --> 03:10:32,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is our convention score low?

1464
03:10:32,488 --> 03:10:37,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it because they just didn't put period, shift, you know, for the capital letter?

1465
03:10:37,751 --> 03:10:39,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it because they don't know how to use apostrophes?

1466
03:10:40,353 --> 03:10:47,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And working at the elementary and having a lot of really good conversations with those teachers, we're seeing some of it.

1467
03:10:48,088 --> 03:10:50,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all, but some of it is related to tech.

1468
03:10:50,090 --> 03:10:57,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've really taken an interest in trying to overcome those barriers as well, especially where this year our third graders will be doing it online, too.

1469
03:10:57,776 --> 03:11:01,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious to see how that will impact the overall scores as well.

1470
03:11:02,019 --> 03:11:05,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1471
03:11:05,222 --> 03:11:08,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm talking too much, so I can end, but you have a list.

1472
03:11:08,684 --> 03:11:09,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo has a question.

1473
03:11:09,325 --> 03:11:09,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo?

1474
03:11:10,986 --> 03:11:17,171
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I mean, there are several computers in my house, and we haven't had a mouse in my house in a very long time.

1475
03:11:17,743 --> 03:11:19,485
[SPEAKER_01]: A real mouse or a technological mouse?

1476
03:11:19,765 --> 03:11:20,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have real mice.

1477
03:11:22,367 --> 03:11:23,448
[SPEAKER_13]: The one attached to a computer.

1478
03:11:23,628 --> 03:11:24,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha, I know.

1479
03:11:25,450 --> 03:11:31,955
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, one of the things that's really interesting, you can go to YouTube and watch videos of people who've never used a mouse, try to use a mouse.

1480
03:11:32,096 --> 03:11:37,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like trying to drive, just no instruction.

1481
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:38,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1482
03:11:38,581 --> 03:11:45,127
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, I guess I'm just really concerned about

1483
03:11:46,192 --> 03:11:58,300
[SPEAKER_13]: third graders being expected to use this technology, but all the way up, if, I mean, my daughter gets her first computer and my son gets their first computer, they're not getting one with a mouse, they're getting one with a trackpad.

1484
03:11:58,440 --> 03:11:58,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1485
03:11:59,881 --> 03:12:06,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a completely different eye-hand coordination effort, and I guess I'm just complaining.

1486
03:12:07,166 --> 03:12:12,130
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what's funny, one Saturday morning I had, so I have a seven-year-old and a ten-year-old,

1487
03:12:13,107 --> 03:12:17,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the 10-year-old is used to the touchscreen Chromebooks, and so is the 7-year-old.

1488
03:12:17,711 --> 03:12:23,956
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's my patient one, and she's trying to touch that screen to make the drag and drop work for her.

1489
03:12:23,996 --> 03:12:24,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I had her do a practice.

1490
03:12:25,283 --> 03:12:26,284
[SPEAKER_01]: She couldn't do it.

1491
03:12:26,624 --> 03:12:28,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And she gave up.

1492
03:12:28,305 --> 03:12:29,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And she never gives up.

1493
03:12:29,565 --> 03:12:31,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, to me, was a little bit eye-opening.

1494
03:12:31,246 --> 03:12:35,669
[SPEAKER_01]: That trackpad for her as a second grader, almost third, was too much.

1495
03:12:36,089 --> 03:12:40,231
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have provided the mice for those that are a little bit more comfortable.

1496
03:12:40,331 --> 03:12:41,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to be a struggle.

1497
03:12:42,272 --> 03:12:45,954
[SPEAKER_01]: But that trackpad is very difficult for them, especially.

1498
03:12:45,974 --> 03:12:48,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to work with what we have.

1499
03:12:49,076 --> 03:12:54,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And think of things that may sound small, but when you're seeing your eight-year-old struggle with it, they're very real.

1500
03:12:55,845 --> 03:12:56,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you saying that.

1501
03:12:58,227 --> 03:12:59,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it.

1502
03:13:00,549 --> 03:13:00,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1503
03:13:03,170 --> 03:13:10,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1504
03:13:11,076 --> 03:13:15,398
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did do is we have typing.com.

1505
03:13:15,979 --> 03:13:17,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard of typing.com?

1506
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:19,761
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an online platform.

1507
03:13:20,001 --> 03:13:23,784
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the technology specialists, which I should have said to your question, Mrs. Stone,

1508
03:13:24,312 --> 03:13:29,293
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they have set up accounts for the kids, and they track it.

1509
03:13:29,933 --> 03:13:35,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the principals have done, like, are typing titans or are top five typers.

1510
03:13:35,514 --> 03:13:41,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's not going to make any child feel bad if they're not the top five typers, but just gives that extra incentive to work at home.

1511
03:13:41,495 --> 03:13:43,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many words they can type.

1512
03:13:43,456 --> 03:13:44,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the research, if you talk to Ms.

1513
03:13:44,976 --> 03:13:48,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Layden, will tell you that they shouldn't really be typing at this age.

1514
03:13:48,136 --> 03:13:48,917
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little fingers.

1515
03:13:49,297 --> 03:13:51,077
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's beyond our control.

1516
03:13:52,027 --> 03:13:57,951
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the English impact to our test, I do get concerned about stamina for the writing.

1517
03:13:58,492 --> 03:14:00,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do get concerned about the conventions.

1518
03:14:00,933 --> 03:14:03,935
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, it's just one piece of all of this as well.

1519
03:14:10,579 --> 03:14:13,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they're human graded for now.

1520
03:14:13,101 --> 03:14:15,983
[SPEAKER_01]: They are human graded for now, but a recent report

1521
03:14:16,511 --> 03:14:18,493
[SPEAKER_01]: had mentioned something about switching that.

1522
03:14:18,533 --> 03:14:21,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Dr. Vincent, you have more information on that.

1523
03:14:21,737 --> 03:14:26,302
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do recall that there's some talk of it, but it hasn't happened yet.

1524
03:14:26,342 --> 03:14:27,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still human graded for now.

1525
03:14:28,585 --> 03:14:34,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1526
03:14:34,131 --> 03:14:35,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use this rubric.

1527
03:14:36,730 --> 03:14:40,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So they follow the rubric, which all of our teachers utilize in the classroom.

1528
03:14:40,953 --> 03:14:44,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has the different idea developments with the different numbers.

1529
03:14:45,057 --> 03:14:53,163
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there's a variety of different pieces that you need to have to achieve a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and so on and so forth.

1530
03:14:54,184 --> 03:15:01,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, you can see that for standard English conventions, a variety of different criteria in order to determine the number.

1531
03:15:01,970 --> 03:15:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we have noticed, because we do dig very deep into this analysis,

1532
03:15:06,480 --> 03:15:14,183
[SPEAKER_01]: grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, is that we've seen the state providing acronyms now for certain scores.

1533
03:15:14,263 --> 03:15:27,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is, if I see an essay written, sometimes instead of a 1 or a 2, they've put the acronym, and this is new this year, not new, but it seems more prevalent this year, DC.

1534
03:15:28,590 --> 03:15:32,512
[SPEAKER_01]: direct copy or OT off topic.

1535
03:15:32,992 --> 03:15:37,434
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see an acronym OT, the child has received zero points.

1536
03:15:37,894 --> 03:15:45,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though according to this rubric, they have maybe developed their idea and given some detail, they're getting zero points for that.

1537
03:15:46,237 --> 03:15:51,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are taking into consideration some deviations from this rubric.

1538
03:15:52,060 --> 03:15:54,841
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, this is how they score.

1539
03:15:58,077 --> 03:15:59,658
[SPEAKER_01]: all the teachers are very aware of.

1540
03:15:59,738 --> 03:16:08,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked a lot about if you see a kiddo off topic, be prepared that when they get their MCAS score, they're not going to get a one or a two anymore.

1541
03:16:08,981 --> 03:16:09,721
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a change.

1542
03:16:10,102 --> 03:16:13,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're digging deep so that they can, you know, hone in on these things.

1543
03:16:13,563 --> 03:16:18,965
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make data-formed and strategic decisions as we, you know, meander, go through all this.

1544
03:16:19,995 --> 03:16:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1545
03:16:20,755 --> 03:16:21,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Domenico.

1546
03:16:22,076 --> 03:16:39,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank you all for presenting the MCAS data in this way and unpacking all of this data and bringing it down to our classrooms and our teachers so that way they're making informed choices of how they're presenting to our children.

1547
03:16:40,544 --> 03:16:49,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like a lot of information that doesn't go anywhere, but it actually is very important work and even though we're

1548
03:16:50,015 --> 03:16:50,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's late for us.

1549
03:16:51,256 --> 03:16:55,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the data you provide is very important for us moving forward.

1550
03:16:55,800 --> 03:17:10,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, subgroup information is something that I like to see, and I don't like to hear the cusps, because we didn't make those benchmarks, so I don't like announcing, well, if we did a little bit better, then we would have got 78%.

1551
03:17:12,274 --> 03:17:15,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not my favorite thing.

1552
03:17:16,543 --> 03:17:17,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you on that.

1553
03:17:17,664 --> 03:17:21,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's confusing to people.

1554
03:17:21,145 --> 03:17:23,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We almost got a 78, but you didn't.

1555
03:17:23,166 --> 03:17:23,626
[SPEAKER_06]: But we didn't.

1556
03:17:24,066 --> 03:17:24,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1557
03:17:24,506 --> 03:17:29,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like to put out exactly what we did so people remember the accurate numbers.

1558
03:17:30,029 --> 03:17:31,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a personal thing.

1559
03:17:31,429 --> 03:17:33,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if other members feel the same way.

1560
03:17:34,070 --> 03:17:38,752
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see through the pages, too, there's a lot more that we do, and you have it in front of you.

1561
03:17:38,892 --> 03:17:44,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's late, so I don't want to go step by step with you, but we are making some real changes as we look at data.

1562
03:17:45,477 --> 03:17:46,138
[SPEAKER_01]: and beyond.

1563
03:17:46,198 --> 03:18:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is just one piece of data we look at as we make informed decisions, we make scheduling changes, we make changes to the student's curriculum if we need to in the instructional to make sure that we are leaving, each child's leaving the grade with the strengths and having their needs attributed, needs taken care of.

1564
03:18:05,395 --> 03:18:08,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't read them all, because I know you're tired, but they are there in front of you.

1565
03:18:08,718 --> 03:18:10,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1566
03:18:10,319 --> 03:18:11,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1567
03:18:12,350 --> 03:18:15,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Ms.

1568
03:18:15,172 --> 03:18:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Villanueva?

1569
03:18:15,673 --> 03:18:15,973

[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1573
03:18:18,234 --> 03:18:18,935
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1574
03:18:20,116 --> 03:18:20,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1575
03:18:20,876 --> 03:18:22,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1576
03:18:22,718 --> 03:18:25,700
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, we have negotiations in legal matters.

1577
03:18:25,720 --> 03:18:26,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1578
03:18:26,481 --> 03:18:28,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to go into executive session.

1579
03:18:28,182 --> 03:18:28,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Now executive session.

1580
03:18:29,103 --> 03:18:30,023

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

[SPEAKER_07]: We will be entering executive session and we will open up executive session in the other room to adjourn the meeting.

1587
03:18:52,574 --> 03:18:53,475
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not be back here.
