64
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:11,845
[SPEAKER_15]: At a recent junior varsity game against Somerville, Brianna broke the glass ceiling as she scored a touchdown for the Mustangs.

65
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:15,292
[SPEAKER_15]: She is the first female to accomplish this feat.

66
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:19,703

67
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:21,908

00:49:29,364 --> 00:49:44,836

00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:53,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Another reminder, the Thanksgiving pep rally will be held prior to the game on Tuesday in the high school gym.

70
00:49:54,548 --> 00:50:02,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Special commemorative T-shirts, hats and sweatshirts will be available for purchase in the athletic office and the main office.

71
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:06,213
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an exciting venture for the Mustang community.

72
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:07,874
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's go Mustangs.

73
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:12,956
[SPEAKER_15]: This coming November 11th is Veterans Day.

74
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:33,505
[SPEAKER_15]: And on behalf of Jeremy Johns, Director of Veteran Services, and Dr. Nicole Chieser, Director of Humanities, I would like to thank the 15 veterans who came to the high school and visited 37 classrooms last Thursday to speak to our students.

75
00:50:34,918 --> 00:50:43,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Veterans Day honors all US veterans for their patriotism, love of country, and their willingness to serve for the common good.

76
00:50:44,926 --> 00:50:49,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I personally know this as one of my brothers made the military his career.

77
00:50:50,891 --> 00:51:00,536
[SPEAKER_15]: In addition, one of our own principals, Captain Michael Downs, also served honorably, and many of our teachers and staff have done the same.

78
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:07,019
[SPEAKER_15]: We must never forget our veterans and the sacrifices that they made to keep America free.

79
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

80
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:19,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to take this moment to congratulate a Mustang, Junior Thea Cruz, who currently is an Italian IV student.

82
00:51:33,662 --> 00:51:43,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Students were tasked with creating a literary form called erasure poetry, tied to Italian artist, Emilio Isgro.

83
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,450
[SPEAKER_15]: This type of poetry erases words

84
00:51:48,197 --> 00:51:51,319
[SPEAKER_15]: and reads the remaining words as a new poem.

85
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Both content and the visual aspect were taken into consideration by the judges.

86
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:02,997
[SPEAKER_15]: He was one of three winners in the high school category.

87
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:12,445
[SPEAKER_15]: She used Giacomo Pucci's famous aria, Che Gelida Manina, from opera La Boheme, as a foundation for her poem.

88
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:16,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Thea received a medal of merit and a scholarship of $150.

89
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:17,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, Thea.

90
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:41,754
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also like to remind everyone to please not forget, don't forget to check our district website for the first edition of the new Fine Arts in Performing Arts newsletter called Color in Courts.

[SPEAKER_15]: which reminds all Americans to remember the important contributions of indigenous peoples, honor their histories, and advocate for solutions to the struggles they still face today.

98
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,272
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to share a few facts about our Native Americans.

99
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:36,540
[SPEAKER_15]: They were not granted citizenship until 1924, after Congress enacted the Indian Citizenship Act.

100
00:53:38,206 --> 00:53:57,368
[SPEAKER_15]: The first American Indian Day was held in New York in 1916, and National Native American Heritage Month became official under former President George H. W. Bush, who proclaimed it for the month of November in 1990.

[SPEAKER_15]: He lived from 1580 to 1661.

105
00:54:32,137 --> 00:54:35,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, what is this you call property?

106
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:45,628
[SPEAKER_15]: It cannot be the earth, for the land is our mother, nourishing all of her children, beasts, birds, fish, and all men.

107
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:53,055
[SPEAKER_15]: The woods, the streams, everything on it belongs to everybody and is for the use of all.

108
00:54:54,468 --> 00:54:57,329
[SPEAKER_15]: How can one person say it only belongs to them.

109
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:04,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us all take the time to celebrate the important contributions of our nation's first peoples.

[SPEAKER_01]: Members of the committee.

00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:00,544
[SPEAKER_01]: As we discussed an executive session earlier this evening.

135
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:03,168
[SPEAKER_01]: The districts of 5.

136
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:11,558

137
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:35,808
[SPEAKER_01]: The we paid out the FY 22 retroactive payments in the most recent payroll disbursement, and I anticipate at this point that the FY 23 retroactive payments for those five bargaining units will be implemented not in the pay cycle that we're currently in meeting this week but in the following one which will be the week of Thanksgiving.

138
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,601
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we are with those.

139
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:50,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And with respect to our ongoing discussions with the Medford Teachers Association, as the committee and the community are aware, we did reach a tentative agreement with that unit on October 23rd.

140
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:55,112
[SPEAKER_01]: That agreement was announced here at the school committee on October 17th.

141
00:57:55,692 --> 00:58:04,098
[SPEAKER_01]: On October 24th, the MTA notified us that they had failed to receive sufficient number of votes in their membership to ratify that agreement.

142
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:20,431
[SPEAKER_01]: from the district's perspective, that agreement is still in place, and we're grateful to the MTA for the ongoing discussions that we've had, and I anticipate we'll be meeting with them in the near future, and it's certainly our hope that there'll be a second vote in the near future.

143
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:32,300
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a short update tonight, because those discussions are ongoing, and there's not a lot that's changed since we last met, but if you have questions, I'm more than happy to answer.

144
00:58:35,964 --> 00:58:37,025
[SPEAKER_01]: questions I'm more than happy.

[SPEAKER_16]: They applied for a grant with the US Department of Education and we were supportive of that and talked about how we would use that grant for the Medford Public Schools.

152
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:23,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And what this would allow us to do is provide basically a free half of a master's degree

153
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:33,329
[SPEAKER_16]: and applied linguistics for teachers and paraprofessionals who already possess like a bachelor's degree going into a master's program.

154
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:38,536
[SPEAKER_16]: And what this would allow us to do is increase our capacity for not only

155
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:59,913
[SPEAKER_16]: hiring teachers to work with English learners, but it would also give us the ability to have content teachers, not only be duly certified in their content in EL, but they would have all of the theory for second language acquisition as part of what they could bring to the classroom every day.

156
01:00:02,146 --> 01:00:07,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We will be starting this program and this is the first that it's been publicized in the district.

157
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:10,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll be working to recruit teachers.

158
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:13,320
[SPEAKER_16]: We have teachers and paraprofessionals.

159
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:17,926
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 15 slots available and the classes would begin in January.

160
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:19,549
[SPEAKER_16]: These teachers would

161
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:27,569
[SPEAKER_16]: for to get their five core classes completed as part of their master's program.

162
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:33,113
[SPEAKER_16]: And once they complete those five courses, they're eligible for ESL certification.

163
01:00:34,574 --> 01:00:37,055
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they can continue on in the program.

164
01:00:37,775 --> 01:00:41,378
[SPEAKER_16]: They can take advantage of Medford's tuition reimbursement.

165
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:43,319
[SPEAKER_16]: It wouldn't cover the entire remaining

166
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:48,657
[SPEAKER_16]: portion of the master's degree, but it would pay for a chunk of it as well.

167
01:00:49,238 --> 01:01:00,028
[SPEAKER_16]: This would be available to elementary, middle, and high school teachers looking to obtain this additional master's degree and certification.

168
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:09,237
[SPEAKER_16]: And then with that, there's coaching that's embedded in this for family and community outreach,

169
01:01:09,757 --> 01:01:16,402
[SPEAKER_16]: for providing professional development for other teachers in the buildings that they're currently working on.

170
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:22,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And they'll be doing that as a cohort throughout the process of their program.

171
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:25,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions on that part?

172
01:01:30,091 --> 01:01:37,275
[SPEAKER_16]: The second news, which I just added onto this is, as you know, we have a partnership with Lesley University for elementary

173
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:51,664
[SPEAKER_16]: elementary teachers or teacher seeking elementary certification, they go through a master's program to get their gen ed in grades one through six, they do a year long internship in the EL department.

174
01:01:53,456 --> 01:01:58,939
[SPEAKER_16]: in any elementary school, typically a newcomer's classroom, but sometimes that doesn't work.

175
01:01:58,999 --> 01:02:04,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And we do a balance of the gen ed classroom and EL pullout.

176
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:11,444
[SPEAKER_16]: And Leslie is extending this program into middle and high school for secondary.

177
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:18,828
[SPEAKER_16]: So teachers that are seeking to get their master's degree in math, the humanities,

178
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:26,815
[SPEAKER_16]: can also do an add-on EL license if they do this year-long internship at the secondary level.

179
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:35,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Medford's also working with them to establish that and get some candidates in the district for that program as well.

180
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:39,425
[SPEAKER_14]: No questions?

181
01:02:41,286 --> 01:02:41,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseaul?

182
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:46,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just like to thank you for the effort to find all this money.

183
01:02:47,106 --> 01:02:49,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Free money, from our perspective, is the best kind.

184
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:50,947
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

185
01:02:51,107 --> 01:02:55,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you have any sense yet on how many teachers will be interested?

186
01:02:55,989 --> 01:03:00,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that you will have to deal with too many people applying?

187
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:07,905
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, you know, and so that is an interesting question because there are other cohorts that will be, that will begin like in September.

188
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:16,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I'll stay in touch if we can't, you know, if they don't, if other districts aren't filling them, you know, to see if we can jump in on that as well.

189
01:03:16,954 --> 01:03:26,162
[SPEAKER_16]: So this happened because I was looking for interns to come do their student teaching in Medford.

190
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:29,471
[SPEAKER_16]: through meeting the director and going through that.

191
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:34,793
[SPEAKER_16]: And I brought her down to the McGlynn Middle School to show her the program and program design.

192
01:03:35,173 --> 01:03:40,494
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when she started talking about this opportunity that they were applying for.

193
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:48,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know what like years two, three and four looked like for them, but Medford would definitely be a part of that.

194
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:49,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, thank you.

195
01:03:50,313 --> 01:03:53,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a limit to the pre-half master's degree?

196
01:03:53,514 --> 01:04:03,997
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's 15 people, 15 teachers and paraprofessionals for this January cohort, but they will have other cohorts throughout the school year.

197
01:04:05,037 --> 01:04:05,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

198
01:04:07,338 --> 01:04:07,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

199
01:04:07,938 --> 01:04:11,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving right along.

200
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Number four, report on enrollment.

201
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:16,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of enrichment and innovation.

202
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a report was left in our desks.

203
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,702
[SPEAKER_18]: The report that I gave you prior to the meeting, I just wanted to make sure that you had the third page.

204
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:35,306
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't sure if that was as part of the submission earlier, but presently we have 1,982 students at our elementary level.

205
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:37,487
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are also showing 924 students at our middle school level.

206
01:04:45,587 --> 01:04:53,289
[SPEAKER_18]: and 1,256 students for a grand total of 4,162 students across the district.

207
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:58,290
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see the breakdowns throughout the entire district per classroom, per grade.

208
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:13,633
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can also see the breakdown of middle schools for each side at each school and at our vocational and med high school and career technical education with the third page breaking down each individual program

209
01:05:14,612 --> 01:05:24,158
[SPEAKER_18]: with their current enrollments in grades 10, 11, 12, as the exploratory programs are still for the freshmen.

210
01:05:24,698 --> 01:05:32,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Currently there are 268 students in CT exploratory out of a class of 342 students.

211
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:40,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Also just want to call your attention on the last page that we've had 286 students tested in the EL department.

212
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:48,823
[SPEAKER_18]: 117 of those are kindergarten students who have been tested.

213
01:05:49,764 --> 01:05:58,173
[SPEAKER_18]: And so right now we're looking at approximately 134 students out of that testing who received services and are now part of our EL program.

214
01:05:58,594 --> 01:06:00,536
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to provide that information to you.

215
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:12,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank him miles for helping for building this report and pulling the requisite information and for all the teachers and educators who are working as we've had.

216
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:15,107
[SPEAKER_18]: You know students returning to us this year.

217
01:06:20,251 --> 01:06:20,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And the result.

218
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:21,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

219
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:27,514
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just looking at last year's numbers, at least according to the DESE report, and we had 39, 37.

220
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:31,556
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a good increase.

221
01:06:31,856 --> 01:06:32,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that we had a drop.

222
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:35,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't gone back and looked further.

223
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:42,101
[SPEAKER_14]: So is there, I mean, I haven't looked through this report since it's just right here.

224
01:06:42,922 --> 01:06:47,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a particular area where we're seeing a lot of, I mean, that's what, nearly 200 students?

225
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:56,861
[SPEAKER_18]: We're seeing students returning to us from private schools, from charter schools.

226
01:06:57,822 --> 01:07:17,026
[SPEAKER_18]: As you can see, from the preliminary charter and other regional vocational charter and other public school numbers, we wanna try to recruit those students back to us even more so, but we are seeing those students return to us and we are seeing an influx of students from other nations.

227
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great, thank you.

228
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,952
[SPEAKER_11]: member Graham.

229
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:44,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us that I'm looking at the charter numbers for enrollment this year so 3.95 is our charter school enrollment and I think that amounts to 7 or 8 million dollars of tuition going out to those charter schools has that compared to your past the 3.95 do you know sorry could.

230
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:46,270
[SPEAKER_18]: critical part of your question.

231
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,093
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the 395 compare to years past?

232
01:07:49,674 --> 01:08:04,849
[SPEAKER_18]: That's staying, that's so that's staying about average with the exception if you'll notice in grades one, two, and three those numbers are higher than the later years and

233
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:18,135
[SPEAKER_18]: The inference is that during the pandemic, people may have chosen different options based on how other schools may have operated than traditional public schools.

234
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:22,356
[SPEAKER_18]: And so now it's our job to try to recruit those students back.

235
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

236
01:08:24,957 --> 01:08:25,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor.

237
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:27,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

238
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:29,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Just on that point, I believe we were at our charter cap.

239
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:34,120
[SPEAKER_14]: So being steady makes sense because we can't exceed the charter cap.

240
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:44,968
[SPEAKER_14]: although I thought the charter cap might be a few students over 395 actually, so that would be surprising and lovely if we were under the cap.

241
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:53,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, the smaller the number, the better for us, but that would explain why we have been steady.

242
01:08:53,732 --> 01:08:58,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't quickly find the charter numbers, because it's the DESE website.

243
01:08:58,554 --> 01:09:01,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Enough said on that, thank you.

244
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, member Stone.

245
01:09:08,463 --> 01:09:10,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.

246
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.

247
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:29,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then a fifth class was added to bring it down.

248
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,764
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.

249
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:37,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say that's the average class size?

250
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:47,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for a classroom.

251
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:53,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Deckman has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average, so thank you for that.

252
01:09:53,597 --> 01:09:55,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,

253
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:58,602
[SPEAKER_06]: community to see those numbers.

254
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:00,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.

255
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:35,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope, I can share it right now.

256
01:10:35,554 --> 01:10:44,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And is the new EL enrollment numbers, the 134, is that in addition to, or is that's finalized, correct?

257
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:50,505
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the current numbers that fluctuated this year.

258
01:10:52,406 --> 01:10:54,087
[SPEAKER_18]: That's for this year.

259
01:10:54,127 --> 01:10:54,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

260
01:10:55,028 --> 01:10:55,648
[SPEAKER_18]: New enrollments.

261
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:57,770
[SPEAKER_06]: New enrollments this year, okay.

262
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:06,598
[SPEAKER_18]: And while Mr. Teixeira will give a further report about this later in the year, I wanted to call attention to 286 students tested.

263
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,723
[SPEAKER_18]: That's about one to three hours per test based upon a family's home language survey.

264
01:11:13,223 --> 01:11:19,847
[SPEAKER_18]: So us receiving those students, greeting them into the district, entering them in.

265
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:26,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Some students may then never join the district because they may move to somewhere else in Massachusetts, the United States,

266
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:28,713
[SPEAKER_18]: may return back to their home country.

267
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, we will.

268
01:11:44,964 --> 01:11:46,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, one last thing.

269
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:47,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

270
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:53,849
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a new format of this report and I just want to say bravo because it's very nicely done.

271
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:54,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It's

272
01:11:55,788 --> 01:11:58,849
[SPEAKER_18]: All kudos need to go to Kim Miles, our data specialist on that.

273
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:01,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Please make sure she receives our thank you, because this is excellent.

274
01:12:01,709 --> 01:12:02,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

275
01:12:02,369 --> 01:12:02,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

276
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:03,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

277
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:07,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you could just leave it up for a little while, Dr. Boshini, if there's no more questions.

278
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:12,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll go on to number five, because I know we have public participation.

279
01:12:12,952 --> 01:12:13,392
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

280
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:13,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

281
01:12:13,932 --> 01:12:14,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

282
01:12:14,252 --> 01:12:16,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

01:12:54,321 --> 01:12:57,043
[SPEAKER_08]: So good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the School Committee.

288
01:12:58,044 --> 01:13:08,192
[SPEAKER_08]: The Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment, Bernadette Bercudelli, and myself are here to present on the MWCA Math report for the school year.

289
01:13:09,273 --> 01:13:21,002
[SPEAKER_08]: The Curriculum Directors, Dr. Nicole Piazza, Director of Communities, Brock Ossiri, Director of Science, and Isaac Kahn, Director of Math, are also here to answer questions at the end of the presentation.

290
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:23,264
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did want to just take this time to thank

291
01:13:24,056 --> 01:13:30,286
[SPEAKER_08]: The academic team for the amount of hours they put into this presentation, which has been many.

292
01:13:31,267 --> 01:13:35,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And at this time, it's my pleasure to pass it off to Dr. Riccadeli to start.

293
01:13:37,228 --> 01:13:40,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent and members of the Metro School Committee.

294
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:58,852
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so nice to see you here tonight and I'm very happy to share our thoughts and our findings and our observations on the most recent administration of the NWEA MAP test that occurred this past fall in September.

295
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:09,588
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that there have been several presentations, there were a few presentations last year, so you have some idea as to the big picture as to what the test is about.

296
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:19,834
[SPEAKER_21]: For the benefit of the people who did not hear those presentations, some of this will be a review, but I'll try not to spend too much time on that part of it.

297
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:26,258
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to add that Faiza Khan will be available on Zoom this evening.

298
01:14:27,018 --> 01:14:28,219
[SPEAKER_21]: She was not able to be here.

299
01:14:28,683 --> 01:14:34,727
[SPEAKER_21]: But as Suzanne Glusi said, Rocco, Rocco Sieri, and Nicole Giza are here to join us.

300
01:14:35,627 --> 01:14:41,651
[SPEAKER_21]: So with regard to the agenda, the agenda, we're gonna go over the test design.

301
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:43,893
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's, we may see a little bit of a review.

302
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:53,319
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna go over the timeline, the approximate testing of the timeline, excuse me, the approximate timing of the tests.

303
01:14:54,660 --> 01:15:04,407
[SPEAKER_21]: The test sessions, we're going to go over sample educator reports, we're going to go over the data utilization so how are we going to use this data moving forward.

304
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:08,391
[SPEAKER_21]: And what we're going to do in our continued work.

305
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:12,713
[SPEAKER_21]: here in the district, and then lastly, in your packet, you'll see an appendix.

306
01:15:13,173 --> 01:15:28,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Our intent is not to go over each one of those charts in the appendix, but rather to leave time at the end for you to ask questions if you have questions about that data, because it is voluminous, and I want you to know that's just a little piece of what is available to us.

307
01:15:29,222 --> 01:15:37,047
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think the challenge for us as a team, and we really did work as a team, was to decide what data to bring forward, because there was so much.

308
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:49,305
[SPEAKER_21]: We looked back at some of the questions that this body asked the last time there was a presentation, and we tried to frame our presentation around answering your questions.

309
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:52,527
[SPEAKER_21]: So we hope that we're able to do that this evening.

310
01:15:54,468 --> 01:15:56,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving on to, here we have the next slide.

311
01:15:57,569 --> 01:15:59,870
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, this is a computer adaptive test.

312
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:04,732
[SPEAKER_21]: It's created by the Northwest Evaluation Association.

313
01:16:05,052 --> 01:16:06,953
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what NWEA stands for.

314
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:11,347
[SPEAKER_21]: and in Medford, we take it three times a year.

315
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,448
[SPEAKER_21]: There are some districts that opt to take it two times a year, we opt three.

316
01:16:16,249 --> 01:16:22,932
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the most important data that is yielded from this test is the test that's provided to teachers in the classroom.

317
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:34,917
[SPEAKER_21]: It's important on the district level, because we can glean a lot, but I think on the classroom level, they really can see where their students are in relationship to the other students in the class,

318
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:45,235
[SPEAKER_21]: They can look at the data, they can look at the domains, and they can pick up the specific areas where there needs to be some adaptation to meet the needs of students.

319
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:47,810
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so what is MAP?

320
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,191
[SPEAKER_21]: I've kind of given you an overview of it.

321
01:16:50,271 --> 01:16:51,931
[SPEAKER_21]: We know it's an adaptive test.

322
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:55,172
[SPEAKER_21]: We know that it's a test that students take.

323
01:16:55,652 --> 01:16:57,292
[SPEAKER_21]: It gets progressively harder.

324
01:16:57,852 --> 01:17:05,013
[SPEAKER_21]: So the same students in a classroom are progressing on that test in a different way.

325
01:17:05,073 --> 01:17:11,674
[SPEAKER_21]: So if the student gets a question correct, it goes on to another question that is more difficult.

326
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:14,695
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what we mean by it is adaptive.

327
01:17:16,181 --> 01:17:30,061
[SPEAKER_21]: It measures students, what they know regardless of their, their age or their grade level, it measures growth over time, and it allows us to track those students in a good way to see where they are growing.

328
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:35,615
[SPEAKER_21]: It's based on a RIT score.

329
01:17:36,155 --> 01:17:40,136
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know that last year when the results were presented to you, the RIT score came up.

330
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:47,458
[SPEAKER_21]: The RIT score is a, it's a stable scale score, excuse me, it's a stable score.

331
01:17:48,818 --> 01:17:56,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Like feet and inches, marking height on the growth chart, it shows how tall at different points in time a student is.

332
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:00,221
[SPEAKER_21]: The higher the RIT score, the more achievement the student has attained.

333
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:23,397
[SPEAKER_21]: I think what's important, and if you were able to take a look at the charts in your appendix, you will notice that our RIT scores, when we look at them compared to the national norm, our scores are actually at the norm or higher with the exception of one or two areas we did see grade seven math where it was slightly below.

334
01:18:23,897 --> 01:18:30,502
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a nice thing to see that we are, again, at the norm or above.

335
01:18:35,328 --> 01:18:41,353
[SPEAKER_21]: So going back to the previous slide, there is a picture of a normal curve.

336
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:46,557
[SPEAKER_21]: And for those people who have studied statistics, it might look somewhat familiar.

337
01:18:46,577 --> 01:18:50,300
[SPEAKER_21]: And if it doesn't, it's okay because it's a really simple idea.

338
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:55,544
[SPEAKER_21]: So in a normal curve, that midpoint line is your mean, median, and mode.

339
01:18:56,611 --> 01:19:06,221
[SPEAKER_21]: And for the MAP test itself, the results are often reported out in terms of an SD or standard deviation.

340
01:19:09,004 --> 01:19:19,234
[SPEAKER_21]: So the dark blue color that you can see on this chart represents one standard deviation away from that mean.

341
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:30,399
[SPEAKER_21]: So when you look at your charts and the SD or the standard deviation says 12, that means there are 12 points.

342
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,360
[SPEAKER_21]: So let me back up.

343
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:46,124
[SPEAKER_21]: 12 points from the mean in a positive direction moving forward and 12 points in a reverse direction would encompass 68% of the students.

344
01:19:46,484 --> 01:19:48,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me try to make that a little bit more clear.

345
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:54,963
[SPEAKER_21]: And I only do this because the SD is recorded on each one of these charts.

346
01:19:55,324 --> 01:20:03,094
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's imagine on the chart that that middle line was a 75, that the average score of a student was a 75.

347
01:20:05,438 --> 01:20:07,260
[SPEAKER_21]: And the standard deviation was a 10.

348
01:20:09,068 --> 01:20:16,114
[SPEAKER_21]: So 10 points above 75 is 85, 10 points below 75 is 65.

349
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:28,784
[SPEAKER_21]: So what that would mean is that 68%, which is a standard in statistics, 68% of the scores fall within that standard deviation.

350
01:20:29,684 --> 01:20:32,347
[SPEAKER_21]: As we go out on the arms of that normal curve,

351
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:36,972
[SPEAKER_21]: you go to a second standard deviation, it goes a little further.

352
01:20:37,052 --> 01:20:48,035
[SPEAKER_21]: So you would go up another 10 points up to 95, you would go down 10 points to 55, and that would account for 98% of your scores.

353
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:50,035
[SPEAKER_21]: So why is this important?

354
01:20:50,455 --> 01:20:57,357
[SPEAKER_21]: It really is just important because the standard deviation tells us how spread out the scores are.

355
01:20:57,877 --> 01:21:00,858
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have a short or a small standard deviation,

356
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:07,231
[SPEAKER_21]: It means that the scores within a classroom are very compact, they're very close to each other.

357
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:12,933
[SPEAKER_21]: When the standard deviation is wide, that means there's a lot of variation in the classroom scores.

358
01:21:13,713 --> 01:21:15,254
[SPEAKER_21]: So what would this mean to a teacher?

359
01:21:15,294 --> 01:21:17,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the teacher would see his or her 25, 20 students.

360
01:21:20,123 --> 01:21:22,605
[SPEAKER_21]: and could see that the scores are spread out.

361
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,787
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think, you know, for us, we're analyzing these.

362
01:21:26,387 --> 01:21:35,333
[SPEAKER_21]: It is interesting and useful just to see how much a teacher needs to differentiate if that standard deviation is broad.

363
01:21:38,335 --> 01:21:40,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving on to the next timeline.

364
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:48,237
[SPEAKER_21]: We have identified the times this year when we are testing students.

365
01:21:48,978 --> 01:21:53,000
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have a calendar for elementary, we have a calendar for secondary.

366
01:21:53,020 --> 01:22:04,126
[SPEAKER_21]: So you will see that the first testing window occurred in September, the second testing window occurs in January, and the third testing window occurs between April and May.

367
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:13,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving on to the next slide, this is a question that we wanted to answer because it came up.

368
01:22:13,879 --> 01:22:17,424
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a question about this last year.

369
01:22:17,444 --> 01:22:21,690
[SPEAKER_21]: So we wanted to take a look at how long it takes students to complete this task.

370
01:22:23,871 --> 01:22:26,372
[SPEAKER_21]: So we were able to get these numbers.

371
01:22:26,712 --> 01:22:28,572
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll first explain the number to the left.

372
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:41,636
[SPEAKER_21]: So in the chart that you're looking at under math, 31 represents the minutes that a student in kindergarten, on average, according to NWEA map, that organization

373
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,291
[SPEAKER_21]: spends on the test, so 31 minutes.

374
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:56,315
[SPEAKER_21]: The number in parentheses is the number that we calculated based on a cross-section of K students taking the test in the district this fall.

375
01:22:56,715 --> 01:22:58,176
[SPEAKER_21]: So it took them 18 minutes.

376
01:22:58,816 --> 01:23:04,478
[SPEAKER_21]: So they actually calculate the time that the student is logged in and is taking the test.

377
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:10,020
[SPEAKER_21]: So we took that and we looked at a cross-section of that, and we came up with 18 minutes.

378
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:22,514
[SPEAKER_21]: So for each one of these numbers, you can see the number not in the parentheses is the number that is the average based on what NWEA puts out.

379
01:23:22,854 --> 01:23:31,460
[SPEAKER_21]: The number in parentheses is the number based on our look at the login time for students.

380
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:39,046
[SPEAKER_21]: The login time does not include the time that a student gets onto the device

381
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:41,570
[SPEAKER_21]: It's only the time that they're locked on.

382
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:43,492
[SPEAKER_21]: But we wanted to provide that to you.

383
01:23:43,512 --> 01:23:52,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, I think it's also important to note that this is the average time, right, in the cross-section, across the district.

384
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:59,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are students that are taking this class maybe 18 minutes and in more.

385
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:01,526
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the average.

386
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:17,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.

387
01:24:18,176 --> 01:24:19,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't cut them off.

388
01:24:19,457 --> 01:24:21,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It lets them go for as long as they need to.

389
01:24:22,461 --> 01:24:32,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Test because it's adaptive, it will keep them going until they get to the level where they know that just right level of where the student achievement and growth is at.

390
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:40,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So that if the students keep answering one correctly and then answering one wrong, answering one correctly might take a little bit longer.

391
01:24:41,495 --> 01:24:48,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, it may, I mean, it also may be that this is representative of more than one sitting.

392
01:24:49,608 --> 01:24:53,991
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an accumulation of how long it took me to take the test.

393
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:55,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

394
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:59,775
[SPEAKER_21]: So with regard to range, I found this to be very interesting.

395
01:24:59,815 --> 01:25:03,837
[SPEAKER_21]: So what you're seeing up there in parentheses is the average, as Mr. Lucy said.

396
01:25:04,858 --> 01:25:08,923
[SPEAKER_21]: But I noticed that the range was vast.

397
01:25:09,164 --> 01:25:17,554
[SPEAKER_21]: So for example, grade five reading in one classroom, there was a range of 26 minutes to 177 minutes.

398
01:25:20,718 --> 01:25:22,440
[SPEAKER_21]: So a great range.

399
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:25,622
[SPEAKER_21]: In another classroom, this was the science test.

400
01:25:25,963 --> 01:25:29,406
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a range of 22 minutes to 111 minutes.

401
01:25:29,746 --> 01:25:34,550
[SPEAKER_21]: So you are seeing the mean, the average, but the range is vast.

402
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:35,671
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

403
01:25:36,051 --> 01:25:36,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor?

404
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:38,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

405
01:25:38,874 --> 01:25:39,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau.

406
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Since you're bringing up the reading, you know, and in

407
01:25:44,505 --> 01:26:06,894
[SPEAKER_14]: The samples that we have here, I'm looking at them and I'm wondering, considering the state of reading in the United States, it doesn't surprise me that a student took two hours or more to do this if they are frankly a typical second grade reader or third grade reader, frankly.

408
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:15,461
[SPEAKER_14]: So does this test understand that a vast number of students aren't able to really read at grade level?

409
01:26:15,781 --> 01:26:18,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is there an expectation that the students can?

410
01:26:20,124 --> 01:26:23,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just really confused by scoring.

411
01:26:23,707 --> 01:26:24,868
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about what they know.

412
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,149
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a reading test.

413
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:27,329
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about what they know.

414
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:32,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, how do you answer what you know if the student has to read something for which they're not capable of reading?

415
01:26:33,514 --> 01:26:37,056
[SPEAKER_14]: They're gonna get the answer wrong if they ever get through the question.

416
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:42,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just confused how this can understand that.

417
01:26:43,718 --> 01:26:48,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, hopefully I understood everything.

418
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:57,341
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think going back to the standard deviation, we have a large standard deviation, it is confirming what we can see with these large variations.

419
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:04,463
[SPEAKER_21]: The point being that a teacher needs to differentiate to the degree to which many of them

420
01:27:06,035 --> 01:27:09,476
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, no, and then the map test confirms that.

421
01:27:11,316 --> 01:27:12,636
[SPEAKER_21]: So there is a wide variation.

422
01:27:12,956 --> 01:27:19,197
[SPEAKER_21]: So with those swings that I just said, that wide range, that is not, that wasn't typical.

423
01:27:19,297 --> 01:27:22,538
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm giving you an outlier just to show you what it was.

424
01:27:22,558 --> 01:27:34,040
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the averages capture that, and, you know, I guess we could figure out what CSD, the standard deviation was for that, but not that anyone really,

425
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:43,838
[SPEAKER_21]: wants to know that, but the bottom line is, yes, there is a wide variation and teachers need to differentiate, which is not easy.

426
01:27:44,398 --> 01:27:50,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get a little bit further in the report when we talk about some of the teacher reports.

427
01:27:51,024 --> 01:28:01,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll address the question that you're asking, but I also need to... Dr. Riccobelli mentioned it, but I think it's very crucial that

428
01:28:03,783 --> 01:28:10,709
[SPEAKER_08]: point of data at the teacher and school level.

429
01:28:14,752 --> 01:28:22,998
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole point of this is the progress monitoring.

430
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:32,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all of those, like, nuanced pieces and the students that took a very long time, there's a story there.

431
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:43,057
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what's standing here at the podium, but that's part of what the principals, the school leaders, the curriculum directors uncover so that they can build the students.

432
01:28:45,899 --> 01:28:53,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one, forgive me if I've already said this, but the reports that the teachers have are student specific.

433
01:28:54,165 --> 01:28:54,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

434
01:28:54,626 --> 01:28:55,286
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's right.

435
01:28:58,707 --> 01:28:58,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

436
01:28:58,887 --> 01:29:01,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Galussi is going to go over some of the reports.

437
01:29:01,529 --> 01:29:03,290
[SPEAKER_21]: And there are many, many reports.

438
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:06,192
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, I'm just going to move because I know- Can I ask one question?

439
01:29:06,212 --> 01:29:06,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

440
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:08,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, ma'am.

441
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:09,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

442
01:29:10,335 --> 01:29:17,740
[SPEAKER_06]: For the testing times, I think, and I appreciate a lot of this information was what was asked in the resolution back in the spring.

443
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for putting this all together.

444
01:29:20,602 --> 01:29:27,226
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?

445
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:28,531
[SPEAKER_06]: from the classroom.

446
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:49,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.

447
01:29:50,379 --> 01:29:54,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data

448
01:29:55,205 --> 01:30:04,913
[SPEAKER_06]: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.

449
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:17,024
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I would say is, you know, having been in the classroom myself, it's a, it's a, an ongoing problem is getting the students to finish any test at the same time.

450
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:18,485
[SPEAKER_21]: It just doesn't, it doesn't happen.

451
01:30:19,106 --> 01:30:22,609
[SPEAKER_21]: So creating those learning opportunities that

452
01:30:23,798 --> 01:30:28,700
[SPEAKER_21]: a student can do while the other students are finishing.

453
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,200
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's easier said than done.

454
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,621
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not easy to do.

455
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:35,962
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think as you get to know your students, you're better able to do that.

456
01:30:36,422 --> 01:30:38,983
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is what the job of the teacher is not easy.

457
01:30:39,363 --> 01:30:44,465
[SPEAKER_21]: And it is creating those late learning opportunities when they present themselves like this.

458
01:30:44,765 --> 01:30:47,926
[SPEAKER_21]: So when the students finish, the students do not have free time.

459
01:30:48,927 --> 01:30:52,568
[SPEAKER_21]: The teachers are giving them assignments to work on.

460
01:30:55,657 --> 01:30:56,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you can.

461
01:30:56,459 --> 01:30:57,822
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, I think it looks different.

462
01:30:58,183 --> 01:30:58,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

463
01:30:58,363 --> 01:31:01,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Galussi, do you mind if you use the microphone so everybody can hear?

464
01:31:01,751 --> 01:31:02,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, thanks.

465
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:02,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at all.

466
01:31:03,074 --> 01:31:05,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say it looks different in every classroom and at every grade level.

467
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:12,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you want specifics around what that looks like, then that's something that we can look into.

468
01:31:12,372 --> 01:31:16,456
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would say that there's a variety of ways that this looks.

469
01:31:16,796 --> 01:31:22,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if I'm just looking at the elementary level and it's literacy block, there's a reason why there's two literacy blocks.

470
01:31:23,081 --> 01:31:25,783
[SPEAKER_08]: One is for tier one and one is for the wind block.

471
01:31:26,004 --> 01:31:33,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And during that wind block is a great time to catch students up and have students finish an assessment while the others are working on

472
01:31:34,747 --> 01:31:36,369
[SPEAKER_08]: individual work or with the teacher.

473
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:44,016
[SPEAKER_08]: There's numerous ways that it's not stopping learning and that everyone is getting what they need.

474
01:31:44,557 --> 01:31:49,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to reiterate again the importance of this test is for the progress monitoring piece.

475
01:31:50,383 --> 01:31:55,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Teachers need the documentation in terms of making sure that students are getting

476
01:31:56,334 --> 01:31:56,894
[SPEAKER_08]: what they need.

477
01:31:56,954 --> 01:32:00,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll show a little bit of the reports that help them do that.

478
01:32:01,295 --> 01:32:07,957
[SPEAKER_08]: But having data informed discussions to adjust practice is needed.

479
01:32:09,138 --> 01:32:09,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

480
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:17,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,

481
01:32:19,143 --> 01:32:20,123
[SPEAKER_06]: practice and tasks.

482
01:32:20,423 --> 01:32:30,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.

483
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:32,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

484
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you about the data.

485
01:32:34,681 --> 01:32:35,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know that.

486
01:32:35,941 --> 01:32:38,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a reminder for the people like watching or people that are here.

487
01:32:39,182 --> 01:32:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for kindergarten, first grade and second grade, it's a mandate.

488
01:32:42,463 --> 01:32:47,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Department of Education, we have to have a screener as part of the dyslexia guidelines.

489
01:32:48,005 --> 01:32:52,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that does that for us.

490
01:32:52,146 --> 01:32:54,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to, we have to have some right.

491
01:32:56,648 --> 01:32:56,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

492
01:33:01,164 --> 01:33:02,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add one thing as well.

493
01:33:02,885 --> 01:33:03,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

494
01:33:03,645 --> 01:33:09,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we think about assessments, we're also to your point, um, we're also thinking about what are we taking away in terms of assessments?

495
01:33:09,946 --> 01:33:12,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what does this replace?

496
01:33:12,547 --> 01:33:23,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that we all have universal assessments, but we're not, you know, you're are removing some things as well, because we do, we are really sensitive to, to your point with instruction.

497
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:26,330
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that is something that we've looked at school to school.

498
01:33:26,906 --> 01:33:27,907
[SPEAKER_00]: grade to grade as well.

499
01:33:28,007 --> 01:33:41,656
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so moving on to the middle and the high school grades, you will notice that there are just the NWEA forms that are listed.

500
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:52,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be honest with you, it was a painstaking process to go through and calculate the minutes because they had to be done individually, and it took many, many hours to do that.

501
01:33:52,422 --> 01:33:59,146
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will eventually get to the upper grades, and that might be something that you get a little bit later.

502
01:34:00,928 --> 01:34:09,994
[SPEAKER_21]: The second reporting of results, but doing a quick scan, I didn't see the wide variation that I saw in the elementary level.

503
01:34:11,317 --> 01:34:16,320
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, 59 minutes, 61 minutes, 53 minutes, and so on.

504
01:34:16,681 --> 01:34:17,741
[SPEAKER_21]: The science are lower.

505
01:34:18,522 --> 01:34:22,624
[SPEAKER_21]: On the secondary level, the classes are 56 minutes in length.

506
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:27,948
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's possible in some cases it went a little bit over that.

507
01:34:28,528 --> 01:34:31,490
[SPEAKER_21]: And on the middle school level, I believe the classes are 43.

508
01:34:31,991 --> 01:34:33,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.

509
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:35,357
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wrong on that.

510
01:34:35,898 --> 01:34:43,412
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, they may have to lose two minutes to part of some classes to that.

511
01:34:48,328 --> 01:34:53,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the next section is about the educator reports.

512
01:34:54,572 --> 01:34:59,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So this opening slide here just provides you with the percentile colors.

513
01:34:59,775 --> 01:35:06,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are seen in the reports that the teachers can access, but they're also seen in reports that go home to parents and caregivers.

514
01:35:07,099 --> 01:35:17,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So this just gives you the spectrum so that you can see blue reading from exceeding average achievement and growth

515
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:21,880
[SPEAKER_08]: to low achievement.

516
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:31,604
[SPEAKER_08]: The first report that we're going to talk about, I kind of scheduled these reports so that we're talking from large school-based down to student sector reports.

517
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:40,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a school-wide report that the principals and department heads have access to.

518
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:44,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So these show the achievement scores at each grade level.

519
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:47,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So here, you will see a representation of one of our middle

520
01:35:50,251 --> 01:35:58,156
[SPEAKER_08]: about this report, it gives just like a bird's-eye view of each of the levels across the grade.

521
01:35:58,597 --> 01:36:12,906
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also are highlighted so that if the teacher or the administrator puts on the color bar, it would bring up a snapshot of what you see below, which is the detailed list of student

522
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:22,438
[SPEAKER_08]: levels, their grit scores, and give just a little bit of a broad application to the scoring.

523
01:36:23,599 --> 01:36:26,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That does not really go into much detail, but just gives a broad overview.

524
01:36:28,104 --> 01:36:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: The next slide

525
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:32,391
[SPEAKER_08]: is a class breakdown.

526
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So this shows you, teachers can use this.

527
01:36:37,335 --> 01:36:38,296
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two ways.

528
01:36:38,436 --> 01:36:43,080
[SPEAKER_08]: They can use this by average grade score, but they can also look at the instructional area.

529
01:36:43,361 --> 01:36:48,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that a lot of our curriculum directors utilize this, a lot of classroom teachers utilize this.

530
01:36:49,165 --> 01:36:50,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you see the column on the left,

531
01:36:51,601 --> 01:37:11,230
[SPEAKER_08]: you can have all of the standards for learning domains populated and then it breaks your class down into RIT scores so that you can see where students are in terms of, this is the differentiation piece that Dr. Scrum's, yeah.

532
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the microphone, sorry.

533
01:37:12,691 --> 01:37:12,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

534
01:37:13,231 --> 01:37:14,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin can't hear you.

535
01:37:14,832 --> 01:37:15,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

536
01:37:15,352 --> 01:37:16,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means Zoom can't hear you.

537
01:37:16,673 --> 01:37:17,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

538
01:37:17,113 --> 01:37:17,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

539
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:19,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have remembered for some.

540
01:37:21,912 --> 01:37:30,121
[SPEAKER_08]: All I was saying, so member McLaughlin, the column on the left has the domain or the standard which was represented on the test.

541
01:37:30,401 --> 01:37:43,576
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of it shows the breakdown by RIT score so that teachers can see in terms of like differentiating based on that standard where the students fall in their level of understanding.

542
01:37:44,236 --> 01:38:02,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So it helps a little bit more as this is again where some of like the standard deviation piece comes in as well as the RIT score comes in so that when you are planning for lessons for where students are and what scaffolds and supports have to be in place this is just a report that will help teachers with their groupings completed.

543
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:07,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know if you have any questions as I go.

544
01:38:09,202 --> 01:38:10,002
[SPEAKER_08]: The next report

545
01:38:11,872 --> 01:38:15,174
[SPEAKER_08]: The next report can be classroom as well as individual student.

546
01:38:15,594 --> 01:38:16,915
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of my favorite reports.

547
01:38:18,035 --> 01:38:21,297
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the quadrant report for achievement and growth.

548
01:38:21,337 --> 01:38:23,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gives you both in one report.

549
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:30,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see that it's broken up into quadrants of, in the far left where it's orange, that's students.

550
01:38:30,642 --> 01:38:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So the little specks that you see on there, those represent students.

551
01:38:36,485 --> 01:38:40,767
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are two different icons, it can represent more than one test at a time.

552
01:38:41,127 --> 01:38:51,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the elementary level, if I want to see, if I'm teaching fifth grade and I want to see how my students did in all three tests, I'll check off the box to populate all three.

553
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:59,727
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be a different icon for each test and I can see where the students fell in relation to their achievement and their growth.

554
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:01,870
[SPEAKER_08]: If you

555
01:39:03,206 --> 01:39:12,074
[SPEAKER_08]: hit, everything's hyperlinked, if you hit one of those icons for the test, it also will bring you to a detailed report for each student.

556
01:39:13,035 --> 01:39:21,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And below this is also a class breakout of how the students, what their growth was, what their achievement level was, and their percentile.

557
01:39:22,363 --> 01:39:25,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a nice way to group students.

558
01:39:26,587 --> 01:39:28,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Growth is,

559
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,112
[SPEAKER_08]: and then achievement goes horizontally.

560
01:39:35,692 --> 01:39:52,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And so teachers can, if they want to, move the access to kind of, but right now it's set on 50% so you can see where the students, where the students are.

561
01:39:52,968 --> 01:39:56,051
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

562
01:39:58,612 --> 01:40:05,139
[SPEAKER_08]: This is another report that gives a classroom view as well as a detailed student view.

563
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:07,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is called the class report.

564
01:40:09,163 --> 01:40:13,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It breaks the classroom by that color coding scale that you saw.

565
01:40:14,028 --> 01:40:26,470
[SPEAKER_08]: so that each teacher can see the overall view of the class, while at the same time also getting individualized student data for each student in the class below.

566
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:43,193
[SPEAKER_08]: That student data, I know it's really small to see, but it has their RIT score, it has their percentile, it shows them how students were in relation to the national norms, it shows students in how they were in relation to the grade level

567
01:40:43,919 --> 01:40:45,880
[SPEAKER_08]: their peers within their own class.

568
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:53,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the teachers can really use this to get a gauge on how the students are doing.

569
01:40:54,003 --> 01:40:56,904
[SPEAKER_08]: This was an upper level example.

570
01:40:56,964 --> 01:41:04,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can also see the breakdown by domain and by test below where it talks about,

571
01:41:13,015 --> 01:41:15,817
[SPEAKER_08]: literature, informational text, vocabulary.

572
01:41:16,438 --> 01:41:22,043
[SPEAKER_08]: So it will give each subsection of the test, not the overall view of the English test.

573
01:41:24,145 --> 01:41:31,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next one is really narrowed down to students.

574
01:41:31,271 --> 01:41:33,293
[SPEAKER_08]: This is student growth summary.

575
01:41:34,154 --> 01:41:39,639
[SPEAKER_08]: So these reports, if you don't mind advancing to the next slide, these reports,

576
01:41:42,542 --> 01:41:47,164
[SPEAKER_08]: The information is important once students actually have data in there to show growth.

577
01:41:47,804 --> 01:41:55,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not going to see this for kindergarten students, we're not going to see this for students that are new to the district, but this projects their growth.

578
01:41:57,828 --> 01:42:03,089
[SPEAKER_08]: The orange little diamond is what math projects their growth to be.

579
01:42:03,689 --> 01:42:10,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the blue column is where they performed in relation to their projected growth.

580
01:42:11,311 --> 01:42:14,991
[SPEAKER_08]: This allows teachers to see how students are doing on a trajectory.

581
01:42:15,011 --> 01:42:24,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also provides information about where they land in terms of relation to their peers and more referenced nationally.

582
01:42:25,785 --> 01:42:29,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last report, which is one of my favorite reports from, this is the last one.

583
01:42:30,187 --> 01:42:33,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to say that we haven't even touched all the reports.

584
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:39,832
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost overwhelming for educators, but these are some of the ones that are the most applicable.

585
01:42:42,193 --> 01:42:43,814
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the student profile.

586
01:42:44,694 --> 01:42:49,757
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a snapshot of the students for every test that they've taken for math.

587
01:42:51,104 --> 01:42:53,526
[SPEAKER_08]: This shows you this particular one.

588
01:42:54,327 --> 01:42:59,471
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can see the top bar, see how they have mathematics, reading and science.

589
01:43:00,252 --> 01:43:06,517
[SPEAKER_08]: But this one I wanted to highlight because you can see how this student performed differently in each grade, in each test.

590
01:43:07,017 --> 01:43:14,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So for math, they were yellow, which is kind of like in the average range, but a little slightly approaching the average norm.

591
01:43:14,624 --> 01:43:19,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Where at blue for reading, this student is exceeding the norm.

592
01:43:20,091 --> 01:43:24,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And for science, the student is better than average, but not exceeding.

593
01:43:24,974 --> 01:43:42,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you click on those colored tabs at the top, it gives you a breakdown within that box and below based on domain and based on their growth for their achievement and their, their achievement growth, excuse me, their achievement and their growth.

594
01:43:43,686 --> 01:43:48,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see really quickly, I just wanna draw your eye to that middle column that says instructional areas.

595
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:56,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, because the math was the one that was highlighted, you can see the domains right there for the math test.

596
01:43:56,893 --> 01:44:00,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So for number and operations, this student struggled a little bit.

597
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:03,876
[SPEAKER_08]: A 75 is below the average RIT score.

598
01:44:04,816 --> 01:44:09,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can also see, because it tells you in the yellow up top what the range is for the RIT score.

599
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:17,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see that math has identified number and operations as an area of focus for the student.

600
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:27,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also see that below operations and algebraic thinking are a strength to the student above what the scaled RIT score should be.

601
01:44:28,302 --> 01:44:29,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is information.

602
01:44:29,823 --> 01:44:32,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if you clicked on that, it would bring you to the test.

603
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:34,468
[SPEAKER_08]: and to the questions.

604
01:44:34,588 --> 01:44:52,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And so teachers can really utilize this data to see that this student, on the mark for measurement and data, on the mark for geometry, above for operations and algebraic thinking, but something's going on with numbers and operations, and let's see what it is so that we can work to build in some supports for where the gaps are.

605
01:44:52,958 --> 01:44:54,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

606
01:44:54,799 --> 01:44:57,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have another 40-something slides, so we're gonna give you a break.

607
01:44:58,541 --> 01:44:59,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

608
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:01,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

609
01:45:01,888 --> 01:45:03,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to give you a little break here.

610
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:09,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules and take items eight and 10 out of order.

611
01:45:10,434 --> 01:45:17,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for suspension of the rules by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

612
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:18,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham?

613
01:45:19,019 --> 01:45:19,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

614
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Hays?

615
01:45:20,881 --> 01:45:21,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

616
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:21,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

617
01:45:22,241 --> 01:45:22,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

618
01:45:22,782 --> 01:45:23,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin?

619
01:45:24,183 --> 01:45:24,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

620
01:45:26,184 --> 01:45:26,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Mustone?

621
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:28,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau, yes.

622
01:45:28,686 --> 01:45:29,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

623
01:45:29,502 --> 01:45:31,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

624
01:45:31,383 --> 01:45:35,825
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna move on to number eight, and then we'll get back to the presentation.

625
01:45:36,726 --> 01:45:47,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Presentations of the public not to begin before 7 p.m., regular meetings of the school committee include this presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

626
01:45:47,411 --> 01:45:50,413
[SPEAKER_11]: A resident may only present once at a meeting.

627
01:45:50,513 --> 01:45:56,976
[SPEAKER_11]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

628
01:45:57,096 --> 01:45:57,977
[SPEAKER_11]: If one or more members

629
01:45:58,353 --> 01:46:05,158
[SPEAKER_11]: committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

630
01:46:05,799 --> 01:46:12,804
[SPEAKER_11]: The details for submitting the presentation can be found within the policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public.

631
01:46:13,565 --> 01:46:21,071
[SPEAKER_11]: So to the policy, any resident in the audience may give permission, be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

632
01:46:21,631 --> 01:46:23,933
[SPEAKER_11]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments

633
01:46:24,629 --> 01:46:31,113
[SPEAKER_11]: To the item on the agenda speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full met for the street dress where they reside.

634
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:46,003
[SPEAKER_11]: welcoming inclusive communities, both the value school committee and aspirational goal, we ask your help in achieving this goal and value perspective, please admit schools are exempt from this policy, the voice of our police welcome on all matters.

635
01:46:47,432 --> 01:46:55,984
[SPEAKER_11]: When a non-Metro resident employee is participating in public comment or submitting a presentation publicly with their home address and identify themselves as an employee of the Metropolitan Schools.

636
01:46:56,484 --> 01:46:56,805
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Ms.

637
01:46:56,825 --> 01:47:00,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Nicole Friendly, parent, presentation on student discipline.

638
01:47:01,051 --> 01:47:01,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

639
01:47:06,863 --> 01:47:13,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicole Branley, our address is on file, but needs to be omitted publicly due to our safety concerns.

640
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,271
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first time speaking at a meeting, and I want to thank you all for this time.

641
01:47:19,072 --> 01:47:26,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard from the mayor personally, and I appreciate your story and your time, each and every one of you.

642
01:47:26,917 --> 01:47:30,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo, you must have lost my email address because I have not heard from you.

643
01:47:32,472 --> 01:47:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband and I have been lifelong Medford residents and have always been proud to be raising our family here.

644
01:47:38,695 --> 01:47:42,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We both attended Method Public Schools and graduated Medford High School.

645
01:47:42,777 --> 01:47:46,598
[SPEAKER_02]: There was never a second guess in sending our children to public school here in Medford.

646
01:47:54,042 --> 01:48:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, my daughter encountered some very alarming and repetitive acts of harassment.

647
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:11,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullying and threats at the high school, which led to a vicious physical assault that sent her to the hospital on October 17th.

648
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:20,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here to speak specifically about her situation, but more of the broader scope of what my eyes have been open to.

649
01:48:22,236 --> 01:48:24,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety in our schools is imperative.

650
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:31,544
[SPEAKER_02]: News reports of mass shootings that have inflicted on our most vulnerable, our innocent children are everywhere.

651
01:48:33,237 --> 01:48:41,766
[SPEAKER_02]: But not until my own daughter's horror story began in June, did I ever really consider that the child sitting next to her would be such a one-on-one threat.

652
01:48:42,626 --> 01:48:45,770
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is exactly what happened when she was attacked two-on-one.

653
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people reached out to us when news got around what happened.

654
01:48:52,176 --> 01:48:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, many shared their own bullying stories with me.

655
01:48:56,874 --> 01:49:06,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry that they had to go through that, but I know that the apology does not have to come from me, but it should come from their bully, from their attacker, and from our school district.

656
01:49:18,709 --> 01:49:22,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard from countless Method public school victims of bullying in the last week.

657
01:49:23,252 --> 01:49:25,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Every story has been more horrifying than the next.

658
01:49:26,923 --> 01:49:28,564
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a new issue.

659
01:49:28,584 --> 01:49:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: As a mom, I know how these mothers feel.

660
01:49:35,628 --> 01:49:45,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Helpless, angry, heartbroken, and terrified to send their child back to school.

661
01:49:49,235 --> 01:49:52,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I worry too about the students who don't feel comfortable going to the administration.

662
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:58,032
[SPEAKER_02]: or even to their parents or guardians to say what is happening.

663
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:00,213
[SPEAKER_02]: What about them?

664
01:50:02,695 --> 01:50:08,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the ultra proactive mom in our situation and this violence still occurred.

665
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:12,180
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the breaking point here?

666
01:50:14,161 --> 01:50:17,043
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the long-term effects of this on our victims?

667
01:50:17,984 --> 01:50:18,404
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter.

668
01:50:21,846 --> 01:50:37,416
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, at one point during the last few weeks, I realized something even more horrifying, that our daughter will carry this story with her through her whole life.

669
01:50:43,481 --> 01:50:47,183
[SPEAKER_02]: One friend told me about her bully in a Method elementary school.

670
01:50:47,203 --> 01:50:49,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

671
01:50:51,567 --> 01:50:52,667
[SPEAKER_02]: back when she was 11.

672
01:50:55,689 --> 01:50:57,389
[SPEAKER_02]: She is now 53 years old.

673
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:06,453
[SPEAKER_02]: She asked me not to share her specific story publicly, but fear that her bully still lives in Medford.

674
01:51:12,856 --> 01:51:14,076
[SPEAKER_02]: 42 years have gone by for her.

675
01:51:14,096 --> 01:51:18,378
[SPEAKER_02]: 42, and she still is in fear.

676
01:51:21,249 --> 01:51:23,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Our school system let her down.

677
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:28,591
[SPEAKER_02]: They let our family down and countless others.

678
01:51:32,292 --> 01:51:43,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard so many stories this week that bullies or aggressors that are in a fight have actually returned to school from their punishments before the victim could heal from the injuries in return.

679
01:51:45,495 --> 01:51:48,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That is backwards and it needs to change.

680
01:51:58,715 --> 01:51:59,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

681
01:52:02,297 --> 01:52:06,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the stories I have heard have been under your administration.

682
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:13,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Or during the time of your elected positions, but our story is and so are countless others.

683
01:52:14,805 --> 01:52:16,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Although you cannot change the past.

684
01:52:18,568 --> 01:52:19,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You certainly need to step up now.

685
01:52:21,509 --> 01:52:25,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford can be the example of the school district that set the bar.

686
01:52:26,562 --> 01:52:30,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Our school should be on the news for positive stories, not ones of violence.

687
01:52:32,327 --> 01:52:37,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I am hoping moving forward, we could work together to actually make sure the policies we have in place are sufficient.

688
01:52:38,932 --> 01:52:40,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, that they are being implemented.

689
01:52:41,995 --> 01:52:46,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's long overdue that children see consequences for their bullying, harassing and fighting.

690
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if students know they will be held accountable and consequences are imminent, that they will think twice.

691
01:52:56,457 --> 01:53:06,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Even more importantly, that no one else has to be a victim of such a crime and that students who choose to use their fists and hateful words to solve problems actually see consequences.

692
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:14,504
[SPEAKER_02]: If zero tolerance is stated as part of our Mustang way, then follow through has to be too.

693
01:53:15,945 --> 01:53:19,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Actions speak louder than words and the students know it.

694
01:53:20,647 --> 01:53:23,168
[SPEAKER_02]: They know it's only lip service from you right now.

695
01:53:24,366 --> 01:53:30,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It is our job as the adults to set the standards for what we are willing to accept.

696
01:53:31,008 --> 01:53:35,709
[SPEAKER_02]: What is allowed in our school defines the morals of the city and our community.

697
01:53:46,692 --> 01:53:48,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a lot of reading in the last few weeks.

698
01:53:50,113 --> 01:53:53,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our own handbook, it says following policies,

699
01:53:54,133 --> 01:54:06,561
[SPEAKER_02]: are consistent with the mission statement to set expectations for students and to offer them considerable motivation and support as a way to help them become responsible citizens.

700
01:54:07,602 --> 01:54:08,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The time is now.

701
01:54:10,884 --> 01:54:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a vow in front of all of you.

702
01:54:13,145 --> 01:54:14,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I will help be a part of the change.

703
01:54:16,247 --> 01:54:17,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what you need.

704
01:54:17,408 --> 01:54:18,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what I can do.

705
01:54:18,909 --> 01:54:20,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me where I can sign up.

706
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:22,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need more funding?

707
01:54:23,299 --> 01:54:25,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me who I need to contact, because I will do it.

708
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need another assistant principal?

709
01:54:30,361 --> 01:54:34,882
[SPEAKER_02]: The relationships we have built with the school resource officer has been a great one.

710
01:54:36,122 --> 01:54:40,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we have maybe one more to help him try to cover multiple buildings?

711
01:54:47,604 --> 01:54:49,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Help him cover multiple buildings and over 1,200 students.

712
01:54:51,496 --> 01:54:56,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you type up a clear policy that every child actually has to read and sign every year?

713
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:57,819
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gotta be options.

714
01:54:58,339 --> 01:55:03,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we make clear that prom, sports, homecoming, that those are privileges and they could lose them.

715
01:55:04,661 --> 01:55:12,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Students need routine, they need encouragement, they need love, they need discipline, and they need a hard line.

716
01:55:12,604 --> 01:55:13,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So draw the line.

717
01:55:16,966 --> 01:55:18,827
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you specifically going to do?

718
01:55:20,683 --> 01:55:21,324
[SPEAKER_02]: starting now.

719
01:55:22,925 --> 01:55:26,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe our school committee members should start walking the halls of Medford High School.

720
01:55:37,137 --> 01:55:42,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can spend some time in the cafeteria at lunch or check in on a bathroom.

721
01:55:44,023 --> 01:55:48,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I wholeheartedly agree that every child has a right to a public education

722
01:55:50,444 --> 01:55:58,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We have exemplary teachers in our district implementing amazing curriculum while nurturing our students to be the best they can be.

723
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:16,398
[SPEAKER_02]: If no expulsions are set forth, then we need to be able to find solutions and education plans for aggressors in an alternative school setting, especially away from the victims to ensure safety for all the students.

724
01:56:26,317 --> 01:56:30,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Introducing violent bullies back into the corridors with their victim is assaulting them again.

725
01:56:31,567 --> 01:56:33,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Only this time, you will be the bully.

726
01:56:34,894 --> 01:56:35,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

727
01:56:56,049 --> 01:56:56,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Miss Branley.

728
01:56:57,229 --> 01:57:07,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we have an associated motion that I'll read under new business, which we move suspension of the rules for 2022-51 offered by Member Graham and Member Ruseau.

729
01:57:08,993 --> 01:57:18,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas the Medford School Committee unanimously approved the following resolution on 12-6-2021, whereas the school committee is committed to achieving the mission statement of the Medford Public Schools.

730
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:33,307
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford Public Schools is a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community designed to ensure that all students are afforded a safe and healthy learning environment in which they develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to reach their full academic and personal potential.

731
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:47,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas the effects of the pandemic have exasperated challenges in school climate and culture nationwide and here in Medford, therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools will issue an RFP to perform a climate and culture assessment of Medford High School

732
01:57:48,516 --> 01:57:50,697
[SPEAKER_11]: to be completed before the end of the academic year.

733
01:57:51,318 --> 01:57:59,182
[SPEAKER_11]: The RFP will seek a qualified and independent vendor to conduct a survey of staff, students, and families who are part of the high school community.

734
01:57:59,202 --> 01:58:15,392
[SPEAKER_11]: And be it resolved that the project scope will include recommendations to address moving forward in a manner that prioritizes a healthy school community and contends with the district's past handling of incidences that are race, gender, and bullying based.

735
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:26,623
[SPEAKER_11]: We had also resolved the recommendations will outline organizational, structural, professional development, and curriculum-based changes needed to address the findings and achieve our district-wide mission.

736
01:58:26,643 --> 01:58:44,129
[SPEAKER_11]: We had further resolved that the school committee authorizes an expenditure of up to 50,000 to complete this important initiative, and that the superintendent will return to the school committee to seek authorization for additional funds should the qualified bids received at the bid opening be in excess of this authorization.

737
01:58:45,034 --> 01:58:57,359
[SPEAKER_11]: and whereas the resolution was amended to include the middle schools in the scope of the assessment, now be it resolved, the administration provide a report of all actions to date to fill this resolution, including the reasons for any delay.

738
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:58,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

739
01:59:01,321 --> 01:59:01,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

740
01:59:03,202 --> 01:59:05,103
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I want to say thank you to Ms.

741
01:59:05,123 --> 01:59:06,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Branley for coming tonight.

742
01:59:08,652 --> 01:59:16,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to speak in front of a large room of people like this, and it's especially hard to deliver the remarks you just gave.

743
01:59:16,397 --> 01:59:32,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I am really terribly sorry that your family is going through this, and I hope that as we navigate beyond this, that you will find what you're looking for in terms of change in the district.

744
01:59:33,528 --> 01:59:37,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Having said that, regarding this motion, give me a second,

745
01:59:38,562 --> 01:59:39,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Marks just disappeared.

746
01:59:44,683 --> 01:59:49,245
[SPEAKER_05]: When we introduced this climate and culture assessment, it was unanimously approved last fall.

747
01:59:49,945 --> 01:59:53,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was at least in part a reaction to an incident last year.

748
01:59:53,105 --> 01:59:59,647
[SPEAKER_05]: The intent of the motion was not last year was not to narrowly or exclusively address the incident itself.

749
02:00:00,972 --> 02:00:04,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that safety and supervision are foundational in daily activities at any school.

750
02:00:05,256 --> 02:00:11,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It's reasonable to assume that any school has the resources, staff, and structures necessary to perform these basic school functions.

751
02:00:12,382 --> 02:00:21,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the system doesn't work at these basic functions, it's reasonable to hold the system and the adults accountable for the kind of failure that we see.

752
02:00:23,971 --> 02:00:27,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Separately, the point of the climate and culture assessment, for me at least,

753
02:00:28,092 --> 02:00:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: is to take a broader look at our school environment and identify what keeps us from the kind of school we want for our kids.

754
02:00:35,235 --> 02:00:41,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear from an expert in the field about how we create a culture that largely avoids these kinds of issues that we find ourselves in right now.

755
02:00:42,558 --> 02:00:57,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a system that avoids bullying, avoids contributing to the self-esteem issues we see in some kids, avoids process failures, avoids situations where kids can leave school unnoticed, and avoids the communication and PR situations we too often find ourselves in.

756
02:00:58,174 --> 02:01:01,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear from an expert about how to create that culture.

757
02:01:01,676 --> 02:01:10,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I expect the recommendations to be quite broad and to address everything from staffing to org structure, to curriculum, to personnel, to policy, and more.

758
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:15,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep circling around real solutions that do more than react to a crisis of some kind in this district.

759
02:01:16,363 --> 02:01:23,747
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, I think we need to hear from an objective party that doesn't care where you are from, who you know, or why it's always been done that way.

760
02:01:24,447 --> 02:01:26,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Our kids and our city in general deserve that.

761
02:01:26,795 --> 02:01:33,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I would expect discipline to be part of that assessment, but I'll say again that safety and supervision are foundational elements of any school.

762
02:01:34,944 --> 02:01:45,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the district will ever provide a truly satisfying answer for all the privacy reasons that are wildly unpopular and still truly the law, but

763
02:01:46,697 --> 02:01:58,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I do hope that what we can expect from our superintendent and from this committee is accountability, that we will take action and expect more of this district in the future.

764
02:01:59,501 --> 02:02:05,102
[SPEAKER_05]: It's long past due that we push past the culture and change the culture of this district.

765
02:02:05,642 --> 02:02:11,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been needed since long before my kids were a part of MPS, and one of them goes to high school next year, in fact.

766
02:02:11,524 --> 02:02:15,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Our kids deserve the best we have to offer, and we need to explore every option to do so.

767
02:02:17,107 --> 02:02:21,968
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of just one other note that I want to provide to Ms.

768
02:02:21,988 --> 02:02:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Franley, the rules and policy subcommittee has on its docket a review of our bullying policy.

769
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:32,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that meeting will be scheduled in the next coming weeks.

770
02:02:32,351 --> 02:02:34,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it is, we will be sure to reach out and let you know.

771
02:02:35,852 --> 02:02:41,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot that goes on from a policy perspective that then has to be executed by the administration.

772
02:02:42,294 --> 02:02:45,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And when that comes up, we'll make sure that you're aware so you can participate.

773
02:02:46,464 --> 02:03:05,301
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do hope my colleagues will join me in again supporting this motion that asks for a detailed update on why this climate and culture assessment hasn't moved forward and what we are going to do to not be here again in three months or six months or a year, having this same conversation and not having done the things that are at our disposal.

774
02:03:05,621 --> 02:03:05,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

775
02:03:08,203 --> 02:03:09,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, one second.

776
02:03:12,507 --> 02:03:13,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Graham.

777
02:03:13,227 --> 02:03:13,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

778
02:03:15,834 --> 02:03:16,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

779
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry I'm remote, but I wanted to say.

780
02:03:19,837 --> 02:03:21,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for folks who are coming forward to speak up.

781
02:03:21,978 --> 02:03:23,579
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a really important issue.

782
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,461
[SPEAKER_13]: This was, we actually had suspension and discipline on the agenda at the last meeting.

783
02:03:29,082 --> 02:03:38,246
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was deferred to have school committee members come back with some notifications about what they wanted to ask about suspension and discipline particular to reports.

784
02:03:38,906 --> 02:03:41,848
[SPEAKER_13]: So we had had that on the last agenda and that hadn't happened.

785
02:03:41,868 --> 02:03:44,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to mention that because that's important.

786
02:03:44,749 --> 02:03:47,651
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was one of the discussions that we had that we were gonna have

787
02:03:49,711 --> 02:03:50,171
[SPEAKER_13]: that.

788
02:03:50,191 --> 02:03:58,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Um and then, you know this incident happened, and everybody obviously.

789
02:03:59,193 --> 02:04:01,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Was in a tailspin dealing with all of that.

790
02:04:01,113 --> 02:04:08,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I also just wanted some clarification if I could on the on the section that says be it also resolved that the project scope.

791
02:04:08,975 --> 02:04:10,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Will include recommendations to address

792
02:04:16,296 --> 02:04:21,057
[SPEAKER_13]: past handling of incidents that are race, gender, or bullying biased.

793
02:04:21,117 --> 02:04:26,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Just specifically around that, I wanted to make an amendment that included disability.

794
02:04:26,978 --> 02:04:33,720
[SPEAKER_13]: So race, disability, gender, or bullying bias is the request I'm making for an amendment.

795
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:39,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Noted, thank you, Member McLaughlin.

796
02:04:39,861 --> 02:04:41,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, absolutely.

797
02:04:44,522 --> 02:04:51,467
[SPEAKER_11]: name and address for the record and I know we have a lot of people here and a couple hundred I think on zoom so if you could limit it to one or two minutes that'd be great Thank you.

798
02:05:01,554 --> 02:05:03,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The MIC is not on sorry man.

799
02:05:04,296 --> 02:05:08,919
[SPEAKER_11]: It is on can you not hear it is on okay i'll we never.

800
02:05:09,369 --> 02:05:14,093
[SPEAKER_20]: So you said you agreed upon the Climate and Culture RFP in December of 2021.

801
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:19,477
[SPEAKER_20]: If this most recent incident had not happened, would we have heard about it again?

802
02:05:19,518 --> 02:05:20,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you have done anything?

803
02:05:20,498 --> 02:05:25,683
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it sounds like you just pulled it out of a drawer because of this most recent incident.

804
02:05:25,863 --> 02:05:27,144
[SPEAKER_05]: That couldn't be further from the truth.

805
02:05:27,324 --> 02:05:30,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been following up on it since we asked for it.

806
02:05:31,127 --> 02:05:35,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think it's important for the entire community to be able to hear that same update.

807
02:05:36,657 --> 02:05:38,899
[SPEAKER_05]: that we committee members often get behind the scenes.

808
02:05:38,959 --> 02:05:43,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that the administration will have something to report to us tonight.

809
02:05:43,423 --> 02:05:44,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So it took 11 months.

810
02:05:45,645 --> 02:05:46,346
[SPEAKER_20]: It's November of 2022.

811
02:05:46,807 --> 02:05:49,149
[SPEAKER_20]: You agreed last year.

812
02:06:03,937 --> 02:06:09,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to go on with Jenny had just said, it really does come down to accountability.

813
02:06:17,463 --> 02:06:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: If the superintendent is accountable for our schools, then why has it not been done?

814
02:06:23,565 --> 02:06:24,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do your job.

815
02:06:28,968 --> 02:06:29,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor.

816
02:06:34,502 --> 02:06:42,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need the school committee to make her accountable for her job, because here are the voters and we're gonna make you accountable for your job.

817
02:06:44,827 --> 02:06:55,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, what will be the new deadline for this climate and culture report?

818
02:06:55,931 --> 02:06:56,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a new deadline?

819
02:06:56,732 --> 02:06:58,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a deadline originally?

820
02:06:59,493 --> 02:07:03,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if there was a deadline, but to draft an RFP

821
02:07:04,474 --> 02:07:06,900
[SPEAKER_11]: release it, have we released an RFP yet?

822
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it takes several months, but Dr. Cushing?

823
02:07:13,989 --> 02:07:19,271
[SPEAKER_18]: So last December, when this was issued, I reached out to numerous companies who do this work.

824
02:07:19,331 --> 02:07:25,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Those companies did not return phone calls and then come back to us despite numerous attempts on my part to reach out to them.

825
02:07:25,854 --> 02:07:34,877
[SPEAKER_18]: When we finally were able to have conversations with them in February and March, we were informed that, and this is multiple companies that we reached out to.

826
02:07:36,718 --> 02:07:43,840
[SPEAKER_18]: that this work was to not, that they did not have the teams available to do this work.

827
02:07:44,341 --> 02:08:04,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And that an issuing of an RFP this fall or, you know, September, October, November would be the best time to be able to get a team in to do the study, to look over the remainder of this academic year, and then to work with district leadership staff

828
02:08:05,618 --> 02:08:31,437
[SPEAKER_18]: school-based administrators throughout the summertime to make sure that you have full implementation, review of handbooks, review of policies, surveying of students, focus groups of students, focus groups of family community members, all of those types of people, that there was such an influx of demand on these companies, some at the state level,

829
02:08:32,097 --> 02:08:39,122
[SPEAKER_18]: The RFP has been modeled after three state issuances, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Nevada.

830
02:08:40,603 --> 02:08:52,632
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's the reason, primarily the delay, was the companies that would do this work have been booked and... But the RFP's ready and going to be released.

831
02:08:52,772 --> 02:08:54,253
[SPEAKER_18]: It's ready for review and to be released.

832
02:08:54,913 --> 02:08:55,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

833
02:08:56,034 --> 02:08:56,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

834
02:08:57,535 --> 02:08:58,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor McLaughlin?

835
02:08:59,073 --> 02:09:04,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I'm not sure if you can see my hand because it's on Facebook, sorry, or on Zoom, sorry.

836
02:09:05,929 --> 02:09:17,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to be clear that Dr. Edward Vincent is our superintendent, and we are all part of the team, and it's all of our children, and we are all mothers.

837
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:32,852
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we talk about our schools, the community is part of our schools, our teachers are part of our schools, the school committee is part of our schools, our superintendent, the central administration team, all of us are part of our schools, and we all

838
02:09:33,372 --> 02:09:35,594
[SPEAKER_13]: As Miss Branley was saying earlier, what can we do to help?

839
02:09:35,654 --> 02:09:38,896
[SPEAKER_13]: We all need to work together to be able to improve our schools.

840
02:09:39,537 --> 02:09:46,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And to, I think it's unfair, frankly, to put blame on one person for anything that happens within our schools.

841
02:09:46,462 --> 02:09:50,225
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a collective community environment for all of our schools.

842
02:09:50,245 --> 02:09:51,406
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened is tragic.

843
02:09:52,126 --> 02:09:57,110
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we're all heartsick over it and we all want to improve our school and we're all here for the children.

844
02:09:57,699 --> 02:10:00,600
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanna just make that point because we're a team.

845
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:16,747
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know Dr. Edward Vincent has been with our team for a few years now and it's not easy turning around a district after 25 to 27 years of somebody else being the lead in the district and a whole different administration.

846
02:10:16,847 --> 02:10:19,528
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just had to say that, thank you.

847
02:10:20,448 --> 02:10:21,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

848
02:10:21,689 --> 02:10:25,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a motion on the floor as amended by member McLaughlin.

849
02:10:27,053 --> 02:10:33,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one person's job to, if one person ran for a superintendent, it's their responsibility.

850
02:10:33,237 --> 02:10:34,277
[SPEAKER_07]: That's who we voted for.

851
02:10:34,557 --> 02:10:36,459
[SPEAKER_07]: That's who should put the change forth.

852
02:10:37,419 --> 02:10:40,701
[SPEAKER_07]: So if she ran for this position, she didn't run for the position.

853
02:10:41,522 --> 02:10:42,842
[SPEAKER_07]: She applied for the position.

854
02:10:42,863 --> 02:10:44,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, she applied.

855
02:10:44,544 --> 02:10:45,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a human resources manager.

856
02:10:45,904 --> 02:10:46,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand it.

857
02:10:46,545 --> 02:10:48,326
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you apply for this job, do your job.

858
02:10:55,737 --> 02:11:00,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Richard Orlando Winford way longtime full time resident.

859
02:11:02,764 --> 02:11:09,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how I would have responded if it was one of my children, my sincere appreciation for what you were able to do.

860
02:11:10,813 --> 02:11:16,999
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm equally angry at the response, another survey, another consultant.

861
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:36,419
[SPEAKER_12]: When I see in the papers that the word is that violence is not allowed in our school system, those words ring hollow.

862
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:54,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you have policy, true policy, to drive consistency, a structure to execute that policy, and consequences that are understood and carried out, those words continue to ring hollow.

863
02:12:02,771 --> 02:12:06,798
[SPEAKER_12]: The last point I will make, which was heard were previous.

864
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the parent.

865
02:12:09,643 --> 02:12:14,792
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about time, the victims concerns and rights are put first.

866
02:12:30,196 --> 02:12:33,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Attention needs to be provided for the perpetrators.

867
02:12:34,178 --> 02:12:54,566
[SPEAKER_12]: No question, but that becomes secondary Thank you As amended Did we get a second

868
02:12:56,445 --> 02:13:00,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Member Graham, and then you, I thought you seconded it as amended.

869
02:13:00,629 --> 02:13:01,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, with the amendment, yep.

870
02:13:05,012 --> 02:13:15,061
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion as amended to include disability in the sentence that includes race, gender, or bullying, it will now say race, gender, disability, or bullying.

871
02:13:16,022 --> 02:13:16,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham?

872
02:13:17,203 --> 02:13:17,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

873
02:13:18,524 --> 02:13:19,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Hays?

874
02:13:19,385 --> 02:13:19,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

875
02:13:20,266 --> 02:13:20,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Kreatz?

876
02:13:21,386 --> 02:13:21,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

877
02:13:22,267 --> 02:13:22,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin?

878
02:13:23,708 --> 02:13:23,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

879
02:13:25,234 --> 02:13:25,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Musko.

880
02:13:26,835 --> 02:13:27,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau.

881
02:13:27,476 --> 02:13:28,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mayor Longo.

882
02:13:28,637 --> 02:13:30,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

883
02:13:31,039 --> 02:13:31,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here.

885
02:13:33,801 --> 02:13:37,064
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to revert back to the MAP.

886
02:13:37,424 --> 02:13:39,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

887
02:13:39,406 --> 02:13:39,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

888
02:13:41,287 --> 02:13:41,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

889
02:13:41,888 --> 02:13:42,769
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

890
02:13:43,709 --> 02:13:43,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

891
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:44,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

892
02:13:46,672 --> 02:13:47,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Who seconded that?

893
02:13:47,473 --> 02:13:47,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

894
02:13:48,093 --> 02:13:49,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, Melanie.

895
02:13:50,055 --> 02:13:50,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

896
02:13:55,939 --> 02:13:56,879
[SPEAKER_19]: May I ask a question?

897
02:13:57,580 --> 02:13:59,520
[SPEAKER_19]: How come the people on Zoom weren't allowed to speak?

898
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:00,520
[SPEAKER_14]: They are.

899
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,061
[SPEAKER_11]: They are.

900
02:14:01,401 --> 02:14:02,121
[SPEAKER_11]: They raised their hands.

901
02:14:02,141 --> 02:14:05,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Is public speaking still open for that, or did you just close it out?

902
02:14:05,702 --> 02:14:06,142
[SPEAKER_19]: It's closed.

903
02:14:06,662 --> 02:14:09,163
[SPEAKER_19]: So the people on Zoom weren't allowed to speak on that matter?

904
02:14:09,203 --> 02:14:09,583
[SPEAKER_11]: They were.

905
02:14:09,603 --> 02:14:10,723
[SPEAKER_11]: We can see them raise their hands.

906
02:14:10,963 --> 02:14:11,704
[SPEAKER_11]: We always look at them.

907
02:14:11,744 --> 02:14:12,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so you're going to allow them to?

908
02:14:13,004 --> 02:14:13,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

909
02:14:13,144 --> 02:14:13,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

910
02:14:13,604 --> 02:14:14,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes.

911
02:14:14,384 --> 02:14:14,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

912
02:14:17,645 --> 02:14:18,226
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, Ms.

913
02:14:18,246 --> 02:14:20,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Galussi, do you want to come back up?

914
02:14:20,986 --> 02:14:21,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

915
02:14:21,606 --> 02:14:23,087
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go back to number five.

916
02:14:25,509 --> 02:14:43,124
[SPEAKER_11]: At the pace we're going, it's another hour, so maybe we can... Motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

917
02:14:43,945 --> 02:14:44,786
[SPEAKER_14]: We already did that.

918
02:14:45,707 --> 02:14:46,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

919
02:14:46,027 --> 02:14:46,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I already did that.

920
02:14:47,368 --> 02:14:48,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

921
02:14:48,169 --> 02:14:50,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't want to take... Okay.

922
02:15:00,148 --> 02:15:05,251
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the report on the NWAE map fall request 2022.

923
02:15:05,931 --> 02:15:06,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

924
02:15:06,111 --> 02:15:12,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Galussi, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Ms.

925
02:15:12,475 --> 02:15:16,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Faiza Khan, who's on Zoom, and Mr. Rocco Sieri.

926
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:54,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're on slide number, if we could get back to slide number 17, please.

927
02:16:04,308 --> 02:16:05,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

928
02:16:10,452 --> 02:16:10,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

929
02:16:13,994 --> 02:16:15,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

930
02:16:18,196 --> 02:16:19,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Take a minute.

931
02:16:19,617 --> 02:16:20,698
[SPEAKER_11]: We can wait till the door is shut.

932
02:16:21,638 --> 02:16:21,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor.

933
02:16:21,878 --> 02:16:24,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we're on slide seven.

934
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:24,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

935
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:32,184
[SPEAKER_14]: I just realized that in the announcements, the rules and policy subcommittee meeting is this Wednesday at 4pm.

936
02:16:32,204 --> 02:16:39,028
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be picking up the wellness policy related to recess, often called the recess policy.

937
02:16:39,048 --> 02:16:41,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to include that for anybody watching.

938
02:16:42,751 --> 02:16:45,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And the notice was posted today.

939
02:16:45,292 --> 02:16:46,533
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

940
02:16:53,139 --> 02:17:05,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, okay so moving forward with triangulation so when we when we look at this test in the context of assessing students we were not looking at it alone so.

941
02:17:07,071 --> 02:17:09,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Our yearly assessment is the MCAS as we know.

942
02:17:10,093 --> 02:17:15,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Our interim assessment that as you know, we are conducting three times a year is the MAP growth.

943
02:17:16,057 --> 02:17:21,640
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the daily, weekly, regular assessments are being done in the classroom.

944
02:17:22,201 --> 02:17:30,586
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're looking at student assessment in relationship to these three periodic testing of students.

945
02:17:31,067 --> 02:17:33,868
[SPEAKER_21]: So interestingly, NWEA MAP has,

946
02:17:35,731 --> 02:17:49,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Back in 2017, they conducted a study in which they linked the RIT cut scores to MCAS scores, and they determined that there was a very strong correlation.

947
02:17:50,882 --> 02:17:58,127
[SPEAKER_21]: The correlation was actually a 0.77 to a 0.86, which is a very strong correlation.

948
02:17:58,648 --> 02:18:04,151
[SPEAKER_21]: So this indicates that the strong relationship among the scores, which is an important validity evidence,

949
02:18:04,992 --> 02:18:10,099
[SPEAKER_21]: for the claim that map growth scores are a good predictor of performance on the MCAS assessments.

950
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:19,891
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are just hoping that those two assessments, along with, as we know, the teachers work in the classroom, will really shed some light on how our students are doing.

951
02:18:21,503 --> 02:18:38,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving forward, we provided on to the next slide we provided a just a snapshot of the professional development that the district has engaged in over the past couple of years, beginning in 2021, when we began investigating this program.

952
02:18:39,815 --> 02:18:42,117
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's when we did the early literacy screener.

953
02:18:43,198 --> 02:18:46,540
[SPEAKER_21]: So teachers K to two were trained in that year.

954
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:58,607
[SPEAKER_21]: And then last school year, there were numerous trainings that occurred to get teachers and administrators comfortable with this test to acclimate them to the different reports that are available.

955
02:18:59,768 --> 02:19:03,150
[SPEAKER_21]: So that data review and a data analysis could occur.

956
02:19:04,350 --> 02:19:05,071
[SPEAKER_21]: in a fruitful way.

957
02:19:05,531 --> 02:19:08,292
[SPEAKER_21]: And then moving on to this current year, the training continues.

958
02:19:08,732 --> 02:19:13,354
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see the different opportunities that we have.

959
02:19:13,474 --> 02:19:19,456
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, more opportunities for professional development are planned around MAP assessments.

960
02:19:20,256 --> 02:19:22,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

961
02:19:23,017 --> 02:19:23,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

962
02:19:25,698 --> 02:19:28,099
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something I may have asked in the past, so forgive me.

963
02:19:30,489 --> 02:19:40,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that we're not Cambridge, for instance, but there seems to be in some districts that each building has a really a data person.

964
02:19:41,114 --> 02:19:57,201
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I, I know we don't have that, but when I think about, and this is nothing to do with the caliber of teachers or anything like that, but a lot of teachers, my guess, unless they're the math teachers, statistics may not have been their strong suit.

965
02:19:57,881 --> 02:19:58,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it was.

966
02:20:00,717 --> 02:20:08,084
[SPEAKER_14]: In the absence of having a literally a warm body always there to help them understand the statistics.

967
02:20:08,985 --> 02:20:10,707
[SPEAKER_14]: How are we supporting them.

968
02:20:11,628 --> 02:20:16,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, are we able to support them is really the question.

969
02:20:20,037 --> 02:20:25,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there going to be an ask in some way maybe in the budget to figure out how to support that because when I'm listening to this stuff.

970
02:20:25,719 --> 02:20:27,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I was, I was a math guy.

971
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:34,422
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I have to admit I haven't done statistics for, I don't know, 20 something years.

972
02:20:37,924 --> 02:20:39,204
[SPEAKER_14]: If I got all these reports.

973
02:20:42,697 --> 02:20:48,764
[SPEAKER_14]: It would not fit into my day and would not fit into my planning period to figure it all out.

974
02:20:49,045 --> 02:20:54,111
[SPEAKER_14]: So how are we supporting the teachers that are not the math, I'm sure the math teachers are just fine.

975
02:20:55,208 --> 02:20:57,509
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe some of the science teachers, but what about everybody else?

976
02:20:57,870 --> 02:21:05,214
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that there's a lot of math behind these reports, but I don't think it takes a statistician to be able to utilize the reports.

977
02:21:05,954 --> 02:21:13,699
[SPEAKER_21]: So I did go over a little bit of the math part, and I have to admit in college, although I wasn't a math major, I really did enjoy the statistics.

978
02:21:14,219 --> 02:21:17,461
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think even the person who is not

979
02:21:18,596 --> 02:21:25,883
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm fond of looking at numbers and statistics that the reports come alive I think they're very user friendly once you understand them.

980
02:21:26,444 --> 02:21:27,825
[SPEAKER_21]: That's, that's my take.

981
02:21:28,225 --> 02:21:36,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, Dr. All of us have used the report so I, I, I got the sense, Dr. Hayes that that you might wonder, did you want to add anything to that.

982
02:21:43,743 --> 02:21:49,325
[SPEAKER_00]: just that in the future slide, you're going to see how we use it within the curriculum department meetings to take time.

983
02:21:49,526 --> 02:21:51,906
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a lot about time with the data.

984
02:21:52,087 --> 02:22:01,270
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Dr. Riccadeli just said, once you're comfortable with the reports, which is why on that previous slide, we invested time in understanding what we were looking at.

985
02:22:01,650 --> 02:22:10,294
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you at that comfort level, which which does, you know, which we do have to get, which we did get to, but took some time, that's when you can begin to understand it.

986
02:22:10,494 --> 02:22:11,274
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what

987
02:22:11,618 --> 02:22:17,440
[SPEAKER_00]: how Dr. Cadelli just explained, it's important, but you will see in a moment the work that's being done and continue to be done.

988
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:17,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

989
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:26,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to add that that's part of the reason why we wanted to show you the breadth and variety of reports because teachers are going, I mean, I even said, oh, I love this one.

990
02:22:26,483 --> 02:22:27,143
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my favorite one.

991
02:22:27,183 --> 02:22:33,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think teachers are going to find the report that gives them the data that they need to inform their practice.

992
02:22:33,265 --> 02:22:37,006
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why there's a variety of reports.

993
02:22:38,326 --> 02:22:38,606
Okay.

994
02:22:40,147 --> 02:22:40,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide.

995
02:22:43,499 --> 02:22:47,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, all right, so how is this data used?

996
02:22:48,042 --> 02:22:52,946
[SPEAKER_21]: So first and foremost, as we said before, we think this data is really important to teachers in the classroom.

997
02:22:53,446 --> 02:22:57,309
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's useful to teachers because they can, as Ms.

998
02:22:57,809 --> 02:23:10,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Galussi illustrated, you could just put the cursor right on that quadrant and find out who is in that high growth, high achievement quadrant and pick out those students, design instruction for them.

999
02:23:11,119 --> 02:23:14,322
[SPEAKER_21]: And through many of the reports, you can zero rate in.

1000
02:23:15,183 --> 02:23:20,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Those reports are designed to make all of us use a strategy.

1001
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,569
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not a guessing game.

1002
02:23:23,009 --> 02:23:24,271
[SPEAKER_21]: It's there in front of us.

1003
02:23:24,611 --> 02:23:28,594
[SPEAKER_21]: We just need to go and look on the reports and go into the different areas.

1004
02:23:29,215 --> 02:23:30,656
[SPEAKER_21]: It's useful to school leaders.

1005
02:23:31,757 --> 02:23:37,402
[SPEAKER_21]: We can make decisions to figure out where there needs to be perhaps a different pacing.

1006
02:23:38,082 --> 02:23:53,539
[SPEAKER_21]: in the curriculum, maybe a bolstering of the curriculum, maybe there needs to be some added professional development for staff, and it's useful to district administrators also for similar reasons.

1007
02:23:55,456 --> 02:23:58,597
[SPEAKER_21]: So MAP growth, as I mentioned, does correlate to MCAS.

1008
02:23:58,657 --> 02:24:08,720
[SPEAKER_21]: It also correlates to many of the other programs that our teachers use, including, let's say, a 4-5, Noozella, RAS Kids, ST Math, Khan Academy.

1009
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:18,362
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is highly regarded in the educational world across the nation, and there are lots of links, connections to other programs.

1010
02:24:18,382 --> 02:24:20,923
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not an isolated program.

1011
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:33,376
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so going to the next slide, this is a snapshot of some of the curriculum analysis that has occurred in grades six to 12.

1012
02:24:34,337 --> 02:24:42,243
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know Dr. Chiesa and Mr. Cieri here have engaged their respective departments in that very meaningful data dive.

1013
02:24:42,323 --> 02:24:46,346
[SPEAKER_21]: So some of the reports that they use are one, the class profile report.

1014
02:24:47,086 --> 02:24:52,430
[SPEAKER_21]: They use a class breakdown report by WRIT, instructional area and projected proficiency.

1015
02:24:53,371 --> 02:24:59,857
[SPEAKER_21]: They also use the achievement status and growth summary report with a quadrant chart, which was highlighted earlier.

1016
02:24:59,877 --> 02:25:02,119
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is ongoing work.

1017
02:25:02,519 --> 02:25:05,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Nowhere I know it's difficult to see on the display.

1018
02:25:05,221 --> 02:25:15,190
[SPEAKER_21]: I just, that's kind of a snapshot with the highlighting in what the respective directors have their staff working on when they meet with them in department meetings.

1019
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you wanna add anything?

1020
02:25:19,213 --> 02:25:19,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1021
02:25:20,815 --> 02:25:20,975
Okay.

1022
02:25:21,474 --> 02:25:26,555
[SPEAKER_17]: I can add just one sentence, because I think one of the bullets, maybe I should talk to the mic.

1023
02:25:26,655 --> 02:25:27,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1024
02:25:28,036 --> 02:25:36,458
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the bullets speaks to continued work at an interdisciplinary level for humanities in the sciences.

1025
02:25:36,518 --> 02:25:49,481
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want to speak for FAISA, but both of us look at pacing guides or pacing and differentiation in classroom or grade level pacing guides as something that we use these tools for.

1026
02:25:50,401 --> 02:25:56,903
[SPEAKER_17]: in terms of looking at the domains and the different subject areas that have strengths or relative weaknesses to help the students.

1027
02:25:56,963 --> 02:26:09,305
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are areas that we're working on currently, and we hope as we move forward and we look at growth, we'll be able to see kids start to show the needed growth moving forward.

1028
02:26:10,325 --> 02:26:10,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor.

1029
02:26:12,246 --> 02:26:12,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Russell.

1030
02:26:13,126 --> 02:26:13,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1031
02:26:13,726 --> 02:26:17,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard from a parent about

1032
02:26:19,312 --> 02:26:21,133
[SPEAKER_14]: in math, and I realize Faiz is not here.

1033
02:26:22,474 --> 02:26:23,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right.

1034
02:26:23,814 --> 02:26:32,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, you know, math, I will say, more than many other subjects, you know, requires that you did the last thing before you can do the next thing.

1035
02:26:33,998 --> 02:26:46,543
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I think about learning loss or gaps, you know, if you're, let's, I'm just picking this randomly, because I cannot honestly remember the details, but if you're in Algebra II, and

1036
02:26:50,231 --> 02:27:00,436
[SPEAKER_14]: the map that this test is given and a concept that is a definite Algebra 1 concept is a student doesn't know it.

1037
02:27:01,476 --> 02:27:09,620
[SPEAKER_14]: They're still sitting there in Algebra 2, and that is not on the syllabus, if you will.

1038
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:12,181
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not going to be taught this year.

1039
02:27:14,282 --> 02:27:19,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Will NWEA map highlight the fact that there's a gap, and then how

1040
02:27:20,268 --> 02:27:25,713
[SPEAKER_14]: What is our expectation of teachers who like they have framework for algebra two.

1041
02:27:26,774 --> 02:27:31,458
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not an extra month somewhere they can carve out to teach something that the kids.

1042
02:27:32,058 --> 02:27:34,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the kids didn't learn in the previous year.

1043
02:27:38,376 --> 02:27:40,237
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure this is a normal thing for teachers.

1044
02:27:40,317 --> 02:27:42,018
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always been a normal thing for teachers.

1045
02:27:42,198 --> 02:27:51,603
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that because of the pandemic, this may not be just like occasionally you'll have a student in Algebra 2 who somehow managed to not know a concept of Algebra 1.

1046
02:27:52,083 --> 02:27:56,005
[SPEAKER_14]: But in fact, you may have a third of your students who don't know a concept.

1047
02:27:56,186 --> 02:27:58,667
[SPEAKER_14]: How do teachers manage that?

1048
02:27:58,747 --> 02:27:59,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And does this testing

1049
02:28:00,808 --> 02:28:09,022
[SPEAKER_14]: help them figure it out real fast so that the teacher can sideline what they were planning to do and get back and teach that.

1050
02:28:10,366 --> 02:28:18,991
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I will say is it shouldn't go that long because the progression is algebra one, geometry, algebra, algebra two.

1051
02:28:19,071 --> 02:28:27,056
[SPEAKER_21]: So many of those concepts and skills that you're learning in algebra one are repeated or built upon in geometry two.

1052
02:28:27,236 --> 02:28:28,777
[SPEAKER_21]: But I understand what you're saying.

1053
02:28:29,057 --> 02:28:32,019
[SPEAKER_21]: So the goal is that those things will be caught.

1054
02:28:32,119 --> 02:28:34,080
[SPEAKER_21]: This will help us catch it.

1055
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:39,729
[SPEAKER_21]: We, it's, it should be caught anyway, but especially with the pandemic.

1056
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:42,013
[SPEAKER_21]: It is possible that some of those strands.

1057
02:28:43,385 --> 02:28:47,367
[SPEAKER_21]: some of the themes, some of the topics, some of the skills were missed.

1058
02:28:47,808 --> 02:28:49,248
[SPEAKER_21]: So this will help with that.

1059
02:28:49,909 --> 02:28:55,492
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, we definitely don't want it to go two levels beyond.

1060
02:28:56,152 --> 02:28:58,454
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't serve anyone's purpose.

1061
02:28:58,474 --> 02:29:00,755
[SPEAKER_21]: But your point is well taken.

1062
02:29:00,875 --> 02:29:05,017
[SPEAKER_21]: And what I will say is this should help to catch it.

1063
02:29:06,338 --> 02:29:08,679
[SPEAKER_21]: It illustrates it, puts it in black and white and color.

1064
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:11,860
[SPEAKER_21]: The reports go out to the parents.

1065
02:29:12,241 --> 02:29:14,081
[SPEAKER_21]: It's right there, right in front.

1066
02:29:16,061 --> 02:29:22,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's really helpful to hear that because, you know, there are plenty of parents who think more testing.

1067
02:29:22,823 --> 02:29:25,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes I'm that parent.

1068
02:29:26,504 --> 02:29:30,945
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, we're not in a regular school year, we probably won't be for

1069
02:29:32,339 --> 02:29:33,800
[SPEAKER_14]: 10 years, I don't know.

1070
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:41,585
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, you know, knowing that there, this can help us find these gaps with precision.

1071
02:29:41,885 --> 02:29:44,527
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, nobody wants to just teach the whole school year over.

1072
02:29:44,547 --> 02:29:46,068
[SPEAKER_14]: The students don't want it.

1073
02:29:46,549 --> 02:29:48,030
[SPEAKER_14]: We probably can't legally even do it.

1074
02:29:48,650 --> 02:30:00,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And, but figuring out what, you know, little Johnny was on Zoom and for that month, there was something else going on in the house and little Johnny wasn't paying attention.

1075
02:30:02,944 --> 02:30:08,268
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, there's no way for the teacher of the next year to have any clue that that happened.

1076
02:30:08,388 --> 02:30:09,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

1077
02:30:10,089 --> 02:30:13,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's right.

1078
02:30:13,632 --> 02:30:16,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So moving to the next slide, Dr. Cushing, please.

1079
02:30:17,235 --> 02:30:25,421
[SPEAKER_08]: This, I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty of this next slide because really the data is the same for at the elementary level.

1080
02:30:25,681 --> 02:30:31,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So the same reports are being utilized that Dr. Riccadeli just spoke about that I highlighted in that section.

1081
02:30:32,264 --> 02:30:45,468
[SPEAKER_08]: These are comparison snippets to what's used at this level, where principals are having data meetings with their grade level teams during common planning time to talk about the data and make plans for supports.

1082
02:30:46,388 --> 02:30:55,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Examples around that are teachers helping one another in terms of best practices, differentiation techniques.

1083
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:57,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it elevates to the need of a student support

1084
02:30:59,360 --> 02:30:59,801
[SPEAKER_08]: system.

1085
02:31:00,841 --> 02:31:05,785
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see here, there's the tracking so that at each meeting, the principal is having conversations.

1086
02:31:07,346 --> 02:31:17,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I know one of the buildings, the principal in collaboration with myself in the upper grades felt that the students, because of a reading issue that affected their math scores.

1087
02:31:17,913 --> 02:31:27,940
[SPEAKER_08]: So we looked at some of the tier two services and were able to pick up a fourth grade group for reading services, which are typically not done.

1088
02:31:28,664 --> 02:31:38,916
[SPEAKER_08]: for Title I, but this is how we're kind of utilizing our resources to adapt to what the student needs based on this data.

1089
02:31:39,556 --> 02:31:41,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving to the next slide.

1090
02:31:41,078 --> 02:31:45,363
[SPEAKER_08]: These next two slides speak about the communication

1091
02:31:46,815 --> 02:31:50,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the reports that go home, you know they go home with each marking period.

1092
02:31:50,457 --> 02:31:53,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the secondary level, that's four times with the report cards.

1093
02:31:53,958 --> 02:32:02,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the elementary level, that's three times with the report cards, which means for this first iteration at the elementary level, they'll get it at the conference.

1094
02:32:02,762 --> 02:32:16,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on this slide, which there's like a pipeline for the family resources for families that are not only translated,

1095
02:32:20,532 --> 02:32:36,103
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also embedded in this a sample test for the parents that their kids themselves can go on and look and take so that you can get an understanding as to what types of questions your students are getting asked on the test.

1096
02:32:37,684 --> 02:32:44,349
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to make sure that this presentation is on our website so that the embedded links are accessible for everybody in the community.

1097
02:32:45,209 --> 02:32:46,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving to the next slide, please.

1098
02:32:50,409 --> 02:32:52,792
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a little bit, we've spoken about this.

1099
02:32:52,972 --> 02:33:02,220
[SPEAKER_08]: This also has some embedded links for resources for families so that they can see what the reports that are sent home to them look like.

1100
02:33:02,841 --> 02:33:15,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the interest of time, and I know I'm advancing slides a little bit, but it kind of dovetails with our next steps because Dr. Riccoboni and I are also going to make sure that

1101
02:33:16,207 --> 02:33:28,433
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of this month, we have a presentation for families on that so that anyone that has questions or would like to join to learn a little bit more information can do so.

1102
02:33:29,433 --> 02:33:36,257
[SPEAKER_08]: We have it reflected on the next slide, but I believe it's... It's Wednesday, November 30 at the 6 p.m.

1103
02:33:36,317 --> 02:33:41,259
[SPEAKER_21]: It will be a Zoom presentation that everybody is welcome to attend.

1104
02:33:42,479 --> 02:33:54,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could, I do want to say, just to reiterate on this slide before we move on to next steps, that I think the biggest piece is that this is a progress monitoring tool.

1105
02:33:54,947 --> 02:33:56,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like MCAS, it's not one and done.

1106
02:33:57,088 --> 02:34:06,634
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for teachers to get an understanding as to what their students' strengths are and what their students' needs are and base their instruction on that.

1107
02:34:07,595 --> 02:34:20,065
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one element of data, as we've spoken about, and if parents and caregivers have concerns at all, the first place they should go to, and the next place they should go to is the principal.

1108
02:34:21,286 --> 02:34:28,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Both are well-versed and able to answer those questions, and the principal can then divert them to someone else if need be.

1109
02:34:28,572 --> 02:34:34,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to reiterate that, if there are people at home wondering where they should go to if they have a concern.

1110
02:34:36,695 --> 02:34:41,461
[SPEAKER_08]: That leads us to the next steps for Metro Public Schools.

1111
02:34:41,521 --> 02:34:43,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one slide before that, Dr. Cushing, sorry.

1112
02:34:44,365 --> 02:34:52,416
[SPEAKER_08]: This has really quickly, I mean, we already covered the parent gardening Q&A.

1113
02:34:54,598 --> 02:34:56,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think on.

1114
02:34:57,480 --> 02:35:11,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, that's not the slide that is that is the slide so again it this this is somewhat repetitious, you know, ongoing professional development, we want to make sure our, our teachers, our administrators understand.

1115
02:35:12,779 --> 02:35:15,401
[SPEAKER_21]: really understand what these reports can do.

1116
02:35:16,922 --> 02:35:18,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Ongoing data meetings.

1117
02:35:18,584 --> 02:35:31,213
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think Mr. Russo, you had mentioned, you know, there are data specialists, but there aren't data specialists in every school, but everybody should be data literate with regard to these reports.

1118
02:35:31,233 --> 02:35:32,234
[SPEAKER_21]: That is our goal.

1119
02:35:32,254 --> 02:35:40,300
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have statisticians and psychometricians on staff, unfortunately, but I don't think we need that for this.

1120
02:35:43,162 --> 02:35:44,323
[SPEAKER_21]: You mentioned precision.

1121
02:35:44,763 --> 02:35:46,984
[SPEAKER_21]: These reports do offer precision.

1122
02:35:48,045 --> 02:35:53,728
[SPEAKER_21]: They allow us to be strategic and purposeful in what we do and what teachers do.

1123
02:35:54,985 --> 02:36:01,369
[SPEAKER_21]: We mentioned the upcoming parent q amp a, again, just to shout out November 30 on yeah.

1124
02:36:02,069 --> 02:36:04,291
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are our next steps with that.

1125
02:36:05,211 --> 02:36:15,457
[SPEAKER_21]: The last section of the report is the appendix, which includes tables and tables of data on the results from the first.

1126
02:36:16,718 --> 02:36:18,758
[SPEAKER_21]: administration of this assessment.

1127
02:36:19,218 --> 02:36:25,880
[SPEAKER_21]: It also includes some sample questions that the directors pulled up in their respective areas.

1128
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:34,761
[SPEAKER_21]: So at this point, without going through page by page, because I think it could be quite tedious, I think we'll stop here.

1129
02:36:35,141 --> 02:36:41,862
[SPEAKER_21]: And let's see if we can get FISA, if FISA Con is available, that would be great.

1130
02:36:41,962 --> 02:36:45,103
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you have questions for any of us, we are happy to.

1131
02:36:56,604 --> 02:37:10,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, Member Graham, I was curious what the testing results in the fall told you and what we need to know about them.

1132
02:37:10,592 --> 02:37:25,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I speak for science and I will if we look at slide 33 it might help us

1133
02:37:26,530 --> 02:37:37,806
[SPEAKER_17]: get a context for that it says grade level district on the top it's a really large title but it's grade level district mean writ achieved scores for science um.

1134
02:37:39,528 --> 02:37:39,689
[SPEAKER_17]: and.

1135
02:37:40,814 --> 02:37:56,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Without getting into too many of the details, I look at the national mean RIT score, which comes from a compilation of four years of aggregated data from the NWEA map data from

1136
02:37:57,318 --> 02:37:58,399
[SPEAKER_17]: did we say 2016 to 2020?

1137
02:37:58,579 --> 02:38:12,030
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's pre-pandemic data from the fall, which helps us understand what students would be at for those RIT scores prior to the pandemic.

1138
02:38:12,150 --> 02:38:16,774
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I compare the Medford-Mead RIT score to that number.

1139
02:38:16,894 --> 02:38:21,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'll notice that across almost all grade levels, we have

1140
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:36,366
[SPEAKER_17]: a very close match or slightly above the mean and what that tells me is that in science it looks like we're back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the mean.

1141
02:38:36,906 --> 02:38:49,632
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know what our students might have done as a district prior to the pandemic but we know in terms of the national data set we are with well within the mean of the

1142
02:38:51,210 --> 02:38:52,371
[SPEAKER_17]: of the national average.

1143
02:38:52,451 --> 02:39:00,474
[SPEAKER_17]: So that makes me hopeful that we can move forward and be able to find instruction that leads to growth.

1144
02:39:01,055 --> 02:39:04,976
[SPEAKER_17]: An area that I thought was interesting is that we do have more

1145
02:39:07,071 --> 02:39:11,552
[SPEAKER_17]: standard deviation than the national average in some of the area and some of the grade levels or some of the schools.

1146
02:39:11,833 --> 02:39:15,894
[SPEAKER_17]: And that tells me that there's more spread of the data.

1147
02:39:16,154 --> 02:39:22,136
[SPEAKER_17]: So that means there are more kids that are wider, further away from the mean.

1148
02:39:22,156 --> 02:39:25,457
[SPEAKER_17]: And it speaks to the level of, um,

1149
02:39:26,556 --> 02:39:36,064
[SPEAKER_17]: work that a teacher needs to do to support a student, whether they are needing additional supports or also on the other side in terms of enrichment.

1150
02:39:36,304 --> 02:39:42,930
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are areas where right now we're starting to look to see what kinds of changes we can make.

1151
02:39:42,970 --> 02:39:44,331
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just wanted to speak broadly.

1152
02:39:44,391 --> 02:39:46,413
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it looked really good.

1153
02:39:46,813 --> 02:39:48,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I was pleased.

1154
02:39:49,235 --> 02:39:51,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other question I had, which

1155
02:39:53,949 --> 02:40:10,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if such a metric exists within math, but comparing to the national average is just a comparison of the average, but what RIT score is proficient?

1156
02:40:11,685 --> 02:40:13,447
[SPEAKER_05]: What should we be shooting for?

1157
02:40:14,668 --> 02:40:20,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Just being the national average doesn't necessarily make

1158
02:40:20,779 --> 02:40:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: give me like the warm fuzzies, but I don't know.

1159
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:24,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the question I'm trying to get to.

1160
02:40:25,661 --> 02:40:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the points is that it's not necessarily the national average as it is a sampling.

1161
02:40:32,724 --> 02:40:40,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it says national norm, but it's a sampling from 2016 to 2020 of where the students would be.

1162
02:40:41,008 --> 02:40:46,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have a sense of what is average achievement until we go to that colored bar.

1163
02:40:46,030 --> 02:40:49,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall what slide it's on off the top of my head, but in

1164
02:40:50,188 --> 02:41:13,748
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at those colored bars, we don't necessarily have a national number for you, because I think a lot of what NWEA is drilling down in the classroom, but for our teachers, back to your original question, for our teachers, when they look at that bar, whatever slide that was way back when, they need to pay close attention to if a lot of my students are in the blue, they're above

1165
02:41:14,501 --> 02:41:16,362
[SPEAKER_00]: they're where they should be at the end of the year.

1166
02:41:16,402 --> 02:41:22,824
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to make sure as a teacher that I'm still challenging those students because we always still have room to grow even our high flyers, right?

1167
02:41:23,404 --> 02:41:31,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anybody in the middle colors would be students that are right on par or need to be pushed a little bit.

1168
02:41:31,587 --> 02:41:36,309
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be honest, there is no set national norm per se.

1169
02:41:36,829 --> 02:41:37,829
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little deceiving.

1170
02:41:37,889 --> 02:41:39,630
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 2016 to 2020 sampling range.

1171
02:41:42,984 --> 02:41:45,146
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the best we can get for them.

1172
02:41:45,166 --> 02:41:46,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that helps, but.

1173
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:49,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor.

1174
02:41:50,791 --> 02:41:53,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just quickly say, and I feel like I'm

1175
02:41:54,868 --> 02:42:05,733
[SPEAKER_08]: on repeat slightly, but I feel like, so two things, slide 15 that I covered, that has the color coding per subject, as well as you can't see it.

1176
02:42:06,414 --> 02:42:12,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I clicked on the mathematics one so that you can see the range for where the rich should fall.

1177
02:42:12,757 --> 02:42:15,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you can see the range for where their scale should fall.

1178
02:42:16,445 --> 02:42:20,446
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't see that for reading or for science because I didn't click on that.

1179
02:42:20,526 --> 02:42:39,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I just highlighted one page, but the teacher is able to highlight on, click on each of those tabs and bring up not only the domains that I spoke about, but on the left, the key piece is where the student fell in achievement and where the student fell for growth.

1180
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:52,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that the shift in this, as I said before, is that this is really looking at the student and how the student is performing on each test, how the student is growing on each test.

1181
02:42:52,695 --> 02:42:55,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And so a low growth

1182
02:42:57,697 --> 02:43:12,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always something to be to look at, but if they're already exceeding, and they're already at a high achievement level, they're not going to have the growth that other students do, but in reverse, you could have some students that are scoring and low achievement.

1183
02:43:12,788 --> 02:43:15,850
[SPEAKER_08]: but they're making huge growth gains.

1184
02:43:16,330 --> 02:43:18,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is something to be celebrated as well.

1185
02:43:19,392 --> 02:43:24,935
[SPEAKER_08]: The piece of this is that drill down data for each student to see what they need.

1186
02:43:25,035 --> 02:43:37,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And so a lot of what you're asking and talking about is done at those data meetings at the secondary level with the curriculum directors and school leaders and at the elementary level with the school leaders.

1187
02:43:39,315 --> 02:43:48,965
[SPEAKER_08]: They're taking the opportunity at those common planning times, which happened twice a month, to talk about the data and then adjust practice to see how can we support the students to do that.

1188
02:43:50,026 --> 02:43:50,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1189
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:53,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. Russo.

1190
02:43:55,252 --> 02:43:55,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1191
02:43:58,348 --> 02:44:01,771
[SPEAKER_14]: feel like I'm going to just ask a couple questions for which you probably don't have the answers.

1192
02:44:01,851 --> 02:44:14,862
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, we talked about MCAS scores, which for the thousandth time, I'm not a fan of, we do know that we were referring to the students of Massachusetts, and we mean virtually all of them.

1193
02:44:16,406 --> 02:44:23,250
[SPEAKER_14]: What I don't know is the NWEA database for which they decide to decide that those are the nationals.

1194
02:44:24,411 --> 02:44:31,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they using, I'm assuming we're not getting some of like, they're not getting, showing us a like district numbers.

1195
02:44:32,435 --> 02:44:36,217
[SPEAKER_14]: And I realized like district at Bessie changes it every year.

1196
02:44:36,957 --> 02:44:42,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And I doubt very much the communities that are in the like districts for us truly changed every year.

1197
02:44:44,221 --> 02:44:56,850
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I have no idea is, you know, does, who's buying NWEA and feeding their database, is it historically low performing urban schools or is it.

1198
02:44:57,827 --> 02:45:13,959
[SPEAKER_14]: You know the wealthy Western Winchester's that are buying it, who's buying it, who's this data source because I think that sort of was maybe what member Graham was trying to get at was the national norm mean RIT in kindergarten for ELA is 136.65.

1199
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:22,486
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we were all to just get together for a year and sit in a room and do some research projects, would we all think that it should be 230?

1200
02:45:24,708 --> 02:45:37,663
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I certainly understand the need to like understand how we compare to the state or to national averages and all that stuff and it's it's not that it's not meaningful, but.

1201
02:45:40,484 --> 02:45:53,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Unlike with the MCAS, where we know when we see the score that we're referring to an individual student or a district against a known cohort comparison, I'm really unsure.

1202
02:45:54,008 --> 02:45:58,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Is NWEA in 80% of the schools or 2% of the schools?

1203
02:45:58,929 --> 02:46:01,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Those kinds of things would matter dramatically.

1204
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:06,211
[SPEAKER_14]: If you told me they were in 80% of the schools in the country, all my questions that I'm asking would just vanish.

1205
02:46:06,771 --> 02:46:07,351
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're in 2%, that

1206
02:46:10,643 --> 02:46:14,785
[SPEAKER_14]: would make me think that the national norm means nothing.

1207
02:46:16,345 --> 02:46:31,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm asking this question realizing you might have to perhaps come back and get an answer later, but it seems really, really important to me to understand whether I can trust that these nationally normed things mean anything.

1208
02:46:32,731 --> 02:46:38,573
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we're above them pretty much everywhere, by the way, that's great news, but who are the them?

1209
02:46:39,734 --> 02:46:39,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1210
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:43,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

1211
02:46:44,301 --> 02:46:45,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1212
02:46:46,402 --> 02:46:46,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1213
02:46:47,223 --> 02:46:48,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank Ms.

1214
02:46:48,303 --> 02:47:06,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Galusi for talking about the importance of the improvement rating so that it's not just about what the scores are, but that it's really about seeing students improving over time as well, because that's a really important piece of data that we're seeing the improvement piece.

1215
02:47:06,596 --> 02:47:07,917
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for sharing that.

1216
02:47:15,811 --> 02:47:16,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1217
02:47:16,812 --> 02:47:17,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We can continue.

1218
02:47:27,577 --> 02:47:29,398
[SPEAKER_10]: We're finished.

1219
02:47:31,419 --> 02:47:33,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the committee?

1220
02:47:35,862 --> 02:47:36,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1221
02:47:38,203 --> 02:47:38,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1222
02:47:40,134 --> 02:47:42,656
[SPEAKER_14]: The appendix is not everything you had, obviously.

1223
02:47:43,616 --> 02:47:45,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And you made that very clear.

1224
02:47:47,039 --> 02:47:53,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I also understand, based on some of the slides, that you had to do work to make them to hide student.

1225
02:47:55,725 --> 02:48:00,888
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have the right to see individual student anything.
