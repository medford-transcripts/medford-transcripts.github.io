[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, move suspension of the rules to take three papers combined, 15-562, 15-563, and 15-568, and they all pertain to the Craddock Bridge construction project.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,482
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for suspension of the rules to take those three aforementioned papers out of order.

00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:35,402
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

30
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:35,983
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

31
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:36,923
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

32
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:38,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

33
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,924
[SPEAKER_24]: So before us are these three motions.

34
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:44,645
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could read them, if you would indulge me.

35
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:57,269
[SPEAKER_24]: 15-562 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss and contact the Department of Transportation pursued to the proposed detour during the shutdown of Main Street

36
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:08,557
[SPEAKER_24]: off route 16, 15-563 offered by Councilor Penta be resolved that the now ongoing construction work at the credit bridge be discussed.

37
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:13,398
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, under petitions, presentations and similar matters.

38
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:27,583
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, this was a request by the Medford city council 15-568 petition that the Massachusetts department of transportation to address the city council on the credit bridge reconstruction project.

39
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:35,760
[SPEAKER_24]: So at this time, I'd like to invite forward the members of the Department of Transportation to make the presentation.

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,005
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you would introduce yourselves to us, and we'll have your presentation.

41
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:48,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of it is an audio or a visual presentation with the screen.

42
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:53,752
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll be vacating the podium, but still be chairing the meeting.

43
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Please, welcome.

44
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:57,729
[SPEAKER_28]: Good evening.

45
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,413
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Scott Kelleway from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

46
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:12,120
[SPEAKER_28]: With us is Paul Malloy, who is the construction engineer, and also Mike Winnick, who is the resident engineer on this project.

47
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,741
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you just speak into the microphone?

48
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,282
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

49
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:15,763
[SPEAKER_28]: We're addressing us.

50
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:17,384
[SPEAKER_28]: I apologize.

51
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:17,924
[SPEAKER_24]: That's OK.

52
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,687
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, Scott Kelleway.

53
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:24,810
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm an assistant construction engineer with the MassDOT District 4.

54
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:29,465
[SPEAKER_28]: Paul Malloy is also with us, who is the district construction engineer.

55
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,749
[SPEAKER_28]: Mike Winnick is the resident engineer on the project.

56
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:41,456
[SPEAKER_28]: And standing to my right is Andy Greenlaw, who is with Zoppo Corporation, who is a contractor on the project.

57
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:51,845
[SPEAKER_28]: We've prepared a PowerPoint presentation that Mr. Greenlaw is going to kind of walk you through, kind of lay out the project.

58
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:55,274
[SPEAKER_28]: entertaining questions afterwards.

59
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,955
[SPEAKER_28]: Very good.

60
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:58,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

61
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:07,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Andy Greenlaw, as Scott said, with Arzapo Corp., with the general contractor for the Craddock Bridge project.

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,882
[SPEAKER_17]: And thanks for inviting us to speak about the project.

63
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,703
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't get the chance to do this very often.

64
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:18,225
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is the Craddock Bridge repair and replacement.

65
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:22,107
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to first go through a little overview

66
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:28,355
[SPEAKER_17]: so you can see the project from beginning to end, and then we'll discuss some of the particulars.

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we're here to repair the bridge.

68
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,203
[SPEAKER_17]: It's structurally deficient.

69
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you're probably all aware of that.

70
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,586
[SPEAKER_17]: You see it in the center of town.

71
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Increase the hydraulic opening for the Mystic River flow.

72
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Studies have shown that removing

73
00:04:54,529 --> 00:05:03,292
[SPEAKER_17]: The old parts of the dam is going to increase the flow, thereby mitigating flood upstream.

74
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Improving the bridge aesthetics.

75
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,354
[SPEAKER_17]: If you've looked at it, that's not going to be difficult.

76
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,735
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're going to make it a nice-looking bridge.

77
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:20,416
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a lot of utilities in the bridge, and we're going to take the opportunity to upgrade those.

78
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:22,697
[SPEAKER_17]: And during our construction,

79
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:44,277
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to maintain the existing traffic flow and we're going to keep two lanes in each direction open all the time, except during the middle part of the day when we can take lanes to do work in the middle of the street, most of which we've done.

80
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:47,338
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to keep the pedestrians safe.

81
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,299
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got a plan to move them around and

82
00:05:52,404 --> 00:06:02,990
[SPEAKER_17]: public safety response, once again, two lanes in each direction, so that the emergency vehicles that are located close by can get through the project.

83
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:09,594
[SPEAKER_17]: The existing condition of the bridge, it's in pretty tough shape.

84
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:17,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Sidewalk wheelchair ramps are almost difficult to use, especially for wheelchairs.

85
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,422
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no travel lanes, no shoulders, no bike paths.

86
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:30,968
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some guardrails that are protecting the pedestrians that are in need of replacement.

87
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:33,269
[SPEAKER_17]: And once again, all the utility work.

88
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,874
[SPEAKER_17]: This is kind of what the utilities look like right now.

89
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:44,957
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see there are fiber optic, gas, and telephone conduits.

90
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:47,019
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also a water pipe.

91
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:54,020
[SPEAKER_17]: and some electrical conduits under the bridge, all of which are going to get upgraded.

92
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:06,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The environment, we talked a little bit about the flood mitigation program and so as we do the demolition, we're going to improve that situation.

93
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:13,848
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what we're going to produce in the final condition.

94
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:15,669
[SPEAKER_17]: This is upstream

95
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,529
[SPEAKER_17]: and we're gonna make it look like downstream.

96
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,275
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna use granite cladding on the surface so that it resembles the actual granite of the downstream.

97
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:43,789
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is the downstream and we're gonna, the existing stones are in the arches and we're gonna try and match that for the remainder of the bridge so that the appearance will all be the same.

98
00:07:46,364 --> 00:08:06,210
[SPEAKER_17]: On the phasing, we're gonna maintain the number of travel lanes, maintain existing access, accommodate traffic, pedestrians, buses, and give ourselves room for construction around the utilities.

99
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:14,232
[SPEAKER_17]: All of that's gonna be accomplished with the construction of a temporary bridge, which is gonna go

100
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:22,699
[SPEAKER_17]: from where the closed ramp is over behind the dentist's office.

101
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,760
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will be carrying the northbound traffic.

102
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,423
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the first construction phase.

103
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:40,508
[SPEAKER_17]: This was actually put into place Monday morning, and that was to close off the ramp westbound off 16.

104
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Next phase will be

105
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:50,575
[SPEAKER_17]: to construct the temporary bridge.

106
00:08:55,319 --> 00:09:08,210
[SPEAKER_17]: As we go along, we'll be able to move traffic onto the bridge and then divide the existing bridge and use two lanes of traffic while we reconstruct the other two lanes.

107
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,694
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be using temporary signals

108
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:19,133
[SPEAKER_17]: over where the traffic splits.

109
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:26,215
[SPEAKER_17]: There's gonna be signals there for pedestrians, and when we get to the pedestrian routes, you'll see why.

110
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:37,219
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, the first, the phase three was construct the west side of the bridge, reconstruct it.

111
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we go to phase four, move the traffic over to the new side of the bridge.

112
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,851
[SPEAKER_17]: and the east side of the bridge will then be reconstructed.

113
00:09:52,012 --> 00:10:03,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Once we get the bridge completely reconstructed, we'll be able to remove the temporary bridge and reopen the ramp from Route 16.

114
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:11,937
[SPEAKER_17]: For pedestrian traffic, you can see in each phase where we have

115
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:28,956
[SPEAKER_17]: plotted where the pedestrians will go, and at the south abutment of the temporary bridge, that's where the traffic signals are going to be with the PED signals to allow people to cross in front of traffic.

116
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:42,627
[SPEAKER_17]: When we move and finish the west side of the bridge, then we'll move the pedestrians to the west side and we'll reconstruct the east side.

117
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:54,686
[SPEAKER_17]: And the final condition is just an upgrade of what's there with a nice new bridge.

118
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:03,953
[SPEAKER_17]: We're still in conversation with the MBTA.

119
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:14,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now it looks like we're gonna move the bus stop from its present location to probably underneath the Route 16 overpass.

120
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:21,393
[SPEAKER_17]: but we'll do that in conjunction with them so that their drivers are happy with the location.

121
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, and it'll be relocated.

122
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:33,895
[SPEAKER_17]: When we're done, we'll put it back where it was.

123
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:37,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Schedule, that one's a little hard to see.

124
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:44,077
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, it's a little hard to see unless I put my glasses on.

125
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:56,655
[SPEAKER_17]: So phase one, which is we're in the middle of now, finishes up at the end of July.

126
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:07,099
[SPEAKER_17]: The temporary bridge with all of its elements to be constructed will be finished and in place the beginning of November.

127
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:15,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Phase three, the west side of the bridge, demolish and reconstruct.

128
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:21,529
[SPEAKER_17]: runs from November of 15 to August of 2017.

129
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:35,331
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a number of phases in the construction of the west side of the bridge that extends that out for that long.

130
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:46,553
[SPEAKER_17]: During the course of that work, we've got some utility work to do.

131
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:57,245
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we come to phase 3B, which is the western portion of the bridge.

132
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:04,206
[SPEAKER_17]: And 3C is the inner western portion of the bridge, if you will.

133
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:11,907
[SPEAKER_17]: And phase four is the eastern portion of the bridge deck.

134
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,668
[SPEAKER_17]: And that finishes at the end of July in 18.

135
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:31,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Phase 5, remove the temporary bridge, restore the traffic signals, surface courses, markings, signs, et cetera, through September.

136
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:38,376
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, post-construction survey, lomacy, and landscaping.

137
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:45,522
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will all finish up in the fall of 18.

138
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:49,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

139
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:52,654
[SPEAKER_24]: Any questions?

140
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:57,636
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that all for the presentation?

141
00:13:58,276 --> 00:13:58,476
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

142
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

143
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,878
[SPEAKER_26]: The Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

144
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

145
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:07,481
[SPEAKER_26]: And thank you very much for being here this evening to the folks from the DOT.

146
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,622
[SPEAKER_26]: That's greatly appreciated.

147
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:11,303
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there going to be any disruption to

148
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:19,153
[SPEAKER_26]: boat access going under the bridge from the Mystic Lakes down to the Boston Harbor during the construction phases of the project?

149
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:19,854
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

150
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:20,774
[SPEAKER_28]: No?

151
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:33,002
[SPEAKER_28]: The Coast Guard prescribed limits for both overhead height clearances and how much we can encroach with coffer dams so boats will be able to use the- I mean, no disruption whatsoever?

152
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:38,566
[SPEAKER_17]: We are going to have to- we're going to be required to move the channel around a little bit.

153
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,527
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to move, but we've got to be able to get through.

154
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:40,607
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

155
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:41,128
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

156
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:41,488
[SPEAKER_26]: Excellent.

157
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:41,728
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

158
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:48,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

159
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Councilor Caraviello.

160
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:50,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

161
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:57,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, during this construction, you know, all the, all the cars are being rerouted around different ways.

162
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:02,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they'll be going down high street now and down, uh, Riverside Avenue.

163
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:16,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is there any plans are, I know you people don't pay, you know, any mitigation, but, uh, for maybe, uh, uh, repaving of, uh, uh, Salem street where all the traffic's going to be headed to, which is kind of in bad shape as it is.

164
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:20,848
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, there's all ripples on Riverside Avenue and on those streets.

165
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:36,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the increased traffic for the next three years, is that something that will fall under the scope of your work of possibly repaving those roads to handle all that increased traffic that's going to really make the road a lot worse than what it is?

166
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,524
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a question better answered by the department.

167
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:42,986
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not within the scope of my project.

168
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,348
[SPEAKER_28]: It's presently not part of the scope of this project.

169
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:45,888
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry?

170
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,667
[SPEAKER_28]: It's presently not a part of the scope of this project.

171
00:15:48,747 --> 00:16:00,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not a part, but as part of helping the city out during this time, that's where I was asking the question, if they could help out with maybe repaving that road at some point.

172
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a question I can answer.

173
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:04,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not a question.

174
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,972
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll second, Councilor.

175
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:08,472
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

176
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

177
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:09,752
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Marks.

178
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:11,853
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

179
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:28,132
[SPEAKER_30]: Regarding the phase one, the move of the Verizon conduits, other than the conduits and the electrical conduits, what other wiring is currently underneath that bridge?

180
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,016
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you speak into the mic?

181
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,317
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, I'm sorry.

182
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:39,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there's a large quantity of fiber optic cable under the bridge.

183
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:41,182
[SPEAKER_17]: The town also has a water line.

184
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:51,441
[SPEAKER_17]: under there, which for a time is going to be disconnected, and then we'll replace it during the course of the construction.

185
00:16:54,943 --> 00:17:10,632
[SPEAKER_17]: MCI business lines, telephone lines, electric lines, there are some empty ducts under there that the owners want to keep, so we're going to even replace the empty ones so that for the future, if the owners of those ducts want to use them, they'll be there.

186
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:32,064
[SPEAKER_30]: The reason why I ask is when we were first presented the conceptual design and project back some time ago, it was stated to us that many members of this council asked why it would take so long to build a bridge, first of all, because of the impact to the business owners and also to the residents.

187
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:40,788
[SPEAKER_30]: And we were told that due to the extensive cabling that runs underneath the bridge, that alone was roughly about a year's worth of work.

188
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:49,200
[SPEAKER_30]: And some of us questioned why it would take a year to move wiring or temporarily relocate wires.

189
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:55,502
[SPEAKER_30]: And when I look through the different phases, it doesn't appear to be that extensive.

190
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,463
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that portion of the project changed?

191
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,784
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it actually hasn't.

192
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:08,327
[SPEAKER_17]: But for the sake of brevity on the schedule, I didn't want to try to keep it to a page.

193
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:26,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Within our contract is a utilities form that has all the movements of all the utilities, and the utilities assign values for the time it takes them to do this work.

194
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:34,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I'm contracted to do a little of it directly with them, but for the most part, they're going to perform the work.

195
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So in my schedule, I have to give them the time they requested.

196
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:45,907
[SPEAKER_17]: because they're working for the department.

197
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:50,289
[SPEAKER_30]: So you're saying then their work would take preference over your work?

198
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:51,010
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that, is that?

199
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it has to happen in order for me to complete my work.

200
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:58,634
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to happen within the construction phasing.

201
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:08,960
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are going to be times when I'm going to have to give over the bridge to a specific utility.

202
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:14,698
[SPEAKER_17]: and let him come in and do his work, and then I can resume my work.

203
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,421
[SPEAKER_30]: So for instance, when you look at phase one is to move Verizon conduits.

204
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,723
[SPEAKER_30]: Then it jumps to phase two, which is to install a temporary bridge.

205
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:28,265
[SPEAKER_30]: And phase three is the demo and reconstruction of the west side of the bridge.

206
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:29,085
[SPEAKER_30]: Right.

207
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:34,348
[SPEAKER_30]: There are no other water or other fiber optics under the west side?

208
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:34,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

209
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you get that back on that slide, Scott?

210
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,213
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a fairly significant amount of moving that we have to do on the west side.

211
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:55,537
[SPEAKER_17]: And it entails moving from present location to temporary location and then to permanent location.

212
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:59,798
[SPEAKER_17]: So where does that fall within the phases?

213
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:02,519
[SPEAKER_17]: That part that I just spoke of is in phase three.

214
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:07,321
[SPEAKER_17]: You know the one that shows the cut of the bridge?

215
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:08,042
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.

216
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:12,504
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, is that the one?

217
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:13,805
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it is.

218
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,120
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go.

219
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,021
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

220
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:46,324
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how well you can see that slide, but if you look on the left-hand side, you'll see that there's a water line there.

221
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:50,565
[SPEAKER_17]: That gets removed and eventually gets replaced.

222
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:55,847
[SPEAKER_17]: There are electric conduits.

223
00:20:55,987 --> 00:21:05,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Those electric conduits have to be initially moved to a temporary location, also within this phase, but not underneath the traffic.

224
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:13,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Then when we reconstruct that section of the bridge, those have to be moved into their permanent location.

225
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:23,872
[SPEAKER_30]: So just if I can interrupt, so the east side piping that we're looking at, telephone gas, is going to be moved to the west side temporarily?

226
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:24,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

227
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:30,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the gas pipe, we're going to even have to run a bypass in order for the work

228
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:38,097
[SPEAKER_17]: to continue through the wintertime so that they can maintain gas pressure for everyone.

229
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:39,638
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

230
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:56,430
[SPEAKER_30]: So if you look at phase three, November of 2015 to August 2017, that demo that says demo and reconstruction of the west side also includes the moving of any underground utilities.

231
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,971
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

232
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:00,213
[SPEAKER_17]: I should also point out.

233
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:10,999
[SPEAKER_17]: take a little time to explain that the utilities are part of the reason that this project takes so long.

234
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:20,382
[SPEAKER_17]: The bigger part of it is we are only allowed to occupy a very small footprint in the river at any one time.

235
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:24,564
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can reconstruct a single pier.

236
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:28,085
[SPEAKER_17]: That means demolish it,

237
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:49,312
[SPEAKER_17]: drive the piles, reconstruct the pier, put the new granite cladding on it, and then we're done, and we can disassemble that cofferdam, and we can move that to a new location, but only one at a time.

238
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:56,498
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to do complete construction of one element, and this is a Corps of Engineers requirement.

239
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:01,120
[SPEAKER_17]: It's part of the water quality certificate for the river.

240
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:05,524
[SPEAKER_17]: That takes up a great deal of time.

241
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:10,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Those restrictions have a great deal of impact on the project.

242
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:18,374
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can't do any work in the river from March 15 to July 15 in accordance with the permit.

243
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:18,815
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

244
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:20,156
Use your microphone.

245
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:20,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

246
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:23,779
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not used to this.

247
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:36,445
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's four months out of every year that we cannot perform any silk-producing activities at all in the river.

248
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,026
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, we can't install a cofferdam.

249
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,888
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't take a cofferdam out.

250
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:46,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we get seasonally stuck, we can't move.

251
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:54,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we've planned our schedule so that we make it fit into the windows that we can work.

252
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,957
[SPEAKER_17]: That drives the schedule more than the utilities do.

253
00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:01,017
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

254
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:11,665
[SPEAKER_30]: And I just have a few questions regarding when the bridge is demolished.

255
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:14,627
[SPEAKER_30]: What plans are there for pest control in the area?

256
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,789
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there any plans laid out by your company?

257
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:17,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

258
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,032
[SPEAKER_17]: The contract contains pest control requirements.

259
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:23,374
[SPEAKER_17]: The baiting has already been done.

260
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,067
[SPEAKER_17]: They're checked on a regular basis.

261
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:36,434
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm given reports on a weekly basis from the pest control company, and those are forwarded to the department when I get them.

262
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:46,401
[SPEAKER_30]: Have the surrounding buildings been checked internally for any type of existing cracks or damage to foundations or so forth?

263
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:47,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Not yet, but it's coming soon.

264
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:48,903
[SPEAKER_17]: That's coming soon.

265
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:54,047
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a program as part of our contract where we're going to put

266
00:24:55,722 --> 00:25:05,244
[SPEAKER_17]: deformation monitoring points, crack monitors on the buildings, on the river wall structures, and we're going to monitor those on a regular basis.

267
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:10,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have limits as to how much movement we can see in those.

268
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:22,248
[SPEAKER_17]: If we see any small movements, we actually have to stop and refigure what we're doing so that we're not affecting the structures.

269
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:26,492
[SPEAKER_30]: and the owners of the property and also tenants will be notified?

270
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:32,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, and we've been in touch on a preliminary basis.

271
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:35,393
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, we're going to get right of entry forms.

272
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,034
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have them fill those out.

273
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:41,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Inside and out, we're going to videotape their structures.

274
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:50,476
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have a structural engineer walk through the buildings and make notes and fill out a report that will be submitted to us.

275
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,802
[SPEAKER_17]: We in turn will give that to the department, and that will be on record, and when we're all done, we're gonna do it again.

276
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:07,025
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, and what plans do you have for access to the businesses that'll be open during the construction period?

277
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:16,148
[SPEAKER_30]: I know you're gonna be removing sidewalks and a lot of construction in the area as well, construction equipment.

278
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:20,150
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there any plans laid out to make sure people have access

279
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:21,452
[SPEAKER_30]: to the businesses?

280
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:22,192
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

281
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:31,999
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're mandated as part of our specification to keep access to those businesses at all times.

282
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,742
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, is there going to be some disruption?

283
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:37,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, there is.

284
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:39,344
[SPEAKER_17]: It's unavoidable.

285
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:47,389
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very difficult to put a new sidewalk in front of a building and not disrupt it to some degree.

286
00:26:47,949 --> 00:26:49,611
[SPEAKER_17]: But we do wooden walkways.

287
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,217
[SPEAKER_17]: We do what we have to do to make sure they can stay open.

288
00:26:55,298 --> 00:27:03,223
[SPEAKER_30]: And that leads to my next point about construction debris and also dust and dirt during the construction phase.

289
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:07,045
[SPEAKER_30]: Will there be power washing of buildings and windows?

290
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:09,547
[SPEAKER_30]: How frequent would that be?

291
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't intend to get them dirty.

292
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,430
[SPEAKER_30]: You don't intend to get them dirty?

293
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:33,697
[SPEAKER_17]: We try to do a very good job with our dust control, and that's part of our contract with the department requires that we medicate dust by using water, by using calcium, by using other mitigation measures to keep the dust down.

294
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:42,364
[SPEAKER_30]: But in the event, for instance, a restaurant, if their window becomes so dirty that patrons don't want to go inside,

295
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:50,075
[SPEAKER_30]: Are you going to provide that type of pressure washing and daily maintenance of... Oh, I can't commit to that, no.

296
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:54,519
[SPEAKER_30]: You can't commit to that, but you said you're not going to have any dust.

297
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:06,688
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the way that we're going to prosecute the work, is to work as cleanly as we possibly can.

298
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:10,652
[SPEAKER_30]: Right, but in the event that doesn't happen, you're saying that you're not willing to do it?

299
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,129
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not part of the specs.

300
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:22,911
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this questioning is getting a little, we came here to present what we're going to do to construct this.

301
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:28,332
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, as part of the construction, there's also a process of cleanup.

302
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:30,093
[SPEAKER_30]: There's also a process of heavy equipment.

303
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,193
[SPEAKER_17]: We keep our job clean.

304
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:33,974
[SPEAKER_30]: We don't let debris collect.

305
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:37,974
[SPEAKER_30]: OK, so can you provide a number that someone can call if there's a concern?

306
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:38,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

307
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:39,235
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

308
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:41,015
[SPEAKER_17]: We do that routinely.

309
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:42,177
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you have that now?

310
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:44,779
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, but I can certainly make sure you have it.

311
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,861
[SPEAKER_30]: If you can provide that, that'd be great.

312
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:51,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Our superintendent is open to conversation with everybody.

313
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,767
[SPEAKER_17]: And if they have a problem, they can talk to him and we'll resolve it.

314
00:28:58,448 --> 00:29:03,192
[SPEAKER_30]: And just my last point, when will the typical hours be of construction?

315
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:11,117
[SPEAKER_17]: To the extent that we can, we're going to run the job during the day, but I'd

316
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:16,871
[SPEAKER_17]: Our hours are 10 o'clock at night until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

317
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,613
[SPEAKER_17]: 10 to 4 in the afternoon.

318
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:28,580
[SPEAKER_17]: And the nighttime hours, I have every reason to believe you're going to see us out there.

319
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Because of the tightness of the schedule for this project,

320
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:36,739
[SPEAKER_17]: That's our cushion.

321
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:47,725
[SPEAKER_17]: The nighttime hours, if we have to make up to meet certain milestones within the schedule, then those nighttime hours will be used.

322
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:53,509
[SPEAKER_30]: And is there any penalty if you don't meet your required deadlines?

323
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,531
[SPEAKER_17]: There's liquidated damages at the end of the project, yes.

324
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,272
[SPEAKER_30]: That's already been established?

325
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:02,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's established prior to even the bid.

326
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:05,195
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you also pass that along to the council?

327
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:10,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, yeah, that's, that's actually a standard.

328
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,621
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a standard department liquidated damage policy.

329
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,262
[SPEAKER_28]: It's in our standard specifications for highways and bridges.

330
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:20,284
[SPEAKER_28]: There's not an incentive disincentive specific to this project.

331
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:21,025
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

332
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:25,007
[SPEAKER_30]: Cause I know what the fast 14 project there was well aware of that.

333
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:26,647
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not independent.

334
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:30,909
[SPEAKER_28]: There's not specific language to incentive disincentive with this project.

335
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,970
[SPEAKER_30]: And is it seven days a week?

336
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:34,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope.

337
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:36,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Monday through Friday?

338
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,356
[SPEAKER_17]: That's our schedule right now.

339
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:44,761
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we need to make up time, we intend to use nights.

340
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:47,824
[SPEAKER_17]: We'd prefer to stay away from weekends as well.

341
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:49,806
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

342
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:56,892
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, just if we can get a copy of the contact number for local businesses and also residents that may have a concern.

343
00:30:57,893 --> 00:31:00,735
[SPEAKER_30]: Will that be manned around the clock, that particular line?

344
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:04,118
[SPEAKER_17]: just during working hours?

345
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,439
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be the superintendent's cell phone.

346
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,020
[SPEAKER_30]: His direct cell phone?

347
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

348
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,061
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

349
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:11,681
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

350
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:13,582
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll give you my number, too.

351
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:16,424
[SPEAKER_30]: You can pass that along to the city clerk.

352
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:19,405
[SPEAKER_24]: The clerk has that, and also Mr. Daley's made note of that as well.

353
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:19,725
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

354
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:21,186
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

355
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:22,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President, Margo Kern.

356
00:31:23,587 --> 00:31:24,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

357
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:31,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I understand it correctly, the only time that work will not be done is from 4 in the afternoon to 10 at night.

358
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:35,222
[SPEAKER_03]: that all other time is a fair game?

359
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:36,523
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

360
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:48,545
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have with regards to signage for, you know, I see the different plans, there's different pedestrian routes and obviously different traffic patterns.

361
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:57,006
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the signage going to be laid out so that people know the safest way to traverse our sidewalks and drive our streets?

362
00:31:58,547 --> 00:32:00,367
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't bring actually the

363
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:03,086
[SPEAKER_17]: the signage plans with us.

364
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:10,492
[SPEAKER_17]: You probably wouldn't even see them very well up there on the board.

365
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:22,942
[SPEAKER_17]: But there are, during the different phases of the work, the signs get moved around to direct the pedestrians, and we'll also move crosswalks.

366
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:35,742
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll eradicate a crosswalk, paint a crosswalk, put up new signs, and actually barricade the sidewalks that are closed so people can't use them.

367
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:40,444
[SPEAKER_17]: And they will find direction from those barricades to where they need to go.

368
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:44,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I can take a look at the plans too.

369
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:50,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, on phase three, you have different patterns of how you want the pedestrians to walk.

370
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:54,850
[SPEAKER_03]: For pedestrian purposes, how many signs will be located?

371
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:02,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like you have Main Street from under 93 all the way down, down Riverside Ave, Ring Road.

372
00:33:02,953 --> 00:33:05,454
[SPEAKER_03]: How many, about how many signs there for the pedestrians?

373
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:15,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Typically the way they're laid out, and I'll let Scott find the plan, but typically the way they're laid out are at what you would call decision points.

374
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,801
[SPEAKER_17]: You come to a spot in the sidewalk, well where do I go now?

375
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:25,115
[SPEAKER_17]: well, there's going to be a sign directing you where to go and there'll be markings.

376
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:36,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, so if we do it right, you shouldn't be able to walk where you don't belong.

377
00:33:36,322 --> 00:33:36,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

378
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:38,263
[SPEAKER_17]: That's, that's the point.

379
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:42,206
[SPEAKER_17]: So at every one of those points where you have to stop and say, well, where do I go now?

380
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,008
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be some direction there as to what you can do.

381
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:54,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just for safety reasons, obviously, and efficiency for pedestrians, I think that's necessary, and for drivers, obviously.

382
00:33:56,181 --> 00:34:06,807
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question, just with regards to the Route 16 West off-ramp, when will that be closed, and is that going to be closed for the full three years?

383
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,675
[SPEAKER_17]: It is closed now as of Monday morning, it was closed.

384
00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:19,579
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, right through till phase five when we take the temporary bridge out, it's three years.

385
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:27,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be closed for the full three years till September 2018?

386
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:28,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

387
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:36,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there ever, it doesn't look like it, but is there ever gonna be

388
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:42,785
[SPEAKER_03]: a situation where traffic is completely closed down at all on Main Street?

389
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:46,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Not that I'm aware of.

390
00:34:46,346 --> 00:35:05,050
[SPEAKER_17]: It's part of our mandate to keep two lanes of travel, north and south on Main Street, except for small windows at midday, between 9.30 and 2, I believe, where we can actually take a lane and cut it down to one lane of traffic when there's not much traffic out there.

391
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:10,693
[SPEAKER_17]: work to do in what we've designated as travel lanes.

392
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:12,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from 930 to 2.

393
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:15,897
[SPEAKER_03]: One could possibly go down to one lane in each direction, you mean?

394
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:18,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, and that's already happened out there.

395
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:24,703
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done that, and we've actually done pretty well in conjunction with the police department.

396
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:26,084
[SPEAKER_17]: They've been great.

397
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:30,608
[SPEAKER_17]: They know how to handle the traffic around the square, and they've been really helpful.

398
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,703
[SPEAKER_03]: With regards to equipment storage, is that always going to be in your work zone?

399
00:35:38,284 --> 00:35:44,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you ever have equipment being stored on the sidewalks or any other location besides the work zone?

400
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Our equipment will be in our work zones.

401
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:56,454
[SPEAKER_17]: If we have to get out in the middle of the street, we'll do a lane closure within those acceptable times.

402
00:35:57,595 --> 00:35:59,116
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have

403
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:03,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Our lay down area is the closed ramp.

404
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:07,907
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll keep equipment there.

405
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:22,538
[SPEAKER_17]: And once we get the temp bridge in, when we close one side of the bridge, and there won't be any traffic, there won't be any pedestrians, there'll be overnight equipment stored there as well.

406
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:27,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only time it may be somewhere on the work area is from that 9.30 to 2?

407
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:41,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's always, if we're out there, we have police details with us, and we have the protection of barrels and signs and indications to the traveling public that we're out on the road working.

408
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:52,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one of my last questions is, you mentioned the structural engineers are going to go put in a few type of monitoring devices.

409
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:58,478
[SPEAKER_03]: How far of a range, how many feet around the actual

410
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:00,623
[SPEAKER_03]: construction zone will that take place?

411
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:05,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get into the homes or is it mainly just the businesses very local to the construction?

412
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:20,175
[SPEAKER_17]: The plan calls for us to actually monitor the two buildings that are right on either side of the north abutment plus the river wall, that those two buildings sit on top of.

413
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:25,318
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to monitor that structure plus the two buildings.

414
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:27,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are,

415
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:34,333
[SPEAKER_17]: are the critical structures, and those are the ones that the department picked out for us to monitor.

416
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so that's the only thing that will be monitored, those two buildings?

417
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:46,478
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll also be monitoring the MWRA sewer, which runs right down the ramp there on the westbound ramp.

418
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:54,221
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a large diameter sewer line that runs down through there, and we have to monitor that, too.

419
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that process of

420
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:13,611
[SPEAKER_03]: filling out the reports before the actual construction takes place, the monitoring, and the work the structural engineer is going to do, that we obviously taking reports and taking pitches of those two buildings to make sure there's no issues?

421
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:14,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

422
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:17,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, we need the building owner's permission.

423
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:19,154
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't enter without his permission.

424
00:38:19,774 --> 00:38:22,996
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is kind of a whole separate story.

425
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:26,578
[SPEAKER_17]: But with their permission, we go in and document

426
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:31,586
[SPEAKER_17]: the condition of the inside of the building and the outside of the building.

427
00:38:33,286 --> 00:38:33,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

428
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:38,808
[SPEAKER_09]: A few questions.

429
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there was a discussion early on dating back maybe some two years ago talking about the sewer line from the bridge to the square.

430
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a sewer line from the bridge to the square?

431
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:55,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Not that I'm aware of.

432
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:56,049
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not aware of it?

433
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,613
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe there's one in the street that stops prior to the bridge.

434
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:01,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Prior to the bridge?

435
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:02,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

436
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,536
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's nothing that goes across the bridge.

437
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:04,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

438
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Second question basically was, coming over the bridge, there was talk about putting a light at the intersection right there where you could take a left to go up to High Street.

439
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:17,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any further discussion on that?

440
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,451
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, moving the traffic.

441
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:24,614
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be a temporary one there.

442
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:25,054
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

443
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:26,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about a traffic light.

444
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:26,916
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

445
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:30,218
[SPEAKER_17]: But during the course of construction, there's going to be temporary traffic.

446
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:33,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there going to be a traffic light that's going to take a left on High Street?

447
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,943
[SPEAKER_28]: At the final build, I don't believe so, no.

448
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:41,967
[SPEAKER_28]: The temporary traffic signal, there will be a signal there just during construction.

449
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:44,529
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's going to go back to a flash signal.

450
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:45,390
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is this.

451
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,191
[SPEAKER_09]: You go over the bridge.

452
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can go right into the square.

453
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:54,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Go straight, or can you take a left to go up High Street without having to go all the way around?

454
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,568
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one of the concerns.

455
00:39:57,588 --> 00:39:59,748
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't believe that's going to be addressed as part of this project.

456
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:00,229
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not?

457
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:01,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

458
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:11,392
[SPEAKER_09]: You indicated your reconstruction project goals, opportunity to upgrade existing utilities over the bridge.

459
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:13,113
[SPEAKER_09]: How and what are they?

460
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:15,534
[SPEAKER_09]: What are these upgradings you're going to be giving?

461
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:22,712
[SPEAKER_28]: fiber optic lines, telephone lines, they'll all be new services.

462
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:26,674
[SPEAKER_28]: Water lines, all those utilities will be.

463
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:30,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying that all these utilities are going to be upgrading a long overdue?

464
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:31,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what we're saying?

465
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I mean, it would be nice.

466
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these are questions I'd like to know.

467
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:36,858
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

468
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:37,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

469
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:41,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know when the first time was when this whole issue on the Craddock bridge came about?

470
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not present.

471
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:46,762
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in 2002 and it was offered by council long ago regarding

472
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:49,383
[SPEAKER_09]: the safety and the concerns of the Karatek Bridge.

473
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:49,923
[SPEAKER_09]: This is now 2015.

474
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:59,007
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a long time to wait about all these concerns, if safety is an issue as it was back then.

475
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:09,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to... You talked about under construction on the traffic management plan, you talked about accommodating traffic, pedestrian and buses.

476
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:13,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And you indicated, quote, it looks like it's going to go underneath the bridge.

477
00:41:13,794 --> 00:41:15,575
[SPEAKER_09]: You folks have no control over bus routes.

478
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,323
[SPEAKER_09]: This Medford City Council controls where the bus routes go.

479
00:41:19,404 --> 00:41:24,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's something that really needs to be considered, because this council has maybe different ideas, maybe the same.

480
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:44,518
[SPEAKER_09]: But to say that you're going to put it underneath the bridge, where a lot of seniors at 99 and 121 now will have to not only walk down to that ring road and then cross over the bridge to get to it, it would be a lot closer and easier for them if they went to Medford Square and they put it temporarily on River Street, turn that into a one-way.

481
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:55,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's nothing more than a three-and-a-half-minute change in a route that accommodates the people, when, in fact, your construction is completely disrupting the entire business community.

482
00:41:56,607 --> 00:42:00,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not believe the temporary relocation has been finalized yet.

483
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:03,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we had asked for someone from the MBTA to be here tonight.

484
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there somebody in the audience from the MBTA here?

485
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any reason why that was not communicated to them?

486
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:12,941
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an important part.

487
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:14,982
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very important part of this project.

488
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:16,522
[SPEAKER_09]: The bus route.

489
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:22,883
[SPEAKER_09]: It accommodates, according to your information here tonight, 300 bus trips a day go through Medford Square.

490
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:24,123
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awful lot.

491
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:30,764
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awful lot of people that need to take a bus to get to work or go to whatever they need to do during the course of a day.

492
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:33,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are options out there.

493
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:39,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wouldn't want anyone in this room to think, and anyone who might be watching, that you folks are going to change that bus route, because you're not.

494
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:46,021
[SPEAKER_09]: This Medford City Council will make the recommendation to the MBTA, because we're the only ones that have the power to make and change bus routes.

495
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:51,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would hope that you go back and you review that as a very serious component.

496
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:59,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, talk about, and this is really mind-boggling.

497
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,752
[SPEAKER_09]: We can go back to 2011 when you said the project was gonna cost 2.5 million.

498
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:04,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Then in 2012, it jumped to 8.5 million.

499
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:13,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Then in April of 2013, it jumps to $12.7 million.

500
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:17,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Then in June of 2013, it goes down to $10.7 million.

501
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:20,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And now here we are in June 2015.

502
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:22,777
[SPEAKER_09]: It's approximately $11 million.

503
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:25,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody know what the real number is?

504
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:28,818
[SPEAKER_09]: The bid price is $11 million.

505
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:30,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the bid price.

506
00:43:30,198 --> 00:43:30,678
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

507
00:43:30,698 --> 00:43:34,739
[SPEAKER_09]: So all this in the interim from 2006 coming forward was just speculation.

508
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:35,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were estimates.

509
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:36,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Estimates.

510
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hell of a jump in estimates from 2006

511
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,580
[SPEAKER_09]: $2.5 to almost $11 million.

512
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:43,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big change.

513
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:47,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, one of the concerns, and I believe you're the contractor, correct?

514
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,224
[SPEAKER_09]: You are, but I mean, he's the contractor.

515
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:58,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Has there been any discussion about mitigation here for any damages or anything to help and offset the business community that might be affected by this?

516
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Has mitigation been discussed with either one of you or through the Department of Transportation?

517
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,473
[SPEAKER_28]: I know nothing of any of those discussions.

518
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:08,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you, sir, know anything about this?

519
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:15,247
[SPEAKER_17]: When I get the documents, I bid on the documents that I'm given.

520
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:19,049
[SPEAKER_17]: If it had required me to offer mitigation, I would have.

521
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you please speak into my microphone?

522
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:28,155
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a requirement of my specification to provide that.

523
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:33,658
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would have to say no.

524
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying a project at this scale of $11 million that's going to disrupt

525
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:55,106
[SPEAKER_09]: tie up the city of MidFitness downtown area for approximately three years, and nobody's going to have any empathy, so to speak, toward any type of business or any one business or multiple business that might be either disrupted or put out of business because of this.

526
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,685
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a great deal of empathy for the people.

527
00:44:57,805 --> 00:44:59,886
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a great deal of empathy for the people.

528
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:00,886
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's no mitigation.

529
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:05,348
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done it for many, many years, pretty successfully.

530
00:45:05,688 --> 00:45:07,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Sir, we're talking about three years.

531
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:08,709
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't a one year project.

532
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:09,810
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about three years.

533
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

534
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,111
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a long period of time.

535
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:13,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

536
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:18,033
[SPEAKER_09]: You also indicated that you clean up after the fact.

537
00:45:18,053 --> 00:45:22,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was Councilman Mox who asked a question about dirt and dust and disruption and this and that.

538
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:26,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you folks been before the city's Conservation Commission?

539
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:28,940
[SPEAKER_17]: They were out on the job today, yes.

540
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon me?

541
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,040
[SPEAKER_17]: They were on the project today.

542
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:31,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Today?

543
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

544
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:48,785
[SPEAKER_09]: But when other businesses have been working in abutting the Karatek Bridge, straight down the river, they had to go to the Conservation Commission first to be told how and what their construction would be and the effect it would have on the river itself.

545
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Those permits were already

546
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,842
[SPEAKER_17]: in place when I did the job.

547
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:58,203
[SPEAKER_17]: They were part of my contract documents and I have the duty to follow them.

548
00:45:58,583 --> 00:45:58,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

549
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:13,547
[SPEAKER_09]: But while the construction has been taking place so far, nothing has been, you folks or whoever you're employing have done nothing the same as other businesses that had to make sure that anything that fell off the building, any dirt or any rubbish or anything did not go into that, did not go into that river.

550
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:15,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It has not taken place yet.

551
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I disagree.

552
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I disagree completely.

553
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:22,768
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to know what's going on on the job.

554
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:23,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Pardon me?

555
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:26,450
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to know what's going on on the job before you make statements like that.

556
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,310
[SPEAKER_17]: I see it every day, sir.

557
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I see it every day.

558
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:32,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you should have been there this morning when the Conservation Commission came.

559
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:33,332
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've been there before this morning.

560
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:35,113
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been working there before this morning, sir.

561
00:46:35,553 --> 00:46:38,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and we made the appointment long ago.

562
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:40,214
[SPEAKER_17]: They made their visit today.

563
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Today is when they first came.

564
00:46:43,656 --> 00:46:47,417
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have done this before, when you first got the job and you was first awarded.

565
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:57,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And you should have known the rules and regulations were on any type of work that abuts that river, that affects the birds and the fish that are in there.

566
00:46:58,198 --> 00:47:04,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, last weekend, there was tons of fish that were dead in that water after your work took place.

567
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:04,823
[SPEAKER_17]: The President Oh, I — please.

568
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:07,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Secretary Nielsen Well, don't tell me please.

569
00:47:08,686 --> 00:47:10,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Second of all — and lastly, Mr. President,

570
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,549
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to stand here and be insulted anymore.

571
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you don't have to be insulted.

572
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:16,511
[SPEAKER_17]: This is insulting.

573
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:17,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sorry, sir.

574
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:19,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you what I'm saying.

575
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:20,795
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you telling me I'm not seeing it correctly?

576
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:21,295
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you're insulting.

577
00:47:21,615 --> 00:47:23,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think you're insulting too, OK?

578
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:27,220
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't stand here, if you can't stand here and answer the questions.

579
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:28,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor, thank you.

580
00:47:29,062 --> 00:47:29,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

581
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:31,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, one last question, and that's this.

582
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:34,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe you can answer it or someone from the Department of Transportation can answer it.

583
00:47:36,148 --> 00:47:38,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you explain why it's taken almost three years to do 121 feet?

584
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,429
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't speak for the past three years, sir.

585
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:48,270
[SPEAKER_28]: We just had an NTP that came out a couple of months ago.

586
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,550
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the bridge is only 121 feet.

587
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:50,010
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

588
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And to do three years for what you're saying.

589
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:53,711
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I'm sorry.

590
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,232
[SPEAKER_28]: Why the project's going to take three years?

591
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I think he walked through it.

592
00:47:57,352 --> 00:48:06,995
[SPEAKER_28]: It's very, believe it or not, in that three-year time period, it is a very compressed schedule, believe it or not, the way that the work has to be sequenced.

593
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:10,396
[SPEAKER_28]: As he said earlier, because the in-water restriction

594
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,621
[SPEAKER_28]: During each phase, we can only work on one pier at a time.

595
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:24,363
[SPEAKER_28]: So we got to build one pier, pull that coffer dam, then we got to wait until the next in-water window, and we can start the next pier.

596
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:32,924
[SPEAKER_28]: That's two years right there to do two piers, where normally we could do both during one phase, we could do both at the same time.

597
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:35,985
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we have the utility work to work around,

598
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,232
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, it's going to be hard to meet that schedule, even with the three years on this small bridge.

599
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:45,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just like to make one last comment, Mr. President.

600
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:47,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the fact that you folks are here.

601
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:53,817
[SPEAKER_09]: But this council has asked for a long period of time to be updated as to where we're going on this.

602
00:48:54,577 --> 00:48:58,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's unfortunate that you've started the job, and now we're getting the information after the fact.

603
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:00,819
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do appreciate the fact that you're here.

604
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you hear what all the concerns might be — public safety, road,

605
00:49:05,498 --> 00:49:08,159
[SPEAKER_09]: displacement, business displacement, if in fact that be the case.

606
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:17,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the gentleman that walked away from the podium is insulted, I apologize, but I'm not apologizing for my comments because my comments are what I've seen and heard.

607
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:23,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So with all due respect to that gentleman, I don't know what to say to you because I would have never walked away from a podium.

608
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:27,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

609
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

610
00:49:30,352 --> 00:49:30,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

611
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:38,012
[SPEAKER_15]: My first question is, is there going to be the temporary construction trailer up where people can actually take a look at the plans?

612
00:49:38,072 --> 00:49:40,553
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's people at home now that couldn't be here this evening.

613
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:41,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you plan on doing that or not?

614
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:45,275
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't speak for the contractor, and he's set out the trailer.

615
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,197
[SPEAKER_28]: But if anybody wants to make plans available, you can contact us.

616
00:49:49,997 --> 00:49:51,598
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll make plans available to review.

617
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:52,599
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, not just the plans.

618
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,379
[SPEAKER_28]: Either just ask us with the department.

619
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,380
[SPEAKER_28]: We can make plans available to whoever.

620
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you talk into the microphone?

621
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:00,745
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an office just off the square.

622
00:50:02,407 --> 00:50:03,849
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll send you the address.

623
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:07,553
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's very close by.

624
00:50:08,094 --> 00:50:09,876
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where my staff is going to be.

625
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:15,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So if anyone needs to go find them, typically they'll find them on the job.

626
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:19,633
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give you the address to our office.

627
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:20,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

628
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:22,636
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have an office phone number there too with an answering machine.

629
00:50:23,276 --> 00:50:23,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

630
00:50:24,117 --> 00:50:25,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Forward all that information to you.

631
00:50:25,538 --> 00:50:32,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, uh, I've taken upon myself to go to other communities that similar projects were done to see what the impact was on the downtown area.

632
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:36,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, one in particular was the town of Winchester, uh, similar project.

633
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:38,709
[SPEAKER_15]: And it took about two and a half, three years.

634
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:47,576
[SPEAKER_15]: And it got cut down to one lane, most of the, um, project and, uh, the businesses, other than the fact that it was a pain in the neck to traverse the area,

635
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,128
[SPEAKER_15]: with police detail, stopping the traffic, that one.

636
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:55,230
[SPEAKER_15]: They said as far as the impact on their businesses, they really didn't see much.

637
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the ones that I happened to talk to.

638
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:04,114
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, are there any projects that you've done similar to this one in the general vicinity?

639
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:11,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably the last one that we did that involved a great deal of interface with businesses was

640
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:28,521
[SPEAKER_17]: We reconstructed almost a mile of a cushioned avenue in New Bedford and that street is lined on both sides with restaurants, businesses, a lot of local bars.

641
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:29,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

642
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:37,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the second thing, um, I have a question about is the, uh, the maritime conditions and the locks and things of that nature because, um,

643
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:45,197
[SPEAKER_15]: The boating community is concerned about the locks being opened and manipulated for this project.

644
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:50,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know if there's going to be an impact on the riverway, as far as that goes?

645
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,059
[SPEAKER_17]: The locks are no longer in operation.

646
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,420
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not the locks here, but the Amelia Earhart Dam.

647
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the water level going to stay the same and everything, or are they going to?

648
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:00,501
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the plan.

649
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:05,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, they control, certainly, the level.

650
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:08,023
[SPEAKER_17]: I will tell you that

651
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:22,092
[SPEAKER_17]: It mentions in our permit that the increased flow that's created by our demolition work is going to require a new pump down at the dam so they can handle the additional volume.

652
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:22,952
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

653
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:25,014
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's already been thought through.

654
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:26,935
[SPEAKER_15]: And that leads up to my next question.

655
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:32,280
[SPEAKER_15]: The DCI vote can certainly help out your cause by slowing the flow up at the upper and mystic

656
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:34,923
[SPEAKER_15]: lakes because that's brand new.

657
00:52:35,424 --> 00:52:37,045
[SPEAKER_15]: It was done over in the past few years.

658
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:40,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Members of the DOT that are here, I'm sure, are familiar with that project.

659
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,429
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's actually good that that was done.

660
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:49,674
[SPEAKER_15]: And interesting enough, the Winchester Bridge was a result of some of their downtown flooding problems as well.

661
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:55,538
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot of moving parts to this whole project that we don't necessarily see.

662
00:52:56,148 --> 00:53:08,052
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing is I'm confident that the direct abutters will be appropriately represented given the fact that you're putting the monitoring systems in.

663
00:53:08,593 --> 00:53:19,157
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would hope that they all take part in it and have an independent insurance person take a look at their conditions prior to this process starting.

664
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:22,818
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but not least, Councilor Pentland hit on it a little bit.

665
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:26,163
[SPEAKER_15]: but the environmental impact on the river.

666
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:27,884
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of stuff.

667
00:53:28,064 --> 00:53:30,825
[SPEAKER_15]: As you said, the city has water lines under there.

668
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:36,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there going to be any negative environmental impact during demolition?

669
00:53:36,988 --> 00:53:42,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there going to be booms set up and everything that contain everything right there, or netting under the bridge that's going to catch stuff?

670
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,450
[SPEAKER_15]: What's in plans?

671
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:49,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, all of those things for each pier that we demolish.

672
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:57,047
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be a steel sheeting cofferdam around it, along with containment curtains.

673
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:06,913
[SPEAKER_17]: When we do the decks, we have to put shielding under the bridge to catch anything that may fall.

674
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:14,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Now the demolition's going to consist of actually saw cutting the bridge in big sections, lifting it out with a crane.

675
00:54:14,778 --> 00:54:16,339
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not going to be normal.

676
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:20,937
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, demolition where you break the whole thing up and just let it fall.

677
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, you can't, otherwise the bridge will be gone.

678
00:54:23,078 --> 00:54:27,921
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to lift these large pieces right out and set them on a truck and take them away.

679
00:54:28,522 --> 00:54:28,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

680
00:54:29,262 --> 00:54:34,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And at any time does this job call for a barge under there as well to either rebuild or demo?

681
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:45,131
[SPEAKER_17]: There may be, but it's probably more likely just small floats for men to work from.

682
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:50,994
[SPEAKER_17]: barges get a little ungainly in a small river like this.

683
00:54:52,014 --> 00:54:53,755
[SPEAKER_15]: My last question is just to follow up on that.

684
00:54:54,476 --> 00:55:04,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, from the drawings and the research that I've done with this particular project, going under the bridge there, it actually looks like it's going to be a lot better.

685
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:07,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Naturally, it's going to be more aesthetically pleasing.

686
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:17,346
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's going to be more open and voluminous when you're on the west side of the bridge looking down river towards Medford Square.

687
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:21,328
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually going to improve the image in the sites.

688
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:28,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that's a very, that's a big area where a lot of people throughout the community utilize to take pictures, whether it's wedding pictures, this, this, this and that type thing.

689
00:55:28,632 --> 00:55:31,594
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, it's more open right now.

690
00:55:31,674 --> 00:55:33,895
[SPEAKER_15]: People that haven't seen it or been up close.

691
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:37,510
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only a small area where boats go through and everything else.

692
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:45,094
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be like the Longfellow Bridge almost, but much smaller, naturally, the arches.

693
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:50,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, in a sense, the west side of the bridge is going to look a lot more like the east side of the bridge.

694
00:55:51,537 --> 00:55:51,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

695
00:55:52,117 --> 00:55:54,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Two arches and a rectangular opening.

696
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:55,099
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

697
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:00,742
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but not least, I know this is very nerve-wracking for residents.

698
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:02,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the traffic the last two days has been

699
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:06,647
[SPEAKER_15]: very bad, but that was because of the Winthrop Street project going on.

700
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:10,610
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because, um, this project that's, that's just getting underway.

701
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:20,840
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um, I, I tried to look back to some of the complaints, um, that the city received years ago when they did the route 16 bridge over down near metal Glen mall.

702
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:27,386
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was a bigger bridge and, um, it actually took, uh, took a substantial amount of time.

703
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:28,928
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, overall,

704
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:39,479
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't directly in the business community, but it was close enough that it could have an adverse effect on the Metal Glym Mall and Century at the time, and Mystic Valley Tower was north.

705
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,901
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was pretty good overall.

706
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:48,623
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the Department of Transportation slash DCR joint venture at the time.

707
00:56:49,124 --> 00:56:57,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm confident that if we all work together that this can be done, and it has to be done.

708
00:56:57,387 --> 00:56:58,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the part that

709
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:01,854
[SPEAKER_15]: people are failing to realize throughout the square and throughout the community.

710
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:06,016
[SPEAKER_15]: If this doesn't happen now, the price is just going to go up.

711
00:57:06,476 --> 00:57:12,159
[SPEAKER_15]: And inevitably, there could be someone resulting in injury or fatality down there.

712
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:19,342
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, when they're putting up yellow caution tape for people not to walk over a bridge, something has to be done or cordoning off certain areas of a bridge.

713
00:57:21,102 --> 00:57:26,945
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is being done for public safety and no other reason, quite honestly, because I know the state wouldn't want to be spending the money either.

714
00:57:27,558 --> 00:57:29,279
[SPEAKER_15]: if it didn't need to be done.

715
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:34,940
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want to thank you for your presentation and look forward to working with you on this project.

716
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:36,161
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

717
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Musso.

718
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:38,722
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

719
00:57:39,682 --> 00:57:41,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

720
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:49,805
[SPEAKER_26]: In terms of the traffic mitigation plan that took place, first of all, I'm hoping that you'd be able to provide the Council with a copy of the traffic mitigation plan.

721
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:57,672
[SPEAKER_26]: And secondly, is there any retiming of the lights that's going to be conducted or performed so that we can ensure the free flow of traffic through these detoured areas?

722
00:57:58,773 --> 00:58:00,653
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, today has been pretty rough.

723
00:58:00,713 --> 00:58:04,175
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know it's a new thing that people are going to have to get used to.

724
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:10,917
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that once people realize Route 16 is closed, they're going to get off at Route 60 or they're not going to try to go the detour route.

725
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:19,421
[SPEAKER_26]: But in terms of retiming of the signals, is there any type of discussion or documentation that we can take a look at to see what you guys are doing in that regard?

726
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:28,357
[SPEAKER_28]: we're putting in a temporary traffic signal as part of the project.

727
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:35,884
[SPEAKER_27]: But in terms of Forest Street, Riverside Ave, Salem Street, because this is our center of town, this is our hub, so most of the main roads.

728
00:58:36,144 --> 00:58:43,470
[SPEAKER_28]: That's presently not part of the project, but if we can do any minor adjustments to timing, we'll certainly look at that.

729
00:58:45,953 --> 00:58:46,213
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

730
00:58:58,238 --> 00:58:58,919
[SPEAKER_26]: I rest, Mr. President.

731
00:58:59,379 --> 00:58:59,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

732
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:00,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

733
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Karafiello.

734
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:03,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

735
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:24,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Touching on what Councilor Knight just mentioned, for the foreseeable, for the near future right now, I'd like to see some more state police presence, at least on Route 93, because you're seeing cars that are now backing up off of Route 16, off the ramp there to get off, because they're getting on, they're seeing this traffic.

736
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw multiple cars doing that today.

737
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:33,461
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not saying forever, but maybe for a couple of weeks, a little extra police presence there.

738
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:40,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Route 16 side, over by where Route 16 goes into Mystic Avenue at that end.

739
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:44,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be posting a state police detail.

740
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:47,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially on the 93 side.

741
00:59:47,548 --> 00:59:54,231
[SPEAKER_04]: The last couple of nights, until people actually get used to it, cars have been backing up back onto the highway.

742
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:57,613
[SPEAKER_28]: We have to take a look at locations when and where, but anywhere that we could.

743
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:06,318
[SPEAKER_28]: do something for, like you say, a few weeks to help traffic adjust to the traffic pattern, we'll certainly do that.

744
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And my last question is, in the event there's a question of damage of the property, is there a vehicle in place between your company and the owner to get it done on a quick basis?

745
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the owner of the building says something is happening and your guy says nothing is happening,

746
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:32,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a vehicle in place to mediate?

747
01:00:35,453 --> 01:00:37,034
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you speak into your microphone, please?

748
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,778
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the reason why we have our inspection and monitoring program.

749
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:49,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what I'm asking is, say my guy comes in and disagrees with your people on damage.

750
01:00:49,763 --> 01:00:54,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a vehicle in place to help the business owner or the property owner?

751
01:00:56,974 --> 01:01:11,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, if the owner of the property goes out and hires their own person and they disagree with a damage that's caused, do you have a vehicle in place to resolve the damage problem or the question?

752
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:23,765
[SPEAKER_17]: If we do cause damage, that's why we carry

753
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:28,026
[SPEAKER_17]: heavy limits on liability insurance.

754
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:38,534
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what that's for, and it's why we want to establish a baseline, so that we know exactly what those structures look like when we start it.

755
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:43,738
[SPEAKER_17]: So it should be very easy to determine that, oh, this happened.

756
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:51,079
[SPEAKER_28]: It is in the contract that the insurance is provided by the contractor.

757
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:52,240
[SPEAKER_28]: He has to have it bonded.

758
01:01:52,440 --> 01:02:00,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And there will be regular meetings with the people, the building owners, that are immediately impacted?

759
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,944
[SPEAKER_28]: They've been reaching out to the building owners, and they'll continue to do so.

760
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:09,906
[SPEAKER_28]: If there's any claims that can't be resolved, just bring them to the department, and we'll make sure that they are.

761
01:02:09,946 --> 01:02:10,106
[SPEAKER_28]: OK.

762
01:02:11,267 --> 01:02:11,547
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

763
01:02:13,968 --> 01:02:14,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

764
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,773
[SPEAKER_24]: There are some citizens that wish to ask questions.

765
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:25,977
[SPEAKER_24]: We remind you to address your questions to the chair and that the representatives will answer them the best they can.

766
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:28,559
[SPEAKER_24]: And please state your name and address for the record.

767
01:02:28,659 --> 01:02:32,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. William Wood, 25 Bussell Road in Indiana.

768
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:35,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we aren't in Indiana anymore.

769
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:36,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford, downtown.

770
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:47,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people know when I come to the, oh, by the way, I wanted to also say, I'm not here to insult you either, and I talk awful loud because I'm deaf.

771
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:52,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope to God you don't walk away from me.

772
01:02:55,859 --> 01:03:00,781
[SPEAKER_11]: My questions are more on the issue that I bring up over and over.

773
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:03,946
[SPEAKER_11]: The disability issue.

774
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I heard a lot of signage.

775
01:03:06,928 --> 01:03:08,470
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're blind, you can't read it.

776
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:17,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard that you have some kind of cost or mediation.

777
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:19,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard them say that through the president, I'm saying.

778
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'm saying that I heard this.

779
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:27,706
[SPEAKER_11]: But I didn't hear whether there was a pedestrian insurance.

780
01:03:28,526 --> 01:03:41,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when you put blind people in a walkway where there's no way they can move, or someone with a cane and there's a piece of stuff and they may not be able to see it, or someone with a walker.

781
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:48,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And especially if they're trying to get to the bus station,

782
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:58,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if they want to go eat from the other side of the bridge to the other side of the bridge, they might fall down.

783
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:01,647
[SPEAKER_11]: That means they might get hurt.

784
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:14,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm suggesting strongly, Mr. President, they answer the question, is there pedestrian insurance, at least for the disabled community?

785
01:04:15,282 --> 01:04:22,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And is there going to be, other than signage, which, by the way, I'm proud to hear that they're putting signage.

786
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:32,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And DOT someday can answer the question of why there's not enough signage in Massachusetts, so we who live here can find out where we're going.

787
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,323
[SPEAKER_11]: This signage is not the only thing.

788
01:04:37,843 --> 01:04:44,085
[SPEAKER_11]: If you all remember, and I think one of our illustrious city councilors, Ms.

789
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:55,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Lunger, was on that committee at the time that put in the walk, the signs that said walk, walk, and then went tweet, tweet, tweet in Medford Square.

790
01:04:56,669 --> 01:05:01,311
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually did something that a lot of people had never thought about.

791
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:03,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're saying we're going to put signs

792
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:10,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I will caution you that there are ways to do that.

793
01:05:10,422 --> 01:05:17,064
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to direct people who are blind or have walkers and stuff like that.

794
01:05:17,464 --> 01:05:21,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one of the ways is also have somebody out there watching it.

795
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:30,367
[SPEAKER_11]: But a better way is to build it into the temporary walkways so that it can, and then into the regular walkways.

796
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:43,336
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're talking about building walkways that are for bicycles, but you're not talking about building walkways for blind people, for people who have to use canes.

797
01:05:44,877 --> 01:05:47,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think somebody should answer these questions.

798
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

799
01:05:49,581 --> 01:05:54,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Does anybody have from the group some information?

800
01:05:54,424 --> 01:05:58,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a dark question, not a developed answer.

801
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,168
[SPEAKER_28]: It's difficult.

802
01:06:00,178 --> 01:06:01,718
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a few questions presented.

803
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:08,360
[SPEAKER_28]: All I can say is that the project will be, the limits of work will be fully ADA compliant when we're complete.

804
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:19,523
[SPEAKER_28]: During the interim condition, it is admittedly difficult at times when you're demolishing portions of sidewalk, et cetera.

805
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,744
[SPEAKER_28]: But the final condition will be fully ADA compliant.

806
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,701
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two types of fully ADA compliance.

807
01:06:29,001 --> 01:06:33,323
[SPEAKER_11]: There's what's called the minimum, which does legally, that's all they have to do.

808
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:46,827
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't protect the blind person who's trying to work, or the person with a cane, or the person who's trying to walk over there from the 99, which is the elderly project.

809
01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:48,828
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's maximum.

810
01:06:50,162 --> 01:07:00,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. President, DOT has done, and I have been on DOT's argument side, arguing with them about most of the time they do minimum.

811
01:07:01,171 --> 01:07:03,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Minimum standard is ridiculous.

812
01:07:03,893 --> 01:07:13,281
[SPEAKER_11]: The Attorney General has made, and the President of the United States, and the Congress of the United States' intent was not to do minimum standard.

813
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:18,725
[SPEAKER_11]: It was to do maximum standard so that all disabled people are helped.

814
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:33,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Disabled vets, that means people who can see well but can't hear, and it also means people who can't read and stuff like that.

815
01:07:34,102 --> 01:07:42,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to see you, the council go on record as saying you support that DOT consider strongly

816
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:50,507
[SPEAKER_11]: putting in maximum standards so that all disabled people are equal in this city.

817
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:51,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

818
01:07:52,308 --> 01:07:53,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much, Doctor.

819
01:07:53,389 --> 01:07:57,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

820
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

821
01:07:59,132 --> 01:08:01,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Bob Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

822
01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:06,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I got just two brief questions and then a brief statement.

823
01:08:06,577 --> 01:08:10,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, my first question revolves around this temporary bridge

824
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:15,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know the safety of its construction, what its weight capacity is.

825
01:08:15,247 --> 01:08:17,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we just had a winter and nine feet of snow.

826
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:19,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it plowable?

827
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,332
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the tonnage it can take?

828
01:08:22,112 --> 01:08:28,338
[SPEAKER_07]: My second question, Councilor Caraviello and Knight touched on it, is police.

829
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:33,302
[SPEAKER_07]: How many Medford police are going to be used over the course of these three years?

830
01:08:33,802 --> 01:08:39,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as we know, we have a shortage of staff in the police force.

831
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:41,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe Chief Sackle can answer.

832
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw him in the audience tonight.

833
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:51,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there going to be any attempts from this council or the mayor's administration to maybe even hire more police?

834
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:56,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, I mean, I'm 45 years old next month.

835
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:01,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Grew up my whole life in Massachusetts without bringing up the big dig.

836
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:08,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've seen now the estimates of costs go from $2.5 million to $11 million.

837
01:09:08,504 --> 01:09:20,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what assurances are we the citizens and the taxpayers and the businesses that are going to be sharply affected that there's not going to be cost overrides, another big winter of snow.

838
01:09:20,627 --> 01:09:23,508
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going from three years now to four, to maybe five.

839
01:09:23,988 --> 01:09:28,869
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, and with all due respect, I want to thank these folks for coming here with this presentation.

840
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:31,090
[SPEAKER_07]: But you elected city councilors.

841
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:33,046
[SPEAKER_07]: are the representatives of Medford.

842
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:33,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You're our voice.

843
01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:42,070
[SPEAKER_07]: If some of these questions are too tough and you get offended by them, well, these are the taxpayer dollars.

844
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:45,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And quite frankly, if you get offended by these questions, I'm sorry.

845
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:48,233
[SPEAKER_07]: With all due respect, that's just too bad.

846
01:09:48,653 --> 01:09:51,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should please stay and answer these questions.

847
01:09:51,574 --> 01:09:52,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

848
01:09:59,649 --> 01:10:19,514
[SPEAKER_17]: In answer to his first question about the temporary bridge It will be it is being designed to carry HS 20 loading which is normal traffic loading includes trucks buses Everything that rides up and down the road.

849
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:22,614
[SPEAKER_17]: It will carry a full complement of two lanes.

850
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:25,615
[SPEAKER_17]: It's certainly plowable and

851
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:30,726
[SPEAKER_17]: They're used extensively throughout the state successfully.

852
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:40,135
[SPEAKER_17]: So although it's temporary, it's constructed to the same set of standards that a permanent bridge would be.

853
01:10:42,017 --> 01:10:42,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

854
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:47,943
[SPEAKER_28]: What was the second part?

855
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:48,924
[SPEAKER_28]: How many pulleys?

856
01:10:49,804 --> 01:10:52,287
[SPEAKER_28]: How many of your averages?

857
01:10:53,421 --> 01:11:02,183
[SPEAKER_24]: Typically, these details regarding police details on construction projects like this are worked out in preliminary phases with the input of the police chief.

858
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:07,964
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we'll allow the chief to address the matter.

859
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Leo Sacco, 227 Elm Street in Medford, chief of police.

860
01:11:12,405 --> 01:11:17,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding the details, the company and MassDOT have been very good to work with.

861
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:21,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had various numbers of police details

862
01:11:22,255 --> 01:11:26,356
[SPEAKER_06]: during the course of each day, depending on the nature of all the work that's going on in that area.

863
01:11:26,896 --> 01:11:30,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Today was a particularly difficult day.

864
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:32,037
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of projects going on in the city.

865
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:43,700
[SPEAKER_06]: We had probably 10 or 12 offices on the Winthrop Street paving project that went the whole stretch from Route 16 up to Lawrence Road, including the rotary.

866
01:11:44,627 --> 01:11:49,691
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a number of offices tied up on that, but we did have out-of-town offices assisting us on details.

867
01:11:50,232 --> 01:11:51,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're short on personnel.

868
01:11:51,933 --> 01:12:00,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the process of attempting to hire seven, but we won't have the benefit of those offices until the middle of next year.

869
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:03,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a work in progress.

870
01:12:03,622 --> 01:12:10,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as this project goes on, the continued good working relationship with the company and with MassDOT, we'll have

871
01:12:11,205 --> 01:12:14,987
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever we need out there for offices, depending on the nature of work that's going on.

872
01:12:15,007 --> 01:12:21,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that, again, it's a situation where people just have to be patient.

873
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:23,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's traffic.

874
01:12:23,112 --> 01:12:24,733
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter where you go, there's traffic.

875
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:28,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You drive in Everett, you drive in Somerville, there is just a lot of traffic.

876
01:12:30,256 --> 01:12:34,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And now with the construction, I think it's a great thing that that Route 16 ramp is closed.

877
01:12:34,378 --> 01:12:37,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I was one of the proponents for that from the very beginning.

878
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:46,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And when that ramp does open up three years from now, I hope no trucks or buses are allowed to make that turn into Medford Square, because it is listed as a truck route.

879
01:12:46,835 --> 01:12:50,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's absolutely absurd to have that.

880
01:12:50,436 --> 01:12:54,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think as we go along, we'll see greater improvements.

881
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:55,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

882
01:12:56,577 --> 01:12:57,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chief.

883
01:12:57,118 --> 01:12:58,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chief.

884
01:12:58,718 --> 01:12:58,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

885
01:12:58,838 --> 01:13:00,358
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

886
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:01,659
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is Michael Otero.

887
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,159
[SPEAKER_36]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

888
01:13:04,099 --> 01:13:06,880
[SPEAKER_36]: Could you bring up the slide with the phase three pedestrian circulation?

889
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:17,589
[SPEAKER_36]: Right now, as you know, on the, right where the exit is off 93, there's a blinking light, and pedestrians can cross at that point.

890
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:26,073
[SPEAKER_36]: There's no light that allows it to stop and then the pedestrian to cross safely, but now you can't really, oh, okay.

891
01:13:26,393 --> 01:13:35,697
[SPEAKER_36]: Right now, this pedestrian circulation route, you can't really see it on the slide because of the lights, but is it possible, gentlemen, to put a crosswalk

892
01:13:36,274 --> 01:13:37,395
[SPEAKER_36]: right in front of the river.

893
01:13:37,415 --> 01:13:37,696
[SPEAKER_36]: Do you see?

894
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:39,758
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a long way to go to cross.

895
01:13:39,778 --> 01:13:41,260
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, yeah, sure, right here.

896
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:41,800
[SPEAKER_36]: Right here.

897
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,044
[SPEAKER_36]: Because that's a long, because this area is a pedestrian area as well.

898
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:48,908
[SPEAKER_36]: You can cross up and there's a nice little park that comes over this way right here.

899
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:53,173
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a long way to go for a pedestrian or someone who has a handicap.

900
01:13:54,656 --> 01:13:56,857
[SPEAKER_36]: to cross the street, to make it from one side to the other?

901
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:57,837
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you see what I'm saying?

902
01:13:57,877 --> 01:13:58,737
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I see what you're saying.

903
01:13:58,777 --> 01:14:00,637
[SPEAKER_28]: But this is the work zone.

904
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:02,138
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, because you have to coordinate.

905
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:02,738
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the work zone.

906
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:05,338
[SPEAKER_28]: So you'd be crossing them into a work zone.

907
01:14:05,578 --> 01:14:05,858
[SPEAKER_36]: I see.

908
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,099
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's just something.

909
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:08,099
[SPEAKER_36]: OK.

910
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:09,439
Thank you.

911
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:10,399
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

912
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:13,640
[SPEAKER_36]: I have a couple of other concerns with this project.

913
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:20,742
[SPEAKER_36]: My biggest concern is I thank you gentlemen for arriving today and providing me this packet and to provide this PowerPoint presentation.

914
01:14:21,242 --> 01:14:22,822
[SPEAKER_36]: It'd be much more helpful in the future.

915
01:14:23,453 --> 01:14:29,077
[SPEAKER_36]: if all projects, before they start, we actually get to see the full details of these projects.

916
01:14:29,137 --> 01:14:32,180
[SPEAKER_36]: It helps companies and businesses plan their activities.

917
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,241
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's one concern.

918
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:39,745
[SPEAKER_36]: The other concern I have is the, and it's already been voiced by Councilor Pensa, the time scale that we're talking about here.

919
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:43,208
[SPEAKER_36]: We're looking at over 1,200 days, 1,200 days for a bridge that's 121 feet.

920
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,590
[SPEAKER_36]: What does that work out to be, like an inch a day?

921
01:14:49,843 --> 01:14:51,725
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a concerning figure.

922
01:14:51,745 --> 01:14:53,526
[SPEAKER_36]: I have a feeling like we can do better.

923
01:14:53,546 --> 01:15:04,195
[SPEAKER_36]: I haven't looked at the project, and I know you gentlemen have a lot of challenges to overcome, but I really wish we could have seen the bidding process and there could have been more communication earlier in the project.

924
01:15:04,635 --> 01:15:04,916
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

925
01:15:07,518 --> 01:15:07,958
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

926
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:09,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

927
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:10,780
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

928
01:15:11,181 --> 01:15:14,083
[SPEAKER_34]: Mary Ann Ashcraft, 77 Fountain Street.

929
01:15:14,984 --> 01:15:17,085
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm here on behalf of Dr. DeMonteverdi.

930
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,900
[SPEAKER_34]: She owns the building right on the river, 30 Main Street.

931
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,341
[SPEAKER_34]: Her father passed away last night, so she could not be here.

932
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:27,602
[SPEAKER_34]: She has a lot of questions.

933
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:32,423
[SPEAKER_34]: Before the project started, no one had spoken to her at all.

934
01:15:32,543 --> 01:15:33,703
[SPEAKER_34]: No one went through the building.

935
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:40,945
[SPEAKER_34]: About a week and a half ago, MassDOT came out and talked to her for about 15 minutes about parking.

936
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:46,647
[SPEAKER_34]: She has 7 to 10 employees every day.

937
01:15:47,914 --> 01:15:55,940
[SPEAKER_34]: They're taking her parking lot, and they're going to give her a couple of parking spaces.

938
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:59,622
[SPEAKER_34]: This question has been asked at other meetings we've been to right from the beginning.

939
01:16:00,683 --> 01:16:04,846
[SPEAKER_34]: And they said she had two parking spaces now where they've taken the island out.

940
01:16:06,087 --> 01:16:08,108
[SPEAKER_34]: They need seven to nine parking spaces.

941
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:11,511
[SPEAKER_34]: No one talked to her till the week before last.

942
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:17,535
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think that is kind of disgraceful that nobody has talked to these people

943
01:16:18,393 --> 01:16:19,213
[SPEAKER_34]: that own the building.

944
01:16:21,554 --> 01:16:23,594
[SPEAKER_34]: She has a lot of concerns.

945
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:27,915
[SPEAKER_34]: There are a lot of elderly people from the housing that go to her.

946
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,896
[SPEAKER_34]: That dentist's office has been there.

947
01:16:30,516 --> 01:16:33,116
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe Dr. Zitzer opened it in 1971.

948
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:38,658
[SPEAKER_34]: People from the elderly housing are not going to walk into a construction site.

949
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:45,519
[SPEAKER_34]: Her other concerns are losing patients, number one, the building.

950
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,340
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a very, very old building.

951
01:16:48,653 --> 01:16:52,956
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a four-story building, unlike Carroll's, which is not a four-story building.

952
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:55,717
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's in danger, too, of damage, we know.

953
01:16:56,498 --> 01:16:58,679
[SPEAKER_34]: She was led to believe there was no mitigation.

954
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,183
[SPEAKER_34]: They came in and they said, we did tests, we did boring, everything's fine.

955
01:17:06,724 --> 01:17:12,547
[SPEAKER_34]: That's kind of hard to believe, with a building of that age and the weight of four stories.

956
01:17:15,117 --> 01:17:16,918
[SPEAKER_34]: And she's very concerned about the parking.

957
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:19,940
[SPEAKER_34]: She also has Medford Auto School upstairs in her building.

958
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,661
[SPEAKER_34]: They need parking spaces.

959
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:27,584
[SPEAKER_34]: And we're looking at a lot of people that have been going out of business in Medford.

960
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:31,246
[SPEAKER_34]: And her concern is she may be another one of them.

961
01:17:32,767 --> 01:17:35,628
[SPEAKER_34]: So we need some questions answered about her parking.

962
01:17:36,028 --> 01:17:37,709
[SPEAKER_34]: This is crucial to her business.

963
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:42,112
[SPEAKER_34]: The dental office has been there, like I say, since the early 70s.

964
01:17:44,364 --> 01:17:46,045
[SPEAKER_34]: And she's worked hard at her business.

965
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:55,729
[SPEAKER_34]: And people are already starting, because of the kiosks, not to come to Medford Square, when they can go to a number of surrounding areas, to dentists.

966
01:17:55,789 --> 01:17:57,450
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a zillion dentists around.

967
01:17:58,271 --> 01:18:01,812
[SPEAKER_34]: So the parking is a big issue for this dental office.

968
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:03,713
[SPEAKER_34]: And we still don't have an answer.

969
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:08,975
[SPEAKER_34]: And what I've heard tonight was, there are places we can call, but we don't have a phone number.

970
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:12,277
[SPEAKER_34]: She'd like to talk to these people about her parking.

971
01:18:13,099 --> 01:18:15,621
[SPEAKER_34]: So is there a number that she can call and talk to somebody?

972
01:18:17,882 --> 01:18:28,929
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the representative of Saupo Construction needs to, and somebody from MassDOT needs to sit down with the doctor and iron out these details.

973
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:37,274
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, the path of the construction is going through the doctor's parking lot, and that needs to be addressed.

974
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:41,617
[SPEAKER_24]: And we hope you can

975
01:18:42,457 --> 01:18:44,558
[SPEAKER_24]: set up a direct line of communication.

976
01:18:44,578 --> 01:18:54,064
[SPEAKER_34]: The egress in the back of her building, where the ramp will be going over her parking lot, that's the second egress.

977
01:18:54,664 --> 01:19:01,888
[SPEAKER_34]: So if at all that front sidewalk is closed off for any reason, her patients cannot get in the building.

978
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:07,932
[SPEAKER_34]: And I don't think anybody has addressed any of this with Dr. DiMonteverdi.

979
01:19:10,304 --> 01:19:18,551
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, both access and egress will be accessible throughout the project.

980
01:19:18,571 --> 01:19:21,934
[SPEAKER_28]: Even the emergency fire exit, they have to keep that.

981
01:19:22,795 --> 01:19:30,221
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, the fire that goes over the wall, that goes over the wall, goes up to the auto school.

982
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:30,882
[SPEAKER_28]: Correct.

983
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:35,226
[SPEAKER_28]: That'll be, that has to be maintained throughout the project as well.

984
01:19:35,246 --> 01:19:35,486
[SPEAKER_28]: Right.

985
01:19:36,407 --> 01:19:36,547
[SPEAKER_28]: Right.

986
01:19:37,204 --> 01:19:42,905
[SPEAKER_34]: But again, elderly people are not going to put themselves in the danger of even walking down to that area.

987
01:19:43,165 --> 01:19:44,925
[SPEAKER_34]: But she needs the parking address.

988
01:19:45,105 --> 01:19:47,226
[SPEAKER_34]: And we need a phone number, a contact person.

989
01:19:47,266 --> 01:19:49,386
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll contact you tomorrow.

990
01:19:49,446 --> 01:19:49,726
[SPEAKER_34]: OK.

991
01:19:50,106 --> 01:19:50,867
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you very much.

992
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:51,687
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

993
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:52,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

994
01:19:54,747 --> 01:19:57,048
[SPEAKER_24]: On that point, Madam Vice President.

995
01:19:57,288 --> 01:19:58,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Diller.

996
01:19:58,428 --> 01:20:02,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lady makes a good point.

997
01:20:03,029 --> 01:20:04,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, blanked on the name.

998
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:08,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Just with regards to a phone number, they have a phone number, but they don't know it now.

999
01:20:08,331 --> 01:20:09,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, same thing with an address.

1000
01:20:09,911 --> 01:20:12,192
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an address, but you won't tell us, or?

1001
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,352
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't.

1002
01:20:14,152 --> 01:20:15,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, it's not that I won't tell you.

1003
01:20:15,652 --> 01:20:17,713
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to be glad to share it with you.

1004
01:20:17,733 --> 01:20:20,213
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't have the information.

1005
01:20:20,413 --> 01:20:23,634
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could just make that part of the committee report, that we get the address and the phone number.

1006
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:28,055
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, if people come to us with concerns, questions, need answers, that we can direct them.

1007
01:20:28,335 --> 01:20:28,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done that.

1008
01:20:28,955 --> 01:20:30,656
[SPEAKER_24]: And Mr. Daly's made note of it, too.

1009
01:20:31,096 --> 01:20:31,496
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.

1010
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:36,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your point of information, Councilor Penta.

1011
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The unfortunate part about all of this is the council's asking the questions.

1012
01:20:39,814 --> 01:20:41,375
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no one here from the city administration.

1013
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:43,217
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no one here from the Office of Community Development.

1014
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:45,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they are, would they please stand up?

1015
01:20:46,099 --> 01:20:47,059
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very important.

1016
01:20:47,099 --> 01:20:59,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the part that I think is a little bit disturbing right now, because this information, whether it be for public safety, whether it be for the bus routes, whether it be for the parking, or just the fact that I have a telephone number to call, this meeting didn't happen overnight.

1017
01:20:59,489 --> 01:21:00,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your point of information, Councilor.

1018
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:01,870
[SPEAKER_09]: This meeting was pointed out.

1019
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:03,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor, can I just ask one more thing, please?

1020
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:30,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You made his point of information console Sir Councilor yes, you asked for point of information And I would appreciate it and I think would have been appreciated by anyone who watching would have had either the number Officer community development or somebody here from the city administration That's how important I believe this issue is.

1021
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:33,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you console console longer current are you through?

1022
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:34,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1023
01:21:35,282 --> 01:21:36,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1024
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Sterello, 20 Metcalf Street.

1025
01:21:40,304 --> 01:21:41,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1026
01:21:41,344 --> 01:21:42,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a very short question.

1027
01:21:43,845 --> 01:21:45,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Will there be any lights on the bridge?

1028
01:21:50,788 --> 01:21:58,830
[SPEAKER_17]: We, during the various phases of the project, are required to provide temporary lighting, which we will do.

1029
01:21:59,411 --> 01:22:03,412
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's to maintain the level of lighting that there is there now.

1030
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:13,809
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the final construction, there will be brand new poles and luminaires both on the bridge and on the ramp.

1031
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,892
[SPEAKER_17]: So everything will be well lit.

1032
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:19,074
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of those will there be?

1033
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:22,397
[SPEAKER_10]: There are four lanes.

1034
01:22:22,697 --> 01:22:27,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Off the top of my head, there's either five or six of

1035
01:22:28,358 --> 01:22:36,882
[SPEAKER_17]: the decorative type lights that the city uses on the bridge, and there's another five or six along the Route 16 ramp.

1036
01:22:37,723 --> 01:22:43,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Up to what height will the lights be?

1037
01:22:43,365 --> 01:22:50,109
[SPEAKER_17]: The ones on the bridge, I believe, are either 16 or 18 feet tall, and they have two luminaires.

1038
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:54,271
[SPEAKER_17]: The double luminaires that the big lights come out on both sides?

1039
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:56,292
[SPEAKER_17]: And the ones

1040
01:22:57,851 --> 01:23:02,634
[SPEAKER_17]: on the ramps are about 25 feet tall, and they have a single luminaire.

1041
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are four lights altogether?

1042
01:23:05,135 --> 01:23:12,340
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I think there are five or six on the bridge, and another five or six on the ramp.

1043
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:15,842
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be appreciated, because we do need better lighting there.

1044
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:22,184
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the interim, we will be providing temporary lighting.

1045
01:23:23,084 --> 01:23:31,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And in all of those cases, a little feedback is always helpful because it is, after all, temporary.

1046
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:37,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we have some dark spots and we know about it, we can fix them.

1047
01:23:37,776 --> 01:23:38,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1048
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:44,502
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1049
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,882
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford.

1050
01:23:48,562 --> 01:23:49,322
[SPEAKER_08]: One quick question.

1051
01:23:49,342 --> 01:24:04,752
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the project, will we finally have working pedestrian lights at the end of South Street, which leads to Main Street, across the street, on the ramp that goes to Route 93, and on the ramp that jumps onto Main Street off of the parkway?

1052
01:24:05,192 --> 01:24:07,534
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had those relics there for years.

1053
01:24:07,974 --> 01:24:09,154
[SPEAKER_08]: All they do is blink yellow.

1054
01:24:09,775 --> 01:24:10,695
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very dangerous.

1055
01:24:10,715 --> 01:24:13,257
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many people, women, men, children,

1056
01:24:13,745 --> 01:24:15,506
[SPEAKER_08]: carriages trying to make it across the street.

1057
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:17,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a race against time with them.

1058
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:24,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to know, is there, I haven't seen anything with that here, but I know that somebody had mentioned that that problem was resolved.

1059
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:25,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

1060
01:24:25,214 --> 01:24:25,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know about that?

1061
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:26,956
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1062
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:32,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'd probably be a different contractor possibly through the state to do that, but I don't see it on the plans.

1063
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think if we're going to spend this kind of money that we don't wind up with pedestrian lights.

1064
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1065
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:39,926
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1066
01:24:40,587 --> 01:24:41,528
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe Mr. President,

1067
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:47,034
[SPEAKER_26]: In the past legislative session, Representative Donato was able to secure money in the transportation bond bill for that initiative.

1068
01:24:48,415 --> 01:24:53,018
[SPEAKER_26]: Senator Jalem was able to secure it in the House side, and the matter was non-conferenceable.

1069
01:24:53,119 --> 01:25:05,048
[SPEAKER_26]: So this council actually passed a resolution sometime back to meet with them once this construction project started to see if we can coordinate the release of these bonded funds to ensure that when the project is completed that all this work is done at the same time.

1070
01:25:11,258 --> 01:25:14,559
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's, yeah, that's all the, that's all the money that he bought at 200,000, 275,000.

1071
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:15,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1072
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all very much.

1073
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:19,821
[SPEAKER_24]: The chair awaits motion.

1074
01:25:24,023 --> 01:25:24,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1075
01:25:24,403 --> 01:25:28,525
[SPEAKER_21]: We have questions.

1076
01:25:28,605 --> 01:25:30,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe there was some questions asked by the council.

1077
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:34,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we move that we get an update on this bridge process on a monthly basis?

1078
01:25:35,187 --> 01:25:40,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And can we have a phone number that we would be able to have in a project person as a contact person?

1079
01:25:40,978 --> 01:25:48,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anyone were to call us or the city clerk or any citizen, um, and they can't get ahold of anybody because they close here at 12 o'clock on a Friday.

1080
01:25:48,806 --> 01:25:54,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the weekend when it's closed, if they want to call a Councilor on the weekend, and if emergency happens, they can give any one of us a call.

1081
01:25:55,353 --> 01:25:56,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So the number will be made available.

1082
01:25:56,914 --> 01:25:57,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's important.

1083
01:25:57,755 --> 01:25:59,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President on that motion.

1084
01:26:08,749 --> 01:26:13,391
[SPEAKER_09]: A monthly update, the phone number, and the location of where the office is going to be, and the contact person.

1085
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Go ahead, Madam Vice President.

1086
01:26:20,094 --> 01:26:21,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1087
01:26:21,714 --> 01:26:29,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And just that we recommend that maximum standards for disability purposes be implemented when the project's finalized, especially.

1088
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:33,279
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion as amended, all those in favor?

1089
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1090
01:26:35,919 --> 01:26:37,160
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

1091
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,702
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for coming.

1092
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:45,185
[SPEAKER_24]: While we're under suspension, Mr. Daly, thank you very much for bringing this group down.

1093
01:26:45,786 --> 01:26:49,989
[SPEAKER_24]: We're entirely grateful to you and for your ability to answer questions.

1094
01:26:55,712 --> 01:27:01,997
[SPEAKER_24]: While we're under suspension, the swim team has been treading water for an hour and 25 minutes.

1095
01:27:02,017 --> 01:27:02,557
[SPEAKER_24]: So we welcome them.

1096
01:27:08,446 --> 01:27:32,592
[SPEAKER_24]: 15-567 petition by May Judge, Medford High School varsity swim coach, to address the council on the Medford High School swimming pool refurbishing varsity swim team, a swim-a-thon fundraiser and charitable donation and check presentation to the Buddy Coholan Adult Daycare Center Community Family Incorporated, Ms.

1097
01:27:32,692 --> 01:27:32,992

[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Judge, 17 St.

01:27:42,863 --> 01:27:44,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Street, Medford, Mass.

1100
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:55,847
[SPEAKER_00]: We, the swim team, would like to thank city council for allowing the refurbishment of the swimming pool for the whole city of Medford.

1101
01:27:56,847 --> 01:28:07,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our, what we did this winter was we had a swim-a-thon to raise some money for, you know, something for the team, but we also decided to donate

1102
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:16,128
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% of what we raised to the Buddy Cajon Memory Center.

1103
01:28:16,148 --> 01:28:20,573
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to give that to them, and we'd like to thank you wholeheartedly for all you've done for us.

1104
01:28:21,334 --> 01:28:24,297
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the community to start using the pool.

1105
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:25,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1106
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:27,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

1107
01:28:44,313 --> 01:28:45,534
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all for coming down.

1108
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:48,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your gratitude.

1109
01:28:48,836 --> 01:28:51,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for putting that pool to good use.

1110
01:28:51,598 --> 01:28:56,962
[SPEAKER_24]: It was a great investment in Medford's life here, and you're right.

1111
01:28:57,282 --> 01:28:58,083
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to use it.

1112
01:28:59,964 --> 01:29:00,965
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all very much.

1113
01:29:02,826 --> 01:29:12,633
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, and on the motion of Councilor Knight, revert back to the regular order of business.

1114
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:13,414
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1115
01:29:14,255 --> 01:29:16,415
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1116
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,956
[SPEAKER_24]: 15-569, offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1117
01:29:19,676 --> 01:29:28,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council refers the matter of body work establishment to the Medford Board of Health for further review and discussion.

1118
01:29:28,538 --> 01:29:31,139
[SPEAKER_24]: See attached Town of Plymouth ordinance.

1119
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:32,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caraviello.

1120
01:29:32,919 --> 01:29:33,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1121
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:41,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I know we talked about this last week in regards to these type of establishments moving into the city of Medford.

1122
01:29:42,463 --> 01:29:51,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the last few days, I was able to talk to the town of Plymouth and their town manager.

1123
01:29:52,048 --> 01:29:58,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And the woman was very helpful in providing me with some information, which I provided to all of our people in the packets this evening.

1124
01:29:59,831 --> 01:30:12,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it is, it's an ordinance that they have crafted in order to stem the tide of these body work establishments that come into the community.

1125
01:30:12,777 --> 01:30:19,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people get confused with the term massage parlors and body work parlors.

1126
01:30:20,143 --> 01:30:26,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the ones we're talking about, that I'm talking about, are called body work establishments.

1127
01:30:26,549 --> 01:30:32,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And currently we have several in the community that are operating right now.

1128
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:38,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And two of them are in residential neighborhoods, along with one that's in, right now, a square.

1129
01:30:40,574 --> 01:30:46,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to meet with our city solicitor this week and Karen rose of the board of health and I provided them information.

1130
01:30:47,017 --> 01:31:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that going forward with this, I'd like to see, I know the chief is doing some investigative work here in this, but the package that I gave to the solicitor, I would like to see if we can craft an ordinance similar to that, so in the future,

1131
01:31:09,663 --> 01:31:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: these establishments will hopefully not want to come to Medford in the future.

1132
01:31:15,564 --> 01:31:19,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it is, it's not so much licensing the establishment.

1133
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:23,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's licensing the workers who work in these establishments.

1134
01:31:24,586 --> 01:31:28,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's kind of a way to get around some of the rules.

1135
01:31:28,387 --> 01:31:31,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.

1136
01:31:31,807 --> 01:31:33,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could refer to the solicitor, Randy.

1137
01:31:36,111 --> 01:31:38,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Board of Health for further discussion of that rule.

1138
01:31:38,113 --> 01:31:38,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

1139
01:31:38,913 --> 01:31:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1140
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:46,398
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to refer the matter to the Board of Health and the City Solicitor.

1141
01:31:47,178 --> 01:31:47,958
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1142
01:31:48,979 --> 01:31:49,980
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Penta.

1143
01:31:51,441 --> 01:32:03,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up because when he discussed this last week, I don't think anybody really knew the magnitude of the impact that this could have on neighborhoods, and especially if you're abutting this particular situation.

1144
01:32:04,645 --> 01:32:20,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And through his follow-through with the community of Plymouth, I think he just highlights the fact that sometimes, unfortunately, when pieces of legislation are written and they're enacted, one little word can just change the whole agenda of what somebody might have to offer and what they want to do.

1145
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:33,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for going forward with this, because I think what it does, I think it's a safeguard into our community, into our neighborhoods, into the little children who might have to be exposed to this, because this is an enterprise that's going on.

1146
01:32:33,712 --> 01:32:43,536
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a scandalous for-profit enterprise by people who have no care about our community and the concept of morals that our community should have.

1147
01:32:44,037 --> 01:32:50,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, and I know our city solicitor is here, I'm quite sure you're going to be looking into it, and I'm quite sure that we can come up with something.

1148
01:32:50,259 --> 01:32:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can follow up, we have one particularly in Central Avenue, which is right beside a park.

1149
01:32:55,182 --> 01:32:55,842
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a residential.

1150
01:32:55,882 --> 01:33:00,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a residential area, and there's homes right in that area.

1151
01:33:00,184 --> 01:33:00,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's here.

1152
01:33:01,004 --> 01:33:02,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another one right up on Main Street.

1153
01:33:03,303 --> 01:33:05,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, all homes surrounding this.

1154
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:12,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And the sad part about this, as we're talking about it, the one that's on Central Ave, if you were to drive by, the windows are all covered.

1155
01:33:13,005 --> 01:33:14,865
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd have no idea what the heck's going on over there.

1156
01:33:15,986 --> 01:33:22,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the individuals inside, some of the people that are running it may not be that nice to you if you were to ask them questions.

1157
01:33:22,907 --> 01:33:26,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, and what are you doing, and what are you asking questions for, why are you taking pictures, and whatever it might be.

1158
01:33:27,288 --> 01:33:27,748
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1159
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,049
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a good move.

1160
01:33:29,069 --> 01:33:31,249
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what you call a good neighborhood protection move.

1161
01:33:31,545 --> 01:33:36,289
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good public health and public safety move between our chief of police and our city solicitor.

1162
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:45,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm quite sure that we can manage, as plummeters manage, to write something that, unfortunately, until the state decides to change its law and its state statute, we can do it here in our local community.

1163
01:33:46,136 --> 01:33:46,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you.

1164
01:33:49,358 --> 01:33:50,619
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1165
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1166
01:33:52,821 --> 01:33:56,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello also for putting this forward.

1167
01:33:57,613 --> 01:34:01,995
[SPEAKER_03]: did speak to somebody else who mentioned the town of Plymouth and it was just random.

1168
01:34:02,035 --> 01:34:05,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like they're getting something done and they're bringing back the control locally.

1169
01:34:05,816 --> 01:34:07,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1170
01:34:07,577 --> 01:34:09,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's something we definitely need.

1171
01:34:09,318 --> 01:34:12,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned that last week that we need to bring control somehow to the city.

1172
01:34:12,699 --> 01:34:20,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, with that being said, we know, I know chief Sacco has responded to a number of us on email that the police department is doing what they can do.

1173
01:34:20,462 --> 01:34:23,303
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one establishment shut down a year or two ago.

1174
01:34:23,757 --> 01:34:29,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thank them for that, but obviously we want to keep up the investigations and keep up closing down these establishments.

1175
01:34:29,879 --> 01:34:43,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, I mean, all over the city, but in a residential neighborhood, in our square, it's not what you want people to know our square has.

1176
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how to put it, but we have families who traverse these areas and we just don't want it within our community.

1177
01:34:50,095 --> 01:35:04,027
[SPEAKER_03]: What this ordinance would do is it would bring back the control to the health department and the police department to be able to regulate this, to provide quarry checks for anybody who wants to open such an establishment, massage, Thai massage.

1178
01:35:04,047 --> 01:35:11,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it covers a whole host of different things, some that I can't even pronounce.

1179
01:35:11,154 --> 01:35:14,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's a zen shutsu.

1180
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:18,235
[SPEAKER_03]: All kinds of stuff, but it's definitely something that's needed.

1181
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:25,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to bring back this so we have local control over it so we can begin shutting down even more or making sure they don't reopen.

1182
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:28,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we had this problem two years ago, now it's back.

1183
01:35:28,501 --> 01:35:32,704
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get really on top of it now, and then it's going to just come back in different locations.

1184
01:35:32,744 --> 01:35:35,665
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure we end it and we put a stop to it.

1185
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:36,626
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one way.

1186
01:35:36,646 --> 01:35:41,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll have a committee of the whole meeting and thank our city solicitor in advance for working on it.

1187
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:43,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1188
01:35:43,976 --> 01:35:45,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1189
01:35:45,257 --> 01:35:46,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Marks.

1190
01:35:47,078 --> 01:35:48,018
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1191
01:35:48,178 --> 01:35:59,884
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think the one thing we can do as a community is what you've seen over the last several weeks and what happened roughly a year ago and some other locations is these businesses want to stay under the radar.

1192
01:36:00,344 --> 01:36:02,605
[SPEAKER_30]: They don't want anyone to know what they're doing in these businesses.

1193
01:36:02,665 --> 01:36:08,728
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's why you see many of them with windows that you can't see through and, you know, shady activity going on.

1194
01:36:09,408 --> 01:36:13,270
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's very helpful when the community unites, like we're seeing now.

1195
01:36:13,978 --> 01:36:39,991
[SPEAKER_30]: The question I had, Chief, and I know there's ongoing investigations and so forth, but when you go onto a particular website of an establishment or on Facebook, and there's reviews about a particular business, and the reviews mention things that are against the law and so forth, what type of information do you need in order to really move this to the next level?

1196
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:41,972
[SPEAKER_30]: And why does it seem that

1197
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,142
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's not a reflection on our police department.

1198
01:36:45,162 --> 01:36:46,303
[SPEAKER_30]: It's probably happening everywhere.

1199
01:36:46,623 --> 01:36:53,468
[SPEAKER_30]: Why does it seem to take so long to investigate and move these businesses out of particular areas?

1200
01:36:54,669 --> 01:37:05,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can tell you as far as, you know, looking at Facebook and looking at other, uh, other areas for advertisement, uh, we don't have enough people that monitor all of the social media that's out there.

1201
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:09,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we work on complaints that we get from the public, obviously,

1202
01:37:10,451 --> 01:37:25,317
[SPEAKER_06]: The same thing that was mentioned, I think, you know, as a police officer for a number of years and all of our police officers, the same thing, any business that opens up and their windows are covered already causes us some concern, some suspicion that something's going on in there.

1203
01:37:25,878 --> 01:37:27,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not good crime prevention.

1204
01:37:27,278 --> 01:37:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they could be getting robbed and we can't see inside the store as we drive by.

1205
01:37:32,641 --> 01:37:33,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does it take so long?

1206
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:36,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a process that needs to be followed.

1207
01:37:36,622 --> 01:37:37,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, just comments.

1208
01:37:38,376 --> 01:37:45,359
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it be in an ad, in a newspaper, or whether it's in social media, isn't enough for us to act on.

1209
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:50,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it's helping us to go in that direction, because that tells us possibly something is going on.

1210
01:37:51,781 --> 01:38:06,706
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we've done in the past, having undercovers go in and actually get the massage, and then the person who's providing the massage offers a little additional service for a fee.

1211
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:11,670
[SPEAKER_06]: That takes time to happen, and we did that one today.

1212
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:18,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We did every location in the city, and we shut down three locations that time.

1213
01:38:18,254 --> 01:38:21,116
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's other crime that's going on in the city, too.

1214
01:38:21,156 --> 01:38:24,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it's just a process that needs to be followed.

1215
01:38:24,378 --> 01:38:30,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We work with the state, and there's one inspector from the Board of State Licensure, and

1216
01:38:31,517 --> 01:38:32,177
[SPEAKER_06]: when he's available.

1217
01:38:32,277 --> 01:38:36,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's covering pretty much, if not all of the state, at least the Eastern portion of the state.

1218
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, they need to ramp up their staffing as well, but it's, it's something that, that we're working on.

1219
01:38:45,861 --> 01:38:52,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you that, uh, there are every one of the locations that's operating in the city right now is under the microscope.

1220
01:38:54,404 --> 01:38:58,745
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, is it within your powers to pay visits?

1221
01:38:59,596 --> 01:39:03,359
[SPEAKER_30]: even though there may not be anything substantial at the beginning?

1222
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We have done that, quite honestly.

1223
01:39:05,141 --> 01:39:25,937
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had that Captain Fowler, who heads up our detective division, has, with another detective and also with the state inspector, actually gone in, asked to see the license, kind of look around to see what the operation looks like, and try to make a determination whether it appears to be legitimate on the face.

1224
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:28,459
[SPEAKER_06]: That's happened on a few occasions.

1225
01:39:30,723 --> 01:39:33,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And it happens more regularly than the sting operations.

1226
01:39:35,087 --> 01:39:36,488
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is being monitored.

1227
01:39:36,508 --> 01:39:39,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that, just look around some of these locations.

1228
01:39:39,811 --> 01:39:41,813
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not the franchise business.

1229
01:39:43,134 --> 01:39:45,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that immediate hit.

1230
01:39:45,517 --> 01:39:52,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had a location on Salem Street, Spring Street actually, the block of stores by Magoon Ave.

1231
01:39:53,424 --> 01:39:57,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people were in there once we got word that they were operating.

1232
01:39:58,104 --> 01:40:00,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Fowler and a couple of other detectives paid them a visit.

1233
01:40:01,886 --> 01:40:03,007
[SPEAKER_06]: They shut down that night.

1234
01:40:04,128 --> 01:40:10,051
[SPEAKER_06]: About a month later, they were operating in an apartment they had rented off of 9th Street in a condo building.

1235
01:40:12,232 --> 01:40:16,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And how we found that out was other people were calling in the building about the amount of traffic coming and going.

1236
01:40:16,695 --> 01:40:18,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the exact same crew.

1237
01:40:19,216 --> 01:40:21,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're on top of it, but we're working with a number of different agencies.

1238
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:24,279
[SPEAKER_06]: The AG's office, as far as human trafficking,

1239
01:40:26,018 --> 01:40:33,862
[SPEAKER_06]: covering every aspect of it, because we don't want to just go on one front and fail.

1240
01:40:34,182 --> 01:40:38,245
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure when we go in there, we're going in there equipped with all these different entities.

1241
01:40:38,325 --> 01:40:45,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And like we did that time a year or so ago, where three places were put out of business and a number of people were arrested.

1242
01:40:47,149 --> 01:40:53,893
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, thanks to your department and thanks to the vigilance of our residents, who are unbelievable.

1243
01:40:54,593 --> 01:40:55,534
[SPEAKER_30]: The output that

1244
01:40:56,059 --> 01:40:59,382
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm seeing just through emails and phone calls now is remarkable.

1245
01:41:00,082 --> 01:41:01,664
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that adds a lot.

1246
01:41:02,244 --> 01:41:23,081
[SPEAKER_30]: I stated it a couple of weeks ago, and I still believe it strongly, Chief, that, you know, when you have a downtown business district, not just Medford Square, many of our business districts right now that have a lot of vacancies, it doesn't look like there's much activity after 7 o'clock, and they become a welcoming zone for establishments like this.

1247
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:25,683
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think the best thing we can do as a community

1248
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:30,382
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not just to be vigilant and let the police department know when we see this happening.

1249
01:41:30,823 --> 01:41:36,466
[SPEAKER_30]: It's also to promote our business districts, also to look at the revitalization of our business districts.

1250
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:49,873
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, when you start seeing places like Best Sellers and Forest Street Art Studio go under, and you see pawn shops and massage parlors open up, it's a concern.

1251
01:41:50,373 --> 01:41:54,175
[SPEAKER_30]: And it should be a concern of every resident, as well as this administration.

1252
01:41:54,961 --> 01:42:02,306
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, it's unfortunate, but I think as long as we stay ahead of the curve, we'll be all right.

1253
01:42:02,386 --> 01:42:22,658
[SPEAKER_30]: But the revitalization of our business districts is key to keeping these type of establishments away and attracting businesses that are going to attract the type of clientele that we want to attract that's going to come around and spend money in our community and treat our business districts with the type of dignity and respect that it deserves.

1254
01:42:23,202 --> 01:42:26,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So absolutely, and I totally agree with those comments.

1255
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:30,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I think all of the business districts, we'd like to see them flourish.

1256
01:42:30,446 --> 01:42:38,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to have the city of Medford known for the right things, not for these types of attractions that come in.

1257
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:40,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I want to say is thank you to the public.

1258
01:42:40,972 --> 01:42:42,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a number of emails.

1259
01:42:42,673 --> 01:42:47,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to assure the public that we're not sitting around waiting for another entity to do our job.

1260
01:42:48,096 --> 01:42:50,637
[SPEAKER_06]: We are actively investigating and hopefully

1261
01:42:52,412 --> 01:42:55,514
[SPEAKER_06]: sometime in the not-too-distant future, they'll see some results.

1262
01:42:56,114 --> 01:43:00,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can tell you that there have been some interesting things happening in a couple of locations.

1263
01:43:00,576 --> 01:43:01,897
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chief.

1264
01:43:01,977 --> 01:43:02,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1265
01:43:02,757 --> 01:43:03,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chief.

1266
01:43:03,517 --> 01:43:04,518
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1267
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:09,580
[SPEAKER_24]: Ma'am, if you wish to speak, please state your name and address for the record.

1268
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:13,082
[SPEAKER_32]: Melanie Raylan, 20 Stanley Avenue.

1269
01:43:14,293 --> 01:43:16,594
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi there, I'm part of the Medford Community Coalition.

1270
01:43:16,634 --> 01:43:20,495
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm here with my co-founder, Laura Brereton, as well as our board member, Frank O'Leary.

1271
01:43:20,735 --> 01:43:22,315
[SPEAKER_32]: We have other board members in the audience.

1272
01:43:22,996 --> 01:43:30,858
[SPEAKER_32]: We have almost 1,000 likes on Facebook and a very strong community outpouring of support for our mission, which is to revitalize Medford Mass.

1273
01:43:31,863 --> 01:43:33,124
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's why we're here today.

1274
01:43:33,585 --> 01:43:38,469
[SPEAKER_32]: We are first, thank you, first of all, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this very important issue up.

1275
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:46,655
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know how to start this except to tell you what happened to me as I walked to Borealis Yoga today before coming here.

1276
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:51,499
[SPEAKER_32]: There was a woman in front of a, that store, and she was looking like this.

1277
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,681
[SPEAKER_32]: She was doing this with a little bit of that.

1278
01:43:54,502 --> 01:43:59,666
[SPEAKER_32]: Another woman in my yoga class who is of Asian descent was catcalled.

1279
01:44:00,438 --> 01:44:05,400
[SPEAKER_32]: So this is what's happening to our downtown area, one that lost bestsellers, one that has missed it.

1280
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:13,523
[SPEAKER_32]: Coffee Roaster's a lovely gathering place but may lose business now because it's down the street from a place that is, best way to say it is sketchy.

1281
01:44:13,823 --> 01:44:18,465
[SPEAKER_32]: So the big question I have here, I have many questions, but I want to keep it brief.

1282
01:44:20,265 --> 01:44:23,946
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all, why is everything reactionary and not proactive?

1283
01:44:25,026 --> 01:44:26,466
[SPEAKER_32]: We're finding issues again and again.

1284
01:44:26,986 --> 01:44:32,427
[SPEAKER_32]: This question really begs, where is the attention to what kind of businesses we are fostering?

1285
01:44:32,547 --> 01:44:34,388
[SPEAKER_32]: Not just in the square, but in Medford as a whole.

1286
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:38,108
[SPEAKER_32]: Why isn't community development given more staff to do their job?

1287
01:44:38,148 --> 01:44:43,169
[SPEAKER_32]: It's very easy to point a finger, but is there one full-time person in community development?

1288
01:44:43,249 --> 01:44:45,470
[SPEAKER_32]: Whereas in other towns, there's usually 12, 15.

1289
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:49,372
[SPEAKER_32]: That's a lot to put on one person's plate.

1290
01:44:51,754 --> 01:44:53,355
[SPEAKER_32]: Was this business fully permitted?

1291
01:44:53,595 --> 01:44:55,717
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the big question I would love to have answered right now.

1292
01:44:56,097 --> 01:44:57,678
[SPEAKER_32]: And who's responsible for letting it in?

1293
01:44:58,579 --> 01:44:59,880
[SPEAKER_32]: Can anyone answer that question?

1294
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,902
[SPEAKER_32]: And yeah, I would love to hear that answer.

1295
01:45:02,922 --> 01:45:14,111
[SPEAKER_24]: State your name and address for the record.

1296
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:16,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Laura Brayerton, 270 Winthrop Street.

1297
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,721
[SPEAKER_12]: recently paved, thank goodness.

1298
01:45:19,562 --> 01:45:23,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also, as Melanie mentioned, a co-founder of the Medford Community Coalition.

1299
01:45:23,345 --> 01:45:25,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I, too, would like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.

1300
01:45:26,547 --> 01:45:36,415
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would also like to thank Chief Sacco, because he seems like he's on board and obviously taking some very serious steps to address this.

1301
01:45:37,116 --> 01:45:40,438
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to echo Melanie's sentiments.

1302
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:44,722
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're trying to, of course, hold back some

1303
01:45:45,275 --> 01:45:53,778
[SPEAKER_12]: real serious frustration and some strong feelings that are going on in the community about this particular business.

1304
01:45:55,299 --> 01:45:59,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I am curious how it got licensed, how it got permits to open up.

1305
01:46:00,901 --> 01:46:04,822
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious how it's going to affect the other businesses in Medford Square.

1306
01:46:04,842 --> 01:46:10,424
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to my role with the MCC, I'm also the programming coordinator for Circle the Square.

1307
01:46:11,357 --> 01:46:17,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And as, hopefully, if you've been to Circle the Square before, hundreds of people come to Medford Square, many of them families.

1308
01:46:18,299 --> 01:46:20,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Riverside Avenue is a huge destination.

1309
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:33,822
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a ton of programming at Burying Ground, and now hundreds of people, including many families, are going to be walking past this particular establishment at 34 Riverside Avenue, which, at the very least, is sketchy.

1310
01:46:34,896 --> 01:46:51,965
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also curious, of course, in the larger picture of things, if this is a human trafficking situation, that obviously is a very serious issue, one that we can't necessarily completely solve within Medford City Council, but this is obviously the larger issue at hand.

1311
01:46:52,926 --> 01:46:59,529
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm also curious what can be done to keep these businesses from coming back

1312
01:47:00,225 --> 01:47:12,991
[SPEAKER_12]: In doing a little bit of research, it seems like some of our neighbors and surrounding communities have changed their ordinances within their towns to not only prevent these types of businesses from coming in the first place or to severely restrict them.

1313
01:47:13,551 --> 01:47:25,237
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think that Medford should take those same kinds of steps so that we don't have to continually, as you mentioned, year after year or every couple of years have to sort of readdress this situation.

1314
01:47:25,657 --> 01:47:27,018
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like it can be done.

1315
01:47:27,767 --> 01:47:33,152
[SPEAKER_12]: within each town and community that there can be changes made to prevent these from opening.

1316
01:47:33,553 --> 01:47:33,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1317
01:47:36,676 --> 01:47:38,618
[SPEAKER_35]: Frank O'Leary, 85 Arlington Street.

1318
01:47:38,638 --> 01:47:41,140
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm also on the board of the MCC.

1319
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,342
[SPEAKER_35]: Just have a basic statement.

1320
01:47:43,382 --> 01:47:48,147
[SPEAKER_35]: The Medford, as I see it, is beginning a huge transition period.

1321
01:47:48,908 --> 01:47:50,269
[SPEAKER_35]: We're on a border where

1322
01:47:51,093 --> 01:48:05,497
[SPEAKER_35]: We can go one way or the other way by allowing businesses in that foster a wrong idea, make the square itself feel unsafe in the evening for families to come walking through.

1323
01:48:06,318 --> 01:48:07,858
[SPEAKER_35]: Recently, the square has been decimated.

1324
01:48:08,979 --> 01:48:10,339
[SPEAKER_35]: We're losing valuable businesses.

1325
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:17,061
[SPEAKER_35]: Everybody talks about how we want the square to be a place for people to come and enjoy themselves in the evenings.

1326
01:48:18,121 --> 01:48:20,002
[SPEAKER_35]: They're not going to do that if they have to worry about

1327
01:48:20,737 --> 01:48:22,477
[SPEAKER_35]: you know, the type of businesses that are coming in.

1328
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:32,339
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, if there's things that can be done, permits that need to be viewed, or even just in general, look at Elements Massage.

1329
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:34,380
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a reputable place.

1330
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,700
[SPEAKER_35]: Those people are certified, individually trained.

1331
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:42,601
[SPEAKER_35]: They spend years doing this type of stuff.

1332
01:48:44,022 --> 01:48:45,162
[SPEAKER_35]: What message do you want to send?

1333
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:52,998
[SPEAKER_35]: Anybody come in who's going to have, who can put up a shingle or we appreciate accreditation.

1334
01:48:53,698 --> 01:48:56,160
[SPEAKER_35]: We appreciate businesses that are going to give back to the community.

1335
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:59,702
[SPEAKER_35]: They're going to foster the right image that we want to present.

1336
01:49:01,443 --> 01:49:04,985
[SPEAKER_35]: Now it's, it's, it's not just the council, it's everybody.

1337
01:49:05,166 --> 01:49:06,286
[SPEAKER_35]: Citizens need to pay attention.

1338
01:49:07,107 --> 01:49:08,328
[SPEAKER_35]: Everybody needs to be a part of this.

1339
01:49:08,668 --> 01:49:09,468
[SPEAKER_35]: We're together in this.

1340
01:49:10,849 --> 01:49:11,109
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1341
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:11,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1342
01:49:23,382 --> 01:49:25,163
[SPEAKER_33]: Mark Crowley, 59 Boynton Road.

1343
01:49:26,764 --> 01:49:30,686
[SPEAKER_33]: I've got to have to say, you know, congrats to the MCC for really making a lot of this happen.

1344
01:49:30,706 --> 01:49:32,087
[SPEAKER_33]: I really appreciate that.

1345
01:49:32,647 --> 01:49:38,350
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, I think it's unfortunate that, you know, the notion of being reactive is exactly what we hear a lot.

1346
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:42,031
[SPEAKER_33]: And unfortunately, it's, you know, you sow what you reap in many ways.

1347
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:48,795
[SPEAKER_33]: And that, you know, the efforts by the city towards economic development in our business districts, you know, has been completely inadequate.

1348
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:51,056
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, certainly today we're going to be talking about Medford Square.

1349
01:49:51,423 --> 01:49:56,885
[SPEAKER_33]: But, I mean, this is a problem that we see across the city, you know, whether it be the vacant storefronts on Salem Street or anywhere else.

1350
01:49:56,905 --> 01:50:00,727
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, you look at the roads or anywhere in Boston Ave, Winthrop Street, or around the Hillside area.

1351
01:50:00,747 --> 01:50:09,350
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, if you're not trying to attract, as Councilor Marks alluded to, and support those desirable businesses, you're going to get the less than desirable ones.

1352
01:50:10,371 --> 01:50:11,811
[SPEAKER_33]: It's like maintaining your front lawn.

1353
01:50:12,011 --> 01:50:15,793
[SPEAKER_33]: If you don't water, you don't fertilize, you don't care for it, you're going to get weeds.

1354
01:50:16,073 --> 01:50:16,773
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's what we're getting.

1355
01:50:17,033 --> 01:50:18,434
[SPEAKER_33]: We're getting weeds in Medford Square.

1356
01:50:19,293 --> 01:50:23,336
[SPEAKER_33]: We need City Hall to be at the forefront of attracting new businesses.

1357
01:50:23,676 --> 01:50:27,559
[SPEAKER_33]: And sure, we can say, gosh, you know, the Office of Community Development, you know, doesn't have enough resources.

1358
01:50:27,619 --> 01:50:28,079
[SPEAKER_33]: That's true.

1359
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:29,881
[SPEAKER_33]: The city can find resources.

1360
01:50:29,901 --> 01:50:32,242
[SPEAKER_33]: We've got a $155 million budget.

1361
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:38,767
[SPEAKER_33]: The mayor miraculously found $250,000, much to his, you know, applause, to fund the, you know, the library.

1362
01:50:39,067 --> 01:50:45,232
[SPEAKER_33]: But why aren't we making the investments at something that actually will generate additional tax revenues for this city?

1363
01:50:45,632 --> 01:50:46,973
[SPEAKER_33]: Where is that investment being made?

1364
01:50:47,772 --> 01:50:49,213
[SPEAKER_33]: And this isn't a new problem.

1365
01:50:49,513 --> 01:50:53,874
[SPEAKER_33]: This isn't something that, you know, we just woke up and say, oh, gosh, look, there's empty storefronts in Medford Square.

1366
01:50:54,335 --> 01:51:00,757
[SPEAKER_33]: Or, you know, now we've got a pawn shop, and it is a pawn shop right next to a questionable salon.

1367
01:51:02,778 --> 01:51:08,240
[SPEAKER_33]: Back in 2004, there was an effort, a Medford Square master plan.

1368
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,241
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a great document.

1369
01:51:10,481 --> 01:51:13,382
[SPEAKER_33]: I remember attending a lot of public hearings and listening to things about it.

1370
01:51:14,162 --> 01:51:15,583
[SPEAKER_33]: Lots of really great ideas in there.

1371
01:51:16,057 --> 01:51:18,579
[SPEAKER_33]: Unfortunately, it seems no one in this building has actually read it.

1372
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,882
[SPEAKER_33]: Because the challenge is, it's a beautiful document.

1373
01:51:22,623 --> 01:51:23,664
[SPEAKER_33]: It's got a blueprint.

1374
01:51:23,784 --> 01:51:26,466
[SPEAKER_33]: It tells this city what it should be doing.

1375
01:51:27,407 --> 01:51:28,888
[SPEAKER_33]: Put a marketing plan in place.

1376
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:32,191
[SPEAKER_33]: Start investing in these abandoned lots that are parking lots.

1377
01:51:32,615 --> 01:51:41,863
[SPEAKER_33]: You turn those into private development, build new buildings here, start to incite and be that catalyst for this eastern side of the square.

1378
01:51:42,543 --> 01:52:01,739
[SPEAKER_33]: Put in facade improvements and other ordinances that mandate and even support and even help maybe provide tax incentives or even low-interest loans so that buildings along Riverside and Salem Street can make the investments necessary to replace the chipping paint, to replace the torn awnings, to replace the chipping concrete in each of those buildings.

1379
01:52:02,062 --> 01:52:04,085
[SPEAKER_33]: No reputable business wants to come into those spaces.

1380
01:52:04,706 --> 01:52:15,620
[SPEAKER_33]: I congratulate and I applaud folks like Mystic Coffee Roasters and Carroll's and Tinosh and Salvatore's and unfortunately, as of recently, Best Sellers, but these guys can't do it on their own.

1381
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:17,322
[SPEAKER_33]: They need this city.

1382
01:52:17,738 --> 01:52:21,401
[SPEAKER_33]: to make the investments and make the priority decisions that need to be done.

1383
01:52:21,421 --> 01:52:23,323
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, other cities are doing it.

1384
01:52:23,383 --> 01:52:24,203
[SPEAKER_33]: Boston has it.

1385
01:52:24,624 --> 01:52:25,424
[SPEAKER_33]: Cambridge has it.

1386
01:52:25,505 --> 01:52:26,225
[SPEAKER_33]: Somerville has it.

1387
01:52:26,265 --> 01:52:27,626
[SPEAKER_33]: God, even Malden has it.

1388
01:52:27,666 --> 01:52:31,450
[SPEAKER_33]: And God forbid we compare ourselves to Malden, but they've got a redevelopment authority.

1389
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:32,751
[SPEAKER_33]: Where is Medford?

1390
01:52:33,011 --> 01:52:34,352
[SPEAKER_33]: Where's our marketing plan?

1391
01:52:34,812 --> 01:52:36,594
[SPEAKER_33]: Why aren't we out there banging on the trees?

1392
01:52:36,634 --> 01:52:37,655
[SPEAKER_33]: Where's the mayor talking?

1393
01:52:37,675 --> 01:52:41,958
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, sure, maybe Office of Community Development can't do it by themselves, but there's a lot of other people in this building.

1394
01:52:41,978 --> 01:52:43,039
[SPEAKER_33]: Where's the Chamber of Commerce?

1395
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:46,222
[SPEAKER_33]: Who's out there trying to advocate for the city of Medford?

1396
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:56,377
[SPEAKER_33]: Why does it have to be citizen groups like the Medford Community Coalition and CASH that are holding cash mobs and cleanups and concerts and street fairs trying to breathe life back into the square?

1397
01:52:56,717 --> 01:52:59,459
[SPEAKER_33]: It needs to be this building that leads the charge.

1398
01:52:59,999 --> 01:53:04,742
[SPEAKER_33]: And let's not think that, you know, businesses aren't just simply about, you know, profits and business owners.

1399
01:53:05,142 --> 01:53:11,807
[SPEAKER_33]: They're about, as we're starting to see here with respect to the pawn shop and the spa, they're about public safety.

1400
01:53:12,188 --> 01:53:17,072
[SPEAKER_33]: But they're also about generating diversity in terms of reflecting the diverse needs of the city.

1401
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:18,514
[SPEAKER_33]: They generate tax dollars.

1402
01:53:18,994 --> 01:53:22,477
[SPEAKER_33]: They improve the opportunities to invest in other things.

1403
01:53:22,718 --> 01:53:24,099
[SPEAKER_33]: They bring jobs to our neighbors.

1404
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,482
[SPEAKER_33]: It's time the city gets serious about economic development.

1405
01:53:27,502 --> 01:53:29,944
[SPEAKER_33]: We've been talking about it for years and years and years.

1406
01:53:30,264 --> 01:53:31,065
[SPEAKER_33]: We've got a plan.

1407
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:32,046
[SPEAKER_33]: We've got the ideas.

1408
01:53:32,086 --> 01:53:35,309
[SPEAKER_33]: We just need people to actually start doing their jobs and make it happen.

1409
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:36,130
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1410
01:53:42,245 --> 01:53:44,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1411
01:53:45,006 --> 01:53:47,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Margaret Weigel, 64 Forest Street.

1412
01:53:49,268 --> 01:53:52,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would like to say that I've heard a lot about these businesses.

1413
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:53,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really tall.

1414
01:53:54,771 --> 01:53:57,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming into quote, unquote, residential areas.

1415
01:53:59,493 --> 01:53:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

1416
01:54:00,073 --> 01:54:00,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me now?

1417
01:54:01,493 --> 01:54:02,074
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, good.

1418
01:54:02,214 --> 01:54:02,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

1419
01:54:04,195 --> 01:54:08,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about it coming into residential areas, but Medford Square is my backyard.

1420
01:54:08,577 --> 01:54:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I live.

1421
01:54:09,677 --> 01:54:11,738
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I get off the bus to walk to home.

1422
01:54:12,404 --> 01:54:17,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk off the bus sometimes at 8 o'clock and everything is closed except Asian Body Works.

1423
01:54:18,457 --> 01:54:22,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's become a very different place in recent weeks since it opened.

1424
01:54:23,437 --> 01:54:31,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to reiterate the comments that I've heard from my citizens about being a little bit more proactive about the kind of businesses that come into the square.

1425
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:42,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Medford has adopted either accidentally or just by default a program of benign neglect in terms of the business development, and I think it's one of those things.

1426
01:54:42,524 --> 01:54:49,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I know money is hard to come by and nobody wants to spend the money, but it's the kind of investment that will be paid back tenfold once

1427
01:54:49,968 --> 01:54:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: it's implemented, it will attract new revenue, it will attract other attractive businesses.

1428
01:54:54,890 --> 01:55:01,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford will be the place that people choose to come to instead of being the default city because they are priced out of other communities.

1429
01:55:03,073 --> 01:55:11,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I think other people have said everything that I want to say, but I did want to reiterate that Medford Square is home to a lot of people too.

1430
01:55:11,497 --> 01:55:12,257
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all, thank you.

1431
01:55:16,459 --> 01:55:18,480
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1432
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:28,106
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Sharon Hepburn, 228 Governors Avenue, and also owner of Mystic Coffee Roaster at 30 Riverside Avenue, just two doors down from the new establishment.

1433
01:55:29,808 --> 01:55:32,110
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to echo what has already been said.

1434
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:35,152
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the result of no city planning.

1435
01:55:36,293 --> 01:55:38,895
[SPEAKER_23]: We really need a strong community development office.

1436
01:55:39,315 --> 01:55:41,177
[SPEAKER_23]: We need you guys to all work together.

1437
01:55:41,197 --> 01:55:45,840
[SPEAKER_23]: The city does need to be leading the charge on this.

1438
01:55:46,721 --> 01:55:49,283
[SPEAKER_23]: And we as a community are trying to come together,

1439
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:54,473
[SPEAKER_23]: to do something about it, but we can't do it all, and you guys need to help us.

1440
01:55:55,734 --> 01:55:59,597
[SPEAKER_23]: And whoever's running for mayor needs to be listening, because you guys are on notice.

1441
01:56:00,458 --> 01:56:02,179
[SPEAKER_23]: We're watching, all right?

1442
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:15,168
[SPEAKER_23]: I would also like to explore maybe the idea of if anything illegal is happening in these places, are landlords culpable for the illegal activity going on?

1443
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:20,783
[SPEAKER_23]: I really think the city needs to work with the landlords in the square.

1444
01:56:20,803 --> 01:56:28,752
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of places are going out of business because the rents are being jacked up, and we have empty storefronts.

1445
01:56:32,088 --> 01:56:35,551
[SPEAKER_23]: is working to bring in new businesses.

1446
01:56:35,951 --> 01:56:45,439
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have to tell you, I have been approached by other community development offices from other cities to locate in other cities.

1447
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:46,420
[SPEAKER_23]: But this is my city.

1448
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:47,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to be here.

1449
01:56:48,381 --> 01:56:55,868
[SPEAKER_23]: And like I said, we really need the city to be leading the charge on this.

1450
01:56:56,988 --> 01:56:57,309
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1451
01:56:57,729 --> 01:56:58,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1452
01:57:02,045 --> 01:57:03,926
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1453
01:57:04,306 --> 01:57:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Jay Campbell.

1454
01:57:05,386 --> 01:57:07,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 707 Fulton Street.

1455
01:57:07,247 --> 01:57:08,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really just myself a resident.

1456
01:57:08,987 --> 01:57:13,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to give my two cents on the whole thing with the massage parlors and everything else.

1457
01:57:14,469 --> 01:57:15,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great that you brought it up.

1458
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:16,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great point.

1459
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:22,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that a lot of people don't realize that you cannot legally tell a business not to come into the city.

1460
01:57:23,212 --> 01:57:25,033
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you can do is create zoning.

1461
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something that MedFed lacks.

1462
01:57:27,311 --> 01:57:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, myself, any of you, anyone here, could open up a strip club next to Bistro 5, because it's a legal business and you can.

1463
01:57:37,414 --> 01:57:44,036
[SPEAKER_02]: What you do need is adult zoning in the city of MedFed.

1464
01:57:44,056 --> 01:57:45,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen, oh, I was talking to other people.

1465
01:57:45,677 --> 01:57:47,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Penta.

1466
01:57:47,717 --> 01:57:48,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have that?

1467
01:57:48,678 --> 01:57:48,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1468
01:57:49,858 --> 01:57:52,779
[SPEAKER_09]: You made a comment about next to Bistro 5, you could put a strip joint.

1469
01:57:53,132 --> 01:57:55,194
[SPEAKER_09]: City of Medford has what they call an entertainment zone.

1470
01:57:55,214 --> 01:57:57,797
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one spot in the city and that's on the end of Mystic Avenue.

1471
01:57:58,117 --> 01:57:59,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only place that something like that.

1472
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:00,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1473
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was on the stand that we didn't have it.

1474
01:58:01,761 --> 01:58:02,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fantastic.

1475
01:58:02,642 --> 01:58:07,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be great if we could maybe take that and add some of these other businesses that might be cropping up.

1476
01:58:08,151 --> 01:58:10,373
[SPEAKER_02]: into that same category, like zone it that way.

1477
01:58:11,473 --> 01:58:13,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you don't have this issue.

1478
01:58:13,955 --> 01:58:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can't say to somebody, we think you're sketchy, we don't really want you here, but you don't really know.

1479
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is, chief, if you need someone for social media, give me a call.

1480
01:58:25,282 --> 01:58:25,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to help.

1481
01:58:26,623 --> 01:58:27,704
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to bring that up.

1482
01:58:27,744 --> 01:58:31,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to know that Medford does have that zoning, because I wasn't aware of that.

1483
01:58:31,346 --> 01:58:31,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.

1484
01:58:31,987 --> 01:58:32,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1485
01:58:32,707 --> 01:58:33,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1486
01:58:38,854 --> 01:58:46,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I haven't changed my address, so do I necessarily need to give my name and address?

1487
01:58:48,402 --> 01:58:57,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm probably the only person here that's going to ask some interesting and technical questions.

1488
01:58:59,791 --> 01:59:03,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, but this is ringing in my ears, and I can't hear it.

1489
01:59:04,251 --> 01:59:06,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to do two things at once with it.

1490
01:59:07,232 --> 01:59:12,353
[SPEAKER_11]: One, hear from it, and the other one, make sure it doesn't ring in your microphones.

1491
01:59:13,273 --> 01:59:15,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, the gentleman before me is right.

1492
01:59:16,153 --> 01:59:20,914
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't actually not let some businesses in.

1493
01:59:21,335 --> 01:59:25,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I've been hearing it as a pawn shop, the business.

1494
01:59:26,336 --> 01:59:32,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you'll have to excuse me, but the pawn shop

1495
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:37,869
[SPEAKER_11]: TV show is one of the most popular TV shows in the United States.

1496
01:59:38,509 --> 01:59:44,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It keeps a station on cable TV.

1497
01:59:45,813 --> 01:59:52,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Hence, there are probably as equal many people out here on the pawn shop.

1498
01:59:52,376 --> 01:59:58,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never been invited to the circle of the square things, nor somebody my age.

1499
01:59:59,418 --> 02:00:02,020
[SPEAKER_11]: probably, or have been too often.

1500
02:00:03,161 --> 02:00:13,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, there are more 50-year-olds in the city than there are under 50 who do the voting.

1501
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:15,611
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I know that?

1502
02:00:15,631 --> 02:00:22,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Because as at least several of you have worked on your campaigns, and we've proven that.

1503
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:31,231
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing is, the pawn shop is a secondary market for products.

1504
02:00:32,751 --> 02:00:39,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like Morgan Memorial, just like Salvation Army.

1505
02:00:39,813 --> 02:00:46,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Now when I got out of the Army, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross helped me with my disabilities.

1506
02:00:47,574 --> 02:00:52,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I got out of the Army, and that was in the 60s by the way, I'm an old man now,

1507
02:00:53,668 --> 02:01:01,155
[SPEAKER_11]: The only one that pawn shop type business that helped me was the Salvation Army.

1508
02:01:02,677 --> 02:01:08,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I've bought clothes and products in the so-called pawn shop.

1509
02:01:08,142 --> 02:01:09,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know it was a pawn shop.

1510
02:01:09,723 --> 02:01:11,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was a secondary shop.

1511
02:01:12,686 --> 02:01:17,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think it has a pawn shop license, so I wouldn't call it a pawn shop.

1512
02:01:19,516 --> 02:01:27,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what you're doing is saying we want the square and the people in the square for one group of people.

1513
02:01:28,218 --> 02:01:30,959
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, I also made Medford my home.

1514
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:37,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't come here because it was a dirty, rotten place.

1515
02:01:37,721 --> 02:01:38,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was quite good.

1516
02:01:38,941 --> 02:01:41,122
[SPEAKER_11]: That was 30 years ago.

1517
02:01:41,922 --> 02:01:46,403
[SPEAKER_11]: But the people in Cambridge, as these people say, are fighting

1518
02:01:48,006 --> 02:01:58,948
[SPEAKER_11]: to stay in their homes because of the developers and because of the kinds of things, stores, that you're talking about.

1519
02:01:59,428 --> 02:02:02,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're trying to get back to the community again.

1520
02:02:02,729 --> 02:02:05,429
[SPEAKER_11]: The African-Americans were thrown out of Cambridge.

1521
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:07,649
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I know that?

1522
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:09,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I lived there when it happened.

1523
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:16,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I also argued at 20 similar arguments than I am arguing today.

1524
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:19,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you need to, yes, I agree with them.

1525
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:21,933
[SPEAKER_11]: You need a development, some development.

1526
02:02:22,093 --> 02:02:34,864
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also think taking pot shots by candidates who come up here at groups is not the way to settle a problem.

1527
02:02:35,384 --> 02:02:44,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the way to settle a problem is to be a more unified city and invite people to come who they don't normally invite.

1528
02:02:45,505 --> 02:02:52,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk to their neighbors, all their neighbors, not the specific ones that are friends of theirs.

1529
02:02:54,247 --> 02:02:57,768
[SPEAKER_11]: All their neighbors, like the West Medford Community Center.

1530
02:02:58,028 --> 02:03:07,830
[SPEAKER_11]: How many times have they gone down there and said, since some of those people probably, and I don't know how many, go and use that pawn shop?

1531
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:13,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the cost of whatever x is as a product

1532
02:03:15,197 --> 02:03:17,378
[SPEAKER_11]: is $10, $20 higher.

1533
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:28,684
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're saying, and what I heard, was inequality, economic slavery, for only the wealthy to come into Medford.

1534
02:03:29,024 --> 02:03:31,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I happen to own a business since 1982.

1535
02:03:34,127 --> 02:03:43,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I happen to not rent anything in Medford Square, but though I know a lot of them, because I happen to also be a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

1536
02:03:44,453 --> 02:03:52,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they do an adequate job in a time, in a place, when there was no money out there for anything.

1537
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:55,239
[SPEAKER_11]: We forgot we just went through a recession.

1538
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:01,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Have we forgotten so quickly that only one group of people gets to run the city?

1539
02:04:02,363 --> 02:04:03,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

1540
02:04:03,804 --> 02:04:05,805
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to sit down.

1541
02:04:06,586 --> 02:04:10,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, after my conversation, there won't be unity with me.

1542
02:04:10,968 --> 02:04:13,550
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's exactly the problem.

1543
02:04:14,501 --> 02:04:24,170
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is we put groups together who are, by the way, flip houses so that they can make lots of money.

1544
02:04:25,071 --> 02:04:30,877
[SPEAKER_11]: We put people who are developers, and we let them come up here, and they're the only ones that speak.

1545
02:04:31,397 --> 02:04:35,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I own a mortgage company, and I'm going to tell you one thing.

1546
02:04:40,269 --> 02:04:50,959
[SPEAKER_11]: The poor and the working people are just as good as the people who call themselves the circle of the square.

1547
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:57,805
[SPEAKER_11]: And the next time, maybe they should invite some more people for the circle of the square.

1548
02:04:58,145 --> 02:05:00,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen them in my neighborhood.

1549
02:05:00,707 --> 02:05:03,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen them give a flyer in my house.

1550
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:06,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen them make a call to my wife.

1551
02:05:07,329 --> 02:05:11,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard anything except they do do events.

1552
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:17,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've also seen some of them take credit for events that the Kwan and hims did.

1553
02:05:18,872 --> 02:05:25,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's kind of a class warfare that you're having in here tonight.

1554
02:05:25,794 --> 02:05:26,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And you ought to stop it.

1555
02:05:27,414 --> 02:05:29,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm one of the wealthy people in the city too.

1556
02:05:30,315 --> 02:05:34,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm one of the people who grew up around this community.

1557
02:05:34,736 --> 02:05:36,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are a heck of a lot of us out there.

1558
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:43,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that there's some of you on the city council right now who own businesses in this camp.

1559
02:05:44,433 --> 02:05:49,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Rick Caraviello, the president, Ms.

1560
02:05:49,156 --> 02:05:49,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Lungo.

1561
02:05:51,137 --> 02:05:54,379
[SPEAKER_11]: And you ought to take a look at what's going on here.

1562
02:05:54,939 --> 02:06:00,442
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want a city of only young people or only bar rooms.

1563
02:06:01,418 --> 02:06:03,539
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want that kind of city.

1564
02:06:04,099 --> 02:06:14,123
[SPEAKER_11]: You want a city that is inclusive and that it's not economically driven by one thing, profit.

1565
02:06:14,443 --> 02:06:15,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1566
02:06:16,864 --> 02:06:18,785
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record, Senator.

1567
02:06:20,026 --> 02:06:21,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1568
02:06:21,386 --> 02:06:23,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob Cappucci, 71 Evans Street.

1569
02:06:23,207 --> 02:06:25,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just be as brief as I possibly can be.

1570
02:06:26,989 --> 02:06:29,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this problem is actually a little bit larger

1571
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:46,934
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would only respectfully ask this body to maybe bring in our state representatives and state senator into this, because other than these massage parlors, anybody with a smartphone or a laptop can go to craigslist.com or Backpage.

1572
02:06:47,374 --> 02:06:55,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I know in recent years, they do like these sting operations for these massage people that are operating out of hotels.

1573
02:06:55,762 --> 02:06:57,403
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people that are coming in out of state

1574
02:06:57,796 --> 02:07:04,882
[SPEAKER_07]: staying here a week, a weekend, and there's just a lot of this, and it's rampant on the internet.

1575
02:07:05,022 --> 02:07:15,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we can engage our state representatives to maybe have the Massachusetts State Police to look in this beyond what's being offered here tonight.

1576
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:16,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1577
02:07:16,771 --> 02:07:17,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1578
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:20,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record, please.

1579
02:07:20,454 --> 02:07:20,874
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

1580
02:07:20,894 --> 02:07:22,695
[SPEAKER_31]: Mario Martin at 198 Harvard Street.

1581
02:07:23,516 --> 02:07:24,577
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to

1582
02:07:27,618 --> 02:07:34,063
[SPEAKER_31]: sort of echo a little bit of some of the comments that were mentioned earlier in terms of economic growth and development here.

1583
02:07:34,103 --> 02:07:41,109
[SPEAKER_31]: I think Mark Crowley really nailed it in terms of how we look at opportunities to see growth.

1584
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:54,339
[SPEAKER_31]: But if we actually take a second to apply that same principle to the current situation, which is this massage parlor and the pawn shop,

1585
02:07:55,043 --> 02:08:03,786
[SPEAKER_31]: Typically, if you think about it, when a business starts up, they consider many factors in terms of how they're going to operate their business.

1586
02:08:04,807 --> 02:08:06,867
[SPEAKER_31]: One is an opportunity.

1587
02:08:07,488 --> 02:08:17,251
[SPEAKER_31]: Two, they develop a marketing structure, a basic analysis of how they're going to push this product, whether a product or a service.

1588
02:08:17,992 --> 02:08:20,973
[SPEAKER_31]: And then lastly, they look for a demographic.

1589
02:08:23,294 --> 02:08:24,094
[SPEAKER_31]: A pawn shop.

1590
02:08:24,952 --> 02:08:34,195
[SPEAKER_31]: and a massage parlor, these specific types of businesses only look for certain types of demographics.

1591
02:08:34,235 --> 02:08:41,338
[SPEAKER_31]: And it'd be really, really sad to have that conversation about whether this is that type of demographic that they're looking for.

1592
02:08:41,478 --> 02:08:43,798
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know, that's something to really, really consider.

1593
02:08:44,499 --> 02:08:44,839
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1594
02:08:47,039 --> 02:08:47,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1595
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:48,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1596
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:54,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully tonight some of the comments and questions that the coalition and other people have made

1597
02:08:55,967 --> 02:08:57,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll echo into City Hall.

1598
02:08:58,269 --> 02:09:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope that going forward that the new mayor, whoever it may be, would consider opening an office of redevelopments to help the people in the city.

1599
02:09:10,054 --> 02:09:16,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, please, when you're addressing these establishments, please note that they are not massage parlors.

1600
02:09:17,358 --> 02:09:18,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the confusion comes in with people.

1601
02:09:19,239 --> 02:09:20,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They're body work establishments.

1602
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Massage parlors are licensed by the state.

1603
02:09:23,850 --> 02:09:31,936
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are not massage parlors, and they give the legitimate massage parlors, like Massage Envy and all these other places, they give them a bad name.

1604
02:09:31,956 --> 02:09:36,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people reference them, you reference them as bodywork establishments.

1605
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:38,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the confusion comes in.

1606
02:09:40,163 --> 02:09:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1607
02:09:40,884 --> 02:09:41,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1608
02:09:41,064 --> 02:09:42,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

1609
02:09:42,965 --> 02:09:43,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, sure.

1610
02:09:43,506 --> 02:09:45,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Carlson Claudio, 2 Yeomans Avenue in Medford.

1611
02:09:46,608 --> 02:09:49,711
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to thank you, Councilor Claviello, very much for bringing this to light.

1612
02:09:50,291 --> 02:09:52,593
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that everyone in their packet has received

1613
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:02,407
[SPEAKER_18]: from the Councilor, the paper article that was in the Herald, explaining in detail everything that's gone on previously with these places.

1614
02:10:02,808 --> 02:10:04,689
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's absolutely right.

1615
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:09,433
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, massage parlors, as well as therapeutic, all around.

1616
02:10:09,473 --> 02:10:10,533
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have open windows.

1617
02:10:10,593 --> 02:10:17,038
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're in places like 101 Main Street, where you go there and they're helping people.

1618
02:10:17,479 --> 02:10:18,760
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not blacked out windows.

1619
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:21,342
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had this conversation with our

1620
02:10:22,082 --> 02:10:26,486
[SPEAKER_18]: City Solicitor before, and I've also had it with the people up at City Hall.

1621
02:10:27,947 --> 02:10:30,749
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had a runaround for over 10 months with this.

1622
02:10:31,569 --> 02:10:36,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody seems to have any jurisdiction whatsoever over these establishments and these people.

1623
02:10:37,354 --> 02:10:40,456
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to the Board of Health, they're telling you, oh, it's been out of our hands.

1624
02:10:41,077 --> 02:10:41,938
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been out of our hands.

1625
02:10:41,998 --> 02:10:43,299
[SPEAKER_18]: The state took it out of our hands.

1626
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:44,099
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the end of it.

1627
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:51,325
[SPEAKER_18]: So that means to say that they have no recourse to go in to see if there's anything that shouldn't be going on.

1628
02:10:51,718 --> 02:10:58,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Never mind in terms of the activity, but maybe the health, the cleanliness, the codes that should be enforced in any business.

1629
02:10:59,784 --> 02:11:03,326
[SPEAKER_18]: You go to the administrations, and the administrations tell you the same thing.

1630
02:11:03,767 --> 02:11:09,350
[SPEAKER_18]: I've spoken with people in our state delegation, and they turn around and say, well, it's out of our jurisdiction.

1631
02:11:09,371 --> 02:11:10,611
[SPEAKER_18]: You should go back to the Board of Health.

1632
02:11:11,392 --> 02:11:12,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Believe it or not, this has happened.

1633
02:11:13,682 --> 02:11:15,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Robert Capucci was absolutely right.

1634
02:11:15,703 --> 02:11:28,270
[SPEAKER_18]: This needs the work of all seven Councilors, the administration, city solicitors sitting out there, this police department to work together solidly and to get to a state delegation.

1635
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:38,735
[SPEAKER_18]: In that article, for people that don't know, you people have had it and you've read it, you definitely need to go and change statutory law.

1636
02:11:39,812 --> 02:11:41,013
[SPEAKER_18]: That's probably number one.

1637
02:11:41,733 --> 02:11:48,999
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, they can keep an eye on these things and put out what's needed in order to deter some of this.

1638
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:59,887
[SPEAKER_18]: The establishment that's on Central Avenue just this week had an orange poster put up by, I believe it was the Department of Taxation.

1639
02:12:00,508 --> 02:12:01,729
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not 100% sure of it.

1640
02:12:02,789 --> 02:12:07,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Within a few moments of that being up and the light show turned off, they were told to close their establishment.

1641
02:12:09,414 --> 02:12:13,615
[SPEAKER_18]: People within themselves put a piece of paper over that.

1642
02:12:14,075 --> 02:12:15,636
[SPEAKER_18]: They didn't want it seen from the street.

1643
02:12:15,876 --> 02:12:16,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally illegal to do.

1644
02:12:16,936 --> 02:12:18,516
[SPEAKER_18]: I think anyone here understands that.

1645
02:12:18,956 --> 02:12:19,456
[SPEAKER_18]: And they know it.

1646
02:12:19,536 --> 02:12:20,997
[SPEAKER_18]: I wished I had been home at the time.

1647
02:12:21,497 --> 02:12:23,757
[SPEAKER_18]: My neighbor next door went to take pictures of that.

1648
02:12:24,638 --> 02:12:28,419
[SPEAKER_18]: The people came out and literally chased her away and actually followed her in her car.

1649
02:12:28,839 --> 02:12:33,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Wanted to know what right she had to take pictures, talk about harassing neighbors.

1650
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:38,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Had I been there and I seen that, I would have called the state police, not Medford police.

1651
02:12:38,675 --> 02:12:46,297
[SPEAKER_18]: because that there is something that the state police, that was an enactment from the taxation department, probably out of the jurisdiction of the regular police.

1652
02:12:46,937 --> 02:12:47,958
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what should have happened.

1653
02:12:48,298 --> 02:12:49,758
[SPEAKER_18]: These are some of the things that go on.

1654
02:12:50,938 --> 02:12:54,279
[SPEAKER_18]: I've also spoken with John Brabuso many a times.

1655
02:12:54,979 --> 02:12:56,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Look, we've got an illegal sign out there.

1656
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:59,381
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a sign that's hanging four feet up.

1657
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:00,121
[SPEAKER_18]: It's electrical.

1658
02:13:01,401 --> 02:13:02,301
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a wire.

1659
02:13:02,321 --> 02:13:03,902
[SPEAKER_18]: They close the door on the wire.

1660
02:13:04,062 --> 02:13:06,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Every day it gets put out, puts back open.

1661
02:13:06,963 --> 02:13:08,003
[SPEAKER_18]: He did contact them.

1662
02:13:08,972 --> 02:13:11,613
[SPEAKER_18]: did his due diligence and asked them not to have the running light.

1663
02:13:12,233 --> 02:13:13,713
[SPEAKER_18]: That's against our sign ordinance.

1664
02:13:14,273 --> 02:13:16,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta, you and I did legislation on that.

1665
02:13:16,974 --> 02:13:20,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Two and a half years to write that up, along with the Chamber of Commerce.

1666
02:13:20,955 --> 02:13:22,876
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a good policy that we put in place.

1667
02:13:23,616 --> 02:13:24,796
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to be looked into.

1668
02:13:25,677 --> 02:13:32,418
[SPEAKER_18]: He told me about the possibility of jeopardizing, you know, investigatory work that might be going on.

1669
02:13:32,878 --> 02:13:33,919
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's all well and good.

1670
02:13:34,119 --> 02:13:36,880
[SPEAKER_18]: It's taking far too long, in my view, to begin with.

1671
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:38,560
[SPEAKER_18]: This just shouldn't be happening.

1672
02:13:39,631 --> 02:13:40,952
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking about these places.

1673
02:13:40,972 --> 02:13:42,392
[SPEAKER_18]: There was one of them on Chipman Street.

1674
02:13:42,632 --> 02:13:44,533
[SPEAKER_18]: People know the city, know where Chipman Street is.

1675
02:13:45,053 --> 02:13:45,873
[SPEAKER_18]: There are no stores.

1676
02:13:45,913 --> 02:13:46,974
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no con or anything.

1677
02:13:47,534 --> 02:13:53,696
[SPEAKER_18]: You couldn't even say it's in a mixed zone of allowable mixed use, strictly residential, SF2.

1678
02:13:54,697 --> 02:13:55,917
[SPEAKER_18]: And they've been there for some time.

1679
02:13:56,477 --> 02:14:01,759
[SPEAKER_18]: They go out on their own volition because, you know, it just isn't profitable for them anymore.

1680
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:06,441
[SPEAKER_18]: It comes to my understanding, they really don't care whether it's profitable or not.

1681
02:14:06,941 --> 02:14:08,942
[SPEAKER_18]: The bigger picture is, is that it's alleged.

1682
02:14:09,493 --> 02:14:13,477
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to say that, that there's human trafficking going on with this here.

1683
02:14:14,238 --> 02:14:20,685
[SPEAKER_18]: That there's larger people involved in what goes on, and they're bringing in these young women.

1684
02:14:20,805 --> 02:14:25,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're doing it, and they're putting some of these establishments here, there, and everywhere in their names.

1685
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:28,981
[SPEAKER_18]: not in any consortium, not in any large picture.

1686
02:14:29,581 --> 02:14:31,242
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a much bigger issue over here.

1687
02:14:31,562 --> 02:14:36,964
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to challenge this city council, all seven members, and the rest of the administration.

1688
02:14:37,984 --> 02:14:39,505
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we going to do about this here?

1689
02:14:39,545 --> 02:14:41,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are we going to go with this here, with the state?

1690
02:14:42,065 --> 02:14:44,926
[SPEAKER_18]: That young lady's question from the coalition was never answered.

1691
02:14:44,986 --> 02:14:48,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Can anybody here answer as to what jurisdiction that comes under?

1692
02:14:49,268 --> 02:14:55,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair, I would like to ask our city clerk, do you know if any of these establishments have come to you

1693
02:14:56,128 --> 02:15:01,212
[SPEAKER_18]: and registered, as every other business in this community does, have they had to register?

1694
02:15:01,892 --> 02:15:04,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Have they gone through your office, Mr. Clerk, through the chair?

1695
02:15:06,675 --> 02:15:08,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, obviously, there's two options to go.

1696
02:15:08,857 --> 02:15:09,777
[SPEAKER_20]: You can incorporate.

1697
02:15:10,058 --> 02:15:10,678
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that again?

1698
02:15:10,698 --> 02:15:11,258
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1699
02:15:11,278 --> 02:15:12,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Two options to go on this thing.

1700
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:22,866
[SPEAKER_20]: You can incorporate your name to establish a business in City of Medford, or you can do a DBA, which is a business registration.

1701
02:15:24,165 --> 02:15:30,348
[SPEAKER_20]: But the business registration doesn't tell you types of business it is.

1702
02:15:31,129 --> 02:15:35,371
[SPEAKER_20]: So it could be Carl's, and I wouldn't know what that business would be.

1703
02:15:36,431 --> 02:15:40,173
[SPEAKER_18]: But is there any way that you would have, whether it's an address or a person, what have you?

1704
02:15:40,554 --> 02:15:52,540
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that, you know, when my boys had a business down in Medford Square, they had to go through the clerk's office, you weren't at the time, and register their names, their addresses, their phone numbers, and everything else that had to go along with it.

1705
02:15:52,927 --> 02:16:00,652
[SPEAKER_18]: And actually, it does state what type of a business on their slip, which they still hold, as to what was going to be taking place on that particular business.

1706
02:16:00,972 --> 02:16:01,693
[SPEAKER_18]: I still have that.

1707
02:16:02,693 --> 02:16:03,214
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wondering.

1708
02:16:03,634 --> 02:16:08,998
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing that goes on is we come to find out there's really been nothing up at City Hall.

1709
02:16:09,658 --> 02:16:15,082
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe we've investigated, we've looked into it somewhat in terms of are there electrical permits pulled?

1710
02:16:15,422 --> 02:16:20,245
[SPEAKER_18]: These people are doing major remodeling in these, whether it's a little place or the one open up down the square.

1711
02:16:20,761 --> 02:16:21,702
[SPEAKER_18]: There's walls going up.

1712
02:16:21,722 --> 02:16:23,503
[SPEAKER_18]: There's obviously electrical work being done.

1713
02:16:23,823 --> 02:16:25,785
[SPEAKER_18]: There's probably some plumbing work being done.

1714
02:16:26,145 --> 02:16:27,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Are the toilets handicap accessible?

1715
02:16:29,067 --> 02:16:31,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they're usually not in those particular buildings.

1716
02:16:31,369 --> 02:16:32,009
[SPEAKER_18]: They're up steps.

1717
02:16:32,049 --> 02:16:32,970
[SPEAKER_18]: They're down in the basement.

1718
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:34,491
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that stretch of building.

1719
02:16:35,332 --> 02:16:36,413
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't come under coat.

1720
02:16:37,273 --> 02:16:38,534
[SPEAKER_18]: And they are.

1721
02:16:38,874 --> 02:16:40,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Now you've got your sign ordinance.

1722
02:16:40,936 --> 02:16:48,722
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a 35% rule that we increased from 25% to 35% when the sign ordinance was reviewed and passed.

1723
02:16:49,809 --> 02:16:53,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, to block a window completely with a spray paint is certainly more than 35%.

1724
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:58,591
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another against the city ordinance that's there.

1725
02:16:59,111 --> 02:17:05,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Regardless of any other investigations go on, and I asked John DeRusso that, and he did act somewhat.

1726
02:17:06,573 --> 02:17:09,854
[SPEAKER_18]: He says you still have to maintain the ordinances that are there.

1727
02:17:11,227 --> 02:17:15,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Clearly, when it comes to those, those are visible, blatant violation.

1728
02:17:17,134 --> 02:17:24,122
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an awful lot here that's just slipping by the fingers because, and we've heard, I don't want to single out any agency.

1729
02:17:24,575 --> 02:17:26,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we really haven't heard a lot of complaints.

1730
02:17:26,958 --> 02:17:27,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you know, guess what?

1731
02:17:28,359 --> 02:17:30,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of the people in this city don't even know what these are.

1732
02:17:31,142 --> 02:17:42,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless you're living immediately around it, or like this has come to fruition now with Councilor Caraviello's initiatives, and because it's down in our main square, all of a sudden the light bulb goes off.

1733
02:17:43,336 --> 02:17:44,918
[SPEAKER_18]: People, this is a serious situation.

1734
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:55,376
[SPEAKER_18]: And I challenge everyone in this council and everyone up at this government ahead of us to get the ball rolling on this and to get a state delegation together.

1735
02:17:55,777 --> 02:18:00,020
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's get some laws changed and close the loopholes, as that article states.

1736
02:18:00,381 --> 02:18:03,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Loopholes were closed, and their ordinances are adhered to.

1737
02:18:03,423 --> 02:18:04,664
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was in the city of Plymouth.

1738
02:18:09,328 --> 02:18:10,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mr. Sincardi asked the clerk.

1739
02:18:12,595 --> 02:18:22,380
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only there's two ways you can record yourself here in the city as a corporation or What was the second one?

1740
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:33,125
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you get a business certificate it has to have an address on it and has to give you the name of the person Okay, so apparently our index at City Hall does not go by name It doesn't go by it.

1741
02:18:33,285 --> 02:18:35,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Can it go either way by name or address?

1742
02:18:35,526 --> 02:18:37,027
[SPEAKER_20]: Well the business certificate

1743
02:18:37,964 --> 02:18:41,227
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really, it's a state function for the cities and towns, you know.

1744
02:18:41,467 --> 02:18:44,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but the city charges $30 for somebody to get a business.

1745
02:18:44,930 --> 02:18:46,612
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't give you any rights or privileges.

1746
02:18:47,652 --> 02:18:48,693
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

1747
02:18:48,773 --> 02:18:55,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what he's saying Eddie is the fact that is there any record that shows that somebody either is a business operating or.

1748
02:18:55,499 --> 02:18:56,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, exactly.

1749
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:56,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they registered?

1750
02:18:57,001 --> 02:18:58,262
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they registered one way or the other?

1751
02:18:58,282 --> 02:18:58,742
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1752
02:18:59,223 --> 02:19:00,023
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't know the type.

1753
02:19:00,704 --> 02:19:01,004
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no.

1754
02:19:01,104 --> 02:19:01,445
[SPEAKER_20]: Again.

1755
02:19:03,602 --> 02:19:04,302
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the type.

1756
02:19:04,423 --> 02:19:06,624
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the name of the business and the street location.

1757
02:19:06,684 --> 02:19:14,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't, if you can't get it out by the name of the business, can you go by, if you went into our office right now, could you put up a two, uh, what's the name?

1758
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:15,749
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the address over there?

1759
02:19:15,929 --> 02:19:21,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's, it's 34 Riverside and your business and your business thing.

1760
02:19:21,452 --> 02:19:21,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it come up?

1761
02:19:22,532 --> 02:19:24,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you get something come up on your computer?

1762
02:19:25,133 --> 02:19:27,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Our software will come up, come up with the name.

1763
02:19:27,955 --> 02:19:28,815
[SPEAKER_20]: We can pull the name up.

1764
02:19:30,856 --> 02:19:31,757
[SPEAKER_20]: We can pull the name up.

1765
02:19:32,602 --> 02:19:36,843
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, pull the name or we can pull the street up, you know, and it now will lead us to it.

1766
02:19:36,983 --> 02:19:42,085
[SPEAKER_20]: So as in just recent investigation by the police, you know, they, they got that information.

1767
02:19:42,945 --> 02:19:46,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And do they have a name on, do they have anything at that address?

1768
02:19:47,306 --> 02:19:47,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1769
02:19:48,226 --> 02:19:48,366
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1770
02:19:48,386 --> 02:19:49,927
[SPEAKER_20]: The owner's name, where they're from.

1771
02:19:50,987 --> 02:19:52,407
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the owner, that's not the owner of the building.

1772
02:19:52,447 --> 02:19:54,148
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the renter of the rent, right?

1773
02:19:54,208 --> 02:20:01,410
[SPEAKER_20]: But the owner, you know, the renter or whatever, you'll tell them where they, you know, he, if he's a,

1774
02:20:02,224 --> 02:20:03,965
[SPEAKER_20]: sole proprietor of that business, right?

1775
02:20:04,366 --> 02:20:05,366
[SPEAKER_20]: And he lives in Malden.

1776
02:20:05,927 --> 02:20:12,151
[SPEAKER_20]: He's going to have to put his name in his address from Malden doing business at this particular address.

1777
02:20:13,792 --> 02:20:15,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the question is, is there a city solicitor?

1778
02:20:15,473 --> 02:20:16,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he still here?

1779
02:20:16,194 --> 02:20:19,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Mark.

1780
02:20:22,659 --> 02:20:28,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you came in after the fact, but we went through with the chamber some years ago, painstaking to change all these ordinances.

1781
02:20:29,721 --> 02:20:32,282
[SPEAKER_09]: The covering of the window, 40% was max.

1782
02:20:32,682 --> 02:20:34,003
[SPEAKER_29]: You mean for the sign ordinance?

1783
02:20:34,043 --> 02:20:35,604
[SPEAKER_09]: The sign ordinance, excuse me, 40% was max.

1784
02:20:35,664 --> 02:20:39,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've been down there, but this is completely sprayed.

1785
02:20:39,125 --> 02:20:41,286
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot see nothing on this one here in Central Ave.

1786
02:20:42,527 --> 02:20:47,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that in and of itself enough of a public safety issue and a violation of our municipal law?

1787
02:20:47,589 --> 02:20:51,311
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, this is a cursory answer because I'm just going off the top of my head.

1788
02:20:51,351 --> 02:20:57,354
[SPEAKER_29]: First, I don't think, unless I'm looking at the definition of a sign and I'm not so sure it would qualify to blacken

1789
02:20:58,773 --> 02:21:00,874
[SPEAKER_29]: a piece of glass and then say that's a sign.

1790
02:21:01,554 --> 02:21:05,694
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not so sure that fits into the definition.

1791
02:21:05,814 --> 02:21:08,615
[SPEAKER_29]: Secondly, public safety issue is different.

1792
02:21:09,115 --> 02:21:15,896
[SPEAKER_29]: I've seen windows that have been covered by brown paper or that sort of thing during construction or repair.

1793
02:21:16,176 --> 02:21:23,138
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not so unusual, but you're talking about windows which are darkened in order to secrete the activities which are behind there.

1794
02:21:23,498 --> 02:21:25,298
[SPEAKER_29]: That may well be a public safety issue.

1795
02:21:25,924 --> 02:21:30,907
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't jump it immediately to signs, because I'm not so sure it would fit into the definition.

1796
02:21:31,287 --> 02:21:33,629
[SPEAKER_29]: But I'd have to have the definition in front of me to be definitive.

1797
02:21:34,249 --> 02:21:36,671
[SPEAKER_18]: I could give it to you, actually, because we've worked on it.

1798
02:21:37,251 --> 02:21:38,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you could find it.

1799
02:21:38,152 --> 02:21:40,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm going to give it to you right now so everyone else can hear it.

1800
02:21:41,174 --> 02:21:43,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it is a purview of the sign ordinance.

1801
02:21:43,956 --> 02:21:46,517
[SPEAKER_18]: It was part and parcel of it.

1802
02:21:46,657 --> 02:21:49,819
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's 35%, by the way, just to set the record straight.

1803
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:55,643
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason for that was that you couldn't cover with paper or other types of signage your store windows

1804
02:21:56,060 --> 02:22:04,002
[SPEAKER_18]: more than 35 percent, not only for safety, so the police can look in, whether it's in the — in fact, they suggest that people leave lights on.

1805
02:22:04,342 --> 02:22:08,783
[SPEAKER_18]: But they can look in, see if there's something going on, or a robbery in place, or anything like that.

1806
02:22:09,423 --> 02:22:11,323
[SPEAKER_18]: And it is part of the sign ordinance.

1807
02:22:12,283 --> 02:22:13,064
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not a sign.

1808
02:22:13,344 --> 02:22:13,884
[SPEAKER_29]: I get that.

1809
02:22:14,124 --> 02:22:24,486
[SPEAKER_29]: All I'm saying is that I want to look at the definition of a sign to ensure that the blackening or darkening of glass would fit into that definition.

1810
02:22:25,003 --> 02:22:29,727
[SPEAKER_29]: The purpose of having that, public safety and all that, I very much understand.

1811
02:22:30,207 --> 02:22:43,938
[SPEAKER_29]: What I have to deal with is the parameters of definition and to make sure that it fits into the definition so that the prescribing aspect of the sign ordinance would then apply to a docket window.

1812
02:22:43,959 --> 02:22:48,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President.

1813
02:22:49,443 --> 02:22:51,825
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor, the gentleman was speaking.

1814
02:22:51,865 --> 02:22:54,307
[SPEAKER_24]: You made a point of information, which is now concluded.

1815
02:22:54,871 --> 02:22:57,674
[SPEAKER_24]: And Councilor Knight has the floor next.

1816
02:22:58,715 --> 02:23:06,183
[SPEAKER_18]: So I mean if there's any other questions that anyone has that I could possibly shed some light on, some of the, now let me tell you another aspect what goes on here.

1817
02:23:06,563 --> 02:23:09,306
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's people that are in the neighborhood that are really fuming about it.

1818
02:23:09,927 --> 02:23:15,092
[SPEAKER_18]: The one in particular that's down on Central Avenue of course is right around the corner from Morrison Playground.

1819
02:23:15,192 --> 02:23:17,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Very important to use that playground, it is not a park.

1820
02:23:19,293 --> 02:23:22,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Many, many young children, many people are in there day and night.

1821
02:23:22,175 --> 02:23:27,740
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of young people coming in with carriages and small children and babies.

1822
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:29,901
[SPEAKER_18]: They need to go by that establishment.

1823
02:23:30,442 --> 02:23:40,069
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing that happens is that, and there's no other way to put this, you can't sugar coat it, but the Johns that come in to use that establishment are parking all around the neighborhood.

1824
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:43,532
[SPEAKER_18]: They seek the inner streets and just in from the corners,

1825
02:23:43,888 --> 02:23:51,775
[SPEAKER_18]: because obviously they don't want to be seen on the main avenue and they don't want to be seen getting out of their cars basically and walking into that establishment.

1826
02:23:52,715 --> 02:23:57,379
[SPEAKER_18]: So this way it would appear that they're just walking across either coming from the park or some other location.

1827
02:23:58,660 --> 02:24:05,446
[SPEAKER_18]: So they infiltrate the home based addresses that are all around, you know, and it's kind of wrong.

1828
02:24:06,267 --> 02:24:09,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Those of us that live within those areas, you get to know all the cars that are there.

1829
02:24:10,263 --> 02:24:14,804
[SPEAKER_18]: whether there's someone coming from an adjacent street, you get to know the regular parkers that are there.

1830
02:24:15,084 --> 02:24:16,604
[SPEAKER_18]: It stands out like a sore thumb.

1831
02:24:17,204 --> 02:24:20,585
[SPEAKER_18]: The lights light up on the phone because that's the call for them to come in.

1832
02:24:21,245 --> 02:24:22,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Put a little levity on it.

1833
02:24:23,346 --> 02:24:25,546
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd enjoy this there, Mr. President.

1834
02:24:26,106 --> 02:24:27,866
[SPEAKER_18]: I call that the confessional box.

1835
02:24:28,487 --> 02:24:30,147
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a light fixture that's outside.

1836
02:24:30,187 --> 02:24:33,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to manage that building when I was a kid for many years.

1837
02:24:33,648 --> 02:24:35,728
[SPEAKER_18]: I never knew that that outside light ever worked.

1838
02:24:36,636 --> 02:24:40,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, these people come in, they're screwed in a light bulb, there wasn't even that in there.

1839
02:24:40,777 --> 02:24:44,058
[SPEAKER_18]: And every time that there's something in session, a light goes on.

1840
02:24:44,438 --> 02:24:47,218
[SPEAKER_18]: I say, that's the kneeler in the confessional box, there you go.

1841
02:24:47,718 --> 02:24:49,519
[SPEAKER_18]: The light's on, we're busy in there.

1842
02:24:49,899 --> 02:24:52,739
[SPEAKER_18]: When they're out, light is off, constantly, all the time.

1843
02:24:53,279 --> 02:24:55,140
[SPEAKER_18]: So the signals are there as well.

1844
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,441
[SPEAKER_18]: And you get to recognize them.

1845
02:24:58,921 --> 02:25:05,162
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a seedy thing that we just don't need to have in this community, and we need to do whatever it takes

1846
02:25:05,799 --> 02:25:09,301
[SPEAKER_18]: So augment the laws, change them, and make sure that that happens.

1847
02:25:09,461 --> 02:25:14,684
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd like to know if this city council is on board, if everyone in this city council is on board.

1848
02:25:14,724 --> 02:25:15,484
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to hear that.

1849
02:25:15,964 --> 02:25:18,866
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, with that, I'll just relinquish, and I'd like to hear your comments, please.

1850
02:25:19,626 --> 02:25:20,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

1851
02:25:22,227 --> 02:25:23,688
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1852
02:25:24,609 --> 02:25:26,670
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Sincardi, thank you for your presentation as well.

1853
02:25:28,811 --> 02:25:33,053
[SPEAKER_26]: I've taken a look at this article that he refers to, and one thing that the article does fail to mention is the fact that

1854
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:36,791
[SPEAKER_26]: Prior to the enactment of state law, we had local control.

1855
02:25:37,031 --> 02:25:41,351
[SPEAKER_26]: We had local control over the licensure of massage parlors, body work parlors and everything else.

1856
02:25:41,751 --> 02:25:42,792
[SPEAKER_26]: And that was taken away from us.

1857
02:25:42,832 --> 02:25:43,492
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a bad bill.

1858
02:25:43,792 --> 02:25:44,492
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a bad bill.

1859
02:25:44,772 --> 02:25:51,553
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think Robert Cappucci was absolutely right when he said that we need to get our state delegation in here because I think local control is really where it's at.

1860
02:25:51,993 --> 02:25:59,055
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think we're going to be able to beat back this problem unless we have to have all the tools in the shed to be able to do it.

1861
02:26:01,014 --> 02:26:06,718
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the best tools that we have is local control, where our Board of Health actually governs the responsibility of massage parlors.

1862
02:26:06,738 --> 02:26:08,760
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, we don't have a body works ordinance in the city of Medford.

1863
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:09,961
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the problem.

1864
02:26:10,381 --> 02:26:12,923
[SPEAKER_26]: But we had a massage parlor ordinance, and that was taken away from us.

1865
02:26:12,983 --> 02:26:15,965
[SPEAKER_26]: The rights and responsibilities to enforce that were taken away from us.

1866
02:26:15,985 --> 02:26:19,948
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that local control would really be the best option and the best solution, Mr. President.

1867
02:26:19,988 --> 02:26:27,134
[SPEAKER_26]: So, with that being said, I'd like to request that our state delegation sit down with our Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, Mr. President, and maybe come up with

1868
02:26:27,882 --> 02:26:33,003
[SPEAKER_26]: some recommendations as to how we can modify or amend the state law to ensure that we can gain some local control over these issues.

1869
02:26:33,784 --> 02:26:35,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

1870
02:26:35,804 --> 02:26:36,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Penta.

1871
02:26:37,825 --> 02:26:48,668
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just agree with Mr. Sincarly because I've been over there to see and I saw it in Medford Square and I don't understand where the state legislators are on this.

1872
02:26:48,728 --> 02:26:49,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't understand.

1873
02:26:50,068 --> 02:26:54,069
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that would take it out of their bailiwick and they wouldn't have to worry about it as a state piece of law.

1874
02:26:54,369 --> 02:26:56,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll come back to the local community and the local community.

1875
02:26:56,729 --> 02:26:57,629
[SPEAKER_09]: would make its decision.

1876
02:26:57,969 --> 02:26:58,309
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

1877
02:26:58,329 --> 02:27:04,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it would be on the back of every one of the seven councils or nine or 11, depending on what the form of government might be and the legislative body might be.

1878
02:27:04,751 --> 02:27:11,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this has no redeeming social, economic, financial, no value at all to any community for whatever it might be.

1879
02:27:11,973 --> 02:27:16,074
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not Las Vegas if you want to go out there and engage in this type of business and pay for it.

1880
02:27:16,614 --> 02:27:21,695
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I think the council is quite uniform on this.

1881
02:27:21,735 --> 02:27:24,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the council should send a vote to our state senators.

1882
02:27:24,866 --> 02:27:54,402
[SPEAKER_09]: and our three representatives that are part here of the city of Medford, and ask them to file a bill, take a leadership position on it, file a bill to eliminate this particular clause that's in the state law, and for whatever the terminology might be, just bring it back here to local control, and maybe whoever the other gentleman was that came up here and talked about changing our zoning ordinance, maybe we need to take a look and revise the wording in our zoning ordinance that not only addresses this, or any other type-like businesses that might appear in the future, because they may take the word Asian out, and may call it international,

1883
02:27:54,745 --> 02:27:55,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows what it could be?

1884
02:27:55,906 --> 02:27:58,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they do that, they beat around the law, and they don't have to do it.

1885
02:27:59,329 --> 02:28:03,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this is one issue that completely belongs in the control of the local community.

1886
02:28:04,113 --> 02:28:06,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't say it any other way.

1887
02:28:07,055 --> 02:28:07,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where my vote would go.

1888
02:28:10,999 --> 02:28:12,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1889
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:12,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote.

1890
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:15,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Have it forwarded to our state senator and our three state reps.

1891
02:28:15,562 --> 02:28:20,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I move the motion to make a motion by Councilor Gabriello, as amended by Councilor Penta,

1892
02:28:23,051 --> 02:28:23,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President.

1893
02:28:24,092 --> 02:28:25,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sorry, not to belabor the point.

1894
02:28:26,433 --> 02:28:40,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted, not to put City Solicitor Mark Rumley on the spot either, but it looks like from what I've read, 15 communities across the state have already passed this bylaw that was given to us by Councilor Caraviello.

1895
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:45,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously more probably in the works of being passed.

1896
02:28:47,135 --> 02:28:54,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you read the bylaw or do you think it's something that we could work on within the next few weeks, maybe try to get that passed at our next meeting?

1897
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:59,062
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Caraviello brought that to me last Wednesday.

1898
02:28:59,082 --> 02:29:08,207
[SPEAKER_29]: We were lucky enough to have Karen Rose come right downstairs from her office and we had a meeting about it for about 40 minutes or so.

1899
02:29:08,627 --> 02:29:12,349
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the suggestion was made that it be brought to the council agenda.

1900
02:29:13,189 --> 02:29:15,911
[SPEAKER_29]: Karen felt that the Board of Health would like to look at it

1901
02:29:16,224 --> 02:29:19,566
[SPEAKER_29]: and have some input on it, and so that would follow tonight's meeting.

1902
02:29:20,046 --> 02:29:21,206
[SPEAKER_29]: So I did look at it.

1903
02:29:21,246 --> 02:29:23,107
[SPEAKER_29]: I looked at a couple of ordinances last week.

1904
02:29:23,467 --> 02:29:30,571
[SPEAKER_29]: That's among them, but what I wouldn't do is to say just on the basis of tonight, yes, take this, pass it, because that's not prudent.

1905
02:29:31,031 --> 02:29:37,174
[SPEAKER_29]: Every ordinance has to be looked at, not only by this body, but in this case, by the Board of Health.

1906
02:29:37,614 --> 02:29:43,617
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think things are moving along pretty well since last Wednesday, and they'll continue to move with all deliberate speed.

1907
02:29:44,723 --> 02:30:04,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I just recommend that maybe we have a committee of the whole meeting before our next scheduled council meeting to review any work that's been done by our solicitor and board of health and hopefully review a proposed ordinance to be passed by the city council to move this along and not wait months and months and have these establishments linger.

1908
02:30:05,010 --> 02:30:09,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the sooner we can get these establishments out of Medford, the better.

1909
02:30:09,931 --> 02:30:14,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like cities and towns that do have the bylaws and the books,

1910
02:30:15,138 --> 02:30:27,704
[SPEAKER_03]: These establishments are deterred from even establishing in those cities and towns, so let's be one of those cities and towns, and hopefully at the same time the state will work on what they need to work on, get completely out of Massachusetts entirely.

1911
02:30:27,724 --> 02:30:28,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1912
02:30:28,245 --> 02:30:28,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1913
02:30:29,725 --> 02:30:29,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Ma'am?

1914
02:30:30,166 --> 02:30:32,247
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, I'm just going to do a reading of the ad.

1915
02:30:33,187 --> 02:30:38,030
[SPEAKER_32]: It says, wow, all new girls, brand new, sweet and sexy baby, try now.

1916
02:30:38,250 --> 02:30:40,451
[SPEAKER_32]: It gives the number, it gives the address, and it gives

1917
02:30:41,038 --> 02:30:42,579
[SPEAKER_32]: pictures of women.

1918
02:30:43,599 --> 02:30:58,265
[SPEAKER_32]: I also want to just reiterate something that one of our Medford Coalition supporters have said as a way to address this issue, and pretty much it's to be an informed consumer, and social media is a real thing.

1919
02:30:58,325 --> 02:31:00,046
[SPEAKER_32]: We all know in town what's going on.

1920
02:31:00,606 --> 02:31:02,027
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't want to just hear us talk about it.

1921
02:31:02,067 --> 02:31:03,387
[SPEAKER_32]: We want to see actual deadlines.

1922
02:31:03,427 --> 02:31:04,428
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm totally with you, Brianna.

1923
02:31:04,488 --> 02:31:05,208
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to see

1924
02:31:05,813 --> 02:31:10,117
[SPEAKER_32]: what is gonna happen, if this is here next week, if this is here in two weeks, in a month, you know.

1925
02:31:10,337 --> 02:31:12,639
[SPEAKER_32]: This is, we're trying to revitalize Medford Square.

1926
02:31:12,699 --> 02:31:16,002
[SPEAKER_32]: If you guys don't do this, you know, I'm a mother of a two and a half year old, I'm gonna move.

1927
02:31:16,623 --> 02:31:19,505
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm not just the only one, you know, I want a reason to stay, you know.

1928
02:31:20,726 --> 02:31:32,817
[SPEAKER_32]: Penta, if you become the mayor, which would be very interesting and wonderful, you know, we'd love to, and same with Stephanie Burke, I'd like to see what you guys will actually do in real time, and you were bringing up some of those points now.

1929
02:31:34,239 --> 02:31:44,314
[SPEAKER_32]: Perhaps it is bringing professional licensed masseuses and people who are actually in the field and having them advise you on this council so that you actually know what you're looking for when you're talking to people.

1930
02:31:45,035 --> 02:31:48,240
[SPEAKER_32]: This is from Sharon Bisson, so I want to make sure I'm crediting the right person.

1931
02:31:49,498 --> 02:31:55,901
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want you to know that we are listening to everything, and by me saying we have 1,000 people behind us, that's a lot more people than just 1,000.

1932
02:31:56,021 --> 02:32:00,002
[SPEAKER_32]: There's so many people in Medford, and we're not just going to sit back and listen anymore.

1933
02:32:00,022 --> 02:32:04,084
[SPEAKER_32]: We want to see action, and we're going to figure out ways to make it ourselves.

1934
02:32:05,004 --> 02:32:09,506
[SPEAKER_32]: So please, you know, you guys are all running, except for a few of you.

1935
02:32:09,526 --> 02:32:13,107
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, you're all running, and we are paying attention to everything you're doing.

1936
02:32:13,408 --> 02:32:16,149
[SPEAKER_32]: So please, make us proud.

1937
02:32:16,609 --> 02:32:16,809
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks.

[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I have reviewed these documents.

1985
02:34:39,428 --> 02:34:43,411
[SPEAKER_30]: There are two different places?

1986
02:34:43,491 --> 02:34:46,533
[SPEAKER_14]: No, there are only one, like 15 forests.

1987
02:34:46,613 --> 02:34:46,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this you?

1988
02:34:48,965 --> 02:34:49,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that you?

1989
02:34:49,305 --> 02:34:49,485
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1990
02:34:49,505 --> 02:34:51,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if we could table 15570 and 15571.

1991
02:34:51,286 --> 02:34:52,306
[SPEAKER_04]: The owners are not here this evening.

1992
02:34:52,326 --> 02:34:55,107
[SPEAKER_30]: On the motion of council approval to table 15570, all those in favor?

1993
02:34:55,127 --> 02:34:55,407
[SPEAKER_30]: Those opposed?

1994
02:34:55,427 --> 02:34:56,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass the table.

1995
02:34:56,587 --> 02:35:00,128
[SPEAKER_04]: On the petition by Councilor Caraviello to table 15571, all those in favor?

1996
02:35:18,727 --> 02:35:19,067
[SPEAKER_24]: table.

1997
02:35:19,747 --> 02:35:21,969
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1998
02:35:23,049 --> 02:35:28,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take 15-460, the fiscal year 2016 budget, off of the table.

1999
02:35:29,252 --> 02:35:32,914
[SPEAKER_24]: On motion of Councilor Camuso to take 15-460 off the table.

2000
02:35:32,934 --> 02:35:33,734
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

2001
02:35:34,395 --> 02:35:35,155
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

2002
02:35:36,075 --> 02:35:36,816
[SPEAKER_24]: It's before us.

2003
02:35:36,836 --> 02:35:38,036
[SPEAKER_24]: 15-460.

2004
02:35:38,176 --> 02:35:39,117
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval.

2005
02:35:39,577 --> 02:35:41,678
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval.

2006
02:35:41,738 --> 02:35:42,559
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

2007
02:36:20,597 --> 02:36:21,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President.

2008
02:36:22,158 --> 02:36:23,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

2009
02:36:24,578 --> 02:36:34,842
[SPEAKER_03]: My first question has to do with the debt service.

2010
02:36:35,242 --> 02:36:35,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's see.

2011
02:36:35,743 --> 02:36:39,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to figure out what the name of this document was.

2012
02:36:40,684 --> 02:36:43,886
[SPEAKER_03]: From Ian Baker, we got a document dated June 25th.

2013
02:36:44,046 --> 02:36:49,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It had to do with the Hormel Stadium revolving account that we had asked for figures on.

2014
02:36:53,884 --> 02:37:01,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go to one of the last few pages, the swimming pool, community schools.

2015
02:37:01,788 --> 02:37:09,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure I have these numbers accurate.

2016
02:37:09,712 --> 02:37:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a complex document.

2017
02:37:11,413 --> 02:37:16,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, it looks like Hormel and the pool, obviously, in the

2018
02:37:17,817 --> 02:37:21,920
[SPEAKER_03]: are the two projects that we went out to bond on and also the Failed to Dream.

2019
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:25,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were the three that I think we asked for the breakdowns on.

2020
02:37:25,982 --> 02:37:31,266
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it looks like Hormel is profiting.

2021
02:37:31,446 --> 02:37:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have that correct?

2022
02:37:32,466 --> 02:37:33,167
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

2023
02:37:33,287 --> 02:37:37,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have about $93,000 in revenue, $37,000 in salaries, $7,350 in other expenses, and then $26,000 goes to the debt service.

2024
02:37:37,469 --> 02:37:39,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in April, which I believe

2025
02:37:48,212 --> 02:37:50,594
[SPEAKER_03]: is the only payment that I could see.

2026
02:37:50,654 --> 02:37:53,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So am I correct, we're profiting about $22,000 from HOMEL?

2027
02:37:54,697 --> 02:37:55,297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

2028
02:37:57,379 --> 02:38:09,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So then if I'm reading the figures right and you go to the pool, it looks like when I calculated the numbers a little differently than how they put out in the sheet, salaries are about $127,000.

2029
02:38:13,041 --> 02:38:13,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

2030
02:38:13,241 --> 02:38:14,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Judge already left.

2031
02:38:14,922 --> 02:38:16,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have liked to have asked some questions.

2032
02:38:17,063 --> 02:38:21,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But other expenses of about $15,000, totaling between those two figures, $142,000, $88,000 in revenue.

2033
02:38:21,685 --> 02:38:24,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pool at this point is about $54,000 in the whole?

2034
02:38:24,847 --> 02:38:25,287
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

2035
02:38:25,307 --> 02:38:27,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And that does not include anywhere that any of the

2036
02:38:45,786 --> 02:38:48,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Those expenses just have to do with salaries and supplies.

2037
02:38:48,527 --> 02:38:55,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are not calculating any type of debt service in those numbers.

2038
02:38:55,151 --> 02:38:55,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

2039
02:38:56,131 --> 02:38:59,393
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no debt service reimbursement for the pool project out of the pool fund.

2040
02:39:02,194 --> 02:39:02,794
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

2041
02:39:10,598 --> 02:39:13,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The debt service for the pool was included in the operating budget.

2042
02:39:14,170 --> 02:39:17,833
[SPEAKER_05]: in the debt service sheet, not as a separate line.

2043
02:39:19,354 --> 02:39:21,195
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the operating budget.

2044
02:39:22,656 --> 02:39:24,878
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the operating budget on the city side.

2045
02:39:25,038 --> 02:39:26,279
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

2046
02:39:26,299 --> 02:39:26,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2047
02:39:28,140 --> 02:39:35,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my concern, I'm not even sure if you were present at those meetings because you were the... I was the chief procurement officer then.

2048
02:39:35,305 --> 02:39:40,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I'm not sure if you were at the council meetings when the bond was being approved.

2049
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:41,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not.

2050
02:39:42,544 --> 02:39:47,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I myself specifically asked because it was about $3 million for the pool.

2051
02:39:47,569 --> 02:39:53,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the 1.925 plus another 1.2, so I'm sorry, over $3 million.

2052
02:39:53,834 --> 02:40:09,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time when we first approved the $1.9 million bond, I remember specifically asking what type of fees were going to be generated and will the fees be able to pay back not only staff and personnel, but also pay back the bond.

2053
02:40:10,478 --> 02:40:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We were honestly told that it wasn't going to be full reimbursement for the bond.

2054
02:40:15,422 --> 02:40:21,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't recall exactly, but I could have sworn it was about 75% would be paid back.

2055
02:40:22,548 --> 02:40:27,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you or Superintendent Belson can maybe enlighten us a little bit.

2056
02:40:27,512 --> 02:40:30,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we at now?

2057
02:40:30,154 --> 02:40:34,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're just in the first year since the pool's been rebuilt.

2058
02:40:35,429 --> 02:40:49,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we at with regards to moving forward and trying to generate more than $88,000 a year to pay for at least the salaries and hopefully at some point, whether it's two or three years down the line, start paying back some of that bond through the pool revenues.

2059
02:40:50,294 --> 02:40:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I myself personally have had a hard time getting in contact with the pool.

2060
02:40:54,915 --> 02:40:56,455
[SPEAKER_03]: The pool temperature is fine, but

2061
02:40:58,652 --> 02:41:01,352
[SPEAKER_03]: air temperature is extremely cold.

2062
02:41:02,373 --> 02:41:04,953
[SPEAKER_03]: There is minimal information online.

2063
02:41:05,093 --> 02:41:12,675
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no phone at the pool, which is no fault of anybody's, but, you know, I don't think it's fault of the pool, but there's no phone line.

2064
02:41:13,195 --> 02:41:14,795
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no sign-up online.

2065
02:41:14,935 --> 02:41:21,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can barely get the classes, and the summer schedule is not up there.

2066
02:41:21,416 --> 02:41:25,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't feel like we're doing what we need to do as far as marketing, advertising,

2067
02:41:26,844 --> 02:41:31,607
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing in the revenues that we as a council were told were going to be brought in from this pool.

2068
02:41:32,268 --> 02:41:33,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I know we're probably down the line.

2069
02:41:33,949 --> 02:41:34,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully more is done.

2070
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:39,053
[SPEAKER_03]: But changes need to be made in order to even give the pool the ability to do so.

2071
02:41:39,453 --> 02:41:40,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So not to have a phone for me.

2072
02:41:41,194 --> 02:41:43,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally took my kids there.

2073
02:41:43,376 --> 02:41:44,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take swim lessons.

2074
02:41:44,576 --> 02:41:47,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me three weeks to get in contact with the pool.

2075
02:41:47,919 --> 02:41:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So I as a councilor, I as a, you know, speaking on behalf of the residents, families who want to use this pool have a problem.

2076
02:41:54,842 --> 02:42:06,610
[SPEAKER_05]: with what I see in the figures and how I see it being operated and... Well, the information that I have for you today is that first, the pool was not operational for a full year yet.

2077
02:42:07,771 --> 02:42:13,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So as things were starting up, we should have a full year of operation.

2078
02:42:14,935 --> 02:42:19,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully by the end of the year, we'll have better numbers in terms of what revenue can be generated.

2079
02:42:19,737 --> 02:42:32,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, looking at the expense side, some of the expenses are going to be addressed differently now that we have some experience with operating in a pool, and there should be some reduction in the annual expenses.

2080
02:42:33,249 --> 02:42:40,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And going forward, obviously, advertising would help so that more revenue can be generated from the pool.

2081
02:42:40,375 --> 02:42:44,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this summer, there will be summer programs, and the pool was not open last summer.

2082
02:42:46,757 --> 02:42:49,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, you know, I would just say it needs a little time to get going.

2083
02:42:49,958 --> 02:43:03,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just make a B paper that, you know, whether it's advertising or marketing funds or phone system, online sign-ups, things be implemented to make this work.

2084
02:43:03,945 --> 02:43:16,090
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have a successful Hormel, we have a successful Field of Dreams, but for some reason, this pool, I hope to see it, you know, obviously get better, and I hope to see

2085
02:43:17,122 --> 02:43:27,908
[SPEAKER_03]: what we were told back in, oh, geez, when did we, yeah, two years ago, you would hope that this is going to improve.

2086
02:43:28,008 --> 02:43:39,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask that phone system be set up, online sign-ups be set up, more explicit online advertising and outreach, as well as, you know, my kids want to take swim lessons at the mall.

2087
02:43:39,434 --> 02:43:39,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And why?

2088
02:43:39,774 --> 02:43:43,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's, you know, the pool's, not only the pool's heated, but the air quality is heated.

2089
02:43:43,876 --> 02:43:46,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's a big, big area,

2090
02:43:47,227 --> 02:43:54,132
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make it friendly for families to go in and be able to enjoy their swim lessons.

2091
02:43:54,152 --> 02:44:02,358
[SPEAKER_03]: You're paying $17, $18 a class, which I think is completely fine, but we don't seem to be doing what I feel should be done.

2092
02:44:02,558 --> 02:44:08,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we did approve that $3 million for the pool, I as one Councilor want to see it as a success.

2093
02:44:09,423 --> 02:44:13,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see the revenues being generated that I know can

2094
02:44:13,732 --> 02:44:17,595
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially be generated, because you call the Malden Y, you have to go on a waiting list.

2095
02:44:18,035 --> 02:44:20,057
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the swim programs around here.

2096
02:44:20,077 --> 02:44:28,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go on a waiting list to be able to use the pool at these, and that's how I can, I see the potential there, and I want to see that happen.

2097
02:44:28,643 --> 02:44:39,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just recommend that as a B paper, that we allow more resources or, you know, just simple, simple strategies to generate more income.

2098
02:44:40,332 --> 02:44:42,173
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to take some work, but I know it can be done.

2099
02:44:42,830 --> 02:44:43,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my first question.

2100
02:44:44,031 --> 02:44:50,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I know other councils have questions, but that was my first thing that came up in my research this week.

2101
02:44:54,397 --> 02:45:03,282
[SPEAKER_26]: On that topic, Mr. President, I think it might make sense to figure out what strategies they're going to put in place as opposed to asking them to put strategies in place.

2102
02:45:03,302 --> 02:45:05,063
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we're going to get a new certified pool manager.

2103
02:45:06,270 --> 02:45:07,590
[SPEAKER_26]: very shortly, if we haven't already.

2104
02:45:07,610 --> 02:45:08,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the beginning tomorrow.

2105
02:45:08,591 --> 02:45:09,931
[SPEAKER_26]: Beginning tomorrow, we'll have a new CPO.

2106
02:45:09,951 --> 02:45:10,811
[SPEAKER_26]: That's correct.

2107
02:45:10,831 --> 02:45:20,213
[SPEAKER_26]: So it might make sense, Mr. President, to talk to the new CPO and see exactly what type of vision they have for the pool, what type of plan they have for the pool, and see if we can make some positive suggestions to help them along.

2108
02:45:27,074 --> 02:45:28,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President, are you?

2109
02:45:32,215 --> 02:45:32,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep going.

2110
02:45:32,715 --> 02:45:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody else have questions?

2111
02:45:34,767 --> 02:45:37,688
[SPEAKER_24]: No one's asked for the floor as of yet.

2112
02:45:39,488 --> 02:45:40,989
[SPEAKER_24]: You have the floor, Madam Vice President.

2113
02:45:42,990 --> 02:45:44,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go one more question.

2114
02:45:44,310 --> 02:45:45,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few.

2115
02:45:46,651 --> 02:45:56,134
[SPEAKER_03]: With regards to the correspondence from the OPM with the work at the fire stations, the work was very well detailed.

2116
02:45:56,154 --> 02:46:00,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It was broken down by each station, and that was very well detailed.

2117
02:46:01,355 --> 02:46:03,676
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do kind of have a problem with, I guess,

2118
02:46:06,968 --> 02:46:07,929
[SPEAKER_03]: is what was written.

2119
02:46:16,573 --> 02:46:28,960
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody has contacted the OPM with regards to issues that have not been complete or, you know, with regards to things that came up considering that we have only six more months with the warranty.

2120
02:46:32,581 --> 02:46:33,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand how we have

2121
02:46:34,506 --> 02:46:42,750
[SPEAKER_03]: The union, the firefighters union, and even the chief of fire, I won't verbatim say what has been brought up to us.

2122
02:46:42,850 --> 02:46:45,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been called separately.

2123
02:46:45,111 --> 02:46:49,833
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a meeting on this when the fire department met with us in committee.

2124
02:46:50,174 --> 02:47:03,080
[SPEAKER_03]: The union was there, and they pointed out four or five different issues within these four or five stations where $2 million was put into all this work.

2125
02:47:03,870 --> 02:47:16,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had the fire chief say that he was the one that was responsible for recouping or, you know, going after this warranty period and making sure things were fixed.

2126
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:18,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that's written.

2127
02:47:19,203 --> 02:47:31,053
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that we have a warranty, the fact that we have this answer where the OPM says he was not called, the fact that it was $2 million and things were done

2128
02:47:32,269 --> 02:47:42,075
[SPEAKER_03]: blatantly, admittedly wrong, and our own firefighters have to point it out to us, I find that a real issue.

2129
02:47:42,215 --> 02:47:46,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the taxpayers that this bond was put on their backs.

2130
02:47:46,958 --> 02:47:48,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a $2 million bond.

2131
02:47:50,861 --> 02:47:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And a large amount of money is going to be paid back on that with regards to principal and interest.

2132
02:47:57,805 --> 02:48:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't find it directly.

2133
02:48:03,444 --> 02:48:16,895
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.8 million in 2012, I mean, we're paying back 240,000 in interest alone.

2134
02:48:16,915 --> 02:48:27,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I feel like I have to reiterate that we need somebody to go in and review all the work that's been done.

2135
02:48:28,486 --> 02:48:32,608
[SPEAKER_03]: make a list, and go after what we can with regards to this warranty.

2136
02:48:32,628 --> 02:48:36,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have to reiterate that, especially after we get the response that we did.

2137
02:48:38,290 --> 02:48:40,231
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money for our taxpayers.

2138
02:48:41,371 --> 02:48:42,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to reiterate that.

2139
02:48:43,012 --> 02:48:44,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Councilman.

2140
02:48:47,713 --> 02:48:48,694
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you all set, Madam Vice President?

2141
02:48:48,734 --> 02:48:49,414
[SPEAKER_24]: For now, thank you.

2142
02:48:49,834 --> 02:48:50,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

2143
02:48:50,394 --> 02:48:52,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I just address that for one minute?

2144
02:48:52,295 --> 02:48:54,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I did follow up with the chief.

2145
02:48:55,300 --> 02:49:01,043
[SPEAKER_05]: regarding issues, and as of today, there are only two issues that he has brought to my attention.

2146
02:49:01,204 --> 02:49:18,054
[SPEAKER_05]: One, and I apologize, I can't remember whether he said it was a humidifier or dehumidifier that needs to be adjusted in one of the stations, and the other was possibly the pitch in one of the station floors.

2147
02:49:18,734 --> 02:49:20,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the only two issues.

2148
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:22,480
[SPEAKER_05]: that were brought up.

2149
02:49:22,821 --> 02:49:34,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had also asked the president of the fire union to provide me with information, and I understand that he was on vacation, and so I have not received any information from him.

2150
02:49:36,846 --> 02:49:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: The owner's project manager, his work ended when the project ended.

2151
02:49:40,127 --> 02:49:44,949
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could just request that.

2152
02:49:44,969 --> 02:49:45,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Vice President.

2153
02:49:45,669 --> 02:49:45,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2154
02:49:45,889 --> 02:49:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

2155
02:49:46,590 --> 02:49:46,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Miller.

2156
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:49,551
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could just request whatever you're provided by the

2157
02:49:50,782 --> 02:49:56,987
[SPEAKER_03]: fire union, if you could forward that to us so we can get an idea, because I remember a couple more things on that list.

2158
02:49:57,387 --> 02:50:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it was air conditioning and heating is still an issue at one or two of the fire stations as well.

2159
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:03,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that being another problem.

2160
02:50:03,852 --> 02:50:09,275
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could get that list from the fire union as well.

2161
02:50:09,315 --> 02:50:09,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2162
02:50:11,297 --> 02:50:12,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Pente.

2163
02:50:13,038 --> 02:50:13,719
[SPEAKER_09]: A few questions.

2164
02:50:14,519 --> 02:50:18,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Louise, one of the things that we had asked for was our electrical department.

2165
02:50:19,112 --> 02:50:24,615
[SPEAKER_09]: that the superintendent wise, um, contact national grid to address the lack of lighting at Wentworth street rotary.

2166
02:50:25,596 --> 02:50:32,540
[SPEAKER_09]: The response is that the lack of lighting is due to the removal of one street light for construction reasons and will be reinstalled.

2167
02:50:33,281 --> 02:50:37,904
[SPEAKER_09]: The other answer was one street light was struck by a truck and has been struck on more than one occasion.

2168
02:50:37,964 --> 02:50:42,687
[SPEAKER_09]: National grid is evaluating, evaluating whether or not to reinstall due to this location.

2169
02:50:43,527 --> 02:50:45,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, have you ever gone to Wentworth circle at nighttime?

2170
02:50:46,809 --> 02:50:47,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not.

2171
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:48,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2172
02:50:48,711 --> 02:50:53,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you go there at nighttime, you think you're in the woods, because there's absolutely no lights.

2173
02:50:53,775 --> 02:50:54,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It's as dark as can be.

2174
02:50:55,837 --> 02:50:57,338
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a huge public safety issue.

2175
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:05,324
[SPEAKER_09]: We had asked Mr. Randazzo for whatever it takes to put additional lighting in there while this whole construction is going on.

2176
02:51:06,085 --> 02:51:10,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I know that they're repaving part of the street in Winthrop Street, but they're still working over there.

2177
02:51:11,429 --> 02:51:17,694
[SPEAKER_09]: And to have National Grid tell us that they're going to evaluate whether, in fact, they're going to put a new light up, that doesn't make any sense.

2178
02:51:18,632 --> 02:51:23,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the type of an answer I would have not responded to by saying that.

2179
02:51:23,396 --> 02:51:26,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have went out of my way to make sure national grid did put the light up there.

2180
02:51:26,618 --> 02:51:27,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a public safety issue.

2181
02:51:28,139 --> 02:51:31,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a huge factor over there and that needs to be addressed.

2182
02:51:32,843 --> 02:51:39,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there's some concerns that I had in this budget from four particular departments, engineering, the library, the building and the police department.

2183
02:51:40,329 --> 02:51:44,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we were all educated, at least I was immensely during this past budgetary process,

2184
02:51:45,208 --> 02:51:59,791
[SPEAKER_09]: that these four departments in particular, when asked about their wish list, for which we've been asking each and every year, well, judges knew, as you're aware now, they were all very enlightening to turn around and tell us that they did ask for certain things.

2185
02:52:00,311 --> 02:52:13,773
[SPEAKER_09]: The engineering department in particular, when the engineering director was asked what her wish list was, and she had been asking for this for four years, and how was it done, two times it was verbal,

2186
02:52:14,864 --> 02:52:22,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And two times it was in an email, and she was told by her predecessor not to include it in the budget, because you weren't going to get it.

2187
02:52:22,986 --> 02:52:28,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how do you deny having four people use one telephone call, one telephone?

2188
02:52:28,727 --> 02:52:38,229
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you deny giving them an extra table to work on, file cabinets, and a computerization system to bring them up to date, or at least to keep them up to date, for a $30,000 to a $40,000 hit?

2189
02:52:38,249 --> 02:52:38,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2190
02:52:41,757 --> 02:52:45,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul Mulkey from the building department, when he came up, he was asking for something very simple.

2191
02:52:45,579 --> 02:52:48,221
[SPEAKER_09]: He wanted to become modernized and more computerized.

2192
02:52:49,142 --> 02:52:51,263
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was costing him maybe $30,000 to $40,000, asking.

2193
02:52:51,423 --> 02:52:55,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the chief still here?

2194
02:52:55,626 --> 02:52:56,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to put him on the spot.

2195
02:52:56,767 --> 02:52:59,909
[SPEAKER_09]: But the question was asked of the chief relative to his wish list.

2196
02:53:00,409 --> 02:53:01,269
[SPEAKER_09]: He had never been asked.

2197
02:53:01,790 --> 02:53:07,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And when it was asked of you on the night of the budget, you indicated that you had just heard it that morning from the chief.

2198
02:53:08,814 --> 02:53:09,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And here is the department.

2199
02:53:10,258 --> 02:53:18,383
[SPEAKER_09]: that has cars and a building and a whole gamut of issues still not being addressed.

2200
02:53:19,364 --> 02:53:27,109
[SPEAKER_09]: The library, for four years, the poor librarian, and including myself, have been all over him because he's not putting these things into the budget.

2201
02:53:27,689 --> 02:53:37,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And it took a cast of characters from our community to say that they wanted that library fixed and they wanted their recertification to come forward.

2202
02:53:39,256 --> 02:53:39,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And what had happened?

2203
02:53:40,937 --> 02:53:48,341
[SPEAKER_09]: When Mr. Bryan was there, he was told not to say anything and not to put in his library by your predecessor.

2204
02:53:49,301 --> 02:53:51,322
[SPEAKER_09]: For six years, we went without being certified.

2205
02:53:51,743 --> 02:53:55,084
[SPEAKER_09]: We kept getting these variances and these special privileges from the state.

2206
02:53:55,845 --> 02:54:06,870
[SPEAKER_09]: That, to me, did not represent what a true budget is all about, because that $225,000, $30,000, or whatever it should have been, should have been part of the daily operating budget that that department needs to have.

2207
02:54:08,211 --> 02:54:10,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, I think the question was asked to you.

2208
02:54:10,806 --> 02:54:14,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think I was the one that asked the question, but I believe the question was asked to you.

2209
02:54:15,329 --> 02:54:19,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you have presented the budget the same way you got it to be presented?

2210
02:54:19,913 --> 02:54:22,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And you said no, you would have presented it different.

2211
02:54:22,495 --> 02:54:30,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think you heard about our wish list, a page that had about expensive, a page about salaries, and a page about the whole operation.

2212
02:54:31,302 --> 02:54:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that spoke volumes.

2213
02:54:33,403 --> 02:54:35,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking a quick look over to the school department,

2214
02:54:37,948 --> 02:54:43,869
[SPEAKER_09]: whether Roy wants to agree with me or not, for whatever it might be, we had a conversation about the Curtis Tufts School.

2215
02:54:44,589 --> 02:54:48,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the Curtis Tufts School, to some degree, has been a little bit of a bone of contention.

2216
02:54:49,030 --> 02:54:54,611
[SPEAKER_09]: But our own superintendent at that meeting indicated they had to make some changes because it wasn't going in the right direction.

2217
02:54:54,971 --> 02:54:57,571
[SPEAKER_09]: You can correct me if the words are wrong, but I think that's what you said.

2218
02:54:57,992 --> 02:54:59,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't going in the right direction.

2219
02:54:59,532 --> 02:55:00,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So you had to bring in somebody new.

2220
02:55:01,352 --> 02:55:03,713
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay for 19 kids that are there.

2221
02:55:04,193 --> 02:55:06,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe between 11 administrators and teachers.

2222
02:55:07,334 --> 02:55:13,138
[SPEAKER_09]: But you reward the fellow that's been there for 32 years with a $97,000 brand new job up at the high school.

2223
02:55:14,178 --> 02:55:15,119
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that's not right.

2224
02:55:15,419 --> 02:55:16,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's fair.

2225
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:23,264
[SPEAKER_09]: That's $97,000 that could have gone toward education, to a teacher, to books, to materials that teachers probably need.

2226
02:55:23,945 --> 02:55:27,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you have a difference of opinion with the superintendent, but I wouldn't have done that.

2227
02:55:27,767 --> 02:55:29,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at it an entirely different way.

2228
02:55:29,929 --> 02:55:34,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I also look at the fact that when these new school buildings were built, there was a 5% annual

2229
02:55:37,114 --> 02:55:39,055
[SPEAKER_09]: supposed to be in there for each particular budget.

2230
02:55:39,135 --> 02:55:53,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Councilor Caraviello, I believe it was three years ago going into his first year, produced a document, not from him, but the school department that showed $1,203,000 of repairs that were needed in that school.

2231
02:55:54,159 --> 02:55:59,180
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why the schools got themselves in trouble in the first place was because they never kept maintenance up.

2232
02:55:59,921 --> 02:56:02,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the rate we're going, we're going to find ourselves in the same situation.

2233
02:56:03,762 --> 02:56:05,082
[SPEAKER_09]: All I ask for each school,

2234
02:56:05,492 --> 02:56:14,899
[SPEAKER_09]: to be broken down individually to have a 5% inclusion of each school rather than all the schools together and try to figure out how this thing is going to work.

2235
02:56:15,739 --> 02:56:28,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other part for which I, again, disagree with my superintendent, and I consider him to be my friend, but we have a difference of opinion, I just think the entrance to Medford High School does not present itself very good for an educational purpose.

2236
02:56:29,549 --> 02:56:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm bringing my child up there from the eighth grade going into the ninth, and I look at that front entrance of that building,

2237
02:56:35,070 --> 02:56:37,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not going to accept the fact that it was a poor winter.

2238
02:56:37,992 --> 02:56:43,235
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been like that for a while, with bricks that are broken, door handles that are off the thing.

2239
02:56:43,515 --> 02:56:45,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And you walk into the, it's not very welcoming.

2240
02:56:46,517 --> 02:56:50,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford High has a huge talent pool of students and teachers.

2241
02:56:51,620 --> 02:56:54,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives a good education to the people in this community.

2242
02:56:54,962 --> 02:57:00,526
[SPEAKER_09]: But of all the schools that Medford has, that high school gets the bad rap for its appearance.

2243
02:57:01,206 --> 02:57:04,228
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we all know, an appearance can tell a huge story.

2244
02:57:05,657 --> 02:57:22,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't think right now, the way this budget's been presented, and knowing and seeing these department heads tell their particular stories, I don't feel that we're really getting what you call an accurate budget, especially since we just went two weeks ago to have over $1,200,000 in transfers from one department to another.

2245
02:57:23,727 --> 02:57:24,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Are some transfers needed?

2246
02:57:24,967 --> 02:57:25,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

2247
02:57:25,548 --> 02:57:26,288
[SPEAKER_09]: No question about it.

2248
02:57:27,109 --> 02:57:29,390
[SPEAKER_09]: But when one, two, three, four,

2249
02:57:29,974 --> 02:57:36,836
[SPEAKER_09]: five department heads come in there and tell you that they couldn't put in their budget what they really wanted so we as Councilors could understand it.

2250
02:57:37,376 --> 02:57:48,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we wouldn't have accepted any of them, but all we've asked for for the past many years is show us what your wish list is, tell us how much it's going to cost, and maybe explain to us how you think we can fund it.

2251
02:57:49,159 --> 02:57:55,081
[SPEAKER_09]: But when your predecessor tells them not to put it in there and they don't put it in there, that to me is wrong.

2252
02:57:55,821 --> 02:57:59,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And because of that, I'm having a hard time right now telling you

2253
02:57:59,530 --> 02:58:06,295
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Louise, whether I'm going to vote for this budget tonight or not, because I don't think it reflects an accurate presentation of what department heads need.

2254
02:58:06,675 --> 02:58:11,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anything coming back here that says the electrical department's going to get its $40,000.

2255
02:58:12,520 --> 02:58:20,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So every single employee has its own phone rather than one phone for four people, and a table to work on, and a file cabinet to store things.

2256
02:58:20,906 --> 02:58:21,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

2257
02:58:21,266 --> 02:58:21,907
[SPEAKER_09]: That's number one.

2258
02:58:22,507 --> 02:58:27,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anything in the electrical department that makes me feel satisfied that that one circle is going to be safe.

2259
02:58:28,165 --> 02:58:32,446
[SPEAKER_09]: All I'm getting is a report back that somebody's accepting somebody else's opinion.

2260
02:58:32,846 --> 02:58:36,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that opinion isn't good enough for me when public safety is at issue.

2261
02:58:36,566 --> 02:58:55,430
[SPEAKER_09]: When I hear a librarian tell me that for four years he's been stifled from putting in what he wants, and you hear the people from this community who brought the charge back, which forced Amir to automatically, mysteriously find $250,000 from a construction job, when we're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash,

2262
02:58:57,580 --> 02:58:58,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a problem with that.

2263
02:58:59,460 --> 02:59:06,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And when Paul Moki from the building department tells me all he needs is about 30, 40,000 to upgrade his department to computerize it, that's great.

2264
02:59:06,882 --> 02:59:07,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But we didn't hear that.

2265
02:59:08,042 --> 02:59:19,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I hear our chief of police tell me as of the morning of the date of the budget, that's the first time you and prior to you, your predecessor never had the opportunity or being invited to talk about these things.

2266
02:59:19,905 --> 02:59:24,406
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bothers me because I think a lot of the times through the past, this council was led to believe,

2267
02:59:24,914 --> 02:59:31,457
[SPEAKER_09]: When the budget was presented, okay, all the department heads agreed upon it, and maybe we should have asked more detailed questions.

2268
02:59:32,297 --> 02:59:34,018
[SPEAKER_09]: But this year's budget was very enlightening.

2269
02:59:34,738 --> 02:59:51,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So enlightening to the point that I honestly feel that what you were given for a budget to serve is not a true and honest and accurate budget, because if you're transferring a million dollars at the end of the year, as we've had for so many years in the past, and you just keep adding to your free cash, there is something wrong.

2270
02:59:52,275 --> 02:59:55,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not worried about the bond rating of our community right now.

2271
02:59:55,696 --> 03:00:01,938
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm worried about is how the taxpayers are going to be continuously taxed and taxed and taxed.

2272
03:00:02,438 --> 03:00:03,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll just leave you with this one thought.

2273
03:00:04,598 --> 03:00:07,179
[SPEAKER_09]: We have so much development taking place in this community.

2274
03:00:07,639 --> 03:00:21,123
[SPEAKER_09]: We were told that when in Wellington Circle, when stations landing in there, that was going to be such a boom to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers of this community, we would probably not be looking at a tax rate increase maybe for a few years.

2275
03:00:21,634 --> 03:00:27,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had so much development since then, and again, we are taxed and taxed, increase, increase.

2276
03:00:28,138 --> 03:00:32,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe development for the sake of development is not working in this community.

2277
03:00:32,701 --> 03:00:45,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Public safety, public works, public accommodations, plowing, all municipal services being put on the backs of the taxpayers to accommodate all this development and their taxes are not going down.

2278
03:00:46,030 --> 03:00:48,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you for taking on your new role.

2279
03:00:49,632 --> 03:00:50,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was thrust upon you.

2280
03:00:51,874 --> 03:00:55,415
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, I can't buy what's in front of me right now.

2281
03:00:55,555 --> 03:00:56,495
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my opinion.

2282
03:00:59,996 --> 03:01:15,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I may, I just want to say that in terms of looking at the budget, I think the council should feel comfortable that this budget is providing level services for all the departments.

2283
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:20,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So you will be getting the same level of services that you are getting in the city right now today.

2284
03:01:21,459 --> 03:01:23,661
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few additions to the budget.

2285
03:01:24,321 --> 03:01:29,025
[SPEAKER_05]: The library budget was increased and that was increased out of new growth.

2286
03:01:29,886 --> 03:01:43,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It truly was based upon certain building permits that were brought into the city and the assessor looking at what new growth could be and would be generated in the coming year.

2287
03:01:44,338 --> 03:01:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the concerns with some of the wish list items is that they are one time

2288
03:01:51,711 --> 03:01:57,214
[SPEAKER_05]: or they would add a substantial amount of expense to the budget.

2289
03:01:57,414 --> 03:02:02,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to cover those types of recurring expenses, we do need recurring revenue.

2290
03:02:03,037 --> 03:02:09,040
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we look at free cash, it really can only be used for non-recurring expenses, those one-time expenses.

2291
03:02:09,060 --> 03:02:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't really be used to fund the recurring expenses of the budget, or next year we will end up behind the eight ball before we even start.

2292
03:02:20,265 --> 03:02:43,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So from where I stand and having been here for a number of weeks, now I think maybe six, eight weeks, I do think that the budget is a level service budget that will provide the citizens of Medford with at least in almost every department the same level of services and enhanced services in some of the other departments.

2293
03:02:44,080 --> 03:02:49,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one, in addition to the library, the other budget that was substantially increased was the fire department budget.

2294
03:02:49,890 --> 03:03:00,594
[SPEAKER_05]: where there had been a, I believe they called it a safer grant, that had funded a certain number of firefighters who then had to be absorbed into the budget this year.

2295
03:03:00,974 --> 03:03:06,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is where most of the new growth was directed to, the funding of those firefighter positions.

2296
03:03:06,356 --> 03:03:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that that answers and alleviates some of the concerns of the council.

2297
03:03:12,138 --> 03:03:12,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2298
03:03:12,518 --> 03:03:13,198
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

2299
03:03:13,218 --> 03:03:15,819
[SPEAKER_24]: You had that on from before, Mr. President.

2300
03:03:15,879 --> 03:03:17,160
[SPEAKER_24]: My apologies, Councilor.

2301
03:03:17,180 --> 03:03:17,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Camuso.

2302
03:03:19,081 --> 03:03:27,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you as well as Mayor McGlynn as he presents his final budget to the Medford City Council.

2303
03:03:28,587 --> 03:03:36,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, this is a budget that is going to provide city services at a level that I think is sufficient.

2304
03:03:36,832 --> 03:03:43,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been a member of this council when times were really, really tough and when times were really, really good.

2305
03:03:44,376 --> 03:03:46,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, we're basically at a point or a juncture that

2306
03:03:48,069 --> 03:03:49,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Things in the city are moving forward.

2307
03:03:50,571 --> 03:04:05,480
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm proud to say that that was a collaborative effort, Mayor McGlynn and the city council, the school committee, the superintendent, and all the magnificent department heads and employees that we have here in this very building.

2308
03:04:06,741 --> 03:04:14,306
[SPEAKER_15]: But as I get ready to vote on Mayor McGlynn's final budget favorably, and I'm only one of seven members,

2309
03:04:15,818 --> 03:04:19,180
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing that did stick out to me was the statistics on the parking program.

2310
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:29,885
[SPEAKER_15]: And it looks roughly about there's about 34 to 33,000 transactions at the meters throughout our community a month.

2311
03:04:30,885 --> 03:04:35,388
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a pretty impressive number.

2312
03:04:36,008 --> 03:04:42,211
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you go to look at the citations and the citations collected, the number seems to be going down in the last few months.

2313
03:04:43,298 --> 03:04:52,011
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's another interesting piece of data that we were presented from Mayor McGlynn and his staff.

2314
03:04:53,997 --> 03:04:56,678
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, this is a good solid budget.

2315
03:04:57,899 --> 03:05:07,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very, very happy that the mayor agreed with this honorable body and funded the substance abuse prevention coordinator for the city of Medford.

2316
03:05:08,303 --> 03:05:12,604
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a position that is much needed.

2317
03:05:12,624 --> 03:05:21,488
[SPEAKER_15]: I think everyone on this council supported it when I first brought the idea forward and the mayor took it to one

2318
03:05:22,523 --> 03:05:25,365
[SPEAKER_15]: One step further, another level, and he made it a full-time position.

2319
03:05:26,006 --> 03:05:43,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So certainly, I'm proud of that, and I think that that's a legacy on this entire council, because we initiated it here, and hopefully it's going to be a position that turns out to be a lifesaver when people are ready to utilize the person that's awarded that job in the very near future.

2320
03:05:45,901 --> 03:05:49,965
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, I think the school department budget is a very solid budget, too.

2321
03:05:50,345 --> 03:05:51,646
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent pointed out

2322
03:05:52,830 --> 03:05:56,692
[SPEAKER_15]: the money that's being spent in maintenance and in repairs.

2323
03:05:57,453 --> 03:06:17,322
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent also pointed out that the lump sum checks or the lump sum raises that some were saying were $60,000, a significant amount of money, were actually bonafide employment opportunities where people took new positions, is that correct, superintendent, that were publicly posted and things of that nature.

2324
03:06:19,397 --> 03:06:31,145
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to clear up some of the confusion on that, because I get some phone calls from people in the school department saying, where did these jobs that are referred to on TV, where are they?

2325
03:06:31,905 --> 03:06:37,268
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm thankful the superintendent gave us that in-depth report as well.

2326
03:06:37,729 --> 03:06:41,471
[SPEAKER_15]: But like I said, I think that this is a solid budget, Mr. President.

2327
03:06:41,911 --> 03:06:44,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I was prepared to vote on this budget last week.

2328
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:48,762
[SPEAKER_15]: after the final budget deliberations.

2329
03:06:49,382 --> 03:06:55,927
[SPEAKER_15]: But, Louise, you did a fabulous job on your first budget, your first of many budgets, hopefully, here.

2330
03:06:56,528 --> 03:07:02,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Either that or you'll be doing purchasing, I guess, because you have your contract as our purchasing agent for the next several years.

2331
03:07:03,113 --> 03:07:14,762
[SPEAKER_15]: But, like I said, we're at a juncture in our community right now, Mr. President, where we're, in a very short period of time, the faces and names of

2332
03:07:16,236 --> 03:07:19,659
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of elected officials in this community are going to be changing.

2333
03:07:19,679 --> 03:07:21,220
[SPEAKER_15]: That's factual at this point.

2334
03:07:21,820 --> 03:07:29,326
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really a good opportunity to keep the city stagnant and moving backwards or forward or wherever the voters may see fit.

2335
03:07:29,986 --> 03:07:34,309
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that being said, I think that this is a solid, solid budget.

2336
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:35,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And I support it.

2337
03:07:36,151 --> 03:07:38,753
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully it gets voted on favorably.

2338
03:07:39,293 --> 03:07:45,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And the personnel throughout the community can get back to work tomorrow knowing that the budget is in place.

2339
03:07:46,809 --> 03:07:50,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really don't have anything else to say about it.

2340
03:07:50,090 --> 03:07:56,733
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want to thank the department heads, and particularly Louise Miller, Superintendent Belson, and Mayor McGlynn.

2341
03:07:57,653 --> 03:08:04,616
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, he's been around, and this isn't a Mayor McGlynn, Ra-Ra speech at all, but he's been around when times were tough around here and when times were good.

2342
03:08:06,236 --> 03:08:10,458
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city services were always a priority.

2343
03:08:11,598 --> 03:08:13,259
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city services, where they are,

2344
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:19,242
[SPEAKER_15]: 28 years ago and a lot added and not cut back.

2345
03:08:19,942 --> 03:08:26,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So for that, and it was really good to always support a budget too with no trash fee.

2346
03:08:26,925 --> 03:08:30,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Like our neighboring community of Malden, we were still able to get through another budget cycle without that.

2347
03:08:31,407 --> 03:08:38,490
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot of positive stuff happened over the past couple of years under Mayor McGlynn's watchful eye.

2348
03:08:39,771 --> 03:08:40,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

2349
03:08:41,652 --> 03:08:42,372
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Marks.

2350
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:44,660
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2351
03:08:44,881 --> 03:08:51,743
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, as one member of the council, I'm glad we waited the one week to get responses.

2352
03:08:52,283 --> 03:09:05,388
[SPEAKER_30]: We did get a lot of responses in the last week to questions that we've asked during the countless hours we had with the budget director and also the department heads.

2353
03:09:06,088 --> 03:09:09,149
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it was only appropriate that we took the time to make sure

2354
03:09:10,170 --> 03:09:15,275
[SPEAKER_30]: that every single question was answered, so I'm grateful for that, and I'm grateful to all the responses.

2355
03:09:16,015 --> 03:09:18,057
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, I see it a little different.

2356
03:09:18,077 --> 03:09:28,526
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, when you hear words like, we're gonna provide the same level of service we did last year, I don't know how that's supposed to give you a warm, fuzzy feeling.

2357
03:09:30,028 --> 03:09:31,989
[SPEAKER_30]: We're gonna do what we did for you last year.

2358
03:09:32,209 --> 03:09:36,113
[SPEAKER_30]: We're not gonna improve, we're not gonna advance, we're gonna do what we did for you last year.

2359
03:09:37,156 --> 03:09:41,679
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to charge you more taxes but provide you the same services we did you last year.

2360
03:09:42,920 --> 03:09:46,202
[SPEAKER_30]: And then when you look at the service, we talked about the Office of Community Development.

2361
03:09:46,423 --> 03:09:50,666
[SPEAKER_30]: We've talked about that office for 10 years now under this administration.

2362
03:09:51,166 --> 03:09:51,826
[SPEAKER_30]: Ten years.

2363
03:09:52,187 --> 03:09:55,149
[SPEAKER_30]: They have one and a half person in that office.

2364
03:09:56,410 --> 03:09:59,232
[SPEAKER_30]: We talked to the director of community development.

2365
03:09:59,532 --> 03:10:01,914
[SPEAKER_30]: It was one of the first times she actually opened up to us.

2366
03:10:02,534 --> 03:10:04,175
[SPEAKER_30]: And we asked her, what are your needs?

2367
03:10:04,215 --> 03:10:06,517
[SPEAKER_30]: I believe it was Councilor Penta that asked, what are your needs?

2368
03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:17,091
[SPEAKER_30]: And she said, you know what, in order to revitalize the square and do what we need, our office needs to do to move the city forward, it'd be nice to have a transportation planner.

2369
03:10:17,872 --> 03:10:19,574
[SPEAKER_30]: It'd be nice to have a community planner.

2370
03:10:20,034 --> 03:10:21,596
[SPEAKER_30]: It would be nice to have a grant writer.

2371
03:10:22,817 --> 03:10:27,222
[SPEAKER_30]: Those are the few things that are a staple in an office of community development.

2372
03:10:28,111 --> 03:10:34,872
[SPEAKER_30]: in order to look at revitalization and attract new business and new growth and new spending in our community.

2373
03:10:35,253 --> 03:10:36,113
[SPEAKER_30]: That's what's needed.

2374
03:10:36,493 --> 03:10:39,173
[SPEAKER_30]: This budget does not accomplish any of that.

2375
03:10:39,914 --> 03:10:43,474
[SPEAKER_30]: So to sit here and say we're moving forward, where are we moving forward?

2376
03:10:44,274 --> 03:10:47,615
[SPEAKER_30]: Same level of service we're hearing, same departments.

2377
03:10:48,375 --> 03:10:51,916
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, have they sprinkled a few things here and there by osmosis?

2378
03:10:51,996 --> 03:10:53,876
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, something's bound to happen.

2379
03:10:54,797 --> 03:10:56,217
[SPEAKER_30]: But other than that, really,

2380
03:10:56,748 --> 03:11:06,812
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, we talked about a 311 system, a way residents can electronically report concerns for city services.

2381
03:11:08,373 --> 03:11:12,895
[SPEAKER_30]: We have yet, Somerville has it, Malden has it, Boston has it, Cambridge has it.

2382
03:11:13,215 --> 03:11:21,218
[SPEAKER_30]: We as a city have yet to implement any logical way residents can submit a service request in our community.

2383
03:11:21,773 --> 03:11:27,654
[SPEAKER_30]: And it also helps the administration during budget time when you're able to take all these requests and say, you know what?

2384
03:11:28,034 --> 03:11:32,195
[SPEAKER_30]: We had 3,000 requests for forestry and only 50 requests for parks.

2385
03:11:32,716 --> 03:11:38,077
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's take the budget and let's increase our budget for forestry based on the requests we're receiving.

2386
03:11:38,457 --> 03:11:40,657
[SPEAKER_30]: There's no tracking mechanism in this community.

2387
03:11:41,898 --> 03:11:43,318
[SPEAKER_30]: Honestly, I don't know how it operates.

2388
03:11:43,678 --> 03:11:51,140
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're going to find out come January how this city operates, because it's been a lot of smoke and mirrors for many years in this community.

2389
03:11:51,813 --> 03:11:53,194
[SPEAKER_30]: The 311 system works.

2390
03:11:54,154 --> 03:11:58,756
[SPEAKER_30]: It works in every other community, but except Method can't find the time.

2391
03:11:59,316 --> 03:12:03,438
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know if we don't have the brainpower to implement it, or we don't have the will to do it.

2392
03:12:03,898 --> 03:12:04,638
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know what it is.

2393
03:12:05,258 --> 03:12:08,940
[SPEAKER_30]: But every resident suffers because we don't have 311 in this community.

2394
03:12:09,560 --> 03:12:11,621
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, we talked about the engineering department.

2395
03:12:12,741 --> 03:12:19,304
[SPEAKER_30]: The engineering director came up, and she mentioned that they don't have data collection software.

2396
03:12:19,644 --> 03:12:21,345
[SPEAKER_30]: They have files and files of

2397
03:12:22,064 --> 03:12:25,867
[SPEAKER_30]: of data that's not electronic.

2398
03:12:25,907 --> 03:12:28,249
[SPEAKER_30]: They can't find what's in these cabinets.

2399
03:12:28,549 --> 03:12:37,195
[SPEAKER_30]: I believe she said it was about $30,000 to implement a system where they can have a tracking mechanism for all the electronic documents they have.

2400
03:12:37,655 --> 03:12:41,158
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a small fee in a $150 million budget.

2401
03:12:42,519 --> 03:12:45,621
[SPEAKER_30]: As was mentioned earlier, there's one phone for four employees.

2402
03:12:45,641 --> 03:12:49,704
[SPEAKER_30]: And forget about voicemail.

2403
03:12:49,744 --> 03:12:50,865
[SPEAKER_30]: The mayor's against voicemail.

2404
03:12:51,421 --> 03:12:53,662
[SPEAKER_30]: That's how progressive we are in this community.

2405
03:12:54,003 --> 03:12:55,604
[SPEAKER_30]: He's against voicemail.

2406
03:12:56,004 --> 03:12:59,306
[SPEAKER_30]: They're still using drafting tables as desk.

2407
03:12:59,326 --> 03:13:02,308
[SPEAKER_30]: How would you like to write on a drafting table all day?

2408
03:13:03,729 --> 03:13:04,830
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't make any sense.

2409
03:13:05,430 --> 03:13:11,134
[SPEAKER_30]: But these are the small requests that for some reason we can't get a handle on in this community.

2410
03:13:11,874 --> 03:13:19,279
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, during the budget, um, we had the council on aging in and I offered a motion to the budget because of

2411
03:13:20,335 --> 03:13:36,205
[SPEAKER_30]: the involvement I see at the senior center across the street, we were told that there were 24,796 sign-ins by seniors for programming activities at the senior center.

2412
03:13:36,645 --> 03:13:43,409
[SPEAKER_30]: It ranged from bingo, to dinner movie, to Zumba, to chair yoga, and the list goes on and on and on.

2413
03:13:44,129 --> 03:13:46,991
[SPEAKER_30]: They only receive state funding for their programs.

2414
03:13:47,672 --> 03:13:54,677
[SPEAKER_30]: We asked that we set up, similar to what we did for the art community, $5,000 to provide for additional programming.

2415
03:13:56,278 --> 03:13:58,480
[SPEAKER_30]: The director told us she could use it.

2416
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:05,365
[SPEAKER_30]: Then we were told, well, they also wanted the Council on Aging gave back money, transferred back money to the city.

2417
03:14:05,765 --> 03:14:16,213
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know, when I'm talking to a department head face to face, and they tell me $5,000 can go a long way for senior programming in the city, I tend to trust the department head.

2418
03:14:17,658 --> 03:14:20,099
[SPEAKER_30]: I tend to trust the department could use that money.

2419
03:14:20,579 --> 03:14:29,542
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's a shame that we got a response back that the mayor will take that under advisement in a program that's so utilized by thousands of seniors in this community.

2420
03:14:30,623 --> 03:14:34,164
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, we heard from the chief of police.

2421
03:14:35,585 --> 03:14:39,026
[SPEAKER_30]: This budget does not contain any money for new police vehicles.

2422
03:14:40,878 --> 03:14:44,701
[SPEAKER_30]: Although we have vehicles that have 250,000 miles.

2423
03:14:45,101 --> 03:14:48,744
[SPEAKER_30]: These vehicles operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

2424
03:14:49,104 --> 03:14:56,030
[SPEAKER_30]: Try running your vehicle seven days a week, 24 hours a day with multiple drivers and see what happens to your vehicle.

2425
03:14:57,191 --> 03:14:58,051
[SPEAKER_30]: They don't last long.

2426
03:14:59,653 --> 03:15:04,436
[SPEAKER_30]: The chief asked for six marked vehicles and six unmarked vehicles.

2427
03:15:04,997 --> 03:15:07,679
[SPEAKER_30]: That is not going to be part of this year's budget.

2428
03:15:08,039 --> 03:15:10,061
[SPEAKER_30]: So I don't know how excited I'd be

2429
03:15:10,483 --> 03:15:11,303
[SPEAKER_30]: about this budget.

2430
03:15:11,663 --> 03:15:16,404
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't include the very fabric of a community, which is public safety.

2431
03:15:17,645 --> 03:15:18,185
[SPEAKER_30]: Vehicles.

2432
03:15:18,625 --> 03:15:20,185
[SPEAKER_30]: You can have as many officers as you want.

2433
03:15:20,425 --> 03:15:24,306
[SPEAKER_30]: If you don't have the vehicle to take them to a scene or answer a call, then what good is it?

2434
03:15:25,426 --> 03:15:27,307
[SPEAKER_30]: Talk to the men and women in the police department.

2435
03:15:27,587 --> 03:15:28,887
[SPEAKER_30]: They'll tell you about the vehicles.

2436
03:15:29,207 --> 03:15:30,808
[SPEAKER_30]: Take a ride in the cars.

2437
03:15:31,048 --> 03:15:32,608
[SPEAKER_30]: I challenge you to take a ride in the cars.

2438
03:15:33,628 --> 03:15:36,249
[SPEAKER_30]: They're smelling exhaust fumes from some of these vehicles.

2439
03:15:39,462 --> 03:15:42,183
[SPEAKER_30]: Then we heard from the chief of the fire department.

2440
03:15:42,564 --> 03:15:44,765
[SPEAKER_30]: He asked for $2 million in station repairs.

2441
03:15:45,966 --> 03:15:53,910
[SPEAKER_30]: We still can't get a repair list of what's needed from the last repairs that were done with that bonding money that Councilor Wongo just mentioned.

2442
03:15:56,191 --> 03:16:08,338
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, it seems to me when you're talking about level services and complimenting the fact that level services are good news,

2443
03:16:09,115 --> 03:16:13,096
[SPEAKER_30]: then it seems to me the status quo is what's prevailing in the city.

2444
03:16:14,556 --> 03:16:16,316
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's what's taking place in this community.

2445
03:16:17,476 --> 03:16:19,697
[SPEAKER_30]: It seems to me the status quo is fine.

2446
03:16:20,277 --> 03:16:21,857
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, look, we're doing what we did last year.

2447
03:16:22,877 --> 03:16:24,258
[SPEAKER_30]: That's unacceptable in my opinion.

2448
03:16:25,138 --> 03:16:27,078
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, there are a lot of positive things.

2449
03:16:27,098 --> 03:16:31,179
[SPEAKER_30]: We heard from the superintendent of schools, and a lot of positive things are going in there.

2450
03:16:31,859 --> 03:16:38,020
[SPEAKER_30]: As a former graduate of the vocational school, I'm happy with the direction Heidi Riccio's taking the vocational school.

2451
03:16:38,373 --> 03:16:52,684
[SPEAKER_30]: They're adding a lot of program offerings to the vocational school, state-of-the-art offerings, which will attract kids back from Lexington Minuteman, which is costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars to send these outside placements.

2452
03:16:53,385 --> 03:16:56,828
[SPEAKER_30]: We're adding textbooks in the social studies department.

2453
03:16:57,148 --> 03:16:59,370
[SPEAKER_30]: Our guidance department added an additional Councilor.

2454
03:17:00,050 --> 03:17:04,113
[SPEAKER_30]: We're looking at additional desk and chairs throughout the elementary schools.

2455
03:17:04,914 --> 03:17:06,275
[SPEAKER_30]: As Councilor Camuso mentioned,

2456
03:17:06,898 --> 03:17:10,481
[SPEAKER_30]: The city is providing a prevention outreach program coordinator.

2457
03:17:11,341 --> 03:17:15,804
[SPEAKER_30]: We recently put on a code enforcement officer that Councilor Caraviello has been talking about.

2458
03:17:16,645 --> 03:17:18,486
[SPEAKER_30]: So there are positive things happening.

2459
03:17:19,147 --> 03:17:25,531
[SPEAKER_30]: I just don't think it's enough to outweigh the current status quo in the way this city is operating, to be quite honest with you.

2460
03:17:26,312 --> 03:17:28,954
[SPEAKER_30]: I am appreciative of everything that was sent from the administration.

2461
03:17:29,354 --> 03:17:32,837
[SPEAKER_30]: I think this budget process overall went rather smooth.

2462
03:17:33,417 --> 03:17:34,778
[SPEAKER_30]: We got our budget packages.

2463
03:17:35,568 --> 03:17:43,212
[SPEAKER_30]: well ahead of time, so it gave us ample opportunity to view them, which has always been a bone of contention with me and I know members of this council.

2464
03:17:44,413 --> 03:17:58,480
[SPEAKER_30]: I will support the budget here tonight, but I'm hoping going forward that the status quo and the fact that we're going to provide level services is no longer bragging right in this city.

2465
03:17:58,900 --> 03:18:00,661
[SPEAKER_30]: And it should be something we frown upon.

2466
03:18:01,441 --> 03:18:04,703
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's a sad commentary when we have to say,

2467
03:18:05,083 --> 03:18:13,208
[SPEAKER_30]: we're providing the same services we did last year, knowing that in my opinion, a lot of those services are not accurate enough as is.

2468
03:18:14,008 --> 03:18:19,332
[SPEAKER_30]: And I really think it's a sad commentary, but I will support this budget here tonight.

2469
03:18:20,252 --> 03:18:31,099
[SPEAKER_30]: And I look forward to next year's budget and the discussion and dialogue over how we can improve our community

2470
03:18:31,566 --> 03:18:48,553
[SPEAKER_30]: have a vision of community development, look at some of the needs, infrastructure needs that we have, discussion on a new police department, discussion on revamping our old fire departments, and looking at the roads and the sidewalks and everything else.

2471
03:18:48,633 --> 03:18:49,633
[SPEAKER_30]: The list goes on and on.

2472
03:18:49,893 --> 03:18:50,974
[SPEAKER_30]: The public library.

2473
03:18:50,994 --> 03:18:55,456
[SPEAKER_30]: These are the things that really I think we have to look at as a community.

2474
03:18:56,236 --> 03:18:58,997
[SPEAKER_30]: And I look forward to those discussions next year.

2475
03:19:01,783 --> 03:19:02,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2476
03:19:04,685 --> 03:19:05,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penter.

2477
03:19:07,087 --> 03:19:08,788
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of things pop out.

2478
03:19:09,689 --> 03:19:14,373
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue on the kiosks in the square, citations have gone up.

2479
03:19:14,413 --> 03:19:15,193
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't gone down.

2480
03:19:15,233 --> 03:19:17,095
[SPEAKER_09]: January was 590, February was 1,800, March was 2,393, April was 2,689.

2481
03:19:17,135 --> 03:19:21,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in the month of May, it went down by some 300 citations, but they're still issuing over 2,000 of those a month.

2482
03:19:31,652 --> 03:19:32,453
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awful lot.

2483
03:19:32,673 --> 03:19:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an awful lot of citations.

2484
03:19:34,734 --> 03:19:47,441
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the chief has indicated, and I believe in his report back to us, that some 400 of the 1,100 citations that were appealed were either reduced or they were abated to some degree.

2485
03:19:48,782 --> 03:20:00,128
[SPEAKER_09]: This kiosk program, as we all know, has been a handicap, in my opinion, to businesses throughout the community as it relates to not being business friendly,

2486
03:20:01,507 --> 03:20:09,129
[SPEAKER_09]: when in fact we could have engaged in a revenue, I mean, strike that, a traffic enforcement program rather than a revenue enhancement program.

2487
03:20:10,029 --> 03:20:18,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear what some of my colleagues are saying, but the hard part about supporting a budget like this is the following.

2488
03:20:18,791 --> 03:20:23,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Louise, you were there because you presented this budget and worked on it with us.

2489
03:20:25,612 --> 03:20:29,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any reason why in the electrical department for their $40,000 that they were looking for,

2490
03:20:32,135 --> 03:20:51,922
[SPEAKER_09]: not to strike the electrical engineering, the building department probably almost around the same amount, at least the police department, even if he got a couple or two or three cruises, you had a fight for the $5,000 and the Council of Aging budget, you had a fight to get the $227,000, and you added on to make it $250,000 for the library.

2491
03:20:52,903 --> 03:20:59,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any reason, since you knew that these were concerns from the Council, and before this came back tonight, that you couldn't have come back

2492
03:21:00,471 --> 03:21:06,615
[SPEAKER_09]: and added this in the budget, and some shape me in a reform, because the budget did increase by $4,800,000 from last year.

2493
03:21:06,875 --> 03:21:10,497
[SPEAKER_09]: This is almost two years in a row that this budget's increased by approximately $5 million.

2494
03:21:11,617 --> 03:21:14,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So an increase in the budget by $5 million are close to it.

2495
03:21:14,819 --> 03:21:17,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You're maxing out 2.5% to the max.

2496
03:21:18,722 --> 03:21:24,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Councilor Marks just alluded to, what you're doing is, well, we don't want to see this next year.

2497
03:21:25,365 --> 03:21:28,107
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've heard that rhetoric before about not seeing it next year.

2498
03:21:28,528 --> 03:21:30,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seeing it here right now for the first year.

2499
03:21:31,989 --> 03:21:34,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not to put it on you, because this is what was handed to you.

2500
03:21:36,151 --> 03:21:48,795
[SPEAKER_09]: But if one, two, three, four, if five department heads are all saying the same thing, and even if you increased each one of these departments by $30,000 each, that's what, $150,000 that you can't find in the budget?

2501
03:21:48,835 --> 03:21:50,376
[SPEAKER_09]: When, in fact, you just transferred over $1,200,000 at the end of the year?

2502
03:21:59,231 --> 03:22:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't buy into that.

2503
03:22:01,112 --> 03:22:15,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And just what's happened, unfortunately, with the kiosks and the business people in the community and the last horror show of a lady yesterday with the kiosks and the machine and being yelled at when she went to Park Medford.

2504
03:22:16,475 --> 03:22:27,358
[SPEAKER_09]: And tonight, getting a report back from someone who had to wait two months to get his appeal answered, when I thought the appeal was taking place in this building and Park Medford is still doing the appeals.

2505
03:22:28,029 --> 03:22:36,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how this works, Chief, but if Park Medford is doing the appeals, when we were told it was being done in this building, there's still something wrong.

2506
03:22:36,672 --> 03:22:45,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't think I'm going to vote for this budget, because to me, it does not represent a budget that represents the quality of life that the people of this community need.

2507
03:22:45,596 --> 03:22:46,496
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my opinion.

2508
03:22:47,037 --> 03:22:51,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm going to stick to it, because, like I said, this has been very insightful to me.

2509
03:22:55,603 --> 03:22:59,726
[SPEAKER_09]: to talk to you and tell you things that we never heard before, that bothers me.

2510
03:23:00,547 --> 03:23:01,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It bothers me.

2511
03:23:01,307 --> 03:23:02,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And it should bother you, too.

2512
03:23:05,431 --> 03:23:07,112
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, Mr. President.

2513
03:23:07,172 --> 03:23:25,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So with regard to the requests that were made by the department heads, the fire department and police department really had capital requests or large one-time expenditures, with the exception of the police cruisers, which

2514
03:23:26,910 --> 03:23:33,513
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a substantial amount of money in order to start some type of replacement cycle with regard to the police cruisers.

2515
03:23:34,433 --> 03:23:42,976
[SPEAKER_05]: With respect to the building department software, we need more information before we fund anything in the budget.

2516
03:23:43,696 --> 03:23:52,399
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be some research done into what type of software, how it would be implemented, and some type of implementation timeframe.

2517
03:23:53,731 --> 03:23:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any of that information right now.

2518
03:23:55,912 --> 03:24:05,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And the engineering department was, did have some funding available this year and was asked to get quotes on some of the items that were asked for.

2519
03:24:05,615 --> 03:24:12,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them will be able to be purchased and others, I believe the city engineer did respond.

2520
03:24:12,617 --> 03:24:20,840
[SPEAKER_05]: She did not have prices with respect to the document management program, but for a small amount of money could get a study to figure out what

2521
03:24:21,480 --> 03:24:24,721
[SPEAKER_05]: document management program her department would require.

2522
03:24:25,701 --> 03:24:28,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is money available for that.

2523
03:24:28,022 --> 03:24:32,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only to the order of $2,000 to get the study completed.

2524
03:24:32,883 --> 03:24:39,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of, I mean, these items are items that certainly require further study.

2525
03:24:40,085 --> 03:24:46,847
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're not right, I would say at this point, to put into this fiscal year 16 operating budget.

2526
03:24:46,887 --> 03:24:48,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And the capital items can't be.

2527
03:24:49,050 --> 03:24:55,392
[SPEAKER_09]: But in all fairness to you coming on late in the process, had these wish list issues been discussed?

2528
03:24:55,432 --> 03:24:58,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you just got through saying in the building department, you needed more info.

2529
03:24:59,333 --> 03:25:06,015
[SPEAKER_09]: So if this was brought up in February, which I believe is when the building department, why would the questions asked then of him?

2530
03:25:06,095 --> 03:25:07,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should he have to come up with it?

2531
03:25:08,375 --> 03:25:16,597
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's telling you what he'd like to have, then isn't that what the budget director does or an assistant to the budget director going into the engineering department?

2532
03:25:16,878 --> 03:25:18,398
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been asking for this for four years.

2533
03:25:19,401 --> 03:25:28,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't answer for the prior budget director, and also I can't answer to any conversations that they had.

2534
03:25:28,627 --> 03:25:35,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only answer the question, you know, today based upon what was said in the budget hearings after she was gone.

2535
03:25:35,931 --> 03:25:41,054
[SPEAKER_09]: But when all these department heads indicated that they made the request and they were told not to include it and not to talk about it.

2536
03:25:42,375 --> 03:25:43,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2537
03:25:43,596 --> 03:25:44,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2538
03:25:44,936 --> 03:25:49,079
[SPEAKER_15]: These are all proposals that were brought

2539
03:25:49,564 --> 03:25:54,166
[SPEAKER_15]: through the chain of command, and ultimately the decision was made with Mayor McGlynn.

2540
03:25:54,526 --> 03:25:57,187
[SPEAKER_15]: If he wanted him in the budget, he would have put him in the budget.

2541
03:26:00,249 --> 03:26:14,135
[SPEAKER_15]: This is, and just, I'm going to wrap up, but it's kind of ironic because the council wants to keep adding to the budget, adding to the budget, adding to the budget, but every time we have a paper before us to add something good, he votes against it.

2542
03:26:14,375 --> 03:26:16,576
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, it's just, I'm finding it kind of ironic right now.

2543
03:26:18,859 --> 03:26:24,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Louise, on the library issue of getting ourselves certified, for the last six years we've been getting waivers.

2544
03:26:25,304 --> 03:26:29,668
[SPEAKER_09]: If the money had been included in the budget not to get away, it's good for the first, second year, okay, maybe there was a problem.

2545
03:26:30,989 --> 03:26:40,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But why wasn't the $225, whatever the appropriate dollar amount, included in the budget as part of its operating cost of doing business in the budget?

2546
03:26:40,216 --> 03:26:48,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did it have to be a group of concerned citizens coming forward that finally put the pressure, and with the help of the council, put the pressure to make sure

2547
03:26:49,028 --> 03:26:53,772
[SPEAKER_09]: They got their money, their certification, and they got more employees, and more of an upgrading in the building.

2548
03:26:56,294 --> 03:27:03,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I could only answer a certain revenue was, I mean, the revenue figures were put together, and the budget was developed based upon that revenue.

2549
03:27:04,982 --> 03:27:10,987
[SPEAKER_05]: The revenue figure changed after the budget was presented to the council, and that is how the money was able to be funded.

2550
03:27:11,047 --> 03:27:12,028
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the whole thing.

2551
03:27:12,068 --> 03:27:16,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if we're supposed to be operating according to laws or rules and regulations,

2552
03:27:18,052 --> 03:27:24,036
[SPEAKER_09]: We shouldn't be looking for a waiver each and every year and just go on a wing and a prayer, because eventually it's going to come to an end.

2553
03:27:25,036 --> 03:27:31,760
[SPEAKER_09]: A true, actual, factual operating cost of that library is its recertification, whatever it might be.

2554
03:27:32,200 --> 03:27:33,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Not depending upon a waiver.

2555
03:27:34,422 --> 03:27:38,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And not to have a department head be worried about saying anything, because he's going to get in trouble.

2556
03:27:39,745 --> 03:27:40,545
[SPEAKER_09]: That to me is wrong.

2557
03:27:41,586 --> 03:27:42,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you know it's wrong, too.

2558
03:27:46,088 --> 03:27:46,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

2559
03:27:47,648 --> 03:27:48,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2560
03:27:49,309 --> 03:27:50,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Marks is right.

2561
03:27:51,590 --> 03:27:55,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing a level from the budget is not really what we wanted.

2562
03:27:57,554 --> 03:28:01,656
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a lot of improvements made in the schools and other things, and I'm grateful for that.

2563
03:28:01,676 --> 03:28:11,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hope going forward and for the short time that I've seen you as budget director, I'm very happy with the job that you've done and some of your suggestions going forward.

2564
03:28:12,202 --> 03:28:17,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope that when next year's budget comes around, it's a lot different than this year's budget.

2565
03:28:17,453 --> 03:28:29,516
[SPEAKER_04]: to be more detailed so at the end of the year we're not transferring money around so we can have a true indication of what we need for each particular department so we're not overspending or underspending.

2566
03:28:31,076 --> 03:28:35,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I will support this budget tonight because there are a lot of good things in it.

2567
03:28:38,758 --> 03:28:39,919
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

2568
03:28:40,059 --> 03:28:40,859
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Camuso.

2569
03:28:43,019 --> 03:28:43,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2570
03:28:44,560 --> 03:28:45,420
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President.

2571
03:28:45,843 --> 03:28:47,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

2572
03:28:47,885 --> 03:28:56,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going back and forth on this one, so I'll just leave my comments with bullet-pointed positives and negatives.

2573
03:28:56,472 --> 03:29:05,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some great positive things in the budget with the opiate addiction specialist, obviously the library funding that was desperately needed.

2574
03:29:06,862 --> 03:29:11,846
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hiring fire and police personnel, which is definitely a positive.

2575
03:29:12,397 --> 03:29:13,717
[SPEAKER_03]: new code enforcement officer.

2576
03:29:14,477 --> 03:29:16,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Our tree warding has gone full time.

2577
03:29:16,698 --> 03:29:17,918
[SPEAKER_03]: She does an amazing job.

2578
03:29:18,998 --> 03:29:22,339
[SPEAKER_03]: On the school side, I'll echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

2579
03:29:22,359 --> 03:29:27,960
[SPEAKER_03]: The vocational school, I'm very impressed with how it's evolved, how we discussed it a few years ago.

2580
03:29:27,980 --> 03:29:31,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to add programming, and now programming is being added.

2581
03:29:31,540 --> 03:29:40,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that a positive, and I find that only helpful for our students and keeping them in Medford rather than sending them out of town.

2582
03:29:41,585 --> 03:29:46,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I also, you know, looking through the budget, class size is at a great level.

2583
03:29:47,068 --> 03:29:54,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's one class out of the, you know, 25 or 30 that maybe has over the 20, 21 mark.

2584
03:29:55,752 --> 03:29:59,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, besides that one class, I think that's an extreme positive.

2585
03:30:01,194 --> 03:30:04,275
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do find concern in is, you know, the level fundedness.

2586
03:30:04,315 --> 03:30:09,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that the level funded portion falls mainly on the city side.

2587
03:30:10,607 --> 03:30:15,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the school side has added a number of jobs within the last year or two.

2588
03:30:16,329 --> 03:30:17,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Five new jobs created.

2589
03:30:18,010 --> 03:30:20,851
[SPEAKER_03]: That total is about $500,000.

2590
03:30:20,971 --> 03:30:28,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I see people did get raises, but the way it was worked, I understand positions were changed.

2591
03:30:28,874 --> 03:30:30,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're talking some people $6,000, $7,000, $20,000 raises.

2592
03:30:30,915 --> 03:30:32,635
[SPEAKER_03]: $1.8 million on the school side, mainly to personnel.

2593
03:30:40,202 --> 03:30:59,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Although some good hires, and there's a lot of people that work very hard there, I feel that the school's almost getting a little top heavy, especially when you hear people comment about how some people don't even know what a few of the administrators really are doing with their time.

2594
03:30:59,258 --> 03:31:01,059
[SPEAKER_03]: That extremely concerns me.

2595
03:31:02,580 --> 03:31:09,106
[SPEAKER_03]: With the city side, I've mentioned it a number of times, the warranties on the buildings are a concern of mine.

2596
03:31:10,151 --> 03:31:17,135
[SPEAKER_03]: We were blasted with regards to the girls' locker room, with regards to the police station.

2597
03:31:17,195 --> 03:31:18,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been five years.

2598
03:31:18,595 --> 03:31:19,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was taken care of.

2599
03:31:19,836 --> 03:31:27,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been five years that the female police officers haven't had a facility, a locker room.

2600
03:31:28,800 --> 03:31:30,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I have grave concerns about the building.

2601
03:31:30,801 --> 03:31:34,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been discussed two, three, four, five years in a row.

2602
03:31:34,723 --> 03:31:38,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Grave concerns about the building the police personnel are working in.

2603
03:31:38,607 --> 03:31:40,688
[SPEAKER_03]: and the lack of funding we've put towards that.

2604
03:31:41,668 --> 03:31:50,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I have concerns with regards to, we under-budgeted the MWRA water and sewer accounts by almost a million dollars.

2605
03:31:51,292 --> 03:32:00,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We under-budgeted, well, snow and ice, understandably, we had a tough winter, but we are one point, you can correct me if I'm wrong, 1.7, 1.8 in the hole on that.

2606
03:32:01,216 --> 03:32:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully with the state aid, that will bring that down 400,000.

2607
03:32:03,137 --> 03:32:04,598
[SPEAKER_03]: We have leaks in the police station.

2608
03:32:08,788 --> 03:32:09,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll echo my sentiments.

2609
03:32:10,068 --> 03:32:15,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked repeatedly for a 3-1-1 system, and I don't know how else to ask for it.

2610
03:32:15,710 --> 03:32:31,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've put on four or five resolves on the importance of a 3-1-1 system for accountability and a record outlining when somebody calls on an issue, what steps are taken, when it's going to be resolved, and how long it's going to take for accountability.

2611
03:32:32,014 --> 03:32:36,635
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just randomly fill potholes, or you can't just randomly fix a curb.

2612
03:32:37,269 --> 03:32:38,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be documented.

2613
03:32:39,189 --> 03:32:40,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Our residents deserve that.

2614
03:32:40,590 --> 03:32:42,670
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't just be told they'll be placed on a list.

2615
03:32:43,270 --> 03:32:47,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So how we can get that done, is that me not voting for the budget?

2616
03:32:47,271 --> 03:32:53,513
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an extremely important aspect that works wonderfully, wonderfully at the City of Somerville.

2617
03:32:53,533 --> 03:33:07,036
[SPEAKER_03]: They have it down to a T. And I hate to compare us to the City of Somerville, but it seems like in so many respects, whether it's the Green Line or the 311 system or the personnel they have in their departments, they get it right.

2618
03:33:07,352 --> 03:33:10,574
[SPEAKER_03]: They really get it right, and we really need to follow the lead.

2619
03:33:11,074 --> 03:33:19,919
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you have the administration completely not doing something that's been recommended four or five times, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth.

2620
03:33:22,440 --> 03:33:23,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the issues with the pool.

2621
03:33:23,681 --> 03:33:34,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I have issues with the fact that these raises are going on, yet the kindergarten aides, the paraprofessionals, I mean, they're getting $0.13 raises.

2622
03:33:38,082 --> 03:33:41,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think that's fair.

2623
03:33:41,346 --> 03:33:47,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone can't work more than three hours when they want to, when it's so necessary in the kindergarten class.

2624
03:33:48,313 --> 03:33:50,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in one, believe me.

2625
03:33:50,456 --> 03:33:50,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough.

2626
03:33:51,417 --> 03:33:52,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Aids are needed.

2627
03:33:52,197 --> 03:33:58,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And to say you're worth a $0.13 raise, I just don't find that adequate.

2628
03:33:59,850 --> 03:34:02,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maintenance is another huge issue.

2629
03:34:02,991 --> 03:34:12,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We did what we had to do because we were, you know, and the administration did what they had to do with regards to the library, but, to get accreditation, but what about the maintenance of the library?

2630
03:34:12,333 --> 03:34:15,854
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, you know, I've already said the maintenance of the police station.

2631
03:34:15,914 --> 03:34:20,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about a million, you know, probably a million dollars that needs to go back into the new schools.

2632
03:34:21,596 --> 03:34:27,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a response, but I brought up the issue with regards to the Columbus School roof is coming off.

2633
03:34:28,638 --> 03:34:29,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some,

2634
03:34:30,002 --> 03:34:42,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Something needs to change with regards to maybe doing a little work on our buildings versus the hiring that's happening, I believe, on the school side, where the city side needs more personnel.

2635
03:34:42,453 --> 03:34:46,397
[SPEAKER_03]: OCD department, definitely understaffed.

2636
03:34:47,578 --> 03:34:51,441
[SPEAKER_03]: The engineer had issues, which I was very happy with her openness.

2637
03:34:51,962 --> 03:34:53,303
[SPEAKER_03]: One phone in the whole department.

2638
03:35:04,514 --> 03:35:06,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I could go on and on.

2639
03:35:06,235 --> 03:35:09,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I am torn, but I'm going to stop.

2640
03:35:10,036 --> 03:35:12,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm very thankful for you, Louise.

2641
03:35:12,898 --> 03:35:13,858
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done a great job.

2642
03:35:13,898 --> 03:35:25,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you had more time and, you know, got more information because it was very hard hearing that, you know, you kind of just got on the job six weeks ago, but you did a great job with what you were given.

2643
03:35:27,464 --> 03:35:29,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, you know, happy that we waited the one week.

2644
03:35:29,865 --> 03:35:32,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to have five department heads answer the questions.

2645
03:35:33,617 --> 03:35:35,378
[SPEAKER_03]: on top of what we needed.

2646
03:35:35,398 --> 03:35:40,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like the city needs to move forward a little differently.

2647
03:35:40,122 --> 03:35:44,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I always say that we can't tax to the max.

2648
03:35:44,745 --> 03:35:51,250
[SPEAKER_03]: We seem to have a levy that went up, was able to go up $4.8 million, and guess what?

2649
03:35:51,490 --> 03:35:54,753
[SPEAKER_03]: The budget went up $4.8 million, not a dollar left over.

2650
03:35:56,674 --> 03:36:01,237
[SPEAKER_03]: We have underfunded accounts, which

2651
03:36:02,940 --> 03:36:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Not having the actuals for accounts is the wrong way to present a budget.

2652
03:36:07,844 --> 03:36:09,385
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about that every year as well.

2653
03:36:09,685 --> 03:36:13,348
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to change, but obviously we need to make a stand for that.

2654
03:36:13,948 --> 03:36:17,351
[SPEAKER_03]: For Fire Department in 2015, $1 million was budgeted for overtime, and the actual was $1.5 to $1.6 million.

2655
03:36:17,371 --> 03:36:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: For DPW, $75,000 was budgeted for overtime, and the actual was $700,000.

2656
03:36:31,090 --> 03:36:32,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a problem with that.

2657
03:36:33,512 --> 03:36:40,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Overtime, snow and ice, all these numbers are always way too low.

2658
03:36:40,436 --> 03:36:41,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Way, way, way too low.

2659
03:36:41,637 --> 03:36:47,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're overspending in other areas and we're left shuffling around money or left with a deficit every year.

2660
03:36:54,606 --> 03:36:58,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess my last comment is the no emergency preparedness plans.

2661
03:36:59,329 --> 03:37:00,270
[SPEAKER_03]: We went over that with

2662
03:37:01,688 --> 03:37:09,073
[SPEAKER_03]: civil defense, there is no emergency preparedness plans, which concerns me for a city our size and what goes on in the world today.

2663
03:37:11,775 --> 03:37:13,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of positives, a lot of negatives.

2664
03:37:13,616 --> 03:37:17,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that I had the opportunity to do four hours of reading yesterday.

2665
03:37:17,719 --> 03:37:21,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank my colleagues for allowing us to do that.

2666
03:37:22,582 --> 03:37:28,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And my last comment before I forget, I do have to disclose I have family that works in the school department.

2667
03:37:28,647 --> 03:37:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I'm allowed to vote on the budget.

2668
03:37:31,108 --> 03:37:33,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have to disclose that, so I wanted to do that.

2669
03:37:33,790 --> 03:37:34,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2670
03:37:37,032 --> 03:37:38,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2671
03:37:40,054 --> 03:37:45,838
[SPEAKER_26]: In looking at this budget and in looking at my philosophy, I think our schools are really vital to the future.

2672
03:37:46,359 --> 03:37:48,560
[SPEAKER_26]: success of Medford and the ongoing success of Medford.

2673
03:37:48,580 --> 03:37:50,200
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is an excellent budget for our schools.

2674
03:37:51,340 --> 03:37:53,321
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I can go through the list like everybody else has.

2675
03:37:53,381 --> 03:38:08,044
[SPEAKER_26]: Adjustment council is a facility manager with a preventative maintenance plan and money to use, low student to teacher ratios, compliance with state mandates relative to teacher evaluations, the evolution of the vocational school.

2676
03:38:08,805 --> 03:38:13,486
[SPEAKER_26]: But more importantly, it's the addition of technology in our schools that was something that really excited me about the school budget, Mr. President.

2677
03:38:14,427 --> 03:38:20,770
[SPEAKER_26]: the use of Chromebooks and going digital and actually reducing the cost of materials by embracing the cost of technology.

2678
03:38:21,130 --> 03:38:26,553
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that that's really something that we need to look at here in the city side as well as Medford continues to move and progress.

2679
03:38:27,613 --> 03:38:30,595
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, on the city side we have several new positions that have been created.

2680
03:38:30,655 --> 03:38:33,116
[SPEAKER_26]: We've put, you know, a quarter of a million bucks into the library.

2681
03:38:33,436 --> 03:38:35,597
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a code officer, an additional code officer.

2682
03:38:36,692 --> 03:38:39,935
[SPEAKER_26]: We have the Substance Abuse Outreach Coordinator that's coming on.

2683
03:38:39,975 --> 03:38:41,817
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a clerk in the veteran's office finally.

2684
03:38:42,157 --> 03:38:46,722
[SPEAKER_26]: We've added staff to the police and fire departments, full-time pre-warden as Councilor Longo said.

2685
03:38:47,482 --> 03:38:54,329
[SPEAKER_26]: And one of the other things that's very vital and very important is that capital investments at Hormel and Edgeley Field, they're actually paying off, they're working.

2686
03:38:54,749 --> 03:39:01,215
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're generating non-tax revenues that are reoccurring, Mr. President, that are going to be able to pay for some of these capital projects that everybody keeps talking about.

2687
03:39:02,023 --> 03:39:07,184
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I was prepared to vote on this budget last week and vote for approval on this budget.

2688
03:39:07,204 --> 03:39:10,685
[SPEAKER_26]: And with that being said, Mr. President, I'm prepared to do it again this week, and I'll move for approval.

2689
03:39:13,026 --> 03:39:13,426
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

2690
03:39:13,466 --> 03:39:17,667
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso is seconded by Councilor Knight.

2691
03:39:17,787 --> 03:39:18,667
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Penta.

2692
03:39:20,108 --> 03:39:21,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick point.

2693
03:39:22,908 --> 03:39:27,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I do, you know, but Councilor Longo just enlightened me about something.

2694
03:39:28,170 --> 03:39:28,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Roy, are you here?

2695
03:39:28,810 --> 03:39:29,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you still here?

2696
03:39:30,988 --> 03:39:31,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick question for you.

2697
03:39:32,990 --> 03:39:37,974
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the lowest people on the totem pole, and they haven't had a raise in over eight years, the lunch mothers.

2698
03:39:39,335 --> 03:39:40,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You said you were going to check into it.

2699
03:39:41,117 --> 03:39:43,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2700
03:39:43,379 --> 03:39:47,682
[SPEAKER_19]: The school department has any number of different units that are in collective bargaining.

2701
03:39:48,083 --> 03:39:50,705
[SPEAKER_19]: At one time, the lunch mothers had a collective bargaining unit.

2702
03:39:50,745 --> 03:39:51,526
[SPEAKER_19]: That dissipated.

2703
03:39:52,246 --> 03:39:57,491
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a result, there wasn't any real exchange between the different groups.

2704
03:39:58,087 --> 03:40:03,211
[SPEAKER_19]: But you raised it the other day, and we're looking into it, and we're going to have a meeting with them now that the school's closed.

2705
03:40:03,852 --> 03:40:10,197
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll look to see what kind of adjustments can be made that are intelligent with regard to their current status.

2706
03:40:10,237 --> 03:40:13,179
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it was a good point, and we'll look into it.

2707
03:40:14,440 --> 03:40:15,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Louise, thank you.

2708
03:40:16,001 --> 03:40:18,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to ask a question to Louise.

2709
03:40:18,703 --> 03:40:22,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I didn't find it.

2710
03:40:22,406 --> 03:40:23,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I just went through everything.

2711
03:40:25,561 --> 03:40:27,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there going to be increase in the water and sewer rate?

2712
03:40:28,142 --> 03:40:31,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe you didn't have an answer for us and I haven't received an answer from anybody.

2713
03:40:31,624 --> 03:40:32,805
[SPEAKER_05]: We still don't have an answer.

2714
03:40:32,985 --> 03:40:39,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I believe you should have received a letter from the chair of the water and sewer commission.

2715
03:40:40,969 --> 03:40:51,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year at this time, when we discussed our budget, there was an $800,000 additional monies in the budget to pay for the increase from the MWRA water and sewer rate.

2716
03:40:51,795 --> 03:40:53,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you saying now that the city,

2717
03:40:53,469 --> 03:40:58,253
[SPEAKER_05]: hasn't received, but the cost is... Oh, I'm sorry, you're asking for the MWRA... Yes.

2718
03:40:59,413 --> 03:40:59,994
[SPEAKER_05]: The assessment.

2719
03:41:00,034 --> 03:41:06,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have the assessment.

2720
03:41:06,058 --> 03:41:08,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question.

2721
03:41:09,021 --> 03:41:13,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the increase was included in the water and sewer budgets.

2722
03:41:14,144 --> 03:41:19,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, I was told the final MWRA assessments for FY16

2723
03:41:21,218 --> 03:41:49,052
[SPEAKER_05]: came through and it's actually this water stayed exactly the same as in the budget that was presented to you and the sewer is being reduced by a hundred and seventeen thousand dollars from what was in the budget that was presented to you and I just received this information today so I have made no adjustments so if I understand this correctly you're saying that next year there will not be a taxpayer increase in their water and sewer rate that's not what I'm saying because

2724
03:41:50,470 --> 03:41:53,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It really depends on the revenue projection.

2725
03:41:55,292 --> 03:42:00,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Water and Sewer Commission wanted to review where they were with water consumption.

2726
03:42:00,574 --> 03:42:05,216
[SPEAKER_05]: With the tiered rate, there was some reduction in the water consumption in Medford.

2727
03:42:05,536 --> 03:42:10,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And the top tier is where the reduction occurs, which is where the biggest hit to revenue would be.

2728
03:42:10,998 --> 03:42:16,980
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also a lot of, as I understand it, there was an installation of quite a few irrigation meters.

2729
03:42:18,088 --> 03:42:26,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And when customers are assessed their sewer bill, it is based upon water consumption.

2730
03:42:26,794 --> 03:42:31,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So if someone puts in an irrigation meter, that reduces what they pay for sewer.

2731
03:42:32,138 --> 03:42:35,780
[SPEAKER_05]: So there may be an adjustment required to the rates.

2732
03:42:35,921 --> 03:42:42,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying that the water rate, I want to get this straight, that the water rate in the budget that's projected to pay the MWRA is the same?

2733
03:42:42,805 --> 03:42:46,548
[SPEAKER_09]: The sewer is being reduced?

2734
03:42:46,961 --> 03:42:47,081
[SPEAKER_09]: by $117,000?

2735
03:42:47,181 --> 03:42:54,163
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm saying is the assessment from the MWRA to the city is the same as in the budget.

2736
03:42:54,363 --> 03:43:00,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But whether that affects the Medford residence rates, I can't answer.

2737
03:43:00,124 --> 03:43:00,984
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, wait a minute.

2738
03:43:01,024 --> 03:43:03,325
[SPEAKER_09]: But you also said the sewer portion has been reduced by $117,000.

2739
03:43:03,365 --> 03:43:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct, from the MWRA.

2740
03:43:05,506 --> 03:43:06,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not the same.

2741
03:43:06,326 --> 03:43:12,667
[SPEAKER_09]: So the water is the same, but the sewer is $117,000 less than what's in this budget.

2742
03:43:12,687 --> 03:43:13,287
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

2743
03:43:13,447 --> 03:43:13,747
[SPEAKER_09]: OK?

2744
03:43:13,988 --> 03:43:14,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2745
03:43:14,368 --> 03:43:15,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we speak right now,

2746
03:43:16,347 --> 03:43:30,176
[SPEAKER_09]: According to this budget, if it's passed, there's $117,000 that we haven't been apprised on because we're voting on a budget that's going to have a dollar amount that's $117,000 more than what you're saying right now.

2747
03:43:30,517 --> 03:43:31,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

2748
03:43:31,277 --> 03:43:31,337
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

2749
03:43:31,417 --> 03:43:32,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got this today.

2750
03:43:32,358 --> 03:43:34,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, then that's an inaccurate budget.

2751
03:43:34,660 --> 03:43:40,484
[SPEAKER_09]: The total amount is inaccurate by $117,000 because you just got saying it was reduced.

2752
03:43:41,344 --> 03:43:41,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct?

2753
03:43:41,684 --> 03:43:42,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2754
03:43:43,065 --> 03:43:43,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

2755
03:43:44,006 --> 03:43:46,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2756
03:43:47,368 --> 03:43:54,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I assume, as in years past, this will be funded out of the water and sewer account with a vote of the Council.

2757
03:43:54,834 --> 03:43:55,614
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

2758
03:43:55,974 --> 03:43:57,535
[SPEAKER_15]: This is very much done.

2759
03:43:57,616 --> 03:43:58,416
[SPEAKER_15]: It's rudimentary.

2760
03:43:58,436 --> 03:43:59,117
[SPEAKER_15]: It's done all the time.

2761
03:43:59,757 --> 03:44:00,738
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been done in years past.

2762
03:44:00,758 --> 03:44:05,421
[SPEAKER_09]: The vote of the Council has only been predicated on last year, for example, of the rate increase.

2763
03:44:05,941 --> 03:44:09,484
[SPEAKER_09]: We right now are voting on this water and sewer portion of the budget.

2764
03:44:09,972 --> 03:44:12,974
[SPEAKER_09]: not knowing what the fee is even going to be, if there's going to be an increase or a decrease.

2765
03:44:13,694 --> 03:44:20,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would mean you're going to have to come back at another time if there's going to be an increase, because the Water and Soil Commission don't set the rates.

2766
03:44:23,260 --> 03:44:25,321
[SPEAKER_09]: They're only giving you the dollar amount what's necessary.

2767
03:44:25,702 --> 03:44:37,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So even with your $117,000 reduction here, if the city decides, after reviewing its consumption and its getting rid of the water, there's going to be a $300,000 increase to pay.

2768
03:44:39,514 --> 03:44:39,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

2769
03:44:39,634 --> 03:44:45,278
[SPEAKER_09]: You're all going to have to come back to the council and ask this council, whatever the dollar amount might be, for an increase.

2770
03:44:45,958 --> 03:44:48,800
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget will not go up.

2771
03:44:49,541 --> 03:44:55,384
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget as it is presented to you in your budget books for water will be exactly identical.

2772
03:44:56,245 --> 03:44:59,267
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget for sewer will be reduced by $117,000.

2773
03:44:59,307 --> 03:45:02,389
[SPEAKER_05]: The question that remains open is whether the revenue based upon

2774
03:45:08,613 --> 03:45:15,299
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption for the most recent year will be sufficient to cover the budget that is in your book.

2775
03:45:15,319 --> 03:45:19,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So now let's just say it doesn't cover it and you need more money.

2776
03:45:19,482 --> 03:45:21,304
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to then have to come back to the council.

2777
03:45:21,324 --> 03:45:22,084
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

2778
03:45:22,244 --> 03:45:28,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now we're sitting on $7.5 million of surplus money in the water and sewer enterprise account.

2779
03:45:29,430 --> 03:45:29,911
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

2780
03:45:29,931 --> 03:45:34,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Council can still choose to recommend that that money, whatever the increase comes out of that.

2781
03:45:36,417 --> 03:45:40,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I would move, Mr. President, that the budget as presented with the dollar amount attached be reduced by $117,000.

2782
03:45:40,838 --> 03:45:46,739
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a motion for approval of the budget as presented already on the floor.

2783
03:45:48,779 --> 03:45:49,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to sever.

2784
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:53,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

2785
03:45:53,860 --> 03:46:04,062
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing that anybody that's a good manager would look at at this point would be if there's been any changes in the system that we've used.

2786
03:46:04,362 --> 03:46:05,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's been a major change.

2787
03:46:06,123 --> 03:46:09,786
[SPEAKER_15]: as a result of this council advocating for a tiered rate system.

2788
03:46:10,766 --> 03:46:14,189
[SPEAKER_15]: The tiered rate system started how long ago?

2789
03:46:14,689 --> 03:46:17,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It started actually during the course of this past fiscal year.

2790
03:46:17,731 --> 03:46:23,595
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's, I'm assuming where we don't know where we're going.

2791
03:46:23,635 --> 03:46:24,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

2792
03:46:24,156 --> 03:46:24,656
[SPEAKER_15]: That is correct.

2793
03:46:25,127 --> 03:46:26,107
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a direct result.

2794
03:46:26,307 --> 03:46:27,208
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is Management 101.

2795
03:46:28,128 --> 03:46:32,069
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that we have to learn from this because we don't know at this point.

2796
03:46:32,550 --> 03:46:33,570
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know at this point.

2797
03:46:34,010 --> 03:46:45,354
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm very comfortable knowing that we've funded this in the past out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Accounts, which has certain regulations and standards that the money can be used for.

2798
03:46:45,434 --> 03:46:48,255
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is certainly an appropriate use when necessary.

2799
03:46:48,575 --> 03:46:50,816
[SPEAKER_15]: But to say that it's 117,

2800
03:46:52,830 --> 03:46:58,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I assumed right off the bat it was because of the tiered rate system, and that's why I wanted to pose the question to you.

2801
03:47:00,853 --> 03:47:01,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2802
03:47:02,254 --> 03:47:04,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for approval.

2803
03:47:07,496 --> 03:47:11,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you or did you not just say that the sewer portion is being reduced by $117,000?

2804
03:47:11,358 --> 03:47:13,779
[SPEAKER_09]: You just said it from there, correct?

2805
03:47:14,199 --> 03:47:17,360
[SPEAKER_05]: The sewer operating budget will be reduced by $117,000.

2806
03:47:17,400 --> 03:47:21,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be $117,000 less than what was given to us in that budget.

2807
03:47:21,462 --> 03:47:22,102
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

2808
03:47:22,499 --> 03:47:32,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So the dollar amount the budget is coming forward with needs to be reduced by $117,000 to accurately reflect the water and sewer in this budget.

2809
03:47:32,126 --> 03:47:32,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct?

2810
03:47:32,727 --> 03:47:34,188
[SPEAKER_09]: The sewer portion only.

2811
03:47:34,228 --> 03:47:34,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the sewer portion.

2812
03:47:35,869 --> 03:47:36,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2813
03:47:37,190 --> 03:47:37,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to sever.

2814
03:47:39,252 --> 03:47:40,492
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a motion to sever.

2815
03:47:41,733 --> 03:47:43,715
[SPEAKER_24]: We have on the main motion for approval.

2816
03:47:44,836 --> 03:47:49,599
[SPEAKER_15]: And we only have authorization to cut the budget, not line items.

2817
03:47:50,360 --> 03:47:51,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

2818
03:47:51,501 --> 03:47:51,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

2819
03:47:53,138 --> 03:47:54,419
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not cutting the line items.

2820
03:47:54,499 --> 03:48:01,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the budget director just indicated, and again, she can correct me if I'm wrong, that you just got these figures now, correct?

2821
03:48:02,362 --> 03:48:02,863
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

2822
03:48:02,923 --> 03:48:07,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And the dollar amount in this book that represents the budget is now $117,000 less, correct?

2823
03:48:07,705 --> 03:48:09,766
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

2824
03:48:10,066 --> 03:48:20,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And for this budget to be accurate with its numbers as presented now with the 117 before this vote, this total dollar amount of the budget of $150 million needs to be reduced by $117,000.

2825
03:48:23,027 --> 03:48:23,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct, Louise?

2826
03:48:24,207 --> 03:48:24,788
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

2827
03:48:24,848 --> 03:48:25,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2828
03:48:25,708 --> 03:48:27,729
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be reduced.

2829
03:48:27,769 --> 03:48:28,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't need to be.

2830
03:48:29,029 --> 03:48:32,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be reduced by $117,000 at this point.

2831
03:48:32,211 --> 03:48:34,172
[SPEAKER_24]: The budget doesn't need to be reduced.

2832
03:48:35,512 --> 03:48:37,813
[SPEAKER_09]: That dollar needs to be deducted from the total.

2833
03:48:38,713 --> 03:48:39,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2834
03:48:39,654 --> 03:48:41,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I caused some confusion.

2835
03:48:42,495 --> 03:48:43,175
[SPEAKER_24]: I think you did.

2836
03:48:43,255 --> 03:48:48,637
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could clarify this, please, because there's no need to change, is there?

2837
03:48:50,118 --> 03:48:52,339
[SPEAKER_05]: You could vote the budget as it was presented,

2838
03:48:53,179 --> 03:49:07,808
[SPEAKER_05]: There will, I am sure I will be back here before the council with the final assessments and then if you want to make the adjustments then as to where the water and sewer budgets are, we can do it then.

2839
03:49:08,128 --> 03:49:17,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I may, this particular line item, I don't feel comfortable reducing it at this point.

2840
03:49:18,475 --> 03:49:19,956
[SPEAKER_15]: That money that's in the budget,

2841
03:49:20,773 --> 03:49:26,537
[SPEAKER_15]: could be used at a later time for other accounts if the city council sees fit.

2842
03:49:27,317 --> 03:49:29,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Money from the water and sewer enterprise accounts could not.

2843
03:49:30,199 --> 03:49:40,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's say we have another real bad year, like we've had this last winter, where the snow and ice was outrageous, just based upon the climate that we had.

2844
03:49:41,346 --> 03:49:44,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, when it's in the budget, it can be used to offset the snow and ice, correct?

2845
03:49:45,809 --> 03:49:46,429
[SPEAKER_15]: It cannot.

2846
03:49:46,809 --> 03:49:49,191
[SPEAKER_15]: It cannot, even if it's the budget line item.

2847
03:49:50,614 --> 03:49:52,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the water and sewer budget.

2848
03:49:52,995 --> 03:49:57,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can only be used for incidents that occur with regard to water and sewer.

2849
03:49:57,957 --> 03:50:04,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are correct that we had a very bad year and that there were an unusual number of water and sewer calls.

2850
03:50:04,641 --> 03:50:06,361
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to be paid for out of these budgets.

2851
03:50:06,421 --> 03:50:11,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And you are correct that the sewer budget this year was stretched as thin as it could be.

2852
03:50:12,224 --> 03:50:12,504
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

2853
03:50:12,524 --> 03:50:14,285
[SPEAKER_15]: So I apologize.

2854
03:50:14,345 --> 03:50:18,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I had the wrong understanding on the budgeted side of things compared to the account that the money is in.

2855
03:50:18,907 --> 03:50:19,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2856
03:50:19,368 --> 03:50:19,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

2857
03:50:20,773 --> 03:50:23,754
[SPEAKER_15]: It was, I apologize for misspeaking on that.

2858
03:50:24,234 --> 03:50:29,415
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, I still, the tiered rate system, it's great.

2859
03:50:29,775 --> 03:50:37,957
[SPEAKER_15]: We've advocated strong for it, this council, and we may have to make up money on the water side because of the assessment with this new tiered system.

2860
03:50:38,337 --> 03:50:44,578
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we got the answer from Mr. Kamara, who gave us a very detailed response last week in our packets.

2861
03:50:45,378 --> 03:50:49,239
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd just like to sever those votes, that's all.

2862
03:50:50,292 --> 03:50:51,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Cluso.

2863
03:50:51,313 --> 03:50:51,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

2864
03:50:52,554 --> 03:50:53,235
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

2865
03:50:53,995 --> 03:50:54,176
[SPEAKER_26]: Ms.

2866
03:50:54,216 --> 03:51:06,907
[SPEAKER_26]: Miller, if I remember correctly, I believe that when we were at our budget subcommittee hearings relative to the issue of water and sewer, it was represented that we're not meeting our forecasted projections at this point in time, isn't that correct?

2867
03:51:06,927 --> 03:51:09,990
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct, but we don't have the final revenue numbers yet.

2868
03:51:10,010 --> 03:51:11,251
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't have the final revenue numbers.

2869
03:51:11,311 --> 03:51:14,054
[SPEAKER_26]: And do these numbers that you received today represent the final revenue numbers?

2870
03:51:14,134 --> 03:51:14,915
[SPEAKER_26]: No, they do not, correct?

2871
03:51:17,322 --> 03:51:18,543
[SPEAKER_25]: because they're not revenue numbers, right?

2872
03:51:18,563 --> 03:51:21,724
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what you have to pay, so they're not the revenue numbers.

2873
03:51:21,764 --> 03:51:25,826
[SPEAKER_25]: We really don't know what our final revenue numbers are going to be, but we're not meeting projection at this point in time, correct?

2874
03:51:25,846 --> 03:51:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct, yes.

2875
03:51:27,107 --> 03:51:27,847
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, thank you.

2876
03:51:27,907 --> 03:51:28,528
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

2877
03:51:30,169 --> 03:51:30,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Cavanaugh.

2878
03:51:31,289 --> 03:51:31,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2879
03:51:32,390 --> 03:51:37,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel more comfortable leaving it there, seeing that we don't have enough history from the new water and sewer rates.

2880
03:51:38,053 --> 03:51:45,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And like Louie said, we can come back and readjust it at a later date, rather than have to come back and ask for money.

2881
03:51:49,920 --> 03:51:55,502
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, I think a couple citizens want to present.

2882
03:51:59,924 --> 03:52:01,944
[SPEAKER_10]: John Sorrell, 20 Metcalfe Street.

2883
03:52:03,425 --> 03:52:04,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2884
03:52:05,366 --> 03:52:12,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to begin by saying that I'm aware that the president of the city council understands this budget.

2885
03:52:14,889 --> 03:52:17,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that every single member

2886
03:52:18,230 --> 03:52:20,672
[SPEAKER_10]: of the City Council understands this budget.

2887
03:52:22,553 --> 03:52:31,581
[SPEAKER_10]: But my notion is that the people who are going to pay for it don't know anything about this budget.

2888
03:52:33,062 --> 03:52:40,188
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like, Mr. President, through you, to address the people out there who are actually going to pay for this $155 million budget.

2889
03:52:40,208 --> 03:52:40,748
[SPEAKER_10]: My sense is that

2890
03:52:47,978 --> 03:52:50,159
[SPEAKER_10]: This council loves this budget.

2891
03:52:50,739 --> 03:52:51,559
[SPEAKER_10]: They always have.

2892
03:52:53,220 --> 03:52:55,620
[SPEAKER_10]: They voted for it for 28 years.

2893
03:52:56,841 --> 03:53:02,923
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll vote for it and approve it tonight, with maybe some minor exceptions.

2894
03:53:04,183 --> 03:53:05,343
[SPEAKER_10]: But the budget will pass.

2895
03:53:06,904 --> 03:53:09,805
[SPEAKER_10]: It will pass as has been proposed by the mayor.

2896
03:53:10,765 --> 03:53:11,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It always has.

2897
03:53:13,286 --> 03:53:14,446
[SPEAKER_10]: This budget is for $155 million.

2898
03:53:18,427 --> 03:53:23,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Of that, the school budget alone is $53 million.

2899
03:53:24,509 --> 03:53:27,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that is one third of the whole budget.

2900
03:53:28,330 --> 03:53:29,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I too loud here?

2901
03:53:29,971 --> 03:53:30,551
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not you.

2902
03:53:32,092 --> 03:53:37,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that is the school budget alone is one third of the total budget.

2903
03:53:38,494 --> 03:53:39,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $53 million.

2904
03:53:44,216 --> 03:53:47,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that comes to, um,

2905
03:53:49,854 --> 03:53:50,935
[SPEAKER_10]: one-third of the whole budget.

2906
03:53:52,395 --> 03:53:57,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's actually 34 percent if you do it out.

2907
03:53:57,918 --> 03:54:02,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, 80 percent of the school budget is for employee compensation.

2908
03:54:02,821 --> 03:54:04,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That's $42 million.

2909
03:54:04,342 --> 03:54:05,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine that?

2910
03:54:05,683 --> 03:54:10,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine trying to run an enterprise where labor alone costs you 80 percent.

2911
03:54:10,205 --> 03:54:13,086
[SPEAKER_10]: That leaves you only 20 percent left to run the schools.

2912
03:54:15,468 --> 03:54:16,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how it's done.

2913
03:54:17,989 --> 03:54:19,470
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't run any business.

2914
03:54:20,213 --> 03:54:28,154
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't run anything in the economy with only 20% of the income spent on the enterprise itself.

2915
03:54:30,055 --> 03:54:36,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this $42 million really is 28% of the total city budget.

2916
03:54:36,516 --> 03:54:37,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine that.

2917
03:54:37,996 --> 03:54:49,558
[SPEAKER_10]: We're spending 28% of all of the income in the city, of all the revenue, on the compensation salaries of the employees.

2918
03:54:51,351 --> 03:54:52,532
[SPEAKER_10]: There's something wrong with that.

2919
03:54:54,233 --> 03:54:55,254
[SPEAKER_10]: It ought not be so.

2920
03:54:57,275 --> 03:54:58,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish it were not so.

2921
03:54:59,977 --> 03:55:07,043
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to explain to the people how they paid $155 million in the budget.

2922
03:55:07,543 --> 03:55:09,965
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the budget last year was $150 million.

2923
03:55:10,385 --> 03:55:12,087
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been increased by $5 million.

2924
03:55:12,127 --> 03:55:16,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's how the people pay for it.

2925
03:55:16,690 --> 03:55:19,472
[SPEAKER_10]: The home tax levy is $100 million.

2926
03:55:21,898 --> 03:55:30,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Local receipts, which is really fees and penalties, which is really another tax, the people pay this, is $14 million.

2927
03:55:33,028 --> 03:55:36,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Local state aid nets out at $14 million.

2928
03:55:36,892 --> 03:55:44,799
[SPEAKER_10]: They really give us $22 million, but we subtract $8 million in assessments.

2929
03:55:45,520 --> 03:55:47,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So that comes to another $14 million.

2930
03:55:49,472 --> 03:55:52,273
[SPEAKER_10]: The state gives us $3 million for the new schools.

2931
03:55:53,353 --> 03:55:57,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And the water and sewer taxes, I call them taxes because that's what they are, actually.

2932
03:55:58,195 --> 03:56:00,916
[SPEAKER_10]: We're paying money for a service, comes to $24 million.

2933
03:56:01,716 --> 03:56:07,298
[SPEAKER_10]: That total is $155 million, and that is a 2016 budget.

2934
03:56:09,719 --> 03:56:13,520
[SPEAKER_10]: From this, you can actually project what the budget's going to be next year.

2935
03:56:14,921 --> 03:56:16,241
[SPEAKER_10]: You take the $100 million, multiply that by the 2.5%

2936
03:56:23,688 --> 03:56:31,033
[SPEAKER_10]: a 2.5% tax levy limit, and you get $102.5 million, plus there'll be probably another $1 million of new growth.

2937
03:56:31,113 --> 03:56:34,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And here you are again at $104 million or so.

2938
03:56:35,556 --> 03:56:37,998
[SPEAKER_10]: So next year, we're going to be in the same situation.

2939
03:56:39,259 --> 03:56:40,539
[SPEAKER_10]: This cannot be changed.

2940
03:56:40,980 --> 03:56:45,543
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way you can change anything here is with a charter change.

2941
03:56:46,643 --> 03:56:48,905
[SPEAKER_10]: A charter change is a long way off.

2942
03:56:49,573 --> 03:56:50,614
[SPEAKER_10]: unlikely to happen.

2943
03:56:51,154 --> 03:56:52,375
[SPEAKER_10]: There are all kinds of hurdles.

2944
03:56:52,415 --> 03:56:53,936
[SPEAKER_10]: There are all kinds of obstacles.

2945
03:56:54,676 --> 03:56:57,758
[SPEAKER_10]: The government in power does not want you to change.

2946
03:56:57,998 --> 03:56:58,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Why should it?

2947
03:56:59,699 --> 03:57:00,960
[SPEAKER_10]: They love the status quo.

2948
03:57:02,101 --> 03:57:03,302
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you go wrong with it?

2949
03:57:04,662 --> 03:57:05,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's happy.

2950
03:57:06,864 --> 03:57:10,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's making money, except that people have to pay for it.

2951
03:57:11,046 --> 03:57:11,907
[SPEAKER_10]: They're losing money.

2952
03:57:12,387 --> 03:57:13,308
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the taxpayer.

2953
03:57:13,328 --> 03:57:14,368
[SPEAKER_10]: We're back to that again.

2954
03:57:15,909 --> 03:57:16,630
[SPEAKER_10]: As a matter of fact,

2955
03:57:17,430 --> 03:57:20,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Any government that's ever in power tries to perpetuate itself.

2956
03:57:22,352 --> 03:57:24,152
[SPEAKER_10]: The people in power love to stay in power.

2957
03:57:25,133 --> 03:57:25,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Why shouldn't they?

2958
03:57:25,773 --> 03:57:26,453
[SPEAKER_10]: It serves them.

2959
03:57:27,413 --> 03:57:28,634
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not serve the people.

2960
03:57:29,674 --> 03:57:32,355
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually is not the purpose of government, to serve the people.

2961
03:57:33,235 --> 03:57:34,336
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to serve the governors.

2962
03:57:35,496 --> 03:57:38,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll have to live with the situation as it is.

2963
03:57:38,957 --> 03:57:39,878
[SPEAKER_10]: The laws allow it.

2964
03:57:39,898 --> 03:57:46,620
[SPEAKER_10]: According to the city solicitor, you have to change the state laws in order to change

2965
03:57:47,374 --> 03:57:48,594
[SPEAKER_10]: the Medford City government.

2966
03:57:50,155 --> 03:57:50,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2967
03:58:00,239 --> 03:58:03,380
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

2968
03:58:03,400 --> 03:58:09,603
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Dr. Stirella, one of the great citizens of Medford, fighting for people.

2969
03:58:09,663 --> 03:58:12,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish this room had 150, 200 people here.

2970
03:58:13,044 --> 03:58:14,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Every year approximately 600,000

2971
03:58:16,048 --> 03:58:21,689
[SPEAKER_16]: goes into the general fund as a second tier tax from access cable TV subscribers.

2972
03:58:22,589 --> 03:58:43,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Since that money is essential for the Medford City budget, why approve a budget when, A, we don't know where that money goes, 600 grand a year, say about 10 years, 6 million, and B, there's no access at all for the cable subscribers who are throwing another 600 grand or so into this budget.

2973
03:58:46,055 --> 03:58:47,056
[SPEAKER_16]: irresponsible budget.

2974
03:58:48,577 --> 03:58:52,541
[SPEAKER_16]: It's irresponsible to hide that money from the people paying it.

2975
03:58:55,583 --> 03:59:03,450
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the one time each year this council can hold a plan a mayor accountable.

2976
03:59:03,671 --> 03:59:08,315
[SPEAKER_16]: $33,000 or so is unaccounted for from the old access TV station.

2977
03:59:09,196 --> 03:59:12,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Our esteemed city solicitor told us July 24th was the deadline a year ago.

2978
03:59:13,851 --> 03:59:14,592
[SPEAKER_16]: It's almost a year.

2979
03:59:14,652 --> 03:59:19,655
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not know what happened to that 33 grand that TV3 said there's no money left.

2980
03:59:20,256 --> 03:59:23,778
[SPEAKER_16]: But there was 33 grand in Alex Ruppenthal's article.

2981
03:59:24,659 --> 03:59:25,180
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get it.

2982
03:59:25,380 --> 03:59:31,744
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get why 33 grand is nothing to this city, or 600 grand is nothing to this city.

2983
03:59:32,105 --> 03:59:33,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been fighting here since what?

2984
03:59:33,606 --> 03:59:37,209
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I first met Mr. Rumley and Diane McLeod early 2003.

2985
03:59:37,609 --> 03:59:41,872
[SPEAKER_16]: So I put 12 years of my life into this, which is about a fifth of my life.

2986
03:59:42,573 --> 03:59:42,873
[SPEAKER_16]: For what?

2987
03:59:43,660 --> 03:59:43,900
[SPEAKER_16]: For what?

2988
03:59:43,920 --> 03:59:45,041
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to help the city out.

2989
03:59:45,121 --> 03:59:49,005
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't expect to get yelled at because I'm helping the city out.

2990
03:59:49,065 --> 03:59:50,666
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm helping the citizens out.

2991
03:59:51,027 --> 03:59:53,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So fiscal responsibility.

2992
03:59:53,389 --> 03:59:56,692
[SPEAKER_16]: 124 days away from a monumental election.

2993
03:59:57,272 --> 03:59:58,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Fiscal responsibility.

2994
03:59:58,553 --> 04:00:09,123
[SPEAKER_16]: It is irresponsible to pass this budget tonight if you can't hold the mayor to plan A, this plan A mayor, to telling us where Access TV is and what he does

2995
04:00:10,123 --> 04:00:13,045
[SPEAKER_16]: with the $600,000 or so a year.

2996
04:00:13,305 --> 04:00:15,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, City Council, this is your one moment.

2997
04:00:15,647 --> 04:00:17,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Do not vote for this budget until we get answers.

2998
04:00:18,028 --> 04:00:25,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, in 124 days, the candidates that are sitting out there won't be on AXS TV, and Dr. Stireller is so prophetic.

2999
04:00:26,854 --> 04:00:27,935
[SPEAKER_16]: It is status quo.

3000
04:00:28,575 --> 04:00:30,337
[SPEAKER_16]: People in power don't want to let go.

3001
04:00:32,078 --> 04:00:36,581
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval of the budget as presented.

3002
04:00:36,961 --> 04:00:38,062
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call vote.

3003
04:00:38,102 --> 04:00:39,603
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call has been requested.

3004
04:00:45,374 --> 04:00:46,875
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we take the severed one first?

3005
04:00:48,015 --> 04:00:51,098
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta and your motion was?

3006
04:00:56,942 --> 04:01:01,325
[SPEAKER_09]: The 117,000 that represents the actual numbers of the budget presented.

3007
04:01:01,345 --> 04:01:06,328
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to cut the budget and then vote against the budget.

3008
04:01:10,401 --> 04:01:11,402
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't make sense.

3009
04:01:12,643 --> 04:01:13,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Couldn't run a lemonade stand.

3010
04:01:15,626 --> 04:01:15,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

3011
04:01:15,906 --> 04:01:24,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Miller just got through telling us that she just got today, for which none of us knew about this, $117,000 is a number less than what's in the budget.

3012
04:01:25,073 --> 04:01:29,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So to have these numbers to be accurate as presented, it needs to be deducted by $117,000.

3013
04:01:29,317 --> 04:01:29,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

3014
04:01:29,437 --> 04:01:30,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the vote.

3015
04:01:38,105 --> 04:01:41,166
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3016
04:01:41,567 --> 04:01:43,948
[SPEAKER_15]: A yes vote is to strike.

3017
04:01:44,088 --> 04:01:45,288
[SPEAKER_15]: A no vote is to leave it in.

3018
04:01:45,508 --> 04:01:45,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct?

3019
04:01:45,768 --> 04:01:46,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

3020
04:01:46,169 --> 04:01:47,029

3038
04:02:12,960 --> 04:02:14,541
[SPEAKER_15]: 4-3.

3039
04:02:14,561 --> 04:02:15,381
[SPEAKER_15]: 4-3, and it failed?

3040
04:02:17,022 --> 04:02:25,464
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, on the motion of, on that motion previously, with- The amendment.

3041

[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of nice things happening in the school and a lot of the investments have been made by the council supporting bond issues and other matters.

3075
04:05:15,527 --> 04:05:21,431
[SPEAKER_30]: I just... No, Mike, we're talking about the substance.

3076
04:05:21,472 --> 04:05:22,773
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the outreach coordinator.

[SPEAKER_15]: I just got it tonight, Paul, all right?

[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion, Councilor Penta.

3090
04:05:50,144 --> 04:05:57,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be beneficial if you reviewed it to the public so they'd have an idea of what this prevention coordinator is going to do.

3091
04:05:57,770 --> 04:05:58,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been long overdue.

3092
04:05:59,191 --> 04:06:02,133
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been waiting for this, so I think you can hit the highlights of it.

3093
04:06:03,234 --> 04:06:03,914
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd be delighted.

3094
04:06:05,736 --> 04:06:08,057
[SPEAKER_24]: The prevention and outreach program coordinator.

3095
04:06:08,137 --> 04:06:08,738

[SPEAKER_24]: The prevention and outreach coordinator will have day-to-day responsibility for the coordination of all substance

3097
04:06:15,005 --> 04:06:17,727
[SPEAKER_24]: prevention grant and non-grant activities.

3098
04:06:18,308 --> 04:06:23,211
[SPEAKER_24]: The goal is to provide and coordinate all substance prevention efforts in the city of Medford.

3099
04:06:23,892 --> 04:06:37,543
[SPEAKER_24]: This position will also develop and deliver in coordination with Medford Police, Fire, and EMS, as well as the Medford School Department, evidence-based programming to decrease the use of all substances.

3100
04:06:38,203 --> 04:06:44,388
[SPEAKER_24]: The coordinator will develop tracking of overdose cases to enable timely provision of information

3101
04:06:44,984 --> 04:06:52,026
[SPEAKER_24]: referrals on treatment, and support in recovery to assist those with substance abuse disorders and families.

3104
04:07:37,088 --> 04:07:37,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Job or salary?

3105
04:07:38,450 --> 04:07:48,494
[SPEAKER_24]: Salary is your salary is not listed in this piece, but when we went through it on the budget, it was a, uh, uh, department level head.

3106
04:07:48,634 --> 04:07:49,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was in the sixties.

3107
04:07:50,154 --> 04:07:51,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Same as Ernest Lindsay.

3108
04:07:51,495 --> 04:07:51,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

3109
04:07:52,435 --> 04:07:54,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you just read at the end, um, the physical requirements?

3110
04:07:54,836 --> 04:08:05,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Cause that was the physical requirements, minimal physical effort required when performing functions under typical office conditions while performing the duties of this job.

3111
04:08:06,231 --> 04:08:15,438
[SPEAKER_24]: The employees frequently required to walk, sit, and talk or hear may spend several hours sitting or standing.

3112
04:08:16,539 --> 04:08:17,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Do I need to go on?

3113
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:18,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, only for one reason.

3114
04:08:19,362 --> 04:08:23,265
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing I'm, it doesn't talk about driving to a destination.

3115
04:08:23,625 --> 04:08:34,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just wondering, is this particular job going to just be completely in-house or is this job going to allow somebody to go to a different location or

3116
04:08:35,357 --> 04:08:55,952
[SPEAKER_24]: whatever it might be to... I think in other parts of the job description, it's inferred that travel, interaction, and other forms of human intercourse will be required of this person, while the physical requirements oftentimes in the job description mean physical requirements.

3117
04:08:56,412 --> 04:09:01,576
[SPEAKER_24]: Will the individual have to be able to lug a 500-pound duffel bag

3118
04:09:02,215 --> 04:09:10,480
[SPEAKER_24]: up the center stairs of the rotunda of City Hall, will the individual be able to climb scaffolding outside of a building?

3119
04:09:11,100 --> 04:09:21,667
[SPEAKER_24]: So those requirements are not there, but the regular requirements of one in an administrative position of this position seem to be required of them.

3120
04:09:21,827 --> 04:09:22,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Move the question.

3121
04:09:22,667 --> 04:09:25,849
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank you for passing this up tonight, because this is the first time I see it.

3122
04:09:26,089 --> 04:09:27,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, I'd just like to ask you one question in here.

3123
04:09:27,870 --> 04:09:29,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes reference to the police department.

3124
04:09:31,129 --> 04:09:48,759
[SPEAKER_24]: personally point out in my conversations and I think Councilor Camuso will also agree, the mayor went through great lengths in interviewing many constituencies collectively and individually regarding this matter and putting together this job.

3125
04:09:48,959 --> 04:09:50,960
[SPEAKER_15]: The job is going to be filled very, very soon.

3126
04:09:52,261 --> 04:09:54,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, do you have a copy of this or not?

3127
04:09:54,862 --> 04:09:55,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

3128
04:09:55,442 --> 04:09:56,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had a chance to read it.

3129
04:09:56,683 --> 04:09:57,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

3130
04:09:57,443 --> 04:09:58,104
[SPEAKER_09]: It's section over here.

3131
04:09:58,144 --> 04:10:00,005
[SPEAKER_09]: It says develop jointly with the police,

3132
04:10:00,714 --> 04:10:08,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Programming to decriminalize and foster relationship with those with substance abuse disorders and their families using evidence based upon principles and practices.

3133
04:10:09,416 --> 04:10:13,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Support police on programming and any grant activities related to substance abuse.

3134
04:10:14,477 --> 04:10:18,038
[SPEAKER_09]: What was your interaction with this for this to be included?

3135
04:10:19,739 --> 04:10:20,359
[SPEAKER_09]: In this program.

3136
04:10:20,379 --> 04:10:26,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had very little discussion on that with anyone, quite honestly, the job description.

3137
04:10:26,380 --> 04:10:29,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there have been members of the police department that were involved

3138
04:10:30,826 --> 04:10:36,069
[SPEAKER_06]: along with the ladies that work with the Board of Health, Penny and Brooke.

3139
04:10:36,529 --> 04:10:40,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that they've spoken with people that draw up the job description.

3140
04:10:40,791 --> 04:10:48,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But personally, I was not actively involved in it, but I did have people involved that are doing that work on a daily basis in the department.

3141
04:10:49,456 --> 04:10:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the purposes of this position, are you going to oversee

3142
04:10:54,898 --> 04:10:57,779
[SPEAKER_09]: these particular police officers who might be designated?

3143
04:10:57,799 --> 04:10:58,820
[SPEAKER_09]: How is this going to work?

3144
04:10:58,860 --> 04:11:10,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I will oversee the offices that are involved, but I mean, it's going to be more of a collaborative effort between police, fire, EMS, board of health, and the substance abuse coordinator.

3145
04:11:11,125 --> 04:11:11,225
Okay.

3146
04:11:11,745 --> 04:11:13,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3147
04:11:13,706 --> 04:11:16,887
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion, do you need to counsel?

3148
04:11:16,907 --> 04:11:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Just with regards to the supervisory responsibilities, focus will be

3149
04:11:22,690 --> 04:11:24,711
[SPEAKER_03]: to coordinate all substance prevention efforts.

3150
04:11:24,771 --> 04:11:28,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't see anything, because I just got the hard copy tonight.

3151
04:11:29,493 --> 04:11:36,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything with regards to creating an atmosphere or working in collaboration with school officials.

3152
04:11:38,397 --> 04:11:40,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I just stepped out.

3153
04:11:42,299 --> 04:11:42,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

3154
04:11:43,619 --> 04:11:47,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we approving just the second reading, so then we'll have another third reading in a few weeks?

3155
04:11:47,401 --> 04:11:50,202
[SPEAKER_24]: No, this is the third reading for which it's eligible tonight.

3156
04:11:50,834 --> 04:11:55,457
[SPEAKER_24]: The second reading took place in the posting of the matter.

3157
04:11:57,938 --> 04:11:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may ask the city solicitor a question, then.

3158
04:12:00,760 --> 04:12:07,164
[SPEAKER_03]: If we hold off this vote until our next meeting, just so we can digest.

3159
04:12:07,744 --> 04:12:08,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the job description?

3160
04:12:09,345 --> 04:12:09,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

3161
04:12:11,907 --> 04:12:13,148
[SPEAKER_29]: The next meeting's the end of July.

3162
04:12:13,668 --> 04:12:14,489
[SPEAKER_29]: It's mid-July.

3163
04:12:14,529 --> 04:12:16,070
[SPEAKER_29]: It'll be about two weeks, I'd say, right?

3164
04:12:17,070 --> 04:12:18,651
[SPEAKER_29]: So what does this vote entail?

3165
04:12:18,911 --> 04:12:20,012
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the classification.

3166
04:12:20,597 --> 04:12:22,338
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a personnel classification.

3167
04:12:22,838 --> 04:12:24,599
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already in the budget.

3168
04:12:25,499 --> 04:12:33,943
[SPEAKER_29]: The, the, the, the, the item, I believe that the salary is the salary not already approved in the budget.

3169
04:12:34,003 --> 04:12:41,006
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the job description, but oftentimes duties and job descriptions are part of an ordinance.

3170
04:12:41,786 --> 04:12:43,547
[SPEAKER_29]: My job description is part of an ordinance.

3171
04:12:45,008 --> 04:12:48,169
[SPEAKER_29]: And if we don't do this, the mayor can just do it anyway.

3172
04:12:48,189 --> 04:12:48,749
[SPEAKER_29]: Cause it's in the budget.

3173
04:12:48,769 --> 04:12:50,270
[SPEAKER_29]: I imagine that there's a process of,

3174
04:12:53,042 --> 04:12:54,282
[SPEAKER_29]: going out to advertisements.

3175
04:12:54,322 --> 04:12:57,164
[SPEAKER_15]: We've all been advocating for this, putting it off for longer.

3176
04:12:57,204 --> 04:13:00,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the overdoses just keep going up and up and up in the city.

3177
04:13:02,046 --> 04:13:05,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they shouldn't have gave it to us at 7 o'clock.

3178
04:13:05,267 --> 04:13:06,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I agree.

3179
04:13:06,588 --> 04:13:10,269
[SPEAKER_15]: But the fact of the matter is, it's a position that we all advocated for.

3180
04:13:11,610 --> 04:13:13,571
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that the next council meeting is July 23rd.

3181
04:13:13,591 --> 04:13:14,011
[SPEAKER_29]: No, 14th, I thought.

3182
04:13:14,091 --> 04:13:15,312
[SPEAKER_29]: It got changed to July 21st, I believe, yeah.

3183
04:13:22,691 --> 04:13:23,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Move the question.

3184
04:13:26,752 --> 04:13:27,512
[SPEAKER_24]: On board for what?

3185
04:13:30,133 --> 04:13:31,953
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have information on that.

3186
04:13:31,973 --> 04:13:33,493
[SPEAKER_29]: I agree with that.

3187
04:13:33,633 --> 04:13:37,874
[SPEAKER_29]: There would have to be advertised for solicitation that people would be interested.

3188
04:13:44,676 --> 04:13:46,636
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a motion for approval on the floor.

3189
04:13:46,776 --> 04:13:47,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call vote.

3190
04:13:48,117 --> 04:13:49,457
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call has been requested.

3191
04:13:50,217 --> 04:13:52,919
[SPEAKER_24]: So on that question, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3192
04:13:57,262 --> 04:13:59,504
[SPEAKER_09]: How long does it take to advertise?

3193
04:14:00,245 --> 04:14:01,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it three weeks, ma'am?

3194
04:14:01,185 --> 04:14:03,447
[SPEAKER_09]: After the third reading.

3195
04:14:04,908 --> 04:14:06,730
[SPEAKER_09]: After the first reading.

3196
04:14:07,470 --> 04:14:08,591
[SPEAKER_24]: We had the first reading.

3197
04:14:08,991 --> 04:14:09,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So it can be advertised.

3198
04:14:09,992 --> 04:14:15,196
[SPEAKER_24]: The ordinance was advertised for the creation of the substance abuse person.

3199
04:14:15,456 --> 04:14:16,317
[SPEAKER_21]: It came out May 19th.

3200
04:14:16,357 --> 04:14:16,597
[SPEAKER_21]: May 19th.

3201
04:14:19,637 --> 04:14:22,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Council has been sitting on it.

3202
04:14:26,503 --> 04:14:29,985
[SPEAKER_15]: June 16th, we've been sitting on it, dishonorable bodies since June 16th.

3203
04:14:31,767 --> 04:14:34,929
[SPEAKER_03]: But through the chair, we just got this tonight.

3204
04:14:34,969 --> 04:14:35,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

3205
04:14:35,690 --> 04:14:39,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it goes back to what we fought for last week, just having time to digest something.

3206
04:14:39,953 --> 04:14:43,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously we were concerned only to pass the first reading.

3207
04:14:43,656 --> 04:14:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: This council decided we wanted to take part in

3208
04:14:46,573 --> 04:14:51,456
[SPEAKER_03]: making sure we liked the language of exactly, especially with the prevention side of it.

3209
04:14:52,637 --> 04:14:54,098
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't approve job descriptions.

3210
04:14:54,878 --> 04:14:56,099
[SPEAKER_15]: We're overstepping our boundaries.

3211
04:14:57,300 --> 04:14:59,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Job description is administrative role.

3212
04:15:00,202 --> 04:15:00,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

3213
04:15:00,822 --> 04:15:02,623
[SPEAKER_15]: If you guys don't want to support it, don't support it.

3214
04:15:03,844 --> 04:15:04,825
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a motion for approval.

3215
04:15:04,845 --> 04:15:06,045
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion for approval.

3216
04:15:06,065 --> 04:15:11,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's the only role we have is putting it in their classification personnel table.

3217
04:15:15,945 --> 04:15:17,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Take the vote if you don't want to support it.

3218
04:15:17,645 --> 04:15:19,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Eddie, you're saying you have the chair.

3219
04:15:20,006 --> 04:15:25,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying you're putting this in a classification program, but just the case, just the headline are all these words.

3220
04:15:26,828 --> 04:15:30,089
[SPEAKER_09]: The headline we had, we don't even understand this.

3221
04:15:32,089 --> 04:15:33,369
[SPEAKER_24]: We voted an ordinance.

3222
04:15:33,589 --> 04:15:35,830
[SPEAKER_24]: We started the process 15 four 86.

3223
04:15:37,250 --> 04:15:43,732
[SPEAKER_24]: I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve of the following amendment to the revised ordinances.

3224
04:15:44,275 --> 04:15:48,996
[SPEAKER_24]: entitled Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel.

3225
04:15:49,857 --> 04:16:09,882
[SPEAKER_24]: City of Medford Amendment to Revised Ordinances, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford in Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Classification and Compensation Plans, Section 66-33, entitled

3226
04:16:12,544 --> 04:16:27,068
[SPEAKER_24]: administrative, managerial, confidential personnel is hereby amended by adding the following after Director of Veteran Services, grade CAF-12, title Outreach Agent Substance Abuse.

3227
04:16:27,988 --> 04:16:29,148
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a first reading.

3228
04:16:29,628 --> 04:16:36,430
[SPEAKER_24]: The second reading was affected by the posting of this ordinance publicly in the appropriate time.

3229
04:16:37,111 --> 04:16:44,615
[SPEAKER_24]: We now have a motion for approval of the third reading of which this has been ready for some time.

3230
04:16:45,115 --> 04:16:54,780
[SPEAKER_24]: We approved in the budget process the funding of this by the affirmative vote of this body just moments ago.

3231
04:16:54,920 --> 04:16:58,522
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're talking about the classification, not this description, correct?

3232
04:16:59,643 --> 04:17:02,784
[SPEAKER_24]: But the vote before us is for the ordinance.

3233
04:17:04,445 --> 04:17:06,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Can this be added or subtracted to it?

3234
04:17:06,805 --> 04:17:10,846
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to vote for the classification, but can recommendations be added or subtracted to this?

3235
04:17:11,006 --> 04:17:13,226
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a product of the administration.

3236
04:17:13,246 --> 04:17:16,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course it can.

3237
04:17:16,947 --> 04:17:18,887
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a product of the legislative body.

3238
04:17:21,588 --> 04:17:28,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn asked to this be tabled until we got the description.

3239
04:17:29,469 --> 04:17:31,250
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how we're at now.

3240
04:17:31,310 --> 04:17:33,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, just for the first reading, I never voted for it to be tabled.

3241
04:17:35,118 --> 04:17:36,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I just voted to only take the first reading.

3242
04:17:36,919 --> 04:17:37,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

3243
04:17:38,140 --> 04:17:38,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Moved.

3244
04:17:40,401 --> 04:17:42,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

3245
04:17:42,143 --> 04:17:42,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote.

3246
04:17:43,023 --> 04:17:44,284
[SPEAKER_09]: For the classification.

3247
04:17:44,404 --> 04:17:44,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Marks.

3248
04:17:45,045 --> 04:17:48,827
[SPEAKER_09]: For this to be classified in the city's compensation plan.

3249
04:17:52,049 --> 04:17:53,190
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3250
04:17:53,470 --> 04:17:54,051
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have anything.

3251
04:17:54,331 --> 04:17:55,212

04:18:19,853 --> 04:18:22,975
[SPEAKER_24]: 15-574 offered by Councilor Camuso.

3266
04:18:23,015 --> 04:18:30,319
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the purchasing agent give an update for the Medford Cable Access Television Studio project.

3267
04:18:30,799 --> 04:18:38,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Furthermore, that Architect Scott Payette, the winning bidder, provide detailed drawings when completed.

3268
04:18:38,363 --> 04:18:39,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Camuso.

3269
04:18:39,264 --> 04:18:40,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3270
04:18:40,545 --> 04:18:45,687
[SPEAKER_15]: As we all know, the city- I have a point of order, Mr. President.

3271
04:18:45,707 --> 04:18:46,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about it next week.

3272
04:18:47,048 --> 04:18:48,329
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll talk about it next week.

3273
04:18:50,029 --> 04:18:51,350
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll talk about it in the future.

3274
04:18:51,650 --> 04:18:52,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

3275
04:18:56,052 --> 04:18:57,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Villion won't have his TV station.

3276
04:18:57,853 --> 04:18:59,394
[SPEAKER_24]: We're trying to get a motion of council.

3277
04:18:59,674 --> 04:19:05,296
[SPEAKER_24]: So, uh, to take paper 15, five 73 out of order.

3278
04:19:05,717 --> 04:19:16,562
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor, those opposed communications from the mayor to president Frederick Dello Russo and members of the honorable Medford city council from mayor Michael J. McGlynn.

3279
04:19:17,323 --> 04:19:25,387
[SPEAKER_24]: 3 amendment to chapter 94 of the revised ordinances of the city of Medford entitled safe access to medical marijuana.

3280
04:19:26,388 --> 04:19:37,173
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear Mr. President and members of the honorable medical city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approved the following amendments to chapter 94 of the revised ordinances of the city of Medford.

3281
04:19:37,593 --> 04:19:40,034
[SPEAKER_24]: The following is a full text of the proposed amendments.

3282
04:19:40,755 --> 04:19:45,017
[SPEAKER_24]: As you are aware, since the amendments pertain to zoning,

3283
04:19:45,534 --> 04:19:52,899
[SPEAKER_24]: The next step would be for the city council to forward this paper to the planning board, respectfully, Michael J. McGlynn, et cetera.

3284
04:19:53,319 --> 04:19:54,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to send it to the planning board.

3285
04:19:54,940 --> 04:19:57,742
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to send it to the planning board.

3286
04:19:57,762 --> 04:19:58,463
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

3287
04:19:58,943 --> 04:19:59,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

3288
04:19:59,884 --> 04:20:02,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight on that motion.

3289
04:20:02,846 --> 04:20:07,929
[SPEAKER_24]: The solicitor would be so good as to give us a brief synopsis of the actual text that's going to the planning board.

3290
04:20:08,089 --> 04:20:08,790
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd appreciate it.

3291
04:20:08,890 --> 04:20:09,570
[SPEAKER_26]: Appreciate that.

3292
04:20:09,610 --> 04:20:12,332
[SPEAKER_24]: Please welcome Mr. City Solicitor.

3293
04:20:12,432 --> 04:20:14,133
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

3294
04:20:15,420 --> 04:20:16,560
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll be very, very quick.

3295
04:20:16,660 --> 04:20:18,401
[SPEAKER_29]: I think I should be because of the hour.

3296
04:20:19,361 --> 04:20:28,385
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'll just give you a short description of what this is so that the viewing public, those who are still listening, will get some understanding of this.

3297
04:20:28,785 --> 04:20:38,408
[SPEAKER_29]: As everyone knows, in 2012, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed the act which deals with the siting of medical marijuana facilities.

3298
04:20:39,188 --> 04:20:43,370
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's up to localities to decide in what zoning districts that might be.

3299
04:20:43,885 --> 04:20:49,009
[SPEAKER_29]: The licensing, the vetting, and the background checks and all that is done at the state level.

3300
04:20:50,510 --> 04:20:59,816
[SPEAKER_29]: We really have nothing on the books right now which covers this, so we wanted to get a launch pad going on a possible zoning amendment.

3301
04:21:00,217 --> 04:21:05,100
[SPEAKER_29]: This is simply a suggestion which would have to go to the planning board for a hearing.

3302
04:21:05,881 --> 04:21:09,083
[SPEAKER_29]: And basically, I'll say this as briefly as I can.

3303
04:21:09,683 --> 04:21:12,165
[SPEAKER_29]: On the very first page, you have two definitions, which

3304
04:21:12,683 --> 04:21:18,265
[SPEAKER_29]: under this prototype would be added to section 94 of the revised ordinance of the city of Medford.

3305
04:21:18,825 --> 04:21:30,068
[SPEAKER_29]: The first definition is medical marijuana treatment center, also known as an RMD, and that's the place where a company would acquire, cultivate, or process marijuana.

3306
04:21:30,548 --> 04:21:34,629
[SPEAKER_29]: The second one is an off-site medical marijuana dispensary.

3307
04:21:35,185 --> 04:21:43,431
[SPEAKER_29]: That would be the place where a person who is approved to acquire medical marijuana would go to purchase it.

3308
04:21:43,732 --> 04:21:48,675
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think the best way to look at it is one's a place where it would be grown, cultivated, et cetera.

3309
04:21:48,996 --> 04:21:50,637
[SPEAKER_29]: The other is where it would be sold.

3310
04:21:51,538 --> 04:22:04,788
[SPEAKER_29]: After meeting with the building commissioner, Karen Rose, also Brooke Hoyt, Penny Funoli, and Kim Scanlon, we were going through different alternatives.

3311
04:22:05,212 --> 04:22:10,134
[SPEAKER_29]: And we had suggested along with the, um, it was the building commissioner too.

3312
04:22:10,194 --> 04:22:21,158
[SPEAKER_29]: I mentioned him that the best district zoning wise to have such facilities in would be a C one C two or the industrial district in our city.

3313
04:22:21,838 --> 04:22:28,201
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can describe those a little bit, but rather than to go through all that, there are other restrictions on location.

3314
04:22:28,881 --> 04:22:33,683
[SPEAKER_29]: And one of the restrictions which you'll find on the third page of this proposal is

3315
04:22:34,405 --> 04:23:03,080
[SPEAKER_29]: that neither one of those facilities could be located in a building that has daycare, neither one of those facilities could be located on a parcel which is within 1,000 feet of a parcel occupied by a public or private elementary, junior high, middle, vocational, high school, college, university, daycare, or childcare facility, or a park or a playground, or

3316
04:23:03,763 --> 04:23:13,348
[SPEAKER_29]: any other place or any other use in which children commonly congregate or are organized on a formal basis.

3317
04:23:13,368 --> 04:23:13,969
[SPEAKER_29]: 1,000 feet from that.

3318
04:23:14,009 --> 04:23:20,492
[SPEAKER_29]: So you have those three zones, and then you'd have to be 1,000 feet away from those particular facilities.

3319
04:23:21,172 --> 04:23:29,657
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, as you see on the next page, neither one of those facilities could be located on a lot, even if it was within those zoning districts,

3320
04:23:30,127 --> 04:23:42,734
[SPEAKER_29]: which would be a lot that abuts a residential use, including what's known as a transient residential use, such as a hotel, motel, or dormitory.

3321
04:23:43,354 --> 04:23:47,537
[SPEAKER_29]: Those are the location prescriptions in this particular prototype.

3322
04:23:48,157 --> 04:23:52,139
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, when it goes to the planning board, they would have their own public hearing.

3323
04:23:52,499 --> 04:23:55,941
[SPEAKER_29]: We all intend to appear, of course, and to give our input.

3324
04:23:56,241 --> 04:23:59,143
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the planning board would have to get back to this council

3325
04:23:59,597 --> 04:24:01,058
[SPEAKER_29]: as to its recommendations.

3326
04:24:01,578 --> 04:24:06,301
[SPEAKER_29]: So what you have tonight is the launching pad, but it's not a landing pad.

3327
04:24:06,401 --> 04:24:08,242
[SPEAKER_29]: It has to go through the planning board.

3328
04:24:08,802 --> 04:24:09,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Question, Mark.

3329
04:24:09,522 --> 04:24:09,742
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

3330
04:24:10,083 --> 04:24:10,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick question.

3331
04:24:11,924 --> 04:24:18,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we as a city advocating that we want these things, or can somebody just come in here and set themselves up?

3332
04:24:18,507 --> 04:24:27,332
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a fair question, because if we have nothing, one of the risks are, and I talked about this with my colleague, Mr. Moki, one of the risks would be

3333
04:24:27,752 --> 04:24:33,834
[SPEAKER_29]: that they'd come in right now under the zoning ordinance that we presently have, and they'd say it's a horticultural use.

3334
04:24:34,495 --> 04:24:42,018
[SPEAKER_29]: And if that were the case, there may be some, we would lose some discretion in where these facilities could be.

3335
04:24:42,478 --> 04:24:45,299
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's... Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

3336
04:24:45,779 --> 04:24:51,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if the Councilor may have forgot, but didn't we as a council vote on a moratorium for this particular reason?

3337
04:24:51,582 --> 04:24:53,683
[SPEAKER_29]: We did, but that moratorium has expired.

3338
04:24:53,763 --> 04:24:54,783
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that was six months?

3339
04:24:55,263 --> 04:24:55,443
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

3340
04:24:55,663 --> 04:24:57,284
[SPEAKER_29]: But we did that for this particular reason.

3341
04:24:58,973 --> 04:25:01,234
[SPEAKER_29]: We did that for a number of different reasons, of course.

3342
04:25:02,175 --> 04:25:17,663
[SPEAKER_29]: But one of the reasons we want to get this launched tonight is that this would put, not in limbo, but if any prospective company were interested in coming here, they would have to wait until this process took its course if you send it to the planning board tonight.

3343
04:25:18,144 --> 04:25:23,687
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would say to this council that a week ago Friday, I received a call from a representative of the company

3344
04:25:24,097 --> 04:25:30,522
[SPEAKER_29]: that's operating a medical marijuana dispensary in Salem.

3345
04:25:31,323 --> 04:25:37,748
[SPEAKER_29]: And the gentleman, whose name I don't have in front of me, I spoke with him for about a half hour or so.

3346
04:25:38,268 --> 04:25:41,590
[SPEAKER_29]: And he said to me, well, what if I apply to come into MedFit?

3347
04:25:42,211 --> 04:25:44,813
[SPEAKER_29]: Is there any zoning ordinance that deals with this?

3348
04:25:45,594 --> 04:25:47,195
[SPEAKER_29]: And I said, well, we've talked about one.

3349
04:25:47,215 --> 04:25:48,516
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't have one quite yet.

3350
04:25:50,057 --> 04:25:52,299
[SPEAKER_29]: And we went on to talk about medical marijuana.

3351
04:25:52,559 --> 04:25:53,880
[SPEAKER_29]: It was a very good conversation.

3352
04:25:54,732 --> 04:26:08,055
[SPEAKER_29]: very intelligent and mature gentleman, but it is time that the city took the time to look at the possibilities of appropriate zoning restrictions for these facilities if they ever wanted to come into Medford.

3353
04:26:09,235 --> 04:26:22,138
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, I'm not saying that anybody has or that I have knowledge of that, but if we do nothing, then we're at the peril of somebody coming in, trying to find their way, kind of walking a fence through the zoning ordinance that we presently have.

3354
04:26:22,679 --> 04:26:23,879
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's not very prudent

3355
04:26:24,718 --> 04:26:25,799
[SPEAKER_29]: legislative process.

3356
04:26:27,420 --> 04:26:27,980
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President.

3357
04:26:29,121 --> 04:26:29,581
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry.

3358
04:26:29,742 --> 04:26:30,342
[SPEAKER_26]: Council night.

3359
04:26:30,802 --> 04:26:37,407
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Solicitor, would it make sense for us to expand or extend the moratorium until this piece of legislation goes through the planning process?

3360
04:26:37,427 --> 04:26:40,189
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, actually, you'd actually be having a new moratorium.

3361
04:26:40,249 --> 04:26:45,693
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would say that it would be better to begin this this particular endeavor for this reason.

3362
04:26:46,013 --> 04:26:51,957
[SPEAKER_29]: If you simply say we're putting a moratorium on this, meaning we're taking no action now until the legislation passes.

3363
04:26:52,037 --> 04:26:53,178
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, well, if this

3364
04:26:54,126 --> 04:27:03,072
[SPEAKER_29]: If this goes to the planning board, this essentially acts as not a moratorium, but it stays matters until the zoning process is complete.

3365
04:27:03,112 --> 04:27:03,632
[SPEAKER_27]: Same effect.

3366
04:27:03,872 --> 04:27:08,055
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a certain amount of days that Mr. Finn would have to send this to the planning board.

3367
04:27:08,415 --> 04:27:11,917
[SPEAKER_29]: Then the planning board has a certain number of days in which to schedule a hearing.

3368
04:27:12,278 --> 04:27:17,361
[SPEAKER_29]: And then it has to come back to the city council, which has an additional 90 days in which to take action.

3369
04:27:18,081 --> 04:27:20,563
[SPEAKER_29]: The best route in order to have,

3370
04:27:20,932 --> 04:27:34,321
[SPEAKER_29]: appropriate discernment on this issue, which does have some complexities to it, is to begin this process with the knowledge that what's in front of you right now as a prototype is like clay.

3371
04:27:34,721 --> 04:27:45,308
[SPEAKER_29]: It can be shaped and reshaped not only at the planning board level, but also when it comes back at some juncture to this city council with the recommendations of that planning board.

3372
04:27:45,817 --> 04:27:54,342
[SPEAKER_29]: And it also means that there would be a hearing before the planning board which would be publicly advertised, and the input of the citizenry would be secured that way.

3373
04:27:55,502 --> 04:27:59,324
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to send this to the planning board by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

3374
04:27:59,344 --> 04:27:59,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

3375
04:28:00,905 --> 04:28:01,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, sir.

3376
04:28:04,047 --> 04:28:10,711
[SPEAKER_09]: This is almost like a preemptive strike for what we were talking about earlier with the folks about these massage parlors or whatever you want to call it.

3377
04:28:10,751 --> 04:28:10,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

3378
04:28:11,171 --> 04:28:14,993
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're preparing for it, and I would hope

3379
04:28:15,865 --> 04:28:28,493
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get this information, the same energy will go forward so that we can come up with an ordinance that basically we don't have to deal with folks in residential neighborhoods, unfortunately, that won't have the same luxury as something like this.

3380
04:28:29,134 --> 04:28:32,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I've got no problem having us go forward.

3381
04:28:32,936 --> 04:28:39,300
[SPEAKER_09]: But my only other question is, you suggested that they could maybe come in under the term horticultural.

3382
04:28:40,761 --> 04:28:43,103
[SPEAKER_29]: I would say if we did nothing, we might try to now.

3383
04:28:44,117 --> 04:28:44,838
[SPEAKER_29]: This is sales.

3384
04:28:44,878 --> 04:28:45,798
[SPEAKER_29]: What about growing it?

3385
04:28:46,839 --> 04:28:48,981
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, growing would be under the first definition.

3386
04:28:49,461 --> 04:28:54,985
[SPEAKER_29]: Medical marijuana treatment centers includes the cultivation or possession of marijuana.

3387
04:28:55,025 --> 04:28:56,406
[SPEAKER_29]: That's why there are the two elements.

3388
04:28:56,506 --> 04:28:59,068
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you say the word cultivation, is that going to mean growing?

3389
04:28:59,188 --> 04:28:59,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it does.

3390
04:28:59,729 --> 04:29:01,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Having a hothouse and all of that?

3391
04:29:01,190 --> 04:29:01,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it does.

3392
04:29:03,171 --> 04:29:03,271
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

3393
04:29:04,505 --> 04:29:06,285
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

3394
04:29:06,565 --> 04:29:06,786
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

3395
04:29:07,306 --> 04:29:08,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3396
04:29:08,366 --> 04:29:10,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, while we're under suspension.

3397
04:29:10,846 --> 04:29:12,807
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension, Councilor Camuso.

3398
04:29:12,827 --> 04:29:16,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to take 15-424 and talk about community access.

3399
04:29:16,468 --> 04:29:21,589
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take 15-424 off the table.

3400
04:29:21,609 --> 04:29:22,469
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

3401
04:29:22,669 --> 04:29:23,009
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

3402
04:29:23,269 --> 04:29:24,050
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

3403
04:29:24,750 --> 04:29:25,610
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

3404
04:29:25,630 --> 04:29:29,631
[SPEAKER_24]: 15-424, support community access television H2847.

3405
04:29:30,191 --> 04:29:31,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3406
04:29:31,991 --> 04:29:32,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

3407
04:29:32,992 --> 04:29:33,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3408
04:29:35,671 --> 04:29:40,094
[SPEAKER_15]: As we all know, we're getting the new Medford TV station up at Medford High School.

3409
04:29:40,694 --> 04:29:51,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's going to be pretty exciting that the city is going to be moving forward finally over the next nine months or so with the project.

3410
04:29:52,588 --> 04:29:59,152
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could just ask the school department to get an update, not on the building, because I'll speak about that.

3411
04:29:59,172 --> 04:30:00,973
[SPEAKER_15]: That was section 22 a few minutes ago.

3412
04:30:01,914 --> 04:30:07,797
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would like to ask the school department to see where they're at as far as getting the station up and running.

3413
04:30:07,978 --> 04:30:09,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it comes after the construction.

3414
04:30:09,498 --> 04:30:11,240
[SPEAKER_30]: Point of information, Mr. President.

3415
04:30:11,260 --> 04:30:13,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

3416
04:30:14,221 --> 04:30:19,985
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's a shame that we're not talking about having a local access in a centrally located

3417
04:30:20,472 --> 04:30:23,094
[SPEAKER_30]: area where residents of our community can attend.

3418
04:30:23,614 --> 04:30:26,296
[SPEAKER_30]: I just think it's a real injustice to even discuss this issue.

3419
04:30:26,516 --> 04:30:29,498
[SPEAKER_30]: Point of information, Councilor Musil, you may continue.

3420
04:30:29,799 --> 04:30:39,245
[SPEAKER_15]: And I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, because there's going to be people that can't go to this station because of their quarry, because it's in the school, where if it was in Medford Square or somewhere else, it might not eliminate them.

3421
04:30:39,746 --> 04:30:48,852
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, if we could get an update from the school department on how's it going and who they plan on putting in charge of it, and just basically an update on the new station.

3422
04:30:49,504 --> 04:30:51,525
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion, all those in favor.

3423
04:30:55,207 --> 04:30:55,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

3424
04:30:55,648 --> 04:30:59,550
[SPEAKER_09]: On that particular motion, number one, we talk about local access.

3425
04:31:01,171 --> 04:31:02,512
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got some access alluded to.

3426
04:31:02,532 --> 04:31:05,554
[SPEAKER_09]: You're looking at a location that's centrally located.

3427
04:31:05,894 --> 04:31:07,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford high school is not centrally located.

3428
04:31:08,836 --> 04:31:16,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And from my most recent talking and understanding, I believe that the whole project is on hold right now because they don't have a, they don't have anyone that,

3429
04:31:16,997 --> 04:31:19,098
[SPEAKER_09]: submitted a bid that would be acceptable to the city.

3430
04:31:19,118 --> 04:31:20,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. President?

3431
04:31:20,458 --> 04:31:22,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Poulos.

3432
04:31:24,100 --> 04:31:24,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not on hold.

3433
04:31:25,320 --> 04:31:32,483
[SPEAKER_15]: The paper that was section 22'd a little bit earlier was to get an update on the moving forward, but we can't talk about it.

3434
04:31:32,503 --> 04:31:33,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not on hold.

3435
04:31:33,283 --> 04:31:34,323
[SPEAKER_15]: That's incorrect.

3436
04:31:34,904 --> 04:31:38,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, from the information that I've been able to ascertain,

3437
04:31:39,160 --> 04:31:46,483
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on hold, number one, for the time being, because I don't believe that they had more than one developer who made a request to go up there, number one.

3438
04:31:46,503 --> 04:31:48,504
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not talking about the architect.

3439
04:31:48,764 --> 04:31:54,706
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about the tax-exempt non-profit that would be making the bid on the program.

3440
04:31:54,926 --> 04:31:56,647
[SPEAKER_15]: A developer wants to go up there, you said?

3441
04:31:57,867 --> 04:31:58,687
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm confused.

3442
04:31:59,548 --> 04:32:05,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the tax-exempt non-profit, I believe that they only had one bidder at the present time, but that's not the point.

3443
04:32:05,650 --> 04:32:07,231
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is simply this.

3444
04:32:07,351 --> 04:32:08,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not centrally located.

3445
04:32:08,821 --> 04:32:10,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a place where somebody can go and take a bus.

3446
04:32:11,062 --> 04:32:19,668
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a place where you would want to send an adult at nighttime to have them traverse up there and walk an extension part of the building.

3447
04:32:20,028 --> 04:32:20,669
[SPEAKER_09]: That's number one.

3448
04:32:20,709 --> 04:32:29,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, the fact of the matter is, if it would be in a centrally located place, it would be easily accessible to not only students, but professional people.

3449
04:32:29,834 --> 04:32:36,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And those folks would want to be educated and have the high school become the satellite to the central location somewhere in this community.

3450
04:32:36,979 --> 04:32:38,700
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about two locations possibly.

3451
04:32:39,235 --> 04:32:43,938
[SPEAKER_09]: One at Cheviro Auditorium, the other one, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, at the public library.

3452
04:32:43,958 --> 04:32:44,959
[SPEAKER_09]: A great opportunity.

3453
04:32:45,259 --> 04:32:48,080
[SPEAKER_09]: The city is sitting on over $350,000 of that money.

3454
04:32:48,521 --> 04:32:52,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But the real fact of the matter is this, there is no public access operating right now.

3455
04:32:52,403 --> 04:33:00,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether you're a council running for office, whether you're running here for re-election, for whatever it might be, the mayor is intentionally stifling public access by not having it.

3456
04:33:01,072 --> 04:33:11,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the present time, that is absolutely not fair because each and every rate payer on every single month in their bill, Verizon and Comcast, is being charged for public access for which they're not getting.

3457
04:33:11,657 --> 04:33:12,658
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to take some time.

3458
04:33:13,098 --> 04:33:29,106
[SPEAKER_09]: If you read the report that the three-member commission that the mayor empowered in February this past year talked about it being centrally located, easily accessible for people to get to, and to be educationally and technologically available to students and for business people and for residents and for taxpayers.

3459
04:33:29,416 --> 04:33:35,958
[SPEAKER_09]: We had six people come here on a particular night and talk about the value of what public access could be if, in fact, it was an operation.

3460
04:33:36,338 --> 04:33:37,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But it isn't an operation.

3461
04:33:37,838 --> 04:33:42,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And this administration, unfortunately, has not only fallen asleep on this matter.

3462
04:33:42,620 --> 04:33:55,803
[SPEAKER_09]: When you had the public access here in June, the public meeting on the 10-year contract with Comcast, not one person from the city administration was here to talk about, never mind public access, but to defend the ratepayers of this community for being charged for something.

3463
04:33:56,123 --> 04:33:56,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you have it?

3464
04:33:56,683 --> 04:33:58,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Two o'clock in the afternoon when people are working.

3465
04:33:59,187 --> 04:34:00,308
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the time to have it.

3466
04:34:00,548 --> 04:34:02,229
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not being open and communicative.

3467
04:34:02,530 --> 04:34:03,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And what does the city hire?

3468
04:34:03,831 --> 04:34:10,516
[SPEAKER_09]: They hire an outside attorney, pay him $350 an hour to sit here and take notes for the 10, 12 people who came and spoke on that particular day.

3469
04:34:10,996 --> 04:34:16,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke on that day because I think public access, and more importantly, our cable access bill is very important.

3470
04:34:16,861 --> 04:34:22,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And to have a 10-year contract go out with the lack of amount of public interest and input, that is wrong.

3471
04:34:22,505 --> 04:34:23,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wrong.

3472
04:34:23,405 --> 04:34:29,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what public access is about, having somebody have the opportunity to come up, whether you agree or disagree, to express their opinions.

3473
04:34:29,907 --> 04:34:31,547
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we don't have here in this community.

3474
04:34:31,967 --> 04:34:39,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Not worried about what's going to go up in the high school, that's so far out into the future, way beyond an election coming forward, way beyond whether we have.

3475
04:34:40,009 --> 04:34:41,870
[SPEAKER_09]: July 3rd is right around the corner.

3476
04:34:42,230 --> 04:34:48,633
[SPEAKER_09]: This mayor has up until July 3rd to make his decision whether he's going to sign another 10-year contract with Comcast.

3477
04:34:48,954 --> 04:34:53,396
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was asked on that particular day, not only by myself, but other people, not to sign it.

3478
04:34:53,796 --> 04:34:59,419
[SPEAKER_09]: The same way that the mayor is not going to hire a new director of public works until the new mayor comes in in January of this year.

3479
04:34:59,699 --> 04:35:04,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he should be doing the same thing as it relates to Comcast and to find out where we're going.

3480
04:35:04,542 --> 04:35:09,604
[SPEAKER_09]: The contracts now that are being extended go anywheres no more from three to five years max.

3481
04:35:09,864 --> 04:35:10,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And after the third year,

3482
04:35:11,155 --> 04:35:12,275
[SPEAKER_09]: There's supposed to be community input.

3483
04:35:12,315 --> 04:35:17,176
[SPEAKER_09]: There's supposed to be a community survey, for which never took place, as to what do you think about Comcast.

3484
04:35:17,456 --> 04:35:19,716
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the aliquot and the specialty programs.

3485
04:35:20,137 --> 04:35:23,837
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that has taken place, for which if you read the contract, it was supposed to take place.

3486
04:35:24,077 --> 04:35:32,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you read the guidelines from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Utilities say those are the ingredients that are necessary in each and every one of contract renewals.

3487
04:35:32,779 --> 04:35:40,140
[SPEAKER_09]: This city did not follow any of the guidelines, none of the renewal quotes, and as it relates to that, and as a result, that's why we don't have public access.

3488
04:35:40,450 --> 04:35:49,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if this mayor was so interested in having public access, he could plaster himself all over it, like he does in Channel 15, and let everybody have an opportunity.

3489
04:35:49,575 --> 04:35:50,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not his station.

3490
04:35:51,135 --> 04:35:52,316
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Comcast.

3491
04:35:52,556 --> 04:35:53,337
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't own it.

3492
04:35:53,837 --> 04:35:54,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what's wrong.

3493
04:35:54,997 --> 04:35:55,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

3494
04:35:55,658 --> 04:35:57,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Councilor Penta.

3495
04:35:57,158 --> 04:35:57,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

3496
04:35:58,059 --> 04:36:03,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to remind the viewing public that it was Councilor Penta that fought the charge to shut the access station down.

3497
04:36:04,462 --> 04:36:07,604
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of ironic, once again,

3498
04:36:08,918 --> 04:36:11,680
[SPEAKER_15]: There's many emotions he brought forward, and the record doesn't lie.

3499
04:36:12,240 --> 04:36:24,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the reason why, you know, lying is a strange word around here, because I think sometimes the maker of the commentary should review his comments.

3500
04:36:25,003 --> 04:36:30,527
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why we wanted to get rid of Channel 3 was because it's despicable actions.

3501
04:36:31,287 --> 04:36:33,089
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lack of accounting for money.

3502
04:36:33,449 --> 04:36:35,730
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lack of keeping minutes of records.

3503
04:36:36,051 --> 04:36:40,954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lack of allowing people to come and speak, and it's a lack of doing the community work.

3504
04:36:41,214 --> 04:36:48,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the people who were running it at the time, their complete abuse and misuse of their 501c3 prerogative, that's what is wrong.

3505
04:36:49,440 --> 04:36:52,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I may just conclude, as I stated,

3506
04:36:53,711 --> 04:36:57,095
[SPEAKER_15]: The Councilor wanted to get rid of public access and now he's a proponent.

3507
04:36:57,956 --> 04:37:00,059
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, enough with these personal attacks.

3508
04:37:00,359 --> 04:37:04,644
[SPEAKER_30]: They're personal attacks.

3509
04:37:04,785 --> 04:37:06,166
[SPEAKER_30]: Enough with the personal attacks.

3510
04:37:06,226 --> 04:37:10,011
[SPEAKER_30]: We're here to do the people's business, not with the personal attacks.

3511
04:37:13,355 --> 04:37:14,556
[SPEAKER_30]: personal tax.

3512
04:37:14,596 --> 04:37:15,937
[SPEAKER_30]: We don't need that.

3513
04:37:15,977 --> 04:37:17,578
[SPEAKER_30]: You're a lame duck councillor.

3514
04:37:17,598 --> 04:37:20,079
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need personal tax.

3515
04:37:20,119 --> 04:37:22,500
[SPEAKER_15]: You're on your last leg here, councillor.

3516
04:37:22,520 --> 04:37:24,041
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll be joining me in January.

3517
04:37:24,061 --> 04:37:25,642
[SPEAKER_16]: State your name and address for the record.

3518
04:37:26,002 --> 04:37:27,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, council president.

3519
04:37:27,563 --> 04:37:28,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Joe Villion, 59 Garfield.

3520
04:37:28,924 --> 04:37:29,464
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only begun.

3521
04:37:29,764 --> 04:37:31,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say one thing, council president.

3522
04:37:32,046 --> 04:37:42,832
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion that was tabled was Ruth Bowser's bill, and we're not discussing Ruth Bowser's bill, so I would ask the city

3523
04:37:43,623 --> 04:37:49,986
[SPEAKER_16]: keep it on the table because that was about Ruth Bowser's bill, not what this Councilor made it about.

3524
04:37:50,006 --> 04:37:52,007
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion to table is undebatable.

3525
04:37:52,087 --> 04:37:53,027
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favour?

3526
04:37:55,888 --> 04:37:58,850
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place on file.

3527
04:37:59,390 --> 04:38:01,111
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call vote has been requested.

3528
04:38:05,152 --> 04:38:07,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much Councilor Marks for the chair.

3529
04:38:08,034 --> 04:38:10,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Ruth Bowser had a bill which I got at the Mass Access

3530
04:38:11,649 --> 04:38:12,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Springfield Convention.

3531
04:38:12,790 --> 04:38:18,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I spent a lot of money to go out there to be part of that convention and bring information back to this city.

3532
04:38:18,772 --> 04:38:21,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Ruth Bowser's bill is about saving public access TV.

3533
04:38:21,334 --> 04:38:29,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel it was hijacked tonight because we didn't talk about Section 22 was called, and a person took my petition about Ruth Bowser's bill and hijacked it.

3534
04:38:29,397 --> 04:38:30,098
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not fair.

3535
04:38:30,938 --> 04:38:32,139
[SPEAKER_16]: People have to follow rules.

3536
04:38:32,519 --> 04:38:35,940
[SPEAKER_16]: We follow decorum, but there was no decorum here tonight, President, except for you.

3537
04:38:36,021 --> 04:38:38,442
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much when it comes to this individual.

3538
04:38:38,462 --> 04:38:38,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all.

3539
04:38:38,742 --> 04:38:39,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, America.

3540
04:38:39,322 --> 04:38:41,003
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're going to wrap up tonight's meeting.

3541
04:38:41,835 --> 04:38:47,057
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso's motion to receive in place on file, all those in favor?

3542
04:38:47,878 --> 04:38:50,439
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

3543
04:38:51,600 --> 04:38:53,821
[SPEAKER_24]: 15564, we have a couple of condolences here.

3544
04:38:53,841 --> 04:39:04,666
[SPEAKER_24]: 15564 offered by Councilor Caraviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Merle Lindsay, who passed away after a lengthy illness.

3545
04:39:05,246 --> 04:39:09,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Merle is the wife of Ernest Lindsay, the Director of Veterans Services for the City of Medford.

3546
04:39:10,303 --> 04:39:12,304
[SPEAKER_24]: she will be missed by her family and friends.

3547
04:39:12,905 --> 04:39:23,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Offered by Councilor Knight, 15566, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer deep and sincere condolences to the family of Vincent Guerra on his recent passing.

3548
04:39:24,493 --> 04:39:35,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Offered by Councilor Marks, paper in hand of the clerk, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time Medford resident Dennis Figalski on his recent passing.

3549
04:39:35,401 --> 04:39:38,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Dennis served with the United States Air Force in Vietnam

3550
04:39:38,644 --> 04:39:41,126
[SPEAKER_24]: was also an employee of the Medford Engineering Department.

3551
04:39:41,686 --> 04:40:06,664
[SPEAKER_24]: And finally, we dedicated this meeting at the request of Councilor Penta in memory of George Kayon, who was a tireless community activist in the city of Medford in a period when community activism meant something, involved people through cross-sections of the population in the city.

3552
04:40:08,947 --> 04:40:12,228
[SPEAKER_24]: when things were sort of at their height of community involvement.

3553
04:40:12,768 --> 04:40:21,871
[SPEAKER_24]: And the Bicentennial Committee, as a member of the Lions, as a member of, he was on the Parks Commission, as he was on several other boards.

3554
04:40:22,211 --> 04:40:25,532
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful and great member of our community.

3555
04:40:26,372 --> 04:40:28,353
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Camuso wishes to speak?

3556
04:40:28,993 --> 04:40:29,153
[SPEAKER_24]: No?

3557
04:40:29,313 --> 04:40:30,013
[SPEAKER_24]: It's on something else.

3558
04:40:30,434 --> 04:40:35,235
[SPEAKER_24]: So then if you would all stand for a moment of silence for all these citizens.

3559
04:40:36,008 --> 04:40:38,049
