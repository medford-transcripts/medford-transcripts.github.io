    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=234.87s">Third</a>  regular meeting, Medford City Council, February 11, 2025, is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=238.634s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=240.196s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=242.038s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=243.86s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=245.923s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=247.204s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=248.486s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=249.587s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=250.288s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=250.768s">So</a>  President Adkins, please rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=267.667s">Announcements,</a>  accolades, remembrances, reports, and records. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=270.488s">25022</a>  offered by Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Tseng, and President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=276.01s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council acknowledge and celebrate Black History Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=279.211s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=283.472s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=284.513s">Happy</a>  Black History Month to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=287.914s">I</a>  wanted to read a couple of segments of some emails that I received this month honoring Black History Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=298.24s">These</a>  were both emails that were sent to me by influential black women, and I thought they were the most appropriate things to read to celebrate Black History Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=310.833s">The</a>  first is by Andrea Campbell, Massachusetts' first black woman to be elected to a statewide office, our current Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=318.924s">quote,</a>  Massachusetts is home to the movements that pushed this country to live up to its promises of freedom and equality for all of its citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=326.89s">Frederick</a>  Douglass started the abolition movement here in Massachusetts, and let's not forget Dr. King and Coretta Scott met as college students in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=335.836s">While</a>  the work is far from over, I'm proud of the progress we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=338.958s">It's</a>  now up to us to fight to defend and advance the wins of our civil rights heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=345.022s">The</a>  second thing I'd like to read is from an email sent out by Frances Nwaje, Medford's very own Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=352.945s">Frances</a>  sends out emails to city employees about various events and days of celebration, giving great history and background, and they're always a really great read. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=362.528s">She</a>  says the National Observance of Black History Month is itself a fairly recent reality in the United States, and it was not immediately met with widespread reception. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=372.559s">Its</a>  history begins with famous historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1926. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=379.466s">In</a>  honor of the birthdays of Frederick Douglass on February 14th, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=384.824s">and</a>  President Abraham Lincoln on February 12th, two of the most important people for black American history, Woodson proclaimed the second week of February to be observed as Negro History Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=394.952s">The</a>  main focus of this observance was to encourage the teaching of black American history in educational institutes, particularly at the primary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=404.059s">The</a>  overall reception was lukewarm, but the departments of education of Delaware, North Carolina and West Virginia were very cooperative and Woodson considered it a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=412.738s">After</a>  this, the idea for Black History Month was promoted by black students and educators at Kent State University in February, 1969, followed by the first celebration of Black History Month on campus and local surroundings one year later. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=425.347s">Six</a>  years later, Black History Month was being widely celebrated across the country, not only in schools, colleges, and community centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=432.271s">In</a>  1976, in conjunction with the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=434.313s">Bicentennial,</a>  President Gerald Ford praised Black History Month, urging all citizens to seize the opportunity to honor the too often neglected, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=442.557s">accomplishments</a>  of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=447.102s">I</a>  just want to thank Frances for sharing some information with city employees and for all her work. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=452.168s">And</a>  I want to acknowledge the valuable work of her department and similar departments across Medford and encourage them to continue their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=460.728s">We're</a>  really grateful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=462.729s">Black</a>  History Month hasn't really even been around for that long, so it's just important that we continue to celebrate it, and I'm glad to be a part of that and a part of that for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=473.171s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=475.011s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=475.871s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=477.771s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=479.712s">Black</a>  History in Medford goes back a long, long time to the founding of our city when <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=486.432s">very</a>  unfortunately, slaves were brought here to work in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=491.338s">We</a>  see from at the Brooks Estate, we have Pomp's Wall, a wall that was created that was built by an enslaved man. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=499.448s">We</a>  see that that black history reflected in the heroic work of Belinda Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=505.385s">who</a>  successfully sued, took the initiative and sued for her rights to reparations and received those reparations, forming the first known legal case in North America when it came to freed slaves, getting reparations for their time as slaves, and setting a legal guideline, a baseline for the rights of freed slaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=533.979s">This</a>  history continues through the last few centuries, we have the our historical black community and West Bedford who form such a rich tapestry of our life here in Medford mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=549.931s">the</a>  work of the West Medford Community Center and uplifting that community and bringing us all together and making sure that Black history isn't just something that we tokenize and something that we shove into a corner, but that Black history is something that we all celebrate and recognize. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=566.897s">And</a>  on that note, I do also want to note that our city on February 17th, Monday, February 17th, 2025, that's President's Day, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=576.701s">From</a>  1030 to 1.30pm in these chambers, we will have a celebration for Black History Month focused on African Americans and labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=585.955s">And</a>  that event is also in conjunction with the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=592.715s">I</a>  also wanted to note, I think it's the elephant in the room, the attacks on diversity happening nationally and from the federal government in particular, trying to wipe away, erase, delete the idea of black history, the idea that of the histories and struggles of different ethnic groups in this country who all form what we all are, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=618.605s">our</a>  story as Americans here. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=621.106s">I've</a>  been glad to talk to neighbors about this, to hear from different elected officials across the city and different offices about our commitment to diversity, to equity, and to inclusion, particularly in our policymaking process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=637.731s">Considering</a>  racial equity in policymaking is something that's really complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=642.593s">something</a>  that's really nuanced, something that doesn't always you know the the policy that is the best for racial equity doesn't always seem like it at first and the easy solutions aren't always the best solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=653.699s">And</a>  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as elected officials as policymakers in the city to ask critically, what, what are <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=664.223s">our</a>  oppressed communities, our marginalized communities, our black communities, feeling, what are they seeing? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=670.066s">What</a>  are they experiencing? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=671.507s">And</a>  how can the policies we write and establish, the policies that we pass through the city council best address those needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=679.271s">And</a>  that takes a lot of listening, and it takes a lot of criticism and critical thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=684.834s">So</a>  I wanted to thank my fellow Councilors for co-sponsoring this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=692.55s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=693.41s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=697.232s">Seeing</a>  none, is there anyone from the public who'd like to speak on this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=700.674s">Seeing</a>  none, just as a co-sponsor, I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=710.279s">Thank</a>  the city for continuing to stand up for the values that we hold of diversity, equity, and inclusion and representing everyone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=719.874s">I</a>  want to thank both of my fellow Councilors for lifting up voices of folks who are speaking out against what's happening right now and lifting up the nuance of what good policy work to address a history of racial injustice looks like in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=739.447s">And</a>  I think, you know, something we can all remember and it's important for us to remember is the <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=748.166s">radicalism</a>  of the civil rights leaders who ended 100 years of functionally slavery and oppression from the end of the Civil War through the 1960s. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=762.433s">And</a>  we often hear sanitized and sparkled up quotes, but I think especially at this moment, a quote from Dr. King from his speech, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=776.119s">remaining</a>  awake for a great revolution speaks to this moment that we're in as a country. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=782.347s">Let</a>  nobody give you the impression that the problem of racial injustice will work itself out. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=787.313s">Let</a>  nobody give you the impression that only time will solve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=791.272s">That</a>  is a myth and it is a myth because time is neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=794.774s">It</a>  can be used either constructively or destructively. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=798.075s">And</a>  I'm absolutely convinced that the people of ill will in our nation, the extreme rightists, the forces committed to negative ends have used time much more effectively than the people of goodwill. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=810.401s">And</a>  sadly, I think we're seeing that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=815.003s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=817.984s">Seeing</a>  none on the motion, Mr. Clerk, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=820.339s">On</a>  the motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=822.34s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=822.88s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=826.541s">25024</a>  offered by Councilor Lazzaro, a resolution in remembrance of Dan Dill. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=831.783s">Dan</a>  Dill was a professor of chemistry at Boston University for 50 years, publishing 78 academic research papers with particular interest in, quote, making quantum aspects of the world accessible to general chemistry students, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=845.167s">That</a>  quote is from his personal reflections on his career upon his retirement in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=850.028s">Professor</a>  Dill was also an accomplished photographer, winning an award from Kodak in 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=854.871s">I</a>  encourage everyone to look at his website. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=857.233s">His</a>  work is beautiful, www.dandillphotography.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=863.157s">On</a>  December 4th, 2024, Professor Dill was walking his dog in a crosswalk across Mystic Valley Parkway near his home in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=870.522s">He</a>  was struck by a car and critically injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=873.164s">Professor</a>  Dill passed away from his injuries on January 11th, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=877.187s">His</a>  neighbors and friends, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=879.68s">have</a>  banded together to lobby for changes to the traffic patterns and the greater traffic enforcement on that road, which is controlled by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=895.016s">Apologies.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=906.238s">Be</a>  it hereby resolved that the Bedford City Council share our deepest condolences of Professor Dill's family and loved ones, express our hope that this senseless tragedy will not be in vain and will not be repeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=918.886s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the City Council work with DCR and our state delegation to make improvements to the crosswalk where Professor Dill was killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=926.87s">Council</a>  is adjourned.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=931.347s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=934.269s">Professor</a>  Dill was not somebody that I knew personally, but somebody who was frequently outside, frequently spent time in nature, spent a long time mentoring and <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=955.184s">nurturing</a>  his students at Boston University. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=957.245s">I</a>  went to Boston University. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=960.047s">I</a>  also I went to Boston University as an undergrad and a graduate student, and I worked there as a professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=969.711s">But</a>  I didn't know Dan, but I lived in his town and I live in his neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=976.195s">And</a>  he went out and walked his dog and he got hit by a car in a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=983.319s">And</a>  because the road that he was walking on is managed not by the city of Medford, but by a state department, it's often very frustrating to try to make changes to the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1012.425s">that</a>  would make it safer for people to walk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1017.467s">To</a>  the point that it seems like nothing can be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1023.37s">There</a>  are some things that you can do to roadways to make it safer for people to walk for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1029.733s">You</a>  can make the crosswalks elevated. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1034.355s">You</a>  can make speed humps. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1037.037s">You</a>  can put flashing signs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1040.885s">But</a>  since it's the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is basically parks and rec for the whole state. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1048.252s">They're</a>  not like the highway administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1050.133s">They</a>  don't have that much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1052.055s">It's,</a>  it often feels like you can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1057.416s">There</a>  are a group of neighbors that have gathered together. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1062.96s">There's</a>  an attachment in the packet of a letter that was written by this group of neighbors and signed by a large number of them who live in the neighborhood that Professor Dill lived in. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1074.527s">And</a>  they are asking for changes to be made to this rotary and that strip of road so that people won't drive so fast on it and it won't be so dangerous for people to walk their dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1089.092s">And</a>  I think that one thing that we should pay attention to as a city council is what we can do as elected officials and what our mandate is as representatives of our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1103.181s">This</a>  happened, Dan was hit in December, he died in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1107.404s">I</a>  think a week and a half ago, somebody else got hit in the rotary that's right outside this building and died. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1116.696s">another</a>  man in his 70s who was walking across a crosswalk in a rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1124.078s">I</a>  don't understand why people in Medford will be angry about all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1134.38s">And</a>  this is life and death, and people are routinely getting hit by cars and dying. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1144.122s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1147.098s">I</a>  don't understand what could be more critical and more urgent than making a speed bump or a flashing sign and putting it up and making the road safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1163.486s">Cars</a>  have become very safe for the people inside the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1167.688s">They've</a>  become very dangerous for the people who are walking on sidewalks and crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1177.573s">I</a>  can share one piece of information, which is that our state delegation has been working with DCR, attempting to meet with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1186.176s">They</a>  did meet today. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1188.737s">Representative</a>  Garbally told me today that they met. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1192.038s">He</a>  didn't tell me what was discussed, but he said that they're making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1195.459s">I'm</a>  hopeful that that means that we can at least have an elevated crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1203.302s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1205.619s">There</a>  are a number of requests, safety requests, speed warning signs for the crosswalk, rotary striping, speed enforcement by state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1216.51s">I</a>  would also prefer to have a <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1223.222s">uh,</a>  committee meeting with the Medford Police Department and the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1228.005s">We</a>  have a state police barracks that's located in the Wellington neighborhood in Medford where I think we could, um, just have an open discussion about, like, how enforcement is carried out by the state police versus Medford police. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1243.973s">I</a>  don't completely understand who is in charge of enforcement in which <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1250.033s">of</a>  the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1251.814s">I've</a>  learned a lot from talking to people who are activists and advocates for these kind of changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1265.38s">And</a>  the roads that are Medford roads exclusively, that Medford's in charge of enforcement, that is Medford police. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1276.849s">um,</a>  jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1277.909s">But</a>  when it's a road that is a state road, it's the state police is in charge of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1284.612s">It's</a>  just everything is somebody else's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1287.433s">It's</a>  very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1288.913s">Um,</a>  it's especially frustrating for family members and neighbors who are concerned, um, people who have lost somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1295.755s">Uh,</a>  and, um, I think we should all, um, be <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1304.677s">fighting</a>  as hard as we can to try to prevent this from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1308.499s">And</a>  when we talk about it, we say, somebody shouldn't have to die for things to change, but then people do die and they still don't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1318.804s">And</a>  then another person dies and they still don't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1320.965s">And</a>  it's infuriating.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1324.707s">And</a>  that's all, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1333.291s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1336.052s">Councilor</a>  Kelly here.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1338.39s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1339.631s">First,</a>  I really want to thank Councilor Lazzaro, of course, for bringing this forward and working with residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1345.074s">I</a>  do want to thank the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1346.675s">Their</a>  letter is incredibly well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1350.798s">The</a>  requests they have made are well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1354.2s">They</a>  have gotten many, many, many signatures for people signing on to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1361.884s">So</a>  they've done a lot of organizing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1363.746s">I</a>  think, and I completely agree with Councilor Lazzaro that it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1368.068s">incredibly</a>  frustrating that deaths, injuries, accidents continue to happen, and we do not have the ability to have the control that our residents would like us to have over these roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1387.517s">You</a>  know, even just in the question of like whether signage is put up saying what the speed limit is the correct speed limit so you know even small things small requests go unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1397.404s">I</a>  wanted to ask a little bit of a procedural question I hope it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1402.548s">This</a>  is by no means to not say that this is an important topic but. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1408.69s">Is</a>  it actually allowed for motions to be put in remembrances, and I'm only wondering because I think there may be people in the community who would want to know about this and might want to speak on this topic but they wouldn't look in remembrances for promotions that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1424.696s">And</a>  my only suggestion, like I've been thinking about whether. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1429.338s">It</a>  would be useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1430.398s">I</a>  know there's been an email thread with more data about the state roads and accidents happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1438.083s">There</a>  is data online that we can see about injuries, deaths, accidents happening on the state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1445.868s">That</a>  data is available to us online. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1449.29s">And</a>  I was wondering if we might think about putting this either in a committee to then go to City Council, but having Todd Blake, who's our traffic guy or anyone else that that folks think is the appropriate person to talk to us about navigating <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1468.557s">our</a>  relationship with DCR and what we can maybe provide, is there anything that we can do to push DCR to take action more quickly? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1478.988s">So</a>  I guess there's, like, should we move this to committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1483.193s">Can</a>  these motions be done in a remembrance? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1486.817s">And</a>  then... <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1488.739s">I</a>  had one other suggestion, which is wondering if city councilors can sign on to this letter, if that would be more impactful for us also to sign on to the letter to maybe send to our state delegation.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1499.714s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1500.915s">I</a>  think just from a procedural perspective, if we wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1507.055s">divide</a>  the question between the two paragraphs and send the second paragraph to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1510.941s">That</a>  would be procedurally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1513.705s">I'm</a>  also in conversation with the Bike Commission and hoping to engage members of WOC-Mentford <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1522.039s">to</a>  have folks down to talk about the updates to the citywide Bicycle plan and also the general road safety needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1530.843s">Um</a>  And maybe even moving towards adopting a vision zero policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1536.586s">I</a>  think there's also the side of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1539.487s">I</a>  don't know if those should be one meeting or two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1542.449s">Um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1544.287s">or</a>  one really big meeting, but I think if we refer this, and my preference would be if we would refer that to Committee of the Whole, my hope would be, my hope in working with the Bicycle Commission and other advocates would be to have that in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1559.911s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1563.572s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1564.972s">Council</a>  Lizard, do you have anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1566.232s">Are</a>  you amenable to turning the second paragraph of the resolution into a B paper and referring that to Committee of the Whole?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1576.488s">Yes,</a>  I'm comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1577.549s">I</a>  do think that enforcement and roadway changes are two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1583.611s">But</a>  I think a larger conversation about traffic safety in Medford is definitely in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1590.474s">And</a>  I think maybe if everybody came together in one conversation that wasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1600.054s">that's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1600.735s">I</a>  don't know if that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1601.335s">Accusatory</a>  or that just was everybody trying to come being on the same team trying to come together to solve the problem that everybody agrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1609.945s">Is</a>  everyone's problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1611.567s">A</a>  great idea.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1621.877s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1622.657s">I</a>  just wanted to thank Councilor Lazzaro for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1625.638s">And</a>  I know that Councilor Lazzaro and President Bears in particular, among other councilors, have been in very close contact with this neighborhood coalition that has been organizing in the wake of Professor Dill's untimely death. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1639.444s">So</a>  thank you to you for that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1642.125s">And</a>  thank you to the residents for organizing in the wake of this tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1646.727s">It's</a>  hard to find words for something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1651.25s">I</a>  want the residents to know that we share in your grief, and it's just so hard to. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1658.835s">As</a>  residents of the city, as residents of most cities, as representatives of any city, this is something that we have to fathom because it happens all of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1666.259s">I</a>  don't think it's at all an exaggeration to say that roads in America are <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1671.067s">paved</a>  in tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1673.308s">It</a>  has incredibly normalized the level of road violence that we all have to live with and grieve from. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1680.27s">And</a>  as a representative, it fills me with just disbelief and fury that municipalities like ours are so hamstrung when it comes to the level of discretion and capacity and resources that we are allowed to have because of how funding is allocated from our federal and state partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1700.636s">and</a>  how hamstrung we are and things that we have to bottom line as a city, leaving us so disempowered to do the type of improvements that residents have been begging us to do for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1710.824s">We</a>  need substantial, radical road redesign on most roads in Medford if they are going to be livable for the people that walk on them and bike on them and roll on them and drive on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1723.173s">And</a>  if it was possible for us to do that amid our other statutory responsibilities, I think we would have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1729.958s">going</a>  to say, 50 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1733.259s">And</a>  because we, for many reasons, could not, and for other reasons, would not, people continue to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1746.381s">And</a>  so it's with this perspective that we have to go forward and use the levers that we have at our disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1751.362s">I'm</a>  really, really grateful to every resident who has been calling on us to meet with our delegation and with partners at DCR as often as possible to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1760.609s">It</a>  is insane that this is normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1762.951s">It</a>  is national gaslighting that people are supposed to just get over, people dying on roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1772.76s">I</a>  think this is another incredibly sad example of how governments are not given the tools to <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1785.48s">kind</a>  of compete with the pace of technological advancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1790.906s">Cars</a>  are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1795.051s">Roads</a>  are not changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1796.372s">Municipalities</a>  are not given more tools to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1799.916s">And</a>  people keep dying. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1808.16s">I</a>  don't really know how to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1810.161s">It</a>  just never should have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1812.001s">And</a>  we have to keep working together until it stops happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1814.862s">So</a>  again, thank you to the residents and to Professor Dill's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1818.143s">We're</a>  very deep in sympathy for your loss.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3040.907s">Yes,</a>  I'd like to thank my colleague for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3044.549s">So</a>  to offer a little bit more insight into the background of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3049.972s">So</a>  a lot of the parents who have been advocating for these programs have been doing so for years and years, and they haven't, I think at this point, a lot of them have just been advocating so long, they feel like they're talking to a brick wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3063.539s">So</a>  part of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3065.28s">purpose</a>  of this is to just make sure that everybody that the parents, Council, the city and Medford recreation are on the same page in terms of vision for what these programs look like and they're, it's, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3082.062s">a</a>  lot of details that like, well, I guess seem like details to the folks, to some folks, but a huge deal to the parents, like whether or not the programs are going to be designed for just kids or kids and teens, whether they're going to be sports based, what times are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3096.605s">So</a>  I think the parents would just like some clarity with Medford recreation on what, on what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3105.747s">And</a>  it would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3108.52s">productive</a>  to get these discussions on the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3113.602s">I</a>  also am excited to hear that my colleague is working with neighboring communities and implementing and starting up these sorts of after school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3127.389s">I</a>  think that's a wonderful initiative.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3202.496s">Mr.</a>  President, I know that yesterday there was a community meeting for the Salem Street neighbors in the community at the Roberts and people that were there really got to share some of their <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3221.228s">I</a>  don't wanna use, you can use frustration would be a good word. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3226.351s">I</a>  think that I don't wanna beat a dead horse and I don't want to keep bringing this up, but I think we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3233.996s">I</a>  think that one thing that's been coming back and forth is that understanding the zoning when it comes to posting information and what is coming up in future meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3248.085s">And</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3249.757s">for</a>  a Councilor or zoning specialists, it's easy because it's in your pipeline and you are accustomed to the language and you can really understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3262.987s">But</a>  I asked a while back if we could, you really work with our consultant to try to find a way that we can, I don't wanna say, probably just a layman's terms, so people can understand the zoning <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3279.872s">and</a>  with better verbiage. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3284.115s">So</a>  it's not so complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3286.757s">I</a>  know that yesterday's frustration, as I talked to neighbors this morning, as I talked to neighbors last night, residents last night, I think the biggest concern is really the speed and the process where last night was impressive in the fact that at least they saw what was going on in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3306.939s">They</a>  got to touch things see things, and then they got to go to those boards and post what they wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3314.743s">And</a>  I think this is something again that I brought up for years now, and I can revert back to previous council. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3324.325s">When</a>  we looked into doing the RFP process, working with the RFP process is really as it was written back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3333.76s">And</a>  I think I showed the council that the minutes that those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3337.605s">that</a>  the RFP asked for the consultant that we were bringing in, the partners were bringing in to really have a detailed plan that would go into the neighborhood for communication and having the neighbors feel as part of the process and share the input as you get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3357.681s">Now,</a>  last night's efforts were great, but that's what we were talking about that we do at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3366.387s">and</a>  as we're moving forward the process I and believe me I understand what my council has been saying we've had over 20 some odd meetings and and and the word is we've tried to get the word out but unfortunately when we have the issues that have come about on Salem Street and the lack of what <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3387.355s">our</a>  residents feel like they're not being listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3390.436s">I</a>  think it's important that we listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3392.257s">And</a>  so I would make a motion that we would ask to, you know, I know that we halted the meeting for March, but I would actually ask to suspend that for another month and maybe go back to that court or go back to the Roberts <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3411.207s">bring</a>  meetings in and just reset the clock with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3414.909s">Not</a>  where it's coming in and people telling me how wrong it is or how bad this is, but just resetting and understanding and having that open process before we go to the next step and say, hey, this is more in depth and this is what we've been asking for, to really understand what we want in the corridor, as they should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3433.756s">I</a>  know some neighbors say it's not a corridor, it's in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3437.638s">I</a>  think it's important if we can do that because I, again, because as I follow it up, I don't see a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3444.202s">I</a>  don't think there is a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3445.462s">I</a>  know that we've been waiting a long time and I know that this council and people have worked really hard and I don't want to discredit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3452.746s">Please</a>  believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3453.807s">But</a>  I think, especially when we talk about the Salem Street Corridor, it seems like it's a lightning rod right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3459.99s">And</a>  it's created such a negative buzz that <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3464.092s">if</a>  there's a way that this council can lead in working with Ennis and working with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3470.475s">Hunt's</a>  office and try to find a more robust way to go back into that neighborhood and sit down and listen and post. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3479.759s">I</a>  think because that's what we did yesterday, a lot of people did feel comfortable with posting and seeing that, you know, they could put something on a board and understand what that's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3488.983s">So</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3490.984s">Resetting</a>  that giving a little bit more time I think it'll be, it will be so important for healing, and it'll be very important to moving forward in this community as we go through this process because I <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3504.263s">This</a>  isn't a meeting to say I told you so. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3506.124s">I</a>  don't want to say that but I just think that it's important that we listen because this hasn't been touched in many, many years and we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3514.628s">And</a>  there was comment yesterday that was made by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3516.989s">Hunt</a>  that she said that during this meeting she thought that everybody was there that was against zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3522.871s">And</a>  the truth of the matter is the people that I've talked to, they weren't against zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3527.003s">they</a>  were against the process of the zoning hearings and how it's gone through and how they feel like they weren't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3534.456s">Because</a>  something simple, and you were there, Council President, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3538.589s">the</a>  simple piece of the biggest, one of the biggest fear we heard was that the methanol clinics and trying to avoid putting medical buildings in that corridor to avoid the concerns that neighborhood had. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3550.934s">And</a>  that's something we can revisit if it was started from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3554.555s">And</a>  it wasn't, you know, there were some people that were upset that, you know, the size of the buildings, but I think the messaging was a lot clearer that people understand where, what's gonna go where and where, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3567.195s">some</a>  stories going to go six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3568.856s">There</a>  was clarification on some map changes that we saw that really clarified and help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3574.357s">But</a>  I think that if we could, if we can, if there's one thing that I would ask as form of motion is if we can see if we can just delay the process and hold a <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3592.208s">a</a>  meeting at the Roberts with the neighbors that would be a listening session and more of a partnership to see what do the neighbors want, not a negative or antagonistic battle with their side, our side, but sit there and present it the way that, and has presented it in the sense that allowed the people to get up <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3619.171s">talk</a>  to people in person to sit there and tangible and put a sticky on the on the note on the board and say, this is what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3626.913s">So</a>  I think it's important because I think that no matter how much work and people have done a lot of work I'm not going to, I'm not going to deny that that there are a lot of people doing a lot of work and spend a lot of time <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3639.306s">But</a>  I think that it's important that we understand as a council that the residents don't feel like they're being listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3647.609s">And</a>  it's not meant to be a disrespectful comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3653.771s">It's</a>  really made to enlighten us to say, hey, nothing's happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3658.913s">We</a>  don't have to rush for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3660.113s">Let's</a>  reset this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3661.333s">Let's</a>  go into that corridor and let's become partners with the neighbors of Salem Street <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3666.863s">and</a>  put everything on the table and understand as we move forward, there was nothing that we pushed through or you leave all the negativity behind and say, we did this the way we should have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3678.226s">And</a>  I think it's important because I, again, I've done that and I've talked to a lot of professionals that have talked about this process and other communities as professionals, whether they're zoning consultants, attorneys, or worked for different municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3696.015s">this</a>  is the difference with what we've done so far and where the gaps are and where the cries are from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3703.319s">So</a>  again, I appreciate the time to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3706.001s">I</a>  know that in totality, I think that's probably the biggest thing that I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3710.844s">I</a>  know that last night's meeting kind of answered some things, but I think the two biggest things that if we can come out of it is if there's a way that we could possibly work with our consultants to try to find <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3726.935s">a</a>  way to simplify. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3728.98s">what</a>  those changes are and what we're really doing in those corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3732.882s">So</a>  it's not these maps that are real tiny so people can understand them a little bit better and just bullets where I hate to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3741.625s">Someone</a>  said to me, yes, this is Georgia. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3743.826s">I'm</a>  78 years old, and I just don't understand all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3747.088s">This</a>  is so confusing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3748.608s">What</a>  does this mean for my house and my future here in Metroton? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3753.13s">I</a>  couldn't answer them because it's specific to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3758.072s">between</a>  that and the speed of the process, and maybe asking to do a little bit more teamwork with the neighbors, I think would go a long way for both this council and our vision together. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3770.117s">Because</a>  again, it's not that people in the room were against everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3775.879s">They</a>  weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3776.619s">It</a>  was the pace and not understanding the fear, I think, that was something we need to correct if we could.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3784.423s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3786.18s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3786.681s">I</a>  just want to give my perspective on the meeting last night and talk about procedurally the ideas that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3795.418s">But</a>  I just wanted to say that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3798.157s">It's</a>  a pretty general truism that when government does something right. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3803.121s">Nobody</a>  complains, nobody talks about it and nobody gets any credit for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3807.143s">And</a>  when government does something wrong, you have a lot of conversations about how it could have been better and how to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3812.267s">And</a>  I think that's been my experience of <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3816.75s">this</a>  larger project so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3818.932s">This</a>  is the fourth major change that we've done as part of the project, but it's the first one where we had residents so clearly and vociferously frustrated by elements of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3831.081s">And</a>  I think that we have done significant work to try to respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3835.304s">And</a>  last night's meeting was a part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3837.405s">I'm</a>  going to leave it to Councilor Collins to talk about some of the other work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3841.508s">I</a>  think very much along the lines of what you just mentioned Councilor Scarpelli around bullet points and breaking this down and getting nuggets out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3848.153s">I</a>  know Councilor Collins has more on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3851.435s">We</a>  were there till about 10 last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3855.26s">you</a>  know, most folks had left at that point, but the, I know, you know, Councilor Scarpelli, Rep Donato and about maybe half to three quarters of the crowd had something they needed to do other than talk about zoning for three and a half hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3869.476s">But</a>  we did manage to answer every question of everyone who stuck around. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3874.581s">And</a>  I think, you know, certainly there are people who walked in with opinions and feelings who left with the same opinions and feelings about the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3882.085s">But</a>  I think we also did do some significant work as Councilor Scarpelli noted to break down the information, provide a little bit more of a visual guide for folks who had concerns, address some of the statements and comments that had been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3895.512s">I</a>  know one of the big ones was around, oh, 15 stories and some, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3900.495s">there's</a>  going to be these loopholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3903.877s">And</a>  we actually really were able to dive down directly with a couple of folks who had really been concerned about that and show them that actually the thing that they're worried about is the zoning we have now and not the zoning that's being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3916.364s">And</a>  that was really reassuring, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3918.945s">Maybe</a>  not on the totality of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3920.506s">I'm</a>  not saying those people agree that this new proposal is the best thing in the world now. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3925.549s">But</a>  on that specific issue, we were really able to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3929.525s">It</a>  was, I think, a productive evening for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3934.148s">I've</a>  received a bunch of communications today thanking the Council and the Planning Department and Innes Associates for their work to put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3946.216s">And</a>  I think just moving to the procedural perspective, we've continued the public hearing to March 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3953.942s">If</a>  we don't have the recommendations from the Community Development Board, which is meeting the week before at March 5th, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3959.285s">I</a>  certainly would support again, a continuance of the meeting further but that's how we would, we can't make a motion now to continue a public hearing that we just voted to continue to another date. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3970.029s">So,</a>  if we want to make a motion to further push that meeting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3975.09s">We</a>  would do that when we reopen the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3978.511s">And</a>  I just also. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3981.133s">Personally</a>  want to note that I think a lot of residents we were very clear with residents last night who are highly involved and engaged about the process going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3991.099s">And</a>  personally, I would like to let the planning department, and as associates take all the comments and notes and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4001.566s">that</a>  were raised by residents last night, but also at prior meetings via email, via the input submission process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4009.409s">There</a>  were also some residents who were waiting on some questions to be answered, because I think that's going to inform the set of recommendations they make to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4017.693s">And</a>  we really did say to folks last night, the next opportunity to engage on this is Community Development Board on March 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4026.405s">If</a>  the recommendations that associates proposes and planning development, sustainability propose address a lot of these concerns about uses that we're talking about, medical uses, short-term housing uses, some of the questions that people had and that the community development board feels comfortable making its recommendations to the council at the March 5th meeting, then we could consider that on March 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4051.186s">And</a>  if we feel <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4052.693s">that</a>  we should extend as Councilor Scarpelli noted, I think that would be the time to make that call. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4059.379s">But</a>  of course, if the Community Development Board continues for another after March 5th and we don't have recommendations from them, I think we would continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4067.086s">So</a>  I'm trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4069.708s">speak</a>  to what you're saying Councilor Scarpelli in terms of the intent I agree with you if there's still a lot of if we have certainly if we don't have recommendations and community development board feels they need more time to spend on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4080.959s">But</a>  I think we should continue further down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4085.203s">And,</a>  but I just want to be procedurally of note to say <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4089.41s">We</a>  told a lot of people last night how things were going to go, and I don't want to change that up on them personally right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4094.933s">I</a>  think we can make that decision when we get to the decision point in March. <a

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4103.528s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4105.849s">I</a>  also want to yeah, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing up this topic, we talked about this so often in the planning and permitting committee and I think it's really good to have the chance to talk about this to a wider audience in a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4117.497s">Also</a>  want to thank President Bears for facilitating at the Salem Street quarter q amp a last night and to all the elected to attended and especially to city staff and associates for <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4129.504s">staying</a>  quite late to make sure that everybody's questions were answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4135.73s">Truly,</a>  truly appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4139.855s">So</a>  we have, like I said, I'm really glad that we're talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4143.736s">I</a>  appreciate President Bears' framing that this is, you know, by no means the first topic in the zoning, the citywide zoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4153.058s">And</a>  I think as we've been going along, we've been learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4155.178s">I,</a>  well, just to speak for myself, I have been learning a lot, not only about the zoning, I have learned so much about zoning through getting, through being required to get really, really into the weeds on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4166.58s">But</a>  it has also been really critical to note what questions people have about what we started with phase one, we moved on to Mystic Ave corridor district, we moved on to Green Score. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4177.765s">Green</a>  Score is kind of now closest to finalization of the topics that haven't yet been ordained. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4184.347s">And</a>  Salem Street, its next procedural step is the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4186.989s">And</a>  with each of these proposals, we learn more about what is interesting to people, what is confusing to people, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4195.632s">Do</a>  we hear from not very many residents about what do we hear from a lot of residents about. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4201.515s">And</a>  that gives us what I think is incredibly crucial and valuable information about how we need to be responding to those questions in our public facing communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4214.381s">And</a>  we have been trying to really, you know, just sprint as fast as we can being responsive to that, while we are continuing this process of reviewing the whole zoning citywide, I really do think it is important that we <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4230.538s">you</a>  know, stay true to our promise to review zoning comprehensively this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4238.421s">That's</a>  not like kind of getting into any timeline specifics, but just I do think it's incredibly vital to do that as a package because with zoning, if we were to end up with kind of a incomplete overhaul, having touched some quarters, but not others, some neighborhoods, but not others, some topics, but not others, that would create a really chaotic <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4261.329s">legal</a>  landscape for developers for residents for city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4266.153s">That's</a>  just, I don't think that we run the risk of getting into that kind of situation but that is that is kind of an overarching goal guiding this process that we have to make sure that at the end of this project, the zoning, quote unquote, agrees with itself so that we avoid any <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4281.106s">legal</a>  chaos that could come from having tables of uses that don't line up or neighborhood uses that are not compatible with other neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4288.628s">Right</a>  now, we have no intention of singling out any neighborhood and we have to make sure that we proceed at a pace that allows us to stay true to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4298.111s">Anyway,</a>  back to the stuff that I honestly really love talking about.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4301.152s">Vice</a>  President Collins, just one other note. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4304.012s">We</a>  did accept a proposal and that proposal has a time frame on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4309.994s">You</a>  know, we've had the timeline that we've been on since last spring because the proposal is essentially to complete the introduction of major changes by the end of June and the cleanup by September, and that's based on the proposal that the council and city accepted for this project.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4324.702s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4325.182s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4325.883s">No,</a>  I appreciate you noting that of course we are associates is not an employee of the city, so we have to use them while they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4337.233s">I</a>  think on that point, it's also important to note that our zoning consultant has already, I would say, just speaking only for myself here, quite magnanimously gone beyond the scope of what we are paying them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4347.978s">I</a>  think that this work is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4351.379s">I</a>  think it's really valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4353.14s">We're</a>  gonna work with them to make sure that we can continue layering more public feedback, public participation, additional opportunities for public participation beyond all of our existing public committee and public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4365.805s">meetings</a>  that are baked into this process as a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4368.507s">I'm</a>  really grateful to them for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4369.967s">We</a>  want to make sure that they continue to have capacity to do public Q and A's for every zoning topic, not just Salem Street going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4377.851s">We've</a>  been working with them so that they can, for all zoning topics going forward, in addition to some other comm stuff that I'll talk about in just a minute, put out really short bite-sized, like two-minute explainer videos for each zoning topic, which I think will be really, really useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4395.12s">Because</a>  reading about zoning is incredibly dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4397.843s">So</a>  things like that I think will add a lot to the process for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4402.81s">But</a>  at the end of the day, we are still working with a consultant under the constraints of a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4410.419s">And</a>  that is a real constraint. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4415.627s">So</a>  we've talked about this a little bit in the planning and permitting committee, but I thought it was just really salient what the Councilor said about residents noting, you know, that we need to, we need really, residents need help in simplifying what changes are proposed, what is proposed to change in the corridors and the neighborhoods that we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4434.171s">You</a>  mentioned bullet points, you know, my ears pricked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4438.532s">When</a>  I heard that because so much of what I've been working on, you know, quite intensively for the past few weeks at this point is really at the same time as we're comprehensively reviewing the city zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4449.577s">I</a>  personally have been comprehensively overhauling the city zoning website. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4456.1s">And</a>  the thing is, we really need we really need bullet points we really need diagrams. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4463.731s">for</a>  myself as an individual reading a zoning proposal alone, I do not come away with it with a deep enough understanding of the zoning proposal that I can easily explain it to another person in a way that they can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4479.48s">and</a>  residents do not have the time and the responsibility that Councilors do to do that kind of deep dive. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4485.344s">So</a>  I met with the mayor's communications director and communications associate actually just earlier this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4495.75s">We</a>  are getting really close on an overhauled version of the zoning webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4500.152s">And</a>  that is really built around having simplified summaries and bullet points for every single zoning proposal, the ones that are currently going on, the ones that have already been adopted so that it is completely unmissable for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4513.056s">What</a>  is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4514.817s">What</a>  are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4515.877s">Explain</a>  it to me like I'm in fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4518.218s">When</a>  is the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4519.798s">What</a>  topic comes after this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4521.879s">What</a>  does the zoning currently say? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4523.379s">What</a>  can I do by right? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4524.5s">What</a>  does by right mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4526.46s">Under</a>  the proposed zoning, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4528.841s">what</a>  would change, what would be doable by right under that new scenario, what would be different, answering frequently asked questions, including diagrams, because I think those are totally essential for understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4541.386s">There's</a>  a lot of things that really don't come across in text, even when the text is simplified. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4546.687s">We</a>  will add those short explainer videos when they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4549.849s">I</a>  just think it's really important that we are trying to optimize every communication strategy <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4556.991s">that</a>  we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4559.153s">I</a>  think that adding in a public Q and A for each topic is such a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4562.935s">And</a>  I really want to extend my thanks to Councilor Scarpelli for beating that drum for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4567.619s">And</a>  I'm really glad that that's going to be a part of every zoning topic going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4571.481s">In</a>  addition, the short form explainer videos, in addition, a city websites that people have a spot that they can go to, which I really don't think they had before, where they can just get oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4582.489s">What</a>  is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4583.63s">When</a>  are they going to talk about it next? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4585.791s">just</a>  give me a version of this that I can digest and I can understand it well enough that I can ask a question and let people know where they can go to ask a question who to email for reliable information and when the next public meeting is so that you and your neighbors can attend and get your get your questions answered and real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4607.897s">So</a>  I am really excited for us to be onboarding all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4611.998s">And,</a>  you know, that's our responsibility to make sure that residents, it's our responsibility to pass here. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4622.081s">First</a>  and foremost, I believe that it is our responsibility to update Medford zoning because residents have been asking us to do that for a very, very, very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4630.424s">And</a>  I know that there are a lot of Metro residents and business owners and local developers <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4636.686s">who</a>  have been very, very frustrated for a very, very long time, seeing neighborhoods not reflect the character that residents would like them to, seeing squares and areas with a lot of great commercial potential not reach their full potential, because we have not undertaken this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4656.664s">We</a>  owe them <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4658.285s">thoughtful</a>  zoning, reasonable zoning, better zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4661.967s">And</a>  I feel really, really committed to delivering on that goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4664.629s">And</a>  at the same time, we also owe residents good, reliable information that residents can understand without becoming zoning experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4673.634s">And</a>  that has been my focus for the past month in collaboration with my fellow councilors and with city staff and with Innes Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4681.459s">I</a>  am really glad that last night's Q&A answered so many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4686.001s">We're</a>  going to continue doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4688.482s">All</a>  of our public meetings, the planning and permitting meetings, the CDB public hearings, the City Council regular meetings are always public and always forums where residents can ask questions and get their questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4701.845s">We're</a>  going to continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4703.186s">We're</a>  going to continue to use <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4705.026s">all</a>  of the communications channels that are available to us as city councilors and in collaboration with the mayor's office to do our very best at making sure that people know about this topic that is interesting to and relevant to so many residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4719.289s">And</a>  at the same time, you know, myself and all of the councilors also have a responsibility to understand the zoning as best as we can so that we can answer questions and dispel concerns and make sure that we are sources of reliable information to residents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4737.075s">I</a>  truly could talk about this for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4738.816s">I've</a>  been spending a lot of working hours on it in the past few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4742.519s">And</a>  I think the bottom line for me is this project is pretty unprecedented. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4748.704s">So</a>  our communication strategy around it is going to be unprecedented as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4753.308s">I</a>  am so glad that truly all of us here behind this rail have been insisting on the communications process getting better as we go along. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4762.002s">And</a>  I'm committed to making sure that as we go topic by topic, we just continue to do the best job as we can and onboard as many new tools as we have to, so that people know what's going on, know who to ask, know when to ask, know when the meetings are, and that this can be as inclusive of a project as it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4783.19s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4785.991s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4786.951s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4788.492s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4789.912s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4792.402s">I</a>  reiterate what residents have said, they understand that they're all in, they understand that we need some changes, things haven't been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4800.885s">I</a>  think that's a common cry, you hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4804.906s">But</a>  I think that again, I appreciate the effort, but again, I think the biggest piece that we're missing is truly listening to what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4813.649s">Our</a>  residents using Salem Street an example, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4819.324s">because</a>  this is the area that we're working on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4822.925s">That's</a>  the hotbed that they want to be part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4826.946s">They</a>  want to go into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4829.106s">They</a>  want to do what we were forced to do last night, but come back full circle and do it the correct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4835.648s">To</a>  say that, you know, I know that Councilor Collins said that it's breaking a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4842.17s">No,</a>  it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4843.911s">It</a>  is not that the consultants work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4846.956s">They've</a>  already changed the timeline for four other different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4851.464s">So</a>  that's not a true statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4855.47s">If</a>  there was legalities in that, then we should ask for a change order in that contract because it will be easily done if we truly want to fulfill what the residents are asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4869.999s">And</a>  I think it's very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4871.84s">I</a>  have a motion in place and I hope my council support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4876.623s">that</a>  we delayed the process of the Salem Street zoning until we hold neighborhood partner involved meetings with our partners in Ennis and our development board <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4890.888s">and</a>  working together to move that corridor forward in a positive light. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4895.792s">I</a>  appreciate that we're now finally moving into more streamlined, more transparent and understandable process so people understand zoning as a fifth grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4906.26s">But</a>  I think it's important that we're missing the biggest piece here. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4912.488s">We</a>  need to go into these communities, we need to go into these corridors, we need to go into that community and have them feel like they're part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4921.955s">Even</a>  though the questions were answered, there's still a lot of animosity and there's still a lot of confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4928.475s">And</a>  there's a lot of great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4930.256s">I'm</a>  sure that all of you have talked to some very, very brilliant people, as I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4934.68s">I've</a>  talked with people that are in the field that have worked at the highest universities in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4944.888s">And</a>  they've worked on huge projects and small projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4949.131s">And</a>  they live in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4951.313s">And</a>  they've shared some great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4952.934s">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4954.496s">Those</a>  are the people that live in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4957.077s">And</a>  I think that it would be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4960.157s">So</a>  I would make the motion that we ask for the delay, we go through the process correctly, and we ask to bring a meeting to work together with the residents of each quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4972.78s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4974.28s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4974.52s">So</a>  there's a B paper from Councilor Scarapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4977.681s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4979.221s">I'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins and then I'll read the B paper.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4985.955s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4986.335s">I</a>  appreciate that perspective, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4991.477s">Totally</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4992.177s">There's</a>  so many residents who have, who've had, I mean, I've been just over and over shocked by how insightful and thoughtful a lot of the questions that we've had on the zoning proposals have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5003.342s">I</a>  understand from last night, there were several suggestions and questions that city staff indicated that they, just one suggestion to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5013.988s">table</a>  of incentive zoning uses comes to mind that city staff is like, wow, great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5019.329s">Yeah,</a>  let's make sure to make a note of that so we can recommend an amendment around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5026.111s">I</a>  hear you, that going into the neighborhoods is an important part of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5030.992s">I</a>  just have to disagree with the characterization that folks are not being listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5039.735s">I</a>  really implore any resident <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5042.402s">who</a>  is interested in this process to come to all of our public meetings, the Planning and Permanent Committee meeting, they're always public, they're always hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5052.969s">The</a>  Community Development Board public hearings are always public, there's always public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5059.793s">Some</a>  modes of involvement are accessible for some people, some are accessible for other types of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5066.698s">We</a>  are working hard to make sure that the folks who <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5069.92s">are</a>  never going to go to a public meeting are still going to well, I should say, we don't even have to work hard to make sure that people who are have no interest in public meetings can be heard, because people email us all the time with their questions and their asks for clarification and their comments on the zoning and all of those are reviewed by Councilors and by city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5095.253s">The</a>  in-person meetings, we are always collecting, notating, taking down resident feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5101.878s">There's</a>  countless times that that has been incorporated, whether it was feedback that was received at a CDB public hearing or at a planning and permitting meeting or at the Q&As, which we're piloting as of last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5116.79s">For</a>  folks who do not yet feel like they've had a chance to have their questions asked or their suggestions heard, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5124.774s">on</a>  any zoning proposals that are currently in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5127.796s">I</a>  would urge you to get in touch with any Councilor to get in touch with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5133.3s">We</a>  will make sure that the relevant committee hears your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5140.404s">That</a>  has always been a part of this process that will continue to be a part of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5147.908s">And</a>  I just want to clarify on our collaboration with our zoning consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5153.329s">I</a>  don't want there to be any confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5154.729s">The</a>  city council runs no risk of some sort of legal ramification from straying outside the bounds of its contract within associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5163.491s">It</a>  is just that we run the risk of running out of their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5167.192s">They</a>  are not a city employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5170.193s">We</a>  put out an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5172.455s">I</a>  work as a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5173.615s">That</a>  is my day job. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5174.676s">I</a>  respond to RFPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5177.216s">A</a>  consultant responds to an RFP with a proposal, and then a contract is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5183.338s">We</a>  run the risk of running out of their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5187.319s">And</a>  it is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5189.54s">I</a>  don't want anybody to come away with the impression that it is not really important that we fulfill our task of reviewing all of our zoning citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5200.865s">because</a>  to fail to follow through on that would cause problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5205.947s">It</a>  would cause problems for city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5207.848s">It</a>  would cause problems for local developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5209.569s">It</a>  would cause problems for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5212.89s">This</a>  process has always been involving of resident input. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5217.012s">We</a>  are going to continue to do a better job each and every week of making sure that people know about these processes so that they can ask their questions and give their suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5228.962s">And</a>  like President Beer said, if we don't have CDB recommendations on the Salem Street proposal on March 5, absolutely I don't think we should vote on it on March 11, I will, I will, I will support a motion to continue that public hearing if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5242.987s">But</a>  I think it's really clear in keeping with all of this, that we make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5247.428s">very</a>  clear and consistent for people what their next opportunity is. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5250.714s">We</a>  told a lot of people last night the next opportunity is CDB on March 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5255.221s">Let's</a>  stick with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5256.663s">If</a>  CDB needs more time, they need more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5259.728s">That's</a>  fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5260.809s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5263.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5263.573s">We</a>  have a motion, a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli to delay the Salem Street neighborhood quarter district zoning until more neighborhood meetings are held. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5273.776s">Is</a>  that an accurate summary? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5276.257s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5287.421s">Hearing</a>  no second, the B paper is not <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5291.71s">The</a>  B paper fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5293.391s">On</a>  the A paper by Councilor Scarpelli, which was read out earlier, is there a motion on the A paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5302.395s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5304.776s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5306.477s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan, we'll move to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5312.3s">If</a>  you'd like to speak on the paper, please raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5318.722s">seeing</a>  one on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5323.184s">Two</a>  on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5323.885s">We'll</a>  start with Cheryl. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5325.785s">Cheryl,</a>  name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5327.186s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5329.247s">Hi,</a>  my name is Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5330.908s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street, and I have a different impression of the meeting last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5336.831s">As</a>  with all of the meetings that have been held about the Salem Street Corridor, they're very vague PowerPoint presentations that don't inform about the zoning in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5346.56s">What</a>  happened last night was that neighbors had educated neighbors, neighbors had notified other neighbors that a meeting was happening and neighbors came in with the knowledge of the zoning and their questions were about the zoning and they were asking the consultant these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5364.153s">I</a>  don't feel that you have done enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5365.994s">If</a>  you do a public hearing and you're rezoning an entire neighborhood and you're in a room alone and every single person in that room is getting paid, then the neighborhood did not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5376.459s">This</a>  was not done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5378.96s">It</a>  should be gone back and gone over the right way with proper processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5384.583s">And</a>  having a Q&A last night and basically <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5387.727s">not</a>  going to take that on board what the neighbors have told you is insincere. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5394.03s">People</a>  were there and they were knowledgeable about the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5398.333s">And</a>  that is not the result of Innis. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5400.674s">That</a>  is not the result of any of these public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5403.455s">That</a>  is the result of them going into the zoning <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5407.013s">and</a>  learning it from each other and for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5410.634s">And</a>  I think that needs to be acknowledged and it shouldn't have to happen that neighbors citywide have to teach each other the zoning in order to know what is coming to their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5421.918s">These</a>  PowerPoints that just show blocks stacked on top of each other that say how high buildings are or show what the neighborhood looks like that we've already seen is not education on what is in your zoning proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5437.259s">Please</a>  consider that we live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5439.84s">We</a>  will have to live with these ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5443.041s">We</a>  will have to live with the streets being less safe, with the traffic being heavier. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5449.163s">We</a>  are a neighborhood and we should matter too. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5453.525s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5456.386s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5456.906s">We'll</a>  go to Zachary. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5462.928s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5464.609s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5466.849s">Zachary</a>  Chartok, 5 Allmont Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5469.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and Vice President Collins for the floor and for your time tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5476.413s">I</a>  want to echo some of the issues with the public engagement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5480.095s">I've</a>  worked on and with similar proposals in other cities in the state and other parts of the country and actually in other countries as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5488.038s">Typically</a>  you have public engagement meetings from concept through to design and through every stage of proposal, having been in the neighborhood long enough to be signed up for every aspect of public outreach and engagement that the city does to signify when it's holding meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5503.604s">I</a>  can categorically tell you nobody in the building of eight units that I represent and manage received any outrage, paper, hard copy, email, phone, or otherwise as to any of the meetings, even leading up to last night's. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5516.609s">They</a>  were notified by me of the meeting last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5519.99s">And</a>  while I respect what Vice President Collins is talking about in terms of procedural changes, efforts made to codify information in a simpler manner, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5529.413s">that</a>  doing it now is a bit too little too late towards the end of the process for the Salem Street rezoning effort, to the point that it just does not satisfy the lack of public engagement and outreach that has been done so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5540.896s">So</a>  while I appreciate that it'll suffice for correction from this experience moving forward for other processes, it just simply does not satisfy this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5549.619s">So</a>  getting back to the proposal that Councilman Scarpelli raised to the floor, I would urge the council to reconsider, even if it means opening another vote on a different codified issue at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5561.566s">Further</a>  extensions are tabling and potentially revisiting the contract with the consultant who has also worked on similar proposals and echoed similar concerns through conversation about procedure and outreach and engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5576.395s">that</a>  this does need to go back for better engagement for the purposes of equity and inclusion of the neighborhood with the city efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5584.7s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5587.681s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5589.803s">I'll</a>  go to Rich on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5594.265s">Rich,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5596.646s">You'll</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5601.292s">Rich</a>  Lavoie, 128 Sheridan Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5603.834s">And</a>  I'd just like to ask that you strongly consider the proposal that Councilor Scapelli has put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5611.42s">Quite</a>  frankly, as you mentioned, this process you're hoping is going to get better as you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5618.905s">And</a>  I don't wanna be your first pancake. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5623.629s">I</a>  don't wanna be the one that gets burned. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5626.691s">So</a>  please, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5628.075s">If</a>  we need to stop, if we need to pause, if we need to give the neighborhood of Salem Street a little more time to be engaged and to understand, knowing that this is the first residential neighborhood that is going through this, then I strongly encourage you all to please give us that consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5652.307s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5654.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5658.49s">On</a>  the A paper, on the motion receiving place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5661.131s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5662.672s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5663.113s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5663.913s">I</a>  just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5665.714s">Apologies</a>  for having to leave early last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5668.275s">McCormick</a>  Avenue was referred to committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5670.737s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5672.958s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5673.438s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5676.319s">Huh?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5678.961s">Was</a>  it McCormick Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5683.263s">Just</a>  on those two parcels? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5690.913s">So</a>  you're saying if I leave it all, everyone turns? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5699.219s">You</a>  did a podcast of some kind? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5701.48s">The</a>  McCormick Ave Beats? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5704.462s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5705.143s">Well,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5705.843s">Thanks</a>  for answering my question with more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5712.007s">Is</a>  there anything else anyone wants to take up from Unfinished Business? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5716.312s">Do</a>  you want to clear out any unfinished business that's been sitting for a while? <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5720.155s">We</a>  do have a little extra time tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5726.959s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>
