1

[SPEAKER_12]: Third regular meeting, Medford City Council, February 11, 2025, is called to order.

2
00:03:58,634 --> 00:03:59,696

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:07,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

10
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:10,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

11
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So President Adkins, please rise and salute the flag.

12
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.

13
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:35,430
[SPEAKER_12]: 25022 offered by Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Tseng, and President Bears.

14
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council acknowledge and celebrate Black History Month.

15
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lazzaro.

16
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

17
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:46,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Black History Month to everybody.

18
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:55,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to read a couple of segments of some emails that I received this month honoring Black History Month.

19
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:10,432
[SPEAKER_05]: These were both emails that were sent to me by influential black women, and I thought they were the most appropriate things to read to celebrate Black History Month.

20
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:17,880
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is by Andrea Campbell, Massachusetts' first black woman to be elected to a statewide office, our current Attorney General.

21
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:26,089
[SPEAKER_05]: quote, Massachusetts is home to the movements that pushed this country to live up to its promises of freedom and equality for all of its citizens.

22
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:35,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Frederick Douglass started the abolition movement here in Massachusetts, and let's not forget Dr. King and Coretta Scott met as college students in Boston.

23
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,658
[SPEAKER_05]: While the work is far from over, I'm proud of the progress we've made.

24
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:43,602
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now up to us to fight to defend and advance the wins of our civil rights heroes.

25
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:52,405
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing I'd like to read is from an email sent out by Frances Nwaje, Medford's very own Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

26
00:05:52,945 --> 00:06:01,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Frances sends out emails to city employees about various events and days of celebration, giving great history and background, and they're always a really great read.

27
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:11,678
[SPEAKER_05]: She says the National Observance of Black History Month is itself a fairly recent reality in the United States, and it was not immediately met with widespread reception.

28
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:19,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Its history begins with famous historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1926.

29
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:23,611
[SPEAKER_05]: In honor of the birthdays of Frederick Douglass on February 14th,

30
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:34,192
[SPEAKER_05]: and President Abraham Lincoln on February 12th, two of the most important people for black American history, Woodson proclaimed the second week of February to be observed as Negro History Week.

31
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:43,019
[SPEAKER_05]: The main focus of this observance was to encourage the teaching of black American history in educational institutes, particularly at the primary level.

32
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:51,806
[SPEAKER_05]: The overall reception was lukewarm, but the departments of education of Delaware, North Carolina and West Virginia were very cooperative and Woodson considered it a success.

33
00:06:52,738 --> 00:07:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: After this, the idea for Black History Month was promoted by black students and educators at Kent State University in February, 1969, followed by the first celebration of Black History Month on campus and local surroundings one year later.

34
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:11,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Six years later, Black History Month was being widely celebrated across the country, not only in schools, colleges, and community centers.

35
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,273
[SPEAKER_05]: In 1976, in conjunction with the U.S.

36
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Bicentennial, President Gerald Ford praised Black History Month, urging all citizens to seize the opportunity to honor the too often neglected,

37
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:26,021
[SPEAKER_05]: accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.

38
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:31,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank Frances for sharing some information with city employees and for all her work.

39
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:39,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to acknowledge the valuable work of her department and similar departments across Medford and encourage them to continue their work.

40
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really grateful for that.

41
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:52,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Black History Month hasn't really even been around for that long, so it's just important that we continue to celebrate it, and I'm glad to be a part of that and a part of that for Medford.

42
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:53,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

43
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:55,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

44
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:56,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Tseng.

45
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

46
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:05,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Black History in Medford goes back a long, long time to the founding of our city when

47
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:09,476
[SPEAKER_13]: very unfortunately, slaves were brought here to work in Medford.

48
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:18,707
[SPEAKER_13]: We see from at the Brooks Estate, we have Pomp's Wall, a wall that was created that was built by an enslaved man.

49
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:24,775
[SPEAKER_13]: We see that that black history reflected in the heroic work of Belinda Sutton.

50
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:51,869
[SPEAKER_13]: who successfully sued, took the initiative and sued for her rights to reparations and received those reparations, forming the first known legal case in North America when it came to freed slaves, getting reparations for their time as slaves, and setting a legal guideline, a baseline for the rights of freed slaves.

51
00:08:53,979 --> 00:09:07,830
[SPEAKER_13]: This history continues through the last few centuries, we have the our historical black community and West Bedford who form such a rich tapestry of our life here in Medford mass.

52
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:26,457
[SPEAKER_13]: the work of the West Medford Community Center and uplifting that community and bringing us all together and making sure that Black history isn't just something that we tokenize and something that we shove into a corner, but that Black history is something that we all celebrate and recognize.

53
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:36,101
[SPEAKER_13]: And on that note, I do also want to note that our city on February 17th, Monday, February 17th, 2025, that's President's Day, I believe,

54
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:45,935
[SPEAKER_13]: From 1030 to 1.30pm in these chambers, we will have a celebration for Black History Month focused on African Americans and labor.

55
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:51,283
[SPEAKER_13]: And that event is also in conjunction with the West Medford Community Center.

56
00:09:52,715 --> 00:10:17,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I also wanted to note, I think it's the elephant in the room, the attacks on diversity happening nationally and from the federal government in particular, trying to wipe away, erase, delete the idea of black history, the idea that of the histories and struggles of different ethnic groups in this country who all form what we all are,

57
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:19,906
[SPEAKER_13]: our story as Americans here.

58
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:36,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been glad to talk to neighbors about this, to hear from different elected officials across the city and different offices about our commitment to diversity, to equity, and to inclusion, particularly in our policymaking process.

59
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:41,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Considering racial equity in policymaking is something that's really complex.

60
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:53,198
[SPEAKER_13]: something that's really nuanced, something that doesn't always you know the the policy that is the best for racial equity doesn't always seem like it at first and the easy solutions aren't always the best solutions.

61
00:10:53,699 --> 00:11:01,763
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's incumbent upon all of us as elected officials as policymakers in the city to ask critically, what, what are

62
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:09,806
[SPEAKER_13]: our oppressed communities, our marginalized communities, our black communities, feeling, what are they seeing?

63
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,146
[SPEAKER_13]: What are they experiencing?

64
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:18,791
[SPEAKER_13]: And how can the policies we write and establish, the policies that we pass through the city council best address those needs?

65
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:24,814
[SPEAKER_13]: And that takes a lot of listening, and it takes a lot of criticism and critical thinking.

66
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:29,677
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to thank my fellow Councilors for co-sponsoring this resolution.

67
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

68
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further comments by members of the Council?

69
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:40,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, is there anyone from the public who'd like to speak on this resolution?

70
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:49,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, just as a co-sponsor, I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on the agenda.

71
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:59,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank the city for continuing to stand up for the values that we hold of diversity, equity, and inclusion and representing everyone here.

72
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:19,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank both of my fellow Councilors for lifting up voices of folks who are speaking out against what's happening right now and lifting up the nuance of what good policy work to address a history of racial injustice looks like in this country.

73
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:25,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, something we can all remember and it's important for us to remember is the

74
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:41,433
[SPEAKER_12]: radicalism of the civil rights leaders who ended 100 years of functionally slavery and oppression from the end of the Civil War through the 1960s.

75
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:55,000
[SPEAKER_12]: And we often hear sanitized and sparkled up quotes, but I think especially at this moment, a quote from Dr. King from his speech,

76
00:12:56,119 --> 00:13:01,366
[SPEAKER_12]: remaining awake for a great revolution speaks to this moment that we're in as a country.

77
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:06,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Let nobody give you the impression that the problem of racial injustice will work itself out.

78
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:10,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Let nobody give you the impression that only time will solve the problem.

79
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:14,113
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a myth and it is a myth because time is neutral.

80
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,475
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be used either constructively or destructively.

81
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:28,920
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm absolutely convinced that the people of ill will in our nation, the extreme rightists, the forces committed to negative ends have used time much more effectively than the people of goodwill.

82
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And sadly, I think we're seeing that right now.

83
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:35,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further discussion?

84
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none on the motion, Mr. Clerk,

85
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,319
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion, all those in favor?

86
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

87
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

88
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,422
[SPEAKER_12]: 25024 offered by Councilor Lazzaro, a resolution in remembrance of Dan Dill.

89
00:13:51,783 --> 00:14:04,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan Dill was a professor of chemistry at Boston University for 50 years, publishing 78 academic research papers with particular interest in, quote, making quantum aspects of the world accessible to general chemistry students, end quote.

90
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,368
[SPEAKER_12]: That quote is from his personal reflections on his career upon his retirement in 2023.

91
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:14,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Professor Dill was also an accomplished photographer, winning an award from Kodak in 2006.

92
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I encourage everyone to look at his website.

93
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:22,157
[SPEAKER_12]: His work is beautiful, www.dandillphotography.com.

94
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:29,822
[SPEAKER_12]: On December 4th, 2024, Professor Dill was walking his dog in a crosswalk across Mystic Valley Parkway near his home in West Medford.

95
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,424
[SPEAKER_12]: He was struck by a car and critically injured.

96
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Professor Dill passed away from his injuries on January 11th, 2025.

97
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:38,148
[SPEAKER_12]: His neighbors and friends,

98
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:53,014
[SPEAKER_12]: have banded together to lobby for changes to the traffic patterns and the greater traffic enforcement on that road, which is controlled by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.

99
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:55,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Apologies.

100
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:18,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it hereby resolved that the Bedford City Council share our deepest condolences of Professor Dill's family and loved ones, express our hope that this senseless tragedy will not be in vain and will not be repeated.

101
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:26,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it further resolved that the City Council work with DCR and our state delegation to make improvements to the crosswalk where Professor Dill was killed.

102
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Council is adjourned.

103
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:31,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

104
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:53,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Professor Dill was not somebody that I knew personally, but somebody who was frequently outside, frequently spent time in nature, spent a long time mentoring and

105
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,225
[SPEAKER_05]: nurturing his students at Boston University.

106
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:00,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Boston University.

107
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:08,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I also I went to Boston University as an undergrad and a graduate student, and I worked there as a professional.

108
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:15,354
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't know Dan, but I lived in his town and I live in his neighborhood.

109
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:20,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And he went out and walked his dog and he got hit by a car in a crosswalk.

110
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:49,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And because the road that he was walking on is managed not by the city of Medford, but by a state department, it's often very frustrating to try to make changes to the infrastructure.

111
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,986
[SPEAKER_05]: that would make it safer for people to walk there.

112
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:02,010
[SPEAKER_05]: To the point that it seems like nothing can be fixed.

113
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,493
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some things that you can do to roadways to make it safer for people to walk for pedestrians.

114
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:14,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make the crosswalks elevated.

115
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,256
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make speed humps.

116
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put flashing signs up.

117
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:26,690
[SPEAKER_05]: But since it's the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is basically parks and rec for the whole state.

118
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,093
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not like the highway administration.

119
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,294
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have that much money.

120
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:35,038
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it often feels like you can't do anything.

121
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:42,920
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a group of neighbors that have gathered together.

122
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:53,308
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an attachment in the packet of a letter that was written by this group of neighbors and signed by a large number of them who live in the neighborhood that Professor Dill lived in.

123
00:17:54,527 --> 00:18:07,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are asking for changes to be made to this rotary and that strip of road so that people won't drive so fast on it and it won't be so dangerous for people to walk their dogs.

124
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:21,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that one thing that we should pay attention to as a city council is what we can do as elected officials and what our mandate is as representatives of our neighbors.

125
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:27,384
[SPEAKER_05]: This happened, Dan was hit in December, he died in January.

126
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:33,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a week and a half ago, somebody else got hit in the rotary that's right outside this building and died.

127
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:41,097
[SPEAKER_05]: another man in his 70s who was walking across a crosswalk in a rotary.

128
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:53,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why people in Medford will be angry about all kinds of things.

129
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is life and death, and people are routinely getting hit by cars and dying.

130
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:04,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And

131
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:22,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand what could be more critical and more urgent than making a speed bump or a flashing sign and putting it up and making the road safer.

132
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:27,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Cars have become very safe for the people inside the cars.

133
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: They've become very dangerous for the people who are walking on sidewalks and crosswalks.

134
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:46,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share one piece of information, which is that our state delegation has been working with DCR, attempting to meet with DCR.

135
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,136
[SPEAKER_05]: They did meet today.

136
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Representative Garbally told me today that they met.

137
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,219
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't tell me what was discussed, but he said that they're making progress.

138
00:19:55,459 --> 00:20:02,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hopeful that that means that we can at least have an elevated crosswalk.

139
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that

140
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:14,107
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of requests, safety requests, speed warning signs for the crosswalk, rotary striping, speed enforcement by state police.

141
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also prefer to have a

142
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,985
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, committee meeting with the Medford Police Department and the state police.

143
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:43,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a state police barracks that's located in the Wellington neighborhood in Medford where I think we could, um, just have an open discussion about, like, how enforcement is carried out by the state police versus Medford police.

144
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:48,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't completely understand who is in charge of enforcement in which

145
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:50,534
[SPEAKER_05]: of the city.

146
00:20:51,814 --> 00:21:03,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I've learned a lot from talking to people who are activists and advocates for these kind of changes.

147
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:15,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And the roads that are Medford roads exclusively, that Medford's in charge of enforcement, that is Medford police.

148
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:17,789
[SPEAKER_05]: um, jurisdiction.

149
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it's a road that is a state road, it's the state police is in charge of it.

150
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:27,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just everything is somebody else's responsibility.

151
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:28,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very frustrating.

152
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's especially frustrating for family members and neighbors who are concerned, um, people who have lost somebody.

153
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:42,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and, um, I think we should all, um, be

154
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:47,338
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting as hard as we can to try to prevent this from happening.

155
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:58,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we talk about it, we say, somebody shouldn't have to die for things to change, but then people do die and they still don't change.

156
00:21:58,804 --> 00:22:00,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another person dies and they still don't change.

157
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's infuriating.

158
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:11,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all, thank you.

159
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Lazzaro.

160
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:16,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Kelly here.

161
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

162
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:24,834
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I really want to thank Councilor Lazzaro, of course, for bringing this forward and working with residents.

163
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to thank the residents.

164
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:29,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Their letter is incredibly well thought out.

165
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: The requests they have made are well thought out.

166
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,444
[SPEAKER_07]: They have gotten many, many, many signatures for people signing on to this.

167
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:43,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've done a lot of organizing work.

168
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:46,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, and I completely agree with Councilor Lazzaro that it is,

169
00:22:48,068 --> 00:23:04,914
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly frustrating that deaths, injuries, accidents continue to happen, and we do not have the ability to have the control that our residents would like us to have over these roads.

170
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:16,524
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, even just in the question of like whether signage is put up saying what the speed limit is the correct speed limit so you know even small things small requests go unanswered.

171
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:21,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to ask a little bit of a procedural question I hope it's okay.

172
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:26,471
[SPEAKER_07]: This is by no means to not say that this is an important topic but.

173
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:43,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it actually allowed for motions to be put in remembrances, and I'm only wondering because I think there may be people in the community who would want to know about this and might want to speak on this topic but they wouldn't look in remembrances for promotions that are happening.

174
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And my only suggestion, like I've been thinking about whether.

175
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:50,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be useful.

176
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:58,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's been an email thread with more data about the state roads and accidents happening there.

177
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:05,528
[SPEAKER_07]: There is data online that we can see about injuries, deaths, accidents happening on the state roads.

178
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:08,510
[SPEAKER_07]: That data is available to us online.

179
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:27,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if we might think about putting this either in a committee to then go to City Council, but having Todd Blake, who's our traffic guy or anyone else that that folks think is the appropriate person to talk to us about navigating

180
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:38,388
[SPEAKER_07]: our relationship with DCR and what we can maybe provide, is there anything that we can do to push DCR to take action more quickly?

181
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess there's, like, should we move this to committee?

182
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:45,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Can these motions be done in a remembrance?

183
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:47,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

184
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:58,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one other suggestion, which is wondering if city councilors can sign on to this letter, if that would be more impactful for us also to sign on to the letter to maybe send to our state delegation.

185
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:00,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

186
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:06,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I think just from a procedural perspective, if we wanted to

187
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:10,921
[SPEAKER_12]: divide the question between the two paragraphs and send the second paragraph to committee.

188
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:13,685
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be procedurally fine.

189
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:20,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also in conversation with the Bike Commission and hoping to engage members of WOC-Mentford

190
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:30,383
[SPEAKER_12]: to have folks down to talk about the updates to the citywide Bicycle plan and also the general road safety needs.

191
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:36,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Um And maybe even moving towards adopting a vision zero policy.

192
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:38,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's also the side of enforcement.

193
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,688
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if those should be one meeting or two meetings.

194
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:42,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Um

195
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:59,891
[SPEAKER_12]: or one really big meeting, but I think if we refer this, and my preference would be if we would refer that to Committee of the Whole, my hope would be, my hope in working with the Bicycle Commission and other advocates would be to have that in Committee of the Whole.

196
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:01,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

197
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:03,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

198
00:26:04,972 --> 00:26:06,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lazzaro, do you have anything?

199
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:12,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you amenable to turning the second paragraph of the resolution into a B paper and referring that to Committee of the Whole?

200
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:17,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

201
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:22,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that enforcement and roadway changes are two different things.

202
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:30,094
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think a larger conversation about traffic safety in Medford is definitely in order.

203
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:36,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think maybe if everybody came together in one conversation that wasn't

204
00:26:40,054 --> 00:26:40,715
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a great idea.

205
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:41,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that was.

206
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:49,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Accusatory or that just was everybody trying to come being on the same team trying to come together to solve the problem that everybody agrees.

207
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:51,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Is everyone's problem is.

208
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,449
[SPEAKER_05]: A great idea.

209
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:54,851
Thank

210
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:02,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

211
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Lazzaro for putting this forward.

212
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:19,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that Councilor Lazzaro and President Bears in particular, among other councilors, have been in very close contact with this neighborhood coalition that has been organizing in the wake of Professor Dill's untimely death.

213
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:21,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you to you for that work.

214
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:25,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you to the residents for organizing in the wake of this tragedy.

215
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:30,589
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to find words for something like this.

216
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the residents to know that we share in your grief, and it's just so hard to.

217
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:45,539
[SPEAKER_11]: As residents of the city, as residents of most cities, as representatives of any city, this is something that we have to fathom because it happens all of the time.

218
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,801
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's at all an exaggeration to say that roads in America are

219
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:51,927
[SPEAKER_11]: paved in tragedy.

220
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:58,909
[SPEAKER_11]: It has incredibly normalized the level of road violence that we all have to live with and grieve from.

221
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:19,956
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a representative, it fills me with just disbelief and fury that municipalities like ours are so hamstrung when it comes to the level of discretion and capacity and resources that we are allowed to have because of how funding is allocated from our federal and state partners.

222
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:30,604
[SPEAKER_11]: and how hamstrung we are and things that we have to bottom line as a city, leaving us so disempowered to do the type of improvements that residents have been begging us to do for years.

223
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:42,172
[SPEAKER_11]: We need substantial, radical road redesign on most roads in Medford if they are going to be livable for the people that walk on them and bike on them and roll on them and drive on them.

224
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:48,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it was possible for us to do that amid our other statutory responsibilities, I think we would have done that.

225
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,278
[SPEAKER_11]: going to say, 50 years ago.

226
00:28:53,259 --> 00:29:02,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And because we, for many reasons, could not, and for other reasons, would not, people continue to die.

227
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:11,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's with this perspective that we have to go forward and use the levers that we have at our disposal.

228
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:18,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really, really grateful to every resident who has been calling on us to meet with our delegation and with partners at DCR as often as possible to say,

229
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:22,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It is insane that this is normal.

230
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:31,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It is national gaslighting that people are supposed to just get over, people dying on roads.

231
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:41,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is another incredibly sad example of how governments are not given the tools to

232
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,806
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of compete with the pace of technological advancement.

233
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:54,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Cars are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and faster.

234
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:56,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Roads are not changing.

235
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:59,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Municipalities are not given more tools to address this problem.

236
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And people keep dying.

237
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know how to wrap it up.

238
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:11,181
[SPEAKER_11]: It just never should have happened.

239
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:14,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to keep working together until it stops happening.

240
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:18,123
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, thank you to the residents and to Professor Dill's family.

241
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:20,924
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very deep in sympathy for your loss.

242
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:27,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

243
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:31,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins said, you know, she doesn't know how to wrap it up.

244
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:32,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know where to start.

245
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:50,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I am going to be brief because I think my fellow Councilors have really articulated the frustration, the exasperation, the us asking over and over again for really basic things from the state government.

246
00:30:50,843 --> 00:31:12,980
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I mean I think this is a really really clear example of, you know, a field where we keep asking for improvements, even for basic things like additional signs, clear lighting, fixing lighting, you know, a lot of the things that are talked about in the letter that Councilors are mentioned, and yet, nothing, and I it's just, I

247
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:24,312
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we can all agree that safety is the bedrock of what the government should be doing like that's the reason we organize ourselves into a society and have a government right like.

248
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:42,310
[SPEAKER_13]: this level of inaction and as as Councilor Collins put it, the gaslighting that we've had to say that you know we should just accept things like this is just mind boggling and it's really nonsensical.

249
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:49,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I, when it comes to the policy I'll just leave it there because I think, you know,

250
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,284
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel very strongly about it, and I think that's been articulated.

251
00:31:53,304 --> 00:32:02,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I did also want to thank Councilor Lazzaro from a personal level, including the link to Professor Dill's photography.

252
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:11,639
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really touching to see the website and to see the really, really beautiful art that he was creating when he was with us here.

253
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:17,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and to lose that is such a loss.

254
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no words for it.

255
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,681
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really tough.

256
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:28,102
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sending my deepest condolences to Professor Dill to his family as well.

257
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:29,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Or to, yeah.

258
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:34,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

259
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:38,105
[SPEAKER_12]: On the B paper, which is the, oh.

260
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:40,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, on Zoom.

261
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:44,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I will go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

262
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:46,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record.

263
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:46,908
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

264
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Mister Cassidy?

265
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:13,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone here wants to talk?

266
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:14,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

267
00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:16,334
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll try to come back to you.

268
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:21,795
[SPEAKER_12]: If you would like to speak on this resolution, please come to the podium.

269
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

270
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my name is Allison Leach, and I live at 1522 Mystic Valley Parkway.

271
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:33,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am speaking on behalf of several neighbors today.

272
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:40,242
[SPEAKER_06]: My neighbors, Martha Andres, Vanessa Fox, Cecil Dorman, Justin Cole, and many others.

273
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:49,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bears, city council members, and especially Councilor Lazzaro for introducing the resolution and remembrance of my neighbor, Dr. Dan Dill.

274
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:53,678
[SPEAKER_06]: and thank you also for the opportunity to speak here today.

275
00:33:54,859 --> 00:34:01,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I live just down the street from the crosswalk where Dan and his dog, Blue, were hit by a car.

276
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,242
[SPEAKER_06]: That morning was like any other for them.

277
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:11,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They took a morning walk every day, and they crossed the street at the only crosswalk that we have on our stretch of road.

278
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:19,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had even trained his dog, Blue, to sit and look both ways before crossing the road.

279
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:30,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Tragically, on December 4th, Dr. Dan Dill and his dog were hit by a car, and on January 11th, Dan passed away from his injuries.

280
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, his dog Lou is expected to make a full recovery.

281
00:34:36,337 --> 00:34:42,263
[SPEAKER_06]: My neighbors and I were devastated to hear that Dan was hit and his dog were hit by a car.

282
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,285
[SPEAKER_06]: But sadly, we were not surprised.

283
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:48,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We witnessed every day cars speeding up and down that road.

284
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:55,397
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of us have had those calls ourselves with distracted drivers and cars just simply going too fast.

285
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:00,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan's death was a senseless and truly avoidable tragedy.

286
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:08,450
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe that simple and common sense traffic safety measures would make our road safer for our community.

287
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:23,743
[SPEAKER_06]: We drafted a letter that has been referenced here today, and thank you all for reading it, to Brian Arrigo, Commissioner of DCR on January 14th, that listed traffic safety improvements for Mystic Valley Parkway.

288
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:27,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And our letter received over 70 signatures from concerned neighbors.

289
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: That was with no formal organization, just word of mouth.

290
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:34,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of folks are really concerned about this issue.

291
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking forward to working with the council and with DCR to improve the safety of our roads for drivers, for cyclists, for pedestrians, and also for our four-legged friends.

292
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:53,662
[SPEAKER_06]: We are committed to ensuring that no other family suffers the same terrible loss that Dr. Dan Dill's family has endured.

293
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:54,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

294
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:56,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

295
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:07,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to try Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom again.

296
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:09,987
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

297
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:15,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, am I on now?

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,030

[SPEAKER_01]: Castagnetti, Cushman Street, East Medford, Mass.

301
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:24,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very saddened to hear about these two deaths.

302
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it was unavoidable.

303
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:32,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the city sends out a lot of reverse 911s, maybe to like,

304
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:56,212
[SPEAKER_01]: to like cover their mentality, they should send out a message to all the peoples saying, please use extreme common sense and look both ways and look all four ways, especially if you're walking a dog, because it's hard to get out of harm's way when you have an animal with you.

305
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:00,495
[SPEAKER_01]: All I can say is it's unnecessary.

306
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:01,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It should not happen.

307
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say my prayers.

308
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:04,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.

309
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to go to Martha.

310
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:15,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

311
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:15,858
[SPEAKER_12]: It's three minutes.

312
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:17,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

313
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:24,322
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Martha Andrus, and I live on Kilgore Avenue next to Mystic Valley Parkway.

314
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:33,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I echo what's been said by Allie and Emily and other Councilors.

315
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:36,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say that

316
00:37:38,661 --> 00:37:43,644
[SPEAKER_10]: What struck me, I was not surprised by this accident.

317
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:51,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that crosswalk from my house, and I'm frankly afraid every time I cross it, even though I'm extremely careful.

318
00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:07,478
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing that broke my heart was one of my neighbors saying, you know, I feel partly responsible because I fought for years to get that road fixed, and I just got tired and I gave up.

319
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel responsible for Dan.

320
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:12,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

321
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:29,434
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't be on the citizens to get this done, but we are doing our very best to work with you, with our state delegation, with the city to get to move DCR forward.

322
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:31,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And we aren't going anywhere.

323
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:32,275
[SPEAKER_10]: We live there.

324
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,977

00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:25,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:26,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

420
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:30,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We see everything in order, but before we move forward, do you have anything to say?

421
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:33,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it seems like it's just a simple transfer.

422
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,921
[SPEAKER_02]: You're keeping the business the same, but just turning over the ownership?

423
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:39,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what I see?

424
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but in the next couple of months, I will be changing the name.

425
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:44,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you'll be changing the name?

426
00:45:44,563 --> 00:45:44,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

427
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:44,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

428
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,932
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but it seems like the hours of operations don't change.

429
00:45:48,952 --> 00:45:49,853
[SPEAKER_02]: You have everything in place.

430
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I see everything in order, Mr. President.

431
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:53,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Move forward approval and wish him good luck.

432
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:55,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Could we just have your name and address for the record?

433
00:45:57,097 --> 00:45:59,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Just state your name and give the address of the business.

434
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:02,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my name is Thao Vuong, and the home address or?

435
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, just the business address is fine.

[SPEAKER_12]: I'm confirming that the negative of the motion passes.

00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:34,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck.

448
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:35,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

449
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:36,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

450
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:38,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I can, just a quick update.

451
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:40,406
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that- Councilor Scarpelli.

452
00:46:40,426 --> 00:46:42,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Just- You're all set.

453
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, here you go.

454
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:46,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

455
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:52,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the council had some suggestions a few weeks ago with our process when it comes to licensing.

456
00:46:52,834 --> 00:47:02,057
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a great discussion with council being with some opportunities that other communities use in moving that forward.

457
00:47:02,157 --> 00:47:08,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that we have a few ideas that I know that council president's working to

458
00:47:11,213 --> 00:47:11,493
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can.

459
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:27,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Look into the legalities and possibly streamline the processes so we can that the hope is that if maybe going to subcommittee and then talk about the process where it's either biweekly or is needed that we meet half hour before.

460
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:30,182
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council meetings in the side

461
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:47,542
[SPEAKER_02]: the resident would have to stay, the business owner would have to stay, but as we could see most of the time, we could streamline things and move them forward.

462
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:52,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not paying attorney's fees and people staying here for an extra four hours.

463
00:47:52,606 --> 00:48:05,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the council bringing the question forward and pushing this along with Councilor Beguin for his support and his guidance with this and look for something coming down the line.

464
00:48:05,895 --> 00:48:06,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

465
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:08,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

466
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:11,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lazzaro.

467
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:14,009
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

468
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

469
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:18,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Fantastic.

470
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:20,793
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

471
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Motions, orders and resolutions.

472
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:33,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to take up the under suspension and refer it out now or on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to suspend the rules to take paper under suspension, 25-027, seconded by?

473
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:37,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

474
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:37,958
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

475
00:48:38,939 --> 00:48:39,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

476
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:41,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

477
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,739
[SPEAKER_12]: 25-027 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

478
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:48,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the Committee on Education and Culture schedule a meeting on February 25th, 2025 at 6 p.m.

479
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:50,501
[SPEAKER_12]: in the City Council Chambers.

480
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:55,082
[SPEAKER_12]: The Committee will discuss the needs of the Recreation Department for the upcoming budget season.

481
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:58,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Committee will also discuss recreational programs involving our disabled community.

482
00:48:58,243 --> 00:48:59,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

483
00:49:00,043 --> 00:49:01,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

484
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:04,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for Councilors Leming and Callahan, who actually

485
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:17,684
[SPEAKER_02]: started this process with some residents that were looking to increase programs for our disabled community and we had discussions with the parents.

486
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:21,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met with both directors from Medford and

487
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:36,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden, Somerville together starting a collaborative and a pilot program with the three communities, enhancing our programming for our disabled youth and adults.

488
00:49:37,163 --> 00:49:44,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we went forward and looking what the needs are for the, as we move forward with this process, we realized that

489
00:49:45,257 --> 00:50:07,047
[SPEAKER_02]: having a subcommittee for Education and Cultural Committee to focus on the true needs of what the Recreation Department needs coming to budget season and calling for that meeting hopefully on February 25th before our regular scheduled meeting and then meeting with the parents who I spoke with

490
00:50:07,664 --> 00:50:25,447
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday making sure that they understand the process and then possibly working to create a committee with the parents and gathering information to see what our community really needs and what they're looking for and working collaboratively with them.

491
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:34,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we get to a resolution in February and we hope to have programs up and running by April 1st.

492
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:36,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. President.

493
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:38,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

494
00:50:38,386 --> 00:50:38,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Leming.

495
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:44,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'd like to thank my colleague for putting this forward.

496
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:49,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So to offer a little bit more insight into the background of this.

497
00:50:49,972 --> 00:51:03,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of the parents who have been advocating for these programs have been doing so for years and years, and they haven't, I think at this point, a lot of them have just been advocating so long, they feel like they're talking to a brick wall.

498
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:04,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So part of the,

499
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:20,560
[SPEAKER_14]: purpose of this is to just make sure that everybody that the parents, Council, the city and Medford recreation are on the same page in terms of vision for what these programs look like and they're, it's, it's,

500
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:36,525
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of details that like, well, I guess seem like details to the folks, to some folks, but a huge deal to the parents, like whether or not the programs are going to be designed for just kids or kids and teens, whether they're going to be sports based, what times are going to be.

501
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:45,286
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the parents would just like some clarity with Medford recreation on what, on what that would look like.

502
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:47,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And it would be,

503
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,262
[SPEAKER_14]: productive to get these discussions on the public record.

504
00:51:53,602 --> 00:52:07,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I also am excited to hear that my colleague is working with neighboring communities and implementing and starting up these sorts of after school programs.

505
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:09,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a wonderful initiative.

506
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,750
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

507
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:16,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Leming, Vice President Collins.

508
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:18,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

509
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:30,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to thank my colleague for finding a date certain for a committee meeting on this topic and also to my fellow Councilors for working so much with this community in recent weeks.

510
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:35,417
[SPEAKER_11]: This is another issue that I know residents have been advocating for for a very long time.

511
00:52:35,477 --> 00:52:37,638
[SPEAKER_11]: It's overdue for some attention and some funding.

512
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:40,961
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am really glad to see the urgency around this.

513
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:41,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

514
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:42,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to working with you all on this.

515
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

516
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,824
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to refer to the Committee on Education and Culture for a meeting on February 25th, seconded by.

517
00:52:52,244 --> 00:52:53,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

518
00:52:53,124 --> 00:52:53,865
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

519
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:55,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

520
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:55,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

521
00:52:55,906 --> 00:53:08,872
[SPEAKER_12]: 25-023, whereas this member of the Council has received, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, whereas this member of the Council has received multiple calls and emails requesting information regarding communication processes informing residents on the topic of zoning.

522
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:21,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And whereas residents have questions about where to locate meeting minutes and information dealing with the zoning process, and whereas the zoning process moving at a rapid pace and residents are questioning if there's a deadline to complete rezoning, be it resolved that the city council discuss the zoning process.

523
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:22,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

524
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:36,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I know that yesterday there was a community meeting for the Salem Street neighbors in the community at the Roberts and people that were there really got to share some of their

525
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:45,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wanna use, you can use frustration would be a good word.

526
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:53,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I don't wanna beat a dead horse and I don't want to keep bringing this up, but I think we have to.

527
00:53:53,996 --> 00:54:07,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one thing that's been coming back and forth is that understanding the zoning when it comes to posting information and what is coming up in future meetings.

528
00:54:08,085 --> 00:54:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that

529
00:54:09,757 --> 00:54:22,927
[SPEAKER_02]: for a Councilor or zoning specialists, it's easy because it's in your pipeline and you are accustomed to the language and you can really understand it.

530
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:39,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But I asked a while back if we could, you really work with our consultant to try to find a way that we can, I don't wanna say, probably just a layman's terms, so people can understand the zoning

531
00:54:39,872 --> 00:54:43,294
[SPEAKER_02]: and with better verbiage.

532
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not so complicated.

533
00:54:46,757 --> 00:55:06,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that yesterday's frustration, as I talked to neighbors this morning, as I talked to neighbors last night, residents last night, I think the biggest concern is really the speed and the process where last night was impressive in the fact that at least they saw what was going on in person.

534
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:14,242
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to touch things see things, and then they got to go to those boards and post what they wanted to see.

535
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:23,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is something again that I brought up for years now, and I can revert back to previous council.

536
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:33,119
[SPEAKER_02]: When we looked into doing the RFP process, working with the RFP process is really as it was written back in the day.

537
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I showed the council that the minutes that those meetings.

538
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:57,620
[SPEAKER_02]: that the RFP asked for the consultant that we were bringing in, the partners were bringing in to really have a detailed plan that would go into the neighborhood for communication and having the neighbors feel as part of the process and share the input as you get started.

539
00:55:57,681 --> 00:56:05,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, last night's efforts were great, but that's what we were talking about that we do at the beginning.

540
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:26,805
[SPEAKER_02]: and as we're moving forward the process I and believe me I understand what my council has been saying we've had over 20 some odd meetings and and and the word is we've tried to get the word out but unfortunately when we have the issues that have come about on Salem Street and the lack of what

541
00:56:27,355 --> 00:56:29,896
[SPEAKER_02]: our residents feel like they're not being listened to.

542
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:32,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important that we listen.

543
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:49,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would make a motion that we would ask to, you know, I know that we halted the meeting for March, but I would actually ask to suspend that for another month and maybe go back to that court or go back to the Roberts

544
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:54,809
[SPEAKER_02]: bring meetings in and just reset the clock with that.

545
00:56:54,909 --> 00:57:13,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Not where it's coming in and people telling me how wrong it is or how bad this is, but just resetting and understanding and having that open process before we go to the next step and say, hey, this is more in depth and this is what we've been asking for, to really understand what we want in the corridor, as they should say.

546
00:57:13,756 --> 00:57:17,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some neighbors say it's not a corridor, it's in their neighborhood.

547
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:24,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important if we can do that because I, again, because as I follow it up, I don't see a timeline.

548
00:57:24,202 --> 00:57:25,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is a timeline.

549
00:57:25,462 --> 00:57:32,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we've been waiting a long time and I know that this council and people have worked really hard and I don't want to discredit that.

550
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Please believe me.

551
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:39,710
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, especially when we talk about the Salem Street Corridor, it seems like it's a lightning rod right now.

552
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's created such a negative buzz that

553
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:50,435
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's a way that this council can lead in working with Ennis and working with Ms.

554
00:57:50,475 --> 00:57:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunt's office and try to find a more robust way to go back into that neighborhood and sit down and listen and post.

555
00:57:59,759 --> 00:58:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I think because that's what we did yesterday, a lot of people did feel comfortable with posting and seeing that, you know, they could put something on a board and understand what that's about.

556
00:58:08,983 --> 00:58:10,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that

557
00:58:10,984 --> 00:58:21,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Resetting that giving a little bit more time I think it'll be, it will be so important for healing, and it'll be very important to moving forward in this community as we go through this process because I

558
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:25,904
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a meeting to say I told you so.

559
00:58:26,124 --> 00:58:34,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say that but I just think that it's important that we listen because this hasn't been touched in many, many years and we know that.

560
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was comment yesterday that was made by Ms.

561
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:42,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunt that she said that during this meeting she thought that everybody was there that was against zoning.

562
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:46,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth of the matter is the people that I've talked to, they weren't against zoning.

563
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:53,995
[SPEAKER_02]: they were against the process of the zoning hearings and how it's gone through and how they feel like they weren't heard.

564
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:57,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Because something simple, and you were there, Council President,

565
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:10,394
[SPEAKER_02]: the simple piece of the biggest, one of the biggest fear we heard was that the methanol clinics and trying to avoid putting medical buildings in that corridor to avoid the concerns that neighborhood had.

566
00:59:10,934 --> 00:59:14,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something we can revisit if it was started from the beginning.

567
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:25,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't, you know, there were some people that were upset that, you know, the size of the buildings, but I think the messaging was a lot clearer that people understand where, what's gonna go where and where,

568
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:28,816
[SPEAKER_02]: some stories going to go six stories.

569
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: There was clarification on some map changes that we saw that really clarified and help people.

570
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:45,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that if we could, if we can, if there's one thing that I would ask as form of motion is if we can see if we can just delay the process and hold a

571
00:59:52,208 --> 01:00:18,142
[SPEAKER_02]: a meeting at the Roberts with the neighbors that would be a listening session and more of a partnership to see what do the neighbors want, not a negative or antagonistic battle with their side, our side, but sit there and present it the way that, and has presented it in the sense that allowed the people to get up

572
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:25,973
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to people in person to sit there and tangible and put a sticky on the on the note on the board and say, this is what I want.

573
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:38,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important because I think that no matter how much work and people have done a lot of work I'm not going to, I'm not going to deny that that there are a lot of people doing a lot of work and spend a lot of time

574
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:46,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's important that we understand as a council that the residents don't feel like they're being listened to.

575
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:53,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not meant to be a disrespectful comment.

576
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really made to enlighten us to say, hey, nothing's happened yet.

577
01:00:58,913 --> 01:01:00,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to rush for anything.

578
01:01:00,113 --> 01:01:00,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's reset this.

579
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:06,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go into that corridor and let's become partners with the neighbors of Salem Street

580
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: and put everything on the table and understand as we move forward, there was nothing that we pushed through or you leave all the negativity behind and say, we did this the way we should have done it.

581
01:01:18,226 --> 01:01:34,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important because I, again, I've done that and I've talked to a lot of professionals that have talked about this process and other communities as professionals, whether they're zoning consultants, attorneys, or worked for different municipalities.

582
01:01:36,015 --> 01:01:43,279
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the difference with what we've done so far and where the gaps are and where the cries are from the community.

583
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:45,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I appreciate the time to listen.

584
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:50,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that in totality, I think that's probably the biggest thing that I've heard.

585
01:01:50,844 --> 01:02:03,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that last night's meeting kind of answered some things, but I think the two biggest things that if we can come out of it is if there's a way that we could possibly work with our consultants to try to find

586
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,422
[SPEAKER_02]: a way to simplify.

587
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:12,181
[SPEAKER_02]: what those changes are and what we're really doing in those corridors.

588
01:02:12,882 --> 01:02:21,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not these maps that are real tiny so people can understand them a little bit better and just bullets where I hate to say it.

589
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said to me, yes, this is Georgia.

590
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:27,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 78 years old, and I just don't understand all this.

591
01:02:27,088 --> 01:02:28,308
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so confusing to me.

592
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this mean for my house and my future here in Metroton?

593
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't answer them because it's specific to the area.

594
01:02:38,072 --> 01:02:50,097
[SPEAKER_02]: between that and the speed of the process, and maybe asking to do a little bit more teamwork with the neighbors, I think would go a long way for both this council and our vision together.

595
01:02:50,117 --> 01:02:55,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, it's not that people in the room were against everything.

596
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:56,319
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't.

597
01:02:56,619 --> 01:03:04,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the pace and not understanding the fear, I think, that was something we need to correct if we could.

598
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:05,423
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you, Mr. President.

599
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:06,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

600
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:14,556
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to give my perspective on the meeting last night and talk about procedurally the ideas that you're talking about.

601
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:17,181
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just wanted to say that I think

602
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:21,940
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pretty general truism that when government does something right.

603
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:26,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody complains, nobody talks about it and nobody gets any credit for it.

604
01:03:27,143 --> 01:03:32,247
[SPEAKER_12]: And when government does something wrong, you have a lot of conversations about how it could have been better and how to make it better.

605
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:35,849
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's been my experience of

606
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,351
[SPEAKER_12]: this larger project so far.

607
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:50,460
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the fourth major change that we've done as part of the project, but it's the first one where we had residents so clearly and vociferously frustrated by elements of the process.

608
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:55,144
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that we have done significant work to try to respond to that.

609
01:03:55,304 --> 01:03:56,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And last night's meeting was a part of that.

610
01:03:57,405 --> 01:04:00,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to leave it to Councilor Collins to talk about some of the other work that we're doing.

611
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:08,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I think very much along the lines of what you just mentioned Councilor Scarpelli around bullet points and breaking this down and getting nuggets out there.

612
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:10,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Councilor Collins has more on that.

613
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:13,116
[SPEAKER_12]: We were there till about 10 last night.

614
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:28,395
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, most folks had left at that point, but the, I know, you know, Councilor Scarpelli, Rep Donato and about maybe half to three quarters of the crowd had something they needed to do other than talk about zoning for three and a half hours.

615
01:04:29,476 --> 01:04:33,180
[SPEAKER_12]: But we did manage to answer every question of everyone who stuck around.

616
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:41,605
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, certainly there are people who walked in with opinions and feelings who left with the same opinions and feelings about the zoning.

617
01:04:42,085 --> 01:04:55,492
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we also did do some significant work as Councilor Scarpelli noted to break down the information, provide a little bit more of a visual guide for folks who had concerns, address some of the statements and comments that had been made.

618
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:59,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I know one of the big ones was around, oh, 15 stories and some, you know,

619
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:03,777
[SPEAKER_12]: there's going to be these loopholes.

620
01:05:03,877 --> 01:05:15,664
[SPEAKER_12]: And we actually really were able to dive down directly with a couple of folks who had really been concerned about that and show them that actually the thing that they're worried about is the zoning we have now and not the zoning that's being proposed.

621
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:18,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was really reassuring, I think.

622
01:05:18,945 --> 01:05:20,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not on the totality of this.

623
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:25,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying those people agree that this new proposal is the best thing in the world now.

624
01:05:25,549 --> 01:05:28,171
[SPEAKER_12]: But on that specific issue, we were really able to address that.

625
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:34,128
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, I think, a productive evening for the most part.

626
01:05:34,148 --> 01:05:46,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I've received a bunch of communications today thanking the Council and the Planning Department and Innes Associates for their work to put that together.

627
01:05:46,216 --> 01:05:52,761
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think just moving to the procedural perspective, we've continued the public hearing to March 11th.

628
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:58,425
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't have the recommendations from the Community Development Board, which is meeting the week before at March 5th,

629
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:09,708
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly would support again, a continuance of the meeting further but that's how we would, we can't make a motion now to continue a public hearing that we just voted to continue to another date.

630
01:06:10,029 --> 01:06:13,270
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if we want to make a motion to further push that meeting out.

631
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:17,571
[SPEAKER_12]: We would do that when we reopen the public hearing.

632
01:06:18,511 --> 01:06:19,532
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just also.

633
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:29,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Personally want to note that I think a lot of residents we were very clear with residents last night who are highly involved and engaged about the process going forward.

634
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:39,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And personally, I would like to let the planning department, and as associates take all the comments and notes and questions.

635
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:48,829
[SPEAKER_12]: that were raised by residents last night, but also at prior meetings via email, via the input submission process.

636
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:57,133
[SPEAKER_12]: There were also some residents who were waiting on some questions to be answered, because I think that's going to inform the set of recommendations they make to the Community Development Board.

637
01:06:57,693 --> 01:07:04,016
[SPEAKER_12]: And we really did say to folks last night, the next opportunity to engage on this is Community Development Board on March 5th.

638
01:07:06,405 --> 01:07:31,066
[SPEAKER_12]: If the recommendations that associates proposes and planning development, sustainability propose address a lot of these concerns about uses that we're talking about, medical uses, short-term housing uses, some of the questions that people had and that the community development board feels comfortable making its recommendations to the council at the March 5th meeting, then we could consider that on March 11th.

639
01:07:31,186 --> 01:07:31,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we feel

640
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:37,978
[SPEAKER_12]: that we should extend as Councilor Scarpelli noted, I think that would be the time to make that call.

641
01:07:39,379 --> 01:07:46,546
[SPEAKER_12]: But of course, if the Community Development Board continues for another after March 5th and we don't have recommendations from them, I think we would continue.

642
01:07:47,086 --> 01:07:48,447
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm trying to

643
01:07:49,708 --> 01:08:00,458
[SPEAKER_12]: speak to what you're saying Councilor Scarpelli in terms of the intent I agree with you if there's still a lot of if we have certainly if we don't have recommendations and community development board feels they need more time to spend on it.

644
01:08:00,959 --> 01:08:03,521
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we should continue further down the line.

645
01:08:05,203 --> 01:08:07,605
[SPEAKER_12]: And, but I just want to be procedurally of note to say

646
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:14,493
[SPEAKER_12]: We told a lot of people last night how things were going to go, and I don't want to change that up on them personally right now.

647
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:18,715
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we can make that decision when we get to the decision point in March.

648
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:20,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins.

649
01:08:23,528 --> 01:08:24,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

650
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:36,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to yeah, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing up this topic, we talked about this so often in the planning and permitting committee and I think it's really good to have the chance to talk about this to a wider audience in a regular meeting.

651
01:08:37,497 --> 01:08:48,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Also want to thank President Bears for facilitating at the Salem Street quarter q amp a last night and to all the elected to attended and especially to city staff and associates for

652
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:55,630
[SPEAKER_11]: staying quite late to make sure that everybody's questions were answered.

653
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:56,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Truly, truly appreciate that.

654
01:08:59,855 --> 01:09:03,456
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have, like I said, I'm really glad that we're talking about this.

655
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:13,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate President Bears' framing that this is, you know, by no means the first topic in the zoning, the citywide zoning process.

656
01:09:13,058 --> 01:09:15,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think as we've been going along, we've been learning.

657
01:09:15,178 --> 01:09:25,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I, well, just to speak for myself, I have been learning a lot, not only about the zoning, I have learned so much about zoning through getting, through being required to get really, really into the weeds on it.

658
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:36,904
[SPEAKER_11]: But it has also been really critical to note what questions people have about what we started with phase one, we moved on to Mystic Ave corridor district, we moved on to Green Score.

659
01:09:37,765 --> 01:09:43,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Green Score is kind of now closest to finalization of the topics that haven't yet been ordained.

660
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,969
[SPEAKER_11]: And Salem Street, its next procedural step is the CDB.

661
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:53,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And with each of these proposals, we learn more about what is interesting to people, what is confusing to people,

662
01:09:55,632 --> 01:10:00,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we hear from not very many residents about what do we hear from a lot of residents about.

663
01:10:01,515 --> 01:10:12,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And that gives us what I think is incredibly crucial and valuable information about how we need to be responding to those questions in our public facing communications.

664
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:28,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have been trying to really, you know, just sprint as fast as we can being responsive to that, while we are continuing this process of reviewing the whole zoning citywide, I really do think it is important that we

665
01:10:30,538 --> 01:10:35,760
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, stay true to our promise to review zoning comprehensively this term.

666
01:10:38,421 --> 01:11:00,168
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not like kind of getting into any timeline specifics, but just I do think it's incredibly vital to do that as a package because with zoning, if we were to end up with kind of a incomplete overhaul, having touched some quarters, but not others, some neighborhoods, but not others, some topics, but not others, that would create a really chaotic

667
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:05,112
[SPEAKER_11]: legal landscape for developers for residents for city staff.

668
01:11:06,153 --> 01:11:19,525
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just, I don't think that we run the risk of getting into that kind of situation but that is that is kind of an overarching goal guiding this process that we have to make sure that at the end of this project, the zoning, quote unquote, agrees with itself so that we avoid any

669
01:11:21,106 --> 01:11:27,328
[SPEAKER_11]: legal chaos that could come from having tables of uses that don't line up or neighborhood uses that are not compatible with other neighborhoods.

670
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:35,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we have no intention of singling out any neighborhood and we have to make sure that we proceed at a pace that allows us to stay true to that.

671
01:11:38,111 --> 01:11:41,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, back to the stuff that I honestly really love talking about.

672
01:11:41,152 --> 01:11:42,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins, just one other note.

673
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:48,114
[SPEAKER_12]: We did accept a proposal and that proposal has a time frame on it.

674
01:11:49,994 --> 01:12:03,962
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we've had the timeline that we've been on since last spring because the proposal is essentially to complete the introduction of major changes by the end of June and the cleanup by September, and that's based on the proposal that the council and city accepted for this project.

675
01:12:04,702 --> 01:12:04,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

676
01:12:05,182 --> 01:12:05,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

677
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:14,127
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I appreciate you noting that of course we are associates is not an employee of the city, so we have to use them while they are available.

678
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:27,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I think on that point, it's also important to note that our zoning consultant has already, I would say, just speaking only for myself here, quite magnanimously gone beyond the scope of what we are paying them to do.

679
01:12:27,978 --> 01:12:31,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that this work is necessary.

680
01:12:31,379 --> 01:12:32,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really valuable.

681
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:44,865
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna work with them to make sure that we can continue layering more public feedback, public participation, additional opportunities for public participation beyond all of our existing public committee and public hearing.

682
01:12:45,805 --> 01:12:48,066
[SPEAKER_11]: meetings that are baked into this process as a minimum.

683
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:49,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really grateful to them for doing that.

684
01:12:49,967 --> 01:12:57,431
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that they continue to have capacity to do public Q and A's for every zoning topic, not just Salem Street going forward.

685
01:12:57,851 --> 01:13:13,939
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been working with them so that they can, for all zoning topics going forward, in addition to some other comm stuff that I'll talk about in just a minute, put out really short bite-sized, like two-minute explainer videos for each zoning topic, which I think will be really, really useful.

686
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Because reading about zoning is incredibly dry.

687
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:21,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So things like that I think will add a lot to the process for residents.

688
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:29,658
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the end of the day, we are still working with a consultant under the constraints of a contract.

689
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:32,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is a real constraint.

690
01:13:35,627 --> 01:13:54,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've talked about this a little bit in the planning and permitting committee, but I thought it was just really salient what the Councilor said about residents noting, you know, that we need to, we need really, residents need help in simplifying what changes are proposed, what is proposed to change in the corridors and the neighborhoods that we're looking at.

691
01:13:54,171 --> 01:13:57,912
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned bullet points, you know, my ears pricked up.

692
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:09,557
[SPEAKER_11]: When I heard that because so much of what I've been working on, you know, quite intensively for the past few weeks at this point is really at the same time as we're comprehensively reviewing the city zoning.

693
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:13,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally have been comprehensively overhauling the city zoning website.

694
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:20,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing is, we really need we really need bullet points we really need diagrams.

695
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:37,859
[SPEAKER_11]: for myself as an individual reading a zoning proposal alone, I do not come away with it with a deep enough understanding of the zoning proposal that I can easily explain it to another person in a way that they can understand.

696
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:44,863
[SPEAKER_11]: and residents do not have the time and the responsibility that Councilors do to do that kind of deep dive.

697
01:14:45,344 --> 01:14:54,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So I met with the mayor's communications director and communications associate actually just earlier this afternoon.

698
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,672
[SPEAKER_11]: We are getting really close on an overhauled version of the zoning webpage.

699
01:15:00,152 --> 01:15:12,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is really built around having simplified summaries and bullet points for every single zoning proposal, the ones that are currently going on, the ones that have already been adopted so that it is completely unmissable for residents.

700
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:14,016
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this?

701
01:15:14,817 --> 01:15:15,757
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about?

702
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:17,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Explain it to me like I'm in fifth grade.

703
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:19,338
[SPEAKER_11]: When is the next meeting?

704
01:15:19,798 --> 01:15:21,379
[SPEAKER_11]: What topic comes after this one?

705
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:23,319
[SPEAKER_11]: What does the zoning currently say?

706
01:15:23,379 --> 01:15:24,380
[SPEAKER_11]: What can I do by right?

707
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,740
[SPEAKER_11]: What does by right mean?

708
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Under the proposed zoning,

709
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:41,366
[SPEAKER_11]: what would change, what would be doable by right under that new scenario, what would be different, answering frequently asked questions, including diagrams, because I think those are totally essential for understanding.

710
01:15:41,386 --> 01:15:45,367
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of things that really don't come across in text, even when the text is simplified.

711
01:15:46,687 --> 01:15:49,829
[SPEAKER_11]: We will add those short explainer videos when they are available.

712
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:56,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's really important that we are trying to optimize every communication strategy

713
01:15:56,991 --> 01:15:57,612
[SPEAKER_11]: that we have.

714
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:02,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that adding in a public Q and A for each topic is such a great idea.

715
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:07,579
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really want to extend my thanks to Councilor Scarpelli for beating that drum for a long time.

716
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:10,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really glad that that's going to be a part of every zoning topic going forward.

717
01:16:11,481 --> 01:16:21,568
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition, the short form explainer videos, in addition, a city websites that people have a spot that they can go to, which I really don't think they had before, where they can just get oriented.

718
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:23,149
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this?

719
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:24,870
[SPEAKER_11]: When are they going to talk about it next?

720
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:43,401
[SPEAKER_11]: just give me a version of this that I can digest and I can understand it well enough that I can ask a question and let people know where they can go to ask a question who to email for reliable information and when the next public meeting is so that you and your neighbors can attend and get your get your questions answered and real time.

721
01:16:47,897 --> 01:16:51,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am really excited for us to be onboarding all of that.

722
01:16:51,998 --> 01:17:00,741
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, that's our responsibility to make sure that residents, it's our responsibility to pass here.

723
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:10,224
[SPEAKER_11]: First and foremost, I believe that it is our responsibility to update Medford zoning because residents have been asking us to do that for a very, very, very long time.

724
01:17:10,424 --> 01:17:16,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that there are a lot of Metro residents and business owners and local developers

725
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:36,484
[SPEAKER_11]: who have been very, very frustrated for a very, very long time, seeing neighborhoods not reflect the character that residents would like them to, seeing squares and areas with a lot of great commercial potential not reach their full potential, because we have not undertaken this project.

726
01:17:36,664 --> 01:17:37,445
[SPEAKER_11]: We owe them

727
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:41,467
[SPEAKER_11]: thoughtful zoning, reasonable zoning, better zoning.

728
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:44,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel really, really committed to delivering on that goal.

729
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:53,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, we also owe residents good, reliable information that residents can understand without becoming zoning experts.

730
01:17:53,634 --> 01:18:00,058
[SPEAKER_11]: And that has been my focus for the past month in collaboration with my fellow councilors and with city staff and with Innes Associates.

731
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:04,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I am really glad that last night's Q&A answered so many questions.

732
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:07,342
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue doing that.

733
01:18:08,482 --> 01:18:21,405
[SPEAKER_11]: All of our public meetings, the planning and permitting meetings, the CDB public hearings, the City Council regular meetings are always public and always forums where residents can ask questions and get their questions answered.

734
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:23,166
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue to do that.

735
01:18:23,186 --> 01:18:24,366
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue to use

736
01:18:25,026 --> 01:18:37,769
[SPEAKER_11]: all of the communications channels that are available to us as city councilors and in collaboration with the mayor's office to do our very best at making sure that people know about this topic that is interesting to and relevant to so many residents.

737
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:54,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, you know, myself and all of the councilors also have a responsibility to understand the zoning as best as we can so that we can answer questions and dispel concerns and make sure that we are sources of reliable information to residents as well.

738
01:18:57,075 --> 01:18:58,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I truly could talk about this for a long time.

739
01:18:58,816 --> 01:19:01,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been spending a lot of working hours on it in the past few weeks.

740
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:08,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the bottom line for me is this project is pretty unprecedented.

741
01:19:08,704 --> 01:19:12,207
[SPEAKER_11]: So our communication strategy around it is going to be unprecedented as well.

742
01:19:13,308 --> 01:19:19,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I am so glad that truly all of us here behind this rail have been insisting on the communications process getting better as we go along.

743
01:19:22,002 --> 01:19:42,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm committed to making sure that as we go topic by topic, we just continue to do the best job as we can and onboard as many new tools as we have to, so that people know what's going on, know who to ask, know when to ask, know when the meetings are, and that this can be as inclusive of a project as it can be.

744
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:43,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

745
01:19:45,991 --> 01:19:46,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

746
01:19:46,951 --> 01:19:47,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

747
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

748
01:19:49,912 --> 01:19:50,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And again,

749
01:19:52,402 --> 01:20:00,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I reiterate what residents have said, they understand that they're all in, they understand that we need some changes, things haven't been looked at.

750
01:20:00,885 --> 01:20:04,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a common cry, you hear that.

751
01:20:04,906 --> 01:20:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that again, I appreciate the effort, but again, I think the biggest piece that we're missing is truly listening to what they're saying.

752
01:20:13,649 --> 01:20:17,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Our residents using Salem Street an example,

753
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:22,105
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is the area that we're working on right now.

754
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hotbed that they want to be part of the process.

755
01:20:26,946 --> 01:20:28,506
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to go into the community.

756
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to do what we were forced to do last night, but come back full circle and do it the correct way.

757
01:20:35,648 --> 01:20:42,070
[SPEAKER_02]: To say that, you know, I know that Councilor Collins said that it's breaking a contract.

758
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:42,670
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it isn't.

759
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:46,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not that the consultants work for us.

760
01:20:46,956 --> 01:20:51,404
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already changed the timeline for four other different reasons.

761
01:20:51,464 --> 01:20:53,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not a true statement.

762
01:20:55,470 --> 01:21:09,979
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was legalities in that, then we should ask for a change order in that contract because it will be easily done if we truly want to fulfill what the residents are asking for.

763
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very simple.

764
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a motion in place and I hope my council support it.

765
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:30,288
[SPEAKER_02]: that we delayed the process of the Salem Street zoning until we hold neighborhood partner involved meetings with our partners in Ennis and our development board

766
01:21:30,888 --> 01:21:35,772
[SPEAKER_02]: and working together to move that corridor forward in a positive light.

767
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:45,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that we're now finally moving into more streamlined, more transparent and understandable process so people understand zoning as a fifth grader.

768
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's important that we're missing the biggest piece here.

769
01:21:52,488 --> 01:22:01,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to go into these communities, we need to go into these corridors, we need to go into that community and have them feel like they're part of it.

770
01:22:01,955 --> 01:22:07,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the questions were answered, there's still a lot of animosity and there's still a lot of confusion.

771
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of great ideas.

772
01:22:10,256 --> 01:22:14,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that all of you have talked to some very, very brilliant people, as I have.

773
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:24,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked with people that are in the field that have worked at the highest universities in the country.

774
01:22:24,888 --> 01:22:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've worked on huge projects and small projects.

775
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And they live in our community.

776
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:32,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've shared some great ideas.

777
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:33,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that

778
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:37,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the people that live in those areas.

779
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it would be important.

780
01:22:40,157 --> 01:22:52,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would make the motion that we ask for the delay, we go through the process correctly, and we ask to bring a meeting to work together with the residents of each quarter.

781
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

782
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:54,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

783
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,141
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a B paper from Councilor Scarapelli.

784
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:57,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

785
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:01,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go to Vice President Collins and then I'll read the B paper.

786
01:23:05,955 --> 01:23:06,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

787
01:23:06,335 --> 01:23:09,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that perspective, Councilor Scarpelli.

788
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:12,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally agree.

789
01:23:12,177 --> 01:23:23,322
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many residents who have, who've had, I mean, I've been just over and over shocked by how insightful and thoughtful a lot of the questions that we've had on the zoning proposals have been.

790
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:32,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand from last night, there were several suggestions and questions that city staff indicated that they, just one suggestion to the,

791
01:23:33,988 --> 01:23:39,229
[SPEAKER_11]: table of incentive zoning uses comes to mind that city staff is like, wow, great idea.

792
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:43,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's make sure to make a note of that so we can recommend an amendment around that.

793
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:49,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear you, that going into the neighborhoods is an important part of this process.

794
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:57,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have to disagree with the characterization that folks are not being listened to.

795
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I really implore any resident

796
01:24:02,402 --> 01:24:11,908
[SPEAKER_11]: who is interested in this process to come to all of our public meetings, the Planning and Permanent Committee meeting, they're always public, they're always hybrid.

797
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:17,372
[SPEAKER_11]: The Community Development Board public hearings are always public, there's always public comment.

798
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:25,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Some modes of involvement are accessible for some people, some are accessible for other types of people.

799
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:28,799
[SPEAKER_11]: We are working hard to make sure that the folks who

800
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:50,406
[SPEAKER_11]: are never going to go to a public meeting are still going to well, I should say, we don't even have to work hard to make sure that people who are have no interest in public meetings can be heard, because people email us all the time with their questions and their asks for clarification and their comments on the zoning and all of those are reviewed by Councilors and by city staff.

801
01:24:55,253 --> 01:25:01,558
[SPEAKER_11]: The in-person meetings, we are always collecting, notating, taking down resident feedback.

802
01:25:01,878 --> 01:25:13,327
[SPEAKER_11]: There's countless times that that has been incorporated, whether it was feedback that was received at a CDB public hearing or at a planning and permitting meeting or at the Q&As, which we're piloting as of last night.

803
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:23,896
[SPEAKER_11]: For folks who do not yet feel like they've had a chance to have their questions asked or their suggestions heard,

804
01:25:24,774 --> 01:25:27,776
[SPEAKER_11]: on any zoning proposals that are currently in the pipeline.

805
01:25:27,796 --> 01:25:32,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I would urge you to get in touch with any Councilor to get in touch with me.

806
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:38,143
[SPEAKER_11]: We will make sure that the relevant committee hears your comments.

807
01:25:40,404 --> 01:25:44,427
[SPEAKER_11]: That has always been a part of this process that will continue to be a part of this process.

808
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:52,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to clarify on our collaboration with our zoning consultant.

809
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:54,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want there to be any confusion.

810
01:25:54,729 --> 01:26:02,751
[SPEAKER_11]: The city council runs no risk of some sort of legal ramification from straying outside the bounds of its contract within associates.

811
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,972
[SPEAKER_11]: It is just that we run the risk of running out of their time.

812
01:26:07,192 --> 01:26:08,412
[SPEAKER_11]: They are not a city employee.

813
01:26:10,193 --> 01:26:11,193
[SPEAKER_11]: We put out an RFP.

814
01:26:12,455 --> 01:26:13,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I work as a consultant.

815
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:14,516
[SPEAKER_11]: That is my day job.

816
01:26:14,676 --> 01:26:15,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I respond to RFPs.

817
01:26:17,216 --> 01:26:21,938
[SPEAKER_11]: A consultant responds to an RFP with a proposal, and then a contract is signed.

818
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:26,439
[SPEAKER_11]: We run the risk of running out of their time.

819
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:29,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is really important.

820
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:38,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want anybody to come away with the impression that it is not really important that we fulfill our task of reviewing all of our zoning citywide.

821
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:45,747
[SPEAKER_11]: because to fail to follow through on that would cause problems.

822
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:47,288
[SPEAKER_11]: It would cause problems for city staff.

823
01:26:47,848 --> 01:26:49,509
[SPEAKER_11]: It would cause problems for local developers.

824
01:26:49,569 --> 01:26:51,650
[SPEAKER_11]: It would cause problems for businesses.

825
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:56,532
[SPEAKER_11]: This process has always been involving of resident input.

826
01:26:57,012 --> 01:27:05,055
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to continue to do a better job each and every week of making sure that people know about these processes so that they can ask their questions and give their suggestions.

827
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:21,826
[SPEAKER_11]: And like President Beer said, if we don't have CDB recommendations on the Salem Street proposal on March 5, absolutely I don't think we should vote on it on March 11, I will, I will, I will support a motion to continue that public hearing if that's the case.

828
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:26,508
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's really clear in keeping with all of this, that we make it.

829
01:27:27,428 --> 01:27:30,173
[SPEAKER_11]: very clear and consistent for people what their next opportunity is.

830
01:27:30,714 --> 01:27:34,439
[SPEAKER_11]: We told a lot of people last night the next opportunity is CDB on March 5th.

831
01:27:35,221 --> 01:27:35,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's stick with that.

832
01:27:36,663 --> 01:27:38,906
[SPEAKER_11]: If CDB needs more time, they need more time.

833
01:27:39,728 --> 01:27:40,349
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine with me.

834
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:41,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

835
01:27:43,313 --> 01:27:43,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

836
01:27:43,573 --> 01:27:53,036
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a motion, a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli to delay the Salem Street neighborhood quarter district zoning until more neighborhood meetings are held.

837
01:27:53,776 --> 01:27:55,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that an accurate summary?

838
01:27:56,257 --> 01:27:57,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second on that motion?

839
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:09,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Hearing no second, the B paper is not

840
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:12,470
[SPEAKER_12]: The B paper fails.

841
01:28:13,391 --> 01:28:20,915
[SPEAKER_12]: On the A paper by Councilor Scarpelli, which was read out earlier, is there a motion on the A paper?

842
01:28:22,395 --> 01:28:23,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins.

843
01:28:24,776 --> 01:28:26,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to receive and place on file.

844
01:28:26,477 --> 01:28:32,280
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan, we'll move to public participation.

845
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,403
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to speak on the paper, please raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium.

846
01:28:38,722 --> 01:28:41,804
[SPEAKER_12]: seeing one on Zoom.

847
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:43,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Two on Zoom.

848
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,625
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll start with Cheryl.

849
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:47,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Cheryl, name and address for the record.

850
01:28:47,186 --> 01:28:48,227
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

851
01:28:49,247 --> 01:28:50,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

852
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:56,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 281 Park Street, and I have a different impression of the meeting last night.

853
01:28:56,831 --> 01:29:05,975
[SPEAKER_09]: As with all of the meetings that have been held about the Salem Street Corridor, they're very vague PowerPoint presentations that don't inform about the zoning in any way.

854
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:22,530
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened last night was that neighbors had educated neighbors, neighbors had notified other neighbors that a meeting was happening and neighbors came in with the knowledge of the zoning and their questions were about the zoning and they were asking the consultant these questions.

855
01:29:24,153 --> 01:29:25,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel that you have done enough.

856
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:36,439
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do a public hearing and you're rezoning an entire neighborhood and you're in a room alone and every single person in that room is getting paid, then the neighborhood did not know.

857
01:29:36,459 --> 01:29:38,580
[SPEAKER_09]: This was not done correctly.

858
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,163
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be gone back and gone over the right way with proper processes.

859
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:47,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And having a Q&A last night and basically

860
01:29:47,727 --> 01:29:53,670
[SPEAKER_09]: not going to take that on board what the neighbors have told you is insincere.

861
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:58,233
[SPEAKER_09]: People were there and they were knowledgeable about the subject.

862
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:00,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is not the result of Innis.

863
01:30:00,674 --> 01:30:03,095
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not the result of any of these public meetings.

864
01:30:03,455 --> 01:30:06,557
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the result of them going into the zoning

865
01:30:07,013 --> 01:30:10,154
[SPEAKER_09]: and learning it from each other and for themselves.

866
01:30:10,634 --> 01:30:21,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that needs to be acknowledged and it shouldn't have to happen that neighbors citywide have to teach each other the zoning in order to know what is coming to their neighborhood.

867
01:30:21,918 --> 01:30:36,543
[SPEAKER_09]: These PowerPoints that just show blocks stacked on top of each other that say how high buildings are or show what the neighborhood looks like that we've already seen is not education on what is in your zoning proposal.

868
01:30:37,259 --> 01:30:39,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Please consider that we live here.

869
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,661
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have to live with these ramifications.

870
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:48,703
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have to live with the streets being less safe, with the traffic being heavier.

871
01:30:49,163 --> 01:30:53,165
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a neighborhood and we should matter too.

872
01:30:53,525 --> 01:30:53,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

873
01:30:56,386 --> 01:30:56,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

874
01:30:56,906 --> 01:31:01,788
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll go to Zachary.

875
01:31:02,928 --> 01:31:04,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

876
01:31:04,609 --> 01:31:05,469
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

877
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:08,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Zachary Chartok, 5 Allmont Street.

878
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:15,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Bears and Vice President Collins for the floor and for your time tonight.

879
01:31:16,413 --> 01:31:20,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to echo some of the issues with the public engagement process.

880
01:31:20,095 --> 01:31:26,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I've worked on and with similar proposals in other cities in the state and other parts of the country and actually in other countries as well.

881
01:31:28,038 --> 01:31:42,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically you have public engagement meetings from concept through to design and through every stage of proposal, having been in the neighborhood long enough to be signed up for every aspect of public outreach and engagement that the city does to signify when it's holding meetings.

882
01:31:43,604 --> 01:31:56,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I can categorically tell you nobody in the building of eight units that I represent and manage received any outrage, paper, hard copy, email, phone, or otherwise as to any of the meetings, even leading up to last night's.

883
01:31:56,609 --> 01:31:59,790
[SPEAKER_08]: They were notified by me of the meeting last night.

884
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:08,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I respect what Vice President Collins is talking about in terms of procedural changes, efforts made to codify information in a simpler manner,

885
01:32:09,413 --> 01:32:20,876
[SPEAKER_08]: that doing it now is a bit too little too late towards the end of the process for the Salem Street rezoning effort, to the point that it just does not satisfy the lack of public engagement and outreach that has been done so far.

886
01:32:20,896 --> 01:32:28,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So while I appreciate that it'll suffice for correction from this experience moving forward for other processes, it just simply does not satisfy this one.

887
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:40,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting back to the proposal that Councilman Scarpelli raised to the floor, I would urge the council to reconsider, even if it means opening another vote on a different codified issue at the next meeting.

888
01:32:41,566 --> 01:32:54,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Further extensions are tabling and potentially revisiting the contract with the consultant who has also worked on similar proposals and echoed similar concerns through conversation about procedure and outreach and engagement.

889
01:32:56,395 --> 01:33:04,500
[SPEAKER_08]: that this does need to go back for better engagement for the purposes of equity and inclusion of the neighborhood with the city efforts.

890
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

891
01:33:07,681 --> 01:33:08,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

892
01:33:09,803 --> 01:33:12,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go to Rich on Zoom.

893
01:33:14,265 --> 01:33:16,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Rich, name and address for the record, please.

894
01:33:16,646 --> 01:33:17,787
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll have three minutes.

895
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Rich Lavoie, 128 Sheridan Ave.

896
01:33:23,834 --> 01:33:29,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd just like to ask that you strongly consider the proposal that Councilor Scapelli has put forward.

897
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:37,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite frankly, as you mentioned, this process you're hoping is going to get better as you go.

898
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:42,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't wanna be your first pancake.

899
01:33:43,629 --> 01:33:45,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wanna be the one that gets burned.

900
01:33:46,691 --> 01:33:47,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So please,

901
01:33:48,075 --> 01:34:11,546
[SPEAKER_03]: If we need to stop, if we need to pause, if we need to give the neighborhood of Salem Street a little more time to be engaged and to understand, knowing that this is the first residential neighborhood that is going through this, then I strongly encourage you all to please give us that consideration.

902
01:34:12,307 --> 01:34:13,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your time.

903
01:34:14,188 --> 01:34:14,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

904
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:21,071
[SPEAKER_12]: On the A paper, on the motion receiving place on file.

905
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:21,872
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

906
01:34:22,672 --> 01:34:23,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

907
01:34:23,113 --> 01:34:23,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

908
01:34:23,913 --> 01:34:25,614
[SPEAKER_12]: I just had one question.

909
01:34:25,714 --> 01:34:27,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Apologies for having to leave early last regular meeting.

910
01:34:28,275 --> 01:34:30,116
[SPEAKER_12]: McCormick Avenue was referred to committee of the whole.

911
01:34:30,737 --> 01:34:31,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

912
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:33,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

913
01:34:33,438 --> 01:34:33,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

914
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:36,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh?

915
01:34:38,961 --> 01:34:39,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it McCormick Ave?

916
01:34:43,263 --> 01:34:44,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Just on those two parcels?

917
01:34:50,913 --> 01:34:54,135
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're saying if I leave it all, everyone turns?

918
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:00,800
[SPEAKER_12]: You did a podcast of some kind?

919
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,801
[SPEAKER_12]: The McCormick Ave Beats?

920
01:35:04,462 --> 01:35:04,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

921
01:35:05,143 --> 01:35:05,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thanks.

922
01:35:05,843 --> 01:35:08,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for answering my question with more questions.

923
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:14,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anything else anyone wants to take up from Unfinished Business?

924
01:35:16,312 --> 01:35:20,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to clear out any unfinished business that's been sitting for a while?

925
01:35:20,155 --> 01:35:21,856
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have a little extra time tonight.

926
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:27,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins.

927
01:35:29,661 --> 01:35:37,166
[SPEAKER_11]: I would motion, unless there's any objection, I would motion to take 23-412 and 24-352 from the table and receive and place on file.

928
01:35:45,771 --> 01:35:49,954
[SPEAKER_12]: 23412 and 24352 and receive in place on file.

929
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:54,937
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen any action on those in many months, and I haven't heard from any petitioners.

930
01:35:56,478 --> 01:35:59,420
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been long beyond the 90 days, so they're free to reapply at any time.

931
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:06,705
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to take papers 23412 and 24352 from the table and receive in place on file, seconded by.

932
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,561
[SPEAKER_12]: seconded by Councilor Callahan.

933
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:13,281
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

934
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:13,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

935
01:36:14,322 --> 01:36:14,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

936
01:36:14,862 --> 01:36:15,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

937
01:36:16,983 --> 01:36:18,704
