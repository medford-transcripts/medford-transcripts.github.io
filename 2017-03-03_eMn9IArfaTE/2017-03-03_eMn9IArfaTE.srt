00:00:00,972 --> 00:00:02,613
[SPEAKER_15]: To Reverend Noah Evans.

[SPEAKER_15]: Reverend Noah, welcome to City Council.

3
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:10,298
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been here many times.

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:19,825
[SPEAKER_15]: For those of you who don't know, for the last nine years, Reverend Noah Evans has been the pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church.

5
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:26,161
[SPEAKER_15]: On March 5th will be the last Sunday Mass for Noah Evans at the church.

6
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:31,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Reverend Noah will be moving to Mount Lebanon Episcopal Church.

7
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:39,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Reverend has been an integral part of our community and has helped build relationships of support to many in our community.

8
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:47,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Reverend you have been a positive spiritual presence for everyone in the city of Medford and have been an inspiration to all who have known you.

9
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Today we want to say thank you.

10
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:59,460
[SPEAKER_15]: for how you walked in truth, for how you shared God's word, salvation, life, and for each soul you renewed.

11
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:07,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the time you have spent and the hours you have gladly gave to our community in unfolding of God's perfect way at Medford.

12
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:15,370
[SPEAKER_15]: The residents of Medford wish you and your family the best and hope you have more wonderful opportunities on the road ahead.

13
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,653
[SPEAKER_15]: We will miss you, but in more ways than,

14
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:23,386
[SPEAKER_15]: in more ways than you'll know.

15
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:28,028
[SPEAKER_15]: We thank you, we owe you a great debt of gratitude.

16
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Your presence in our community is going to be missed more than you know.

17
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:42,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Reverend.

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I think before we give you your citation,

19
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:50,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I think maybe some of our councilors may want to give you a couple of words.

20
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:53,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks, would you like to start out with something for Reverend Noah?

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

22
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:06,646
[SPEAKER_21]: As you mentioned so eloquently, Reverend Noah has been an integral part of this community and has been a voice of reason.

23
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:15,192
[SPEAKER_21]: He was at the council meeting, I don't know, maybe a month ago or so in representing issues of concern in this community.

24
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:20,048
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know his shoes are going to be sorely missed in our community.

25
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,369
[SPEAKER_21]: And I wish you well in your new endeavor.

26
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,471
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you ever need anything, give us a call.

27
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:27,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

28
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:27,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

29
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Dello Russo.

30
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you.

31
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:45,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Reverend Noah, it's been a pleasure working with you over these years and an honor to work with you in your parish and to minister alongside of you as we both walk people through the darkest moments of their life.

32
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the skill set that you have.

33
00:02:48,864 --> 00:03:00,807
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the concern that you have, not only for the people of the parish, but also in the greater community and the outreach you've done in the urban centers of this area for the poor.

34
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:02,927
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wish you well.

35
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:13,130
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you have a great task before you to minister to the people of Pittsburgh, and I wish you, your wife, and your children well.

36
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,850
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

37
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:15,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Falco.

38
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,939
[SPEAKER_30]: Reverend Owens, thank you for all that you've done for our community throughout the years.

39
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:33,567
[SPEAKER_30]: You have been a big part of just leading the interfaith group within our community, all churches, Catholic, Protestant, Episcopalian.

40
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:39,211
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know you brought that group together like it's never been before in our community, and that's meant a lot.

41
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,533
[SPEAKER_30]: And I wish you well in your future endeavors.

42
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:44,435
[SPEAKER_30]: And on a personal note, I know my

43
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:59,434
[SPEAKER_30]: My in-laws belong to the Episcopal Church, and when my father-in-law passed away, I mean, you were with him to the end, and that meant a lot to our family, and I thank you for everything that you've done, on a personal note, and for our community.

44
00:03:59,734 --> 00:03:59,995
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

45
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:01,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

46
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:05,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Father Noah, thank you very much as well.

47
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,518
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been a great next-door neighbor.

48
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:14,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I've lived next door to the Grace Church now for a number of years, and I've certainly seen the parish grow under

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Father Evans' leadership.

50
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:24,867
[SPEAKER_11]: You've done a great job here in the community, and we really can't thank you enough for the efforts that you put forward in building social capital and creating an engaged citizenry with the parishioners.

51
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,228
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much, Father Evans.

52
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:31,611
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be sadly missed, but I'd ask that even though you're down there in Pittsburgh, you still pray for us up here in Medford.

53
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:32,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

54
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:32,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

55
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:33,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

56
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

57
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

58
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:42,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You've done great work in Medford, and we're going to sorely miss you.

59
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck in your future.

60
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:45,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

61
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:46,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

62
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:52,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I echo what my colleagues have said, Reverend Nowart.

63
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Your vision and your leadership within our community is going to be sorely missed.

64
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, something they all missed.

65
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:04,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope that you remember that you left a Patriots fan and hopefully you don't become a Steelers fan.

66
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:06,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much and God bless.

67
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:07,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

68
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:10,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Solicitor Runley.

69
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

70
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:12,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Reverend Nowart.

71
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:37,382
[SPEAKER_20]: I speak to you tonight just briefly and as a friend, and I only want to say one particular thing, that there's a quality of Christianity that you exhibit so well, and it's one that I've observed over all the times that we've been together in the past years, and that is you are genuine and authentic, and I've been blessed to know you.

72
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:38,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

73
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

74
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:43,324
[SPEAKER_15]: At this point, it gives me great pleasure to present this citation.

75
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,466
[SPEAKER_15]: to Reverend Noah Evans.

76
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:59,397
[SPEAKER_15]: The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Noah Evans, rector, Grace Episcopal Church, in recognition of your leadership to the members of the Grace Episcopal Church and to the community of the city of Medford.

77
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:13,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Since your arrival in 2008, the Grace Episcopal Church has seen 50% growth in attendance, significant growth in stewardship, growth in the Children's Center, and the completion of a major capital campaign

78
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,266
[SPEAKER_15]: in the building project at the parish.

79
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:26,711
[SPEAKER_15]: You've restarted the Protestant chaplaincy at Tufts University and have been a leader in the Medford Conversation project, as well as spearheaded green improvements throughout the parish.

80
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:34,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It is with great pleasure that the Medford City Council rises up to join you and your family and friends on this remarkable milestone.

81
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:41,477
[SPEAKER_15]: On the behalf of the citizens of the city of Medford, we wish you good fortune on your new home as rector at St.

82
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul's Episcopal Church

83
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:47,977
[SPEAKER_15]: in Mount Lebanon, the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

84
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:49,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

85
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:59,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

86
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:01,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

87
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:02,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

88
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:10,250
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been such a blessing to be able to serve both at Grace Church and be able to serve with you all in the city of Medford.

89
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:24,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much from this city and the way that you're committed to your life together and working things out and living in the diversity of this community and moving this changing community forward.

90
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:35,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, truly believe that Medford is a beacon to the world of a way for people to live together, especially a diverse people to live together.

91
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for all of your leadership.

92
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:38,635
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your leadership in that.

93
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:39,757
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an honor.

94
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:40,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

95
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:19,268
Oops.

96
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,314
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, Rick.

97
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we are.

98
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's a good shot.

99
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,862
[SPEAKER_20]: This is going to cost you $5, Capiello.

100
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:00,923
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

101
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:03,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Take it off my salary.

102
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

103
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:05,806
[SPEAKER_15]: It was awesome.

104
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:06,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

105
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,749
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that the parents can find someone that's as equal to you.

106
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,390
[SPEAKER_19]: They're great.

107
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:12,871
Great news.

108
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:42,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to return to regular audit business.

109
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:45,353
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-084 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

110
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:52,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the administration hire a full-time qualified grant writer.

111
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:53,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

112
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

113
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:02,862
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that I've put on the council agenda before, probably three, four years ago.

114
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:09,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something we discuss and bring up usually every budget season, if not more.

115
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:25,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And in light of what's gone on in the last several weeks especially, I believe that we truly need somebody qualified to help us write grants, to help our department heads write grants, to be able to tap into the funding that is out there.

116
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:31,460
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw and we've been discussing grants for police stations and other facilities.

117
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:44,675
[SPEAKER_06]: We just saw our neighbor Malden get $9.8 million in a grant, which is approximately half of the new build for their police station that just was opened in the last couple months.

118
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:47,816
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also other possibilities.

119
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:56,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we could start off by getting a mentor, somebody to help the people here at City Hall that do write an occasional grant.

120
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We are lucky and have good department heads that will write a grant here and there.

121
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:11,636
[SPEAKER_06]: but they're not dedicated full-time grant writers, and I think we're missing out on something that can be so beneficial and pay for itself tenfold, if not more.

122
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just something that I think the city needs.

123
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:27,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, grant mentor, I was given some information today from a resident who said that the service co-ops of retired executives make mentors available, so in the meantime, while we're exploring the possibility of

124
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:32,316
[SPEAKER_06]: hiring, whether it be a part-time or full-time grant writer, there are mentors out there.

125
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:40,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the things that the city needs to tap into so that we could do more projects and more projects that are needed.

126
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:49,080
[SPEAKER_06]: We could be able to spend more of our general fund on maintenance and things that, obviously, we sometimes fall short on.

127
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask for a roll call vote on this.

128
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:56,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really look into this to get a grant writer and put it in the next budget, if not sooner.

129
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

130
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:58,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

131
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I feel as though this is a great resolution.

132
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I second Councilor Longo's motion for approval.

133
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,874
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight, a roll call vote has been requested.

134
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:16,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dello Russo.

135
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:17,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

136
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:18,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco.

137
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:19,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

138
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:20,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

139
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:20,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

140
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

141
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:22,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

142
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:23,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Marks.

143
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:24,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

144
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:25,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

145
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:25,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

146
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

147
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

148
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:32,940
17.

149
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. Councilor Dello Russo.

150
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:38,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Second by Councilor Knight.

151
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:38,405
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-075.

152
00:12:56,237 --> 00:13:00,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Law and order.

153
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:05,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry, wrong one.

154
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,587
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-018, thank you.

155
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:15,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Committee of the whole meeting report from February 22nd, 2017 regarding the bond order for the police station.

156
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:21,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor De La Rosa.

157
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:40,140
[SPEAKER_17]: We have met in great detail, not only last Wednesday, but last night we received over the weekend of a number of responses as to questions that were sent to the administration.

158
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,941
[SPEAKER_17]: They've been answered.

159
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:50,708
[SPEAKER_17]: We had multiple opportunities for discussion, remonstration, and sharing of diverse opinions.

160
00:13:51,567 --> 00:14:02,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, we've gotten our answers and a motion to, as it was reported out of committee, motion to adopt the committee report.

161
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:07,259
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Solicitor Rumley wants to make a statement.

162
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:09,041
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

163
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,502
[SPEAKER_20]: I do have the mayor's communication that she had submitted to the council.

164
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:16,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

165
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:24,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if this would be the appropriate time with the reporting out of committee, but I think it would be, assuming that other procedural things fall into place.

166
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:28,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, motion by Councilor Dello Russo that the committee report be adopted.

167
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:31,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

168
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:32,087
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

169
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:32,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

170
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:33,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion.

171
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:35,268
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension.

172
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:35,308
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-086.

173
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:35,348
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-086.

174
00:14:42,828 --> 00:15:01,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Lungo, Kern, and Mox, be it resolved that the Energy and Environmental Office update the Medford City Council with regards to concerns they may have about 92 Main Street being on a flood plain.

175
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo, Kern.

176
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

177
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel a couple of these resolutions.

178
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,434
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 Main Street.

179
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,715
[SPEAKER_15]: 92 Main.

180
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:11,175
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 Main Street.

181
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:11,355
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 Main.

182
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:14,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel a couple of these resolutions probably come first.

183
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:19,253
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pertinent to, I think, something that will come in a little bit.

184
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:27,480
[SPEAKER_06]: It was brought to my attention that 90 Main Street is on a flood plain.

185
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Climate Change in Medford, it's a group that's working on mapping out the city.

186
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:37,593
[SPEAKER_06]: finding future floodplain issues.

187
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:44,338
[SPEAKER_06]: They did detailed mapping, including air quality, heat gain, sea level rise, and the potential flooding of lots.

188
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:48,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And 90 Maiden Street is on that list of a potential floodplain.

189
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:54,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's just extremely important to get an update from our Energy and Environment Office.

190
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:58,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if our consultant can discuss whether or not that's on a floodplain.

191
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:04,991
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure if anybody's here to answer any questions, because I know that's pertinent to

192
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,759
[SPEAKER_06]: potential vote that may take place in a little bit.

193
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:08,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

194
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

195
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to refer to the subcommittee on environmental affairs.

196
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:13,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

197
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:14,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

198
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:15,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

199
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:20,043
[SPEAKER_15]: All those, uh, all those in favor.

200
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:20,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

201
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:25,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

202
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:26,365
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't push a button.

203
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

204
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:30,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

205
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, that's all right.

206
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:36,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I concur with the sentiment of my colleague, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

207
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:47,056
[SPEAKER_21]: And where we have the gentleman from Dunneman Sweeney, is it possible maybe if you can get up and explain if this would have an impact on the cost of the project itself?

208
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,839
[SPEAKER_21]: If he's not able to answer that, Mr. President, that's fine.

209
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:58,663
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm just concerned that if this wasn't taken into consideration and if it needs to be taken into consideration.

210
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:00,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President?

211
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Donarusso.

212
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:11,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, do we need to be concerned that where it's on a flood plain, do we have to be concerned whether Route 16 and half of Medford Square will be swept away?

213
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,179
[SPEAKER_15]: I would hope that the gentleman maybe will have an answer for us.

214
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

215
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:17,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

216
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:21,905
[SPEAKER_29]: Jeff Shaw, Donovan Swinney, architects on 16 Jay Street in Somerville.

217
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:31,012
[SPEAKER_29]: I can say that it's always going to be a consideration for any project going into construction to take into consideration all of the environmental

218
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:34,639
[SPEAKER_29]: characteristics of this item.

219
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:44,883
[SPEAKER_21]: So Mr. President, if we could just ask, typically, in your opinion, what does this add to the overall cost of a project?

220
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:47,764
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we looking at, is there an industry standard?

221
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:52,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there an additional 10%, 20% that you add on to a cost?

222
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Or has that already been considered?

223
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:59,133
[SPEAKER_29]: The project, as was conceived, already has a budget.

224
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:02,475
[SPEAKER_29]: It considers the site costs at this point in time.

225
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:11,579
[SPEAKER_29]: The actual configuration and how the site is dealt with during construction would be done at that later date when the design is completed.

226
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,161
[SPEAKER_21]: So potentially there could be a request for additional funding if need be?

227
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,363
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think I can answer that question.

228
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:24,124
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it takes into consideration a hypothetical.

229
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,442
[SPEAKER_29]: information about.

230
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:29,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the fact that it's on a floodplain is not hypothetical.

231
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:34,270
[SPEAKER_29]: The fact that it's located in a design haven't been determined yet.

232
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:36,732
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't understand.

233
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:43,799
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know exactly if there would be any consideration of additional costs because we haven't done the actual design.

234
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,060
[SPEAKER_29]: So there may be none.

235
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:45,641
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

236
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:51,393
[SPEAKER_21]: We, we, we heard just the president last night that, uh, you know, money's tight in this community.

237
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:56,994
[SPEAKER_21]: And the only reason why we bring this up is that if there is an additional cost, I think we should know it ahead of time.

238
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:59,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, so that, that's the only reason why I ask.

239
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:06,977
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know if council longer current already made a recommendation, but I think we need to know, and maybe they have to do some more homework on it.

240
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:13,298
[SPEAKER_21]: But if there is additional cost because of the property being located in a floodplain, uh, according to,

241
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:16,029
[SPEAKER_21]: our own energy and environment office.

242
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,891
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd make that part of the report if council.

243
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:31,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think for the city engineer, well, the environmental office, do you have that referred to the environmental office?

244
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:32,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

245
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:42,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I may be pertinent to send into more to have more discussion in committee, but I think we need an update from our environment and energy environment office first.

246
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:58,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could get, have the administration look into a cost, if it is on a floodplain, how much, obviously Council Marks' amendment, but we need an update with regards to this before we meet in committee.

247
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:09,855
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could maybe change that around, get an update, get cost estimates, figure out how much additional cost it's gonna be, and get an update, and then we can put it into committee.

248
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask my colleagues to,

249
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,465
[SPEAKER_06]: get an update first.

250
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:18,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to withdraw the motion?

251
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:22,347
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is to send it to committee.

252
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like that withdrawn so we can get an update first.

253
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,869
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't something that can linger in committee for months and months.

254
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have eight months.

255
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it would be incumbent upon the committee to meet and to request the pertinent information that's necessary to get the questions answered.

256
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:39,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Committee can meet as soon as possible and get the pertinent information?

257
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,252
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to get this information.

258
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,561
[SPEAKER_06]: meet with the information, and then ask additional questions.

259
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:52,723
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason why we have to delay it two, three full weeks to even refer the questions out.

260
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:54,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We're being rushed.

261
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:56,905
[SPEAKER_06]: This is being shoved down our throat.

262
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:58,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We have questions that need to be answered.

263
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:04,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And this should be answered first before we send it to committee in a month or two, whenever we decide to meet.

264
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:10,250
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd ask for a roll call vote on my resolution to get an update.

265
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:18,409
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Lockern to get an update on the flood plain conditions.

266
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:19,910
[SPEAKER_06]: From Ms.

267
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia Hunt.

268
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a committee working on it right now.

269
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:35,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there was a committee meeting, I'm not exactly sure when it was scheduled for, but it was pretty recent and this was information that was divulged.

270
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:40,345
[SPEAKER_06]: We just would like her written opinion on it and to know more information.

271
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't at that meeting.

272
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:47,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't exactly know when it was, but it's information that we need as soon as possible, not in a few months.

273
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:49,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

274
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:57,639
[SPEAKER_15]: So your motion is to get an update from, from, from the office of environment and energy regards to the floodplain.

275
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there will be any additional costs regarding the product.

276
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, please.

277
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:09,168
[SPEAKER_15]: On the second by Councilor Marks, second by Councilor Marks, all those in favor roll call.

278
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:13,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

279
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So the motion to refer to the committee is withdrawn?

280
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:17,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

281
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:20,858
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it'll also go to committee also.

282
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,601
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get an update from the city engineer.

283
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:31,504
[SPEAKER_13]: The table before the council at this point in time is to request the information and then have a subcommittee scheduled so that they can be discussed.

284
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:31,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

285
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:36,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

286
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:37,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dello Russo?

287
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:37,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

288
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:39,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

289
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:40,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

290
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:42,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

291
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:45,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

292
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:45,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

293
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:47,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

294
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:47,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

295
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:48,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative.

296
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:49,253
[SPEAKER_15]: None negative.

297
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:53,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

298
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,234
[SPEAKER_15]: 17 0 8 7 offered by Councilors.

299
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:57,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Lungo-Koehn and vice-president mocks.

300
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:01,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the city of Medford update the Medford city council.

301
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:10,498
[SPEAKER_15]: We regard to who has been hired to be the OPM on this project manager for the, for the potential new building at 92 main street council Lungo-Koehn.

302
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:13,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we could just get an update.

303
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:17,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure somebody would be able to answer this today.

304
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:20,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to be the owner's project manager?

305
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:24,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that needs to be decided before we go out for architectural studies.

306
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:30,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lomax.

307
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:32,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

308
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,974
[SPEAKER_21]: We have the mayor's staff here.

309
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:40,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe they can enlighten us on who's going to be the OPM for this particular project.

310
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark Rumley, City Solicitor.

311
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:49,376
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not under my jurisdiction at all, but I can tell you this, that no one has been designated at this juncture.

312
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a plan to designate someone?

313
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:52,498
[SPEAKER_20]: There has to be.

314
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,919
[SPEAKER_20]: It's required under the law for a project of this size.

315
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,121
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's required prior to any design, is that correct?

316
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,042
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it is not.

317
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:03,264
[SPEAKER_20]: It's required during the design phase, which hasn't begun yet.

318
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,745
[SPEAKER_20]: So when does the design phase start?

319
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:10,808
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, once we get a loan order to pay for the design services, the architectural services.

320
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:16,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the way I read the law, it says that OPM has to be hired before the project designer.

321
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:18,038
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

322
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:19,398
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're on the same page.

323
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,779
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we're pretty much same page.

324
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:21,800
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also concurrently.

325
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,480
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

326
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,961
[SPEAKER_20]: If you want to use that synonym, that might work also.

327
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:26,022
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine with me.

328
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:26,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

329
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:30,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

330
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,885
[SPEAKER_26]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street, Medford, Mass.

331
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:50,570
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually have in front of me from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the Office of Administration and Finance for the Division of Capital Asset Management, the Owner's Project Manager Guidelines for Mass General Law, Chapter 149, Section 44A 1⁄2.

332
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,572
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to read it, just to be clear.

333
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:55,733
[SPEAKER_26]: Effective on July 19, 2004,

334
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:08,700
[SPEAKER_26]: Chapter 193 of the Acts of 2004 inserted a new provision into Mass General Law 14944, which governs public building procurement.

335
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:23,044
[SPEAKER_26]: The new provision requires public awarding authorities to engage the services of an owner's project manager on all building projects estimated to cost $1.5 million or more.

336
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:38,613
[SPEAKER_26]: The law requires that the owner's project manager, also known as the OPM, be hired before the project designer, meet required minimal qualification standards, and be selected through a qualifications-based selection process.

337
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:57,419
[SPEAKER_26]: The OPM acts as the awarding authority's agent and consultant throughout the project from the design through completion and must be completely independent from the designer, general contractor, and any subcontractors involved in the projects at all times.

338
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:03,401
[SPEAKER_26]: The law provides a listing of the minimally required duties of the OPM as follows.

339
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:05,682
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'll just read this and then I'll stop.

340
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:26,662
[SPEAKER_26]: The duties of the owner's project manager shall include, but need not be limited to, providing advice and consultation with respect to design, value engineering, scope of work, cost estimating, general contractor and subcontractor prequalifications pursuant to 44D.5 or 44D.75 where applicable.

341
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:50,220
[SPEAKER_26]: scheduling, construction, the selection, negotiation with oversight of a designer, and as a control standards for monitoring performance of the building project and assisting in project evaluation, including but not limited to written evaluation of the performance of the design professional.

342
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,624
[SPEAKER_26]: contractors, and subcontractors.

343
00:26:53,124 --> 00:27:01,851
[SPEAKER_26]: And attached to this seven-page document, it outlines what the OPM is required to do by law and what you can ask them to do.

344
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:07,695
[SPEAKER_26]: According to this law, your OPM should have been hired before you even engaged with the architect.

345
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:11,138
[SPEAKER_26]: And I can give that to you so you guys can see it.

346
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:11,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

347
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:12,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

348
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:19,885
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion.

349
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:24,064
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Montz.

350
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:28,345
[SPEAKER_21]: So we ask that we be apprised of who the OPM is once the selection is made.

351
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:28,825
[SPEAKER_15]: That is correct.

352
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:28,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

353
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,306
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

354
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:30,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

355
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:32,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

356
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:38,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, while we're on suspension, could we take a paper off the table?

357
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:40,830
[SPEAKER_15]: And which one would you like that to be?

358
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,650
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like that paper to be

359
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:51,289
On the motion of Councilor Dello Russo to take paper 17075 off the table.

360
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Dello Russo.

361
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:54,552
[SPEAKER_19]: Present.

362
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:56,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to approve.

363
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:59,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve by Councilor Dello Russo.

364
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,291
[SPEAKER_15]: seconded by Councilor Knight.

365
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:18,552
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

366
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:26,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote is required, Mr. Clerk.

367
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:31,955
[SPEAKER_15]: The only update I have is whatever you received from the mayor this afternoon.

368
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Asking to take its first reading.

369
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:37,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

370
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:38,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lococo.

371
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:50,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that's a motion for approval, okay, of the paper.

372
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:56,305
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just didn't know if we had any updates from anybody before we take that vote.

373
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,967
[SPEAKER_15]: The only update you have is whatever the mayor sent you earlier today.

374
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the people should be apprised of it.

375
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:02,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

376
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address of the record.

377
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Bill O'Brien, president of local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street.

378
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:12,696
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just coming up here, council, that we'd like this paper read aloud.

379
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:26,809
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Mark Rumley, city solicitor.

380
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

381
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:45,680
[SPEAKER_20]: The communication that the council received late this afternoon or early this evening, I have with me tonight, the mayor has asked that I read it because not everybody has received a copy and that would give them the information of what's included.

382
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:49,898
[SPEAKER_20]: and it is to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

383
00:29:51,119 --> 00:30:04,529
[SPEAKER_20]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, this month I have put before the City Council my request for a loan order to finance the cost of architectural services for a new police station at 90 Main Street.

384
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,073
[SPEAKER_20]: I consider this long overdue effort to be one of which we can all be proud.

385
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:12,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Concurrently,

386
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:19,803
[SPEAKER_20]: I have heard the concerns of the Medford firefighters about their training facility and fire headquarters on Main Street.

387
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:28,468
[SPEAKER_20]: With this in mind, I have met with representatives of the fire department and have given them my commitment to address their concerns.

388
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:34,992
[SPEAKER_20]: And as I said last night, my commitment will be more than words, it is action.

389
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,574
[SPEAKER_20]: The action to which I commit is as follows.

390
00:30:40,836 --> 00:30:51,304
[SPEAKER_20]: I will appoint a working group of fire personnel to assess appropriate sites for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower.

391
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:59,030
[SPEAKER_20]: The amount of $500,000 will be appropriated for the construction of a fire training tower.

392
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:05,415
[SPEAKER_20]: The sites to be reviewed will include but not be limited to the current headquarters.

393
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:07,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Number two.

394
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:15,718
[SPEAKER_20]: The working group will submit a written report to the mayor 18 months after it commences its assessment.

395
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:24,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Its report will primarily include its recommendation as to preferred sites for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters.

396
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:29,268
[SPEAKER_20]: It shall also recommend a site for a fire training tower.

397
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:35,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Number three, after the mayor receives the recommendations of the working group,

398
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:43,571
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor will seek cost estimates for the construction of the new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower.

399
00:31:45,292 --> 00:32:02,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Number four, the mayor will submit a loan order to request of the city council to finance the costs of architectural services for a new fire station slash headquarters no later than the end of fiscal year 2019, provided the working group

400
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:07,864
[SPEAKER_20]: meets all the above deadlines and requirements.

401
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:11,047
[SPEAKER_20]: I am proud to make this commitment.

402
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:18,754
[SPEAKER_20]: I consider it the best way to serve those who serve us so well, the members of our police and fire departments.

403
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:23,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Respectfully submitted, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

404
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:24,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

405
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:25,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Solicitor Rumley.

406
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:29,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

407
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:31,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

408
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:37,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We did meet a couple hours last night with regards to some additional questions.

409
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:38,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

410
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Our treasurer, if you could come up, Ms.

411
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:40,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Irwin.

412
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:51,984
[SPEAKER_06]: We had requested just the numbers of that break-even point of where we would have to possibly do an override, and you said you'd provide those to us today.

413
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:57,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get a handout to the clerk's office today, so hopefully you received that.

414
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see that.

415
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:13,742
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a legal sheet on the back.

416
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:21,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you could maybe just break this down for us.

417
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:21,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

418
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:29,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I, as I, um, we talked about last night, the, uh, new growth and how we were going to be able to consider that in the future.

419
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:34,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, Councilor Kern, you asked us to maybe do a 10-year average.

420
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:45,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we did was I looked back, starting in 2005 through 2017, and the average new growth was about 1.1 million.

421
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:50,542
[SPEAKER_07]: But that factored in a couple of years that were really meager.

422
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,763
[SPEAKER_07]: 2005, I believe, and 2011, we had some really short new growth.

423
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:05,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we did going forward on the first page, if you look, is that we used 1.75 as a new growth number.

424
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:22,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually you can see on page three that our levy of 105 million, just below that you'll see a 2.5 increase and then a new growth number of 1.75.

425
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:25,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that brings us to $4,378,000.

426
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:36,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And that continues all the way down through, let's see, FY, looks like FY 31, all the way down.

427
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:45,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So that number on the end there, 4378-373, is the amount of revenue that we'll be able to levy going forward.

428
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:52,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we did was take that number, and then if you do look on the first sheet,

429
00:34:53,648 --> 00:35:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll see that it's a little convoluted, but I think if you stay with me, you can follow it.

430
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:14,612
[SPEAKER_07]: The first column is personnel, and that is then followed by ordinary income, which is, I mean, revenue, which is just about everything, and then enterprise and debt.

431
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:20,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we did was take personnel, and we increased that by 2% each fiscal year.

432
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:30,766
[SPEAKER_07]: We took out the insurance costs and multiplied those out at an 8% increase each year going forward.

433
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:40,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the final column, you'll see that we have, in 2017, $3,475,000 worth of debt service.

434
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:50,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And going forward, as we get into the years where we'll start to pay back the architect and the police construction

435
00:35:51,724 --> 00:36:01,788
[SPEAKER_07]: fees, debt service, you'll see on the right-hand side that we will have an increase in our budget in FY18 of $4,020,000, excuse me, and we'll have a levy of $4,378,000.

436
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you following me?

437
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:04,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I making sense?

438
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that gives us $357,000 left.

439
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you follow that down,

440
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:32,772
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to see that in 2020, we will be in a deficit of $998,000, which is going to require free cash to make those debt payments.

441
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:37,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Going beyond that, we level out for a while.

442
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:38,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the schools are paid.

443
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:51,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the second to last one, you'll see that that includes a payment for a new fire station with the architect.

444
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:52,375
[SPEAKER_07]: rolled into it.

445
00:36:53,455 --> 00:37:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that brings us to a $6,454,000 increase in our budget, but we'll get $5,204,000 in our levy, which will then again require an infusion of free cash.

446
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:09,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

447
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,580
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may ask questions of the chair.

448
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So this breakdown, I understand the breakdown.

449
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this just with regards to our police station or this is if we did both?

450
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:19,322
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see at the bottom,

451
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:34,086
[SPEAKER_07]: In FY25, there's a payment, which would, it would essentially mean that the police would come online first, and then in five years, we would have the fire come online, a fire bond.

452
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:35,486
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2025?

453
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:36,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

454
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the first debt service payment.

455
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:41,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

456
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:49,983
[SPEAKER_06]: 2020 with just doing the police station, we're going to need to borrow from free cash to balance the budget.

457
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:50,663
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

458
00:37:50,703 --> 00:38:00,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So by you telling us that, that means we will not be able to put another bond on our books unless we were going to take more from free cash until 2021.

459
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless we had an infusion of more new growth.

460
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:08,266
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just projections.

461
00:38:08,306 --> 00:38:10,687
[SPEAKER_07]: These aren't hard and fast numbers, certainly.

462
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:11,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would have to see

463
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,611
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what happens in the next fiscal year.

464
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

465
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:22,534
[SPEAKER_06]: There'd never be enough new growth to sustain a, like a library in between the police and the fire.

466
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:22,814
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

467
00:38:31,297 --> 00:38:31,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

468
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:33,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I understand the breakdown.

469
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice president Moss.

470
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,840
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could, and thank you for providing this in.

471
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:52,911
[SPEAKER_21]: My question last night was, at what point, because we were told if we were moving forward with the police headquarters, there was no talk about any Proposition 2.5 override.

472
00:38:53,372 --> 00:39:02,339
[SPEAKER_21]: It was only when we mentioned about combining police and fire headquarters, it was mentioned last night, well, we're going to need a Proposition 2.5 override to afford that.

473
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,221
[SPEAKER_21]: And my question was, at what dollar amount

474
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,115
[SPEAKER_21]: triggers the two and a half override.

475
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:10,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thought that's what you were going to provide.

476
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:13,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can't give you the exact dollar amount.

477
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:25,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you that we would be, uh, with 1 million with the police station and a dual, uh, facility, we'd be at about two and a half million, uh, in the negative in 2018.

478
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:32,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would require an override because we, I don't know where else we would get it to pay for in the next 30 years.

479
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:34,853
[SPEAKER_07]: every year.

480
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:39,877
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're saying an additional $2 million every year if we were to build?

481
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:41,317
[SPEAKER_21]: A dual facility.

482
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:42,178
[SPEAKER_21]: A dual facility.

483
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:42,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

484
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,102
[SPEAKER_21]: And the need, based on the current $38 million you're talking?

485
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:49,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

486
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:58,849
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we were able to offset some of that with free cash, the $9 million in free cash, or if we were able to offset that with some grant funding?

487
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:01,522
[SPEAKER_21]: That would no longer be the case, correct?

488
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:10,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, those are scenarios that I can't give you a definite answer to that it would or would not require an override today.

489
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:11,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say that.

490
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:23,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say fairly certainly that, you know, a $2.5 million deficit probably would require it because that's an ongoing debt that would be 30 years.

491
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be continuing, excuse me, for 30 years.

492
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:31,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a one-year thing where we could borrow free cash.

493
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, our free cash is our rainy day fund, our stabilization fund.

494
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:41,774
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't use it to pay debt service for 30 years.

495
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:46,795
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but you can use it in cases of public safety and needs that arise.

496
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:55,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and generally in cases where you're using it for a one-time fix or an emergency or something to that effect, but for debt service that's going to be

497
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 years, you know, using free cash is not wise, and it's obviously not something we can afford to do.

498
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:07,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

499
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:11,933
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess my question is that we heard tonight from the mayor and her response.

500
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:23,135
[SPEAKER_21]: So just so I understand, it appears that we're not looking for at least a payment if we were eventually to go through with a new fire station.

501
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:25,775
[SPEAKER_21]: The first payment wouldn't come until

502
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:28,972
[SPEAKER_21]: 2025?

503
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:28,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

504
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:33,375
[SPEAKER_21]: And typically, how long does it take for us to pay off?

505
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:37,278
[SPEAKER_21]: When would the building be built in order for us to have a first payment?

506
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:42,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it wouldn't necessarily mean when it's built, but when we go to bond.

507
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:54,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would get the architect first, then we would wait for the plans, and then we would do some cost estimates, and then we would go to bond based on your approval.

508
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:00,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would have a payment probably about 18 months after we bonded.

509
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:01,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

510
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:04,957
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just trying to figure out the time frame.

511
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:20,708
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we were to move forward with the proposal that was mentioned tonight, and the firefighters got together with their group, and the firefighters, after their due diligence of 18 months, which puts us in what, 2019,

512
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,149
[SPEAKER_21]: make their recommendations to the mayor.

513
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:33,455
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor then moves forward, as she stated within the paper, that she will initiate another design.

514
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:36,358
[SPEAKER_07]: She would anticipate a loan order.

515
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:37,318
[SPEAKER_21]: For another design.

516
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,180
[SPEAKER_07]: For architectural fees, correct.

517
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,802
[SPEAKER_21]: And that would take us how long, roughly?

518
00:42:44,124 --> 00:42:45,005
[SPEAKER_07]: For the plans?

519
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:47,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say probably 10 months, same as the police station.

520
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,408
[SPEAKER_21]: So close to a year, so that brings us to 2020.

521
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:53,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we get that back, and then we go out for an RFP once we get

522
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:55,997
[SPEAKER_21]: The design, which takes how long?

523
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:57,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Roughly?

524
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say probably six months.

525
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:02,862
[SPEAKER_21]: Six months.

526
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:04,003
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's mid of 2020.

527
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:09,147
[SPEAKER_21]: And then what happens between the next five years?

528
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:11,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that when the building's built?

529
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:18,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have to prepare for building it and provided all those things go into, you know, into sync.

530
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:19,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

531
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:22,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at some point we would be here again asking for a bond.

532
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:26,156
[SPEAKER_07]: and we would do that borrowing based on the timeframe.

533
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:33,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally, we want the schools to be paid for before we can go forward on that project.

534
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:44,001
[SPEAKER_21]: So what was stated last night more or less is being stated again tonight that we're looking at 2025 before we see anything.

535
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:44,581
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

536
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:50,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't believe so because we also, if we bond an architect,

537
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:59,008
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2019, excuse me, we have five years to repay that or roll that into a new construction bond.

538
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:03,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would obviously anticipate rolling that into a construction bond.

539
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:07,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would have to do that within a five-year period.

540
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:14,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And the goal is to get that done sooner rather than later, but not until the schools come offline.

541
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:15,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

542
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:18,512
[SPEAKER_21]: So it seems like we can't afford this until 2025.

543
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:22,848
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we can start the project.

544
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:24,509
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't afford the debt service.

545
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:31,831
[SPEAKER_07]: We could probably even afford it in 2024 based on these numbers.

546
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:35,253
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would give us a little breathing room.

547
00:44:36,713 --> 00:44:41,655
[SPEAKER_07]: If you see right here, we'll have excess of $329,000 in the year before.

548
00:44:41,735 --> 00:44:44,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we take on that debt, it would probably be similar.

549
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:45,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

550
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:56,699
[SPEAKER_21]: But, but it seems like, uh, from what I gathered last night, the city's trying to get away as far down the line as possible from the year 2020 when the police department comes online as a payment.

551
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that, is that not correct?

552
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:05,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to get as far away as possible to come as far away, but we're trying to absorb the costs of the police department and get out back on our feet.

553
00:45:06,026 --> 00:45:07,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the, uh,

554
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:08,876
[SPEAKER_21]: The fire department.

555
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:19,319
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just trying to figure out for the firefighters when they could possibly, if everything works out perfect and we know it's not a perfect world, when they could possibly see a new fire station.

556
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:20,979
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I'm trying to gather.

557
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:28,661
[SPEAKER_21]: And if it's 2025 or 2024, I don't know, but I think some type of timeline.

558
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:31,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the dates that the debt service would be due.

559
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:34,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we bond,

560
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:39,387
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't make those debt service payments sometimes for a year or 18 months after.

561
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:40,687
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I asked you.

562
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:41,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

563
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:43,288
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could come online before that.

564
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:46,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any way we can get a timeline?

565
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:50,029
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, is there any way we can get some type of time?

566
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:57,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe the firefighters have this in their head already, but I'm trying to get my hands around it just to see what the timeline is on this.

567
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The timeline shapes up as it goes along.

568
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:02,812
[SPEAKER_07]: As the mayor indicated in her letter, by FY19,

569
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:09,724
[SPEAKER_07]: If we bond an architect, we are on our way to building a fire station.

570
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:14,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And so once that starts, then there are obviously, you know.

571
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but it seems, you're right, 2019.

572
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:23,190
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't tell you what those are, but once we bond it, then our debt service, we can roll it into another bond.

573
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,212
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do this, you know, there are other ways to look at it.

574
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:27,772
[SPEAKER_21]: And I realize what you're saying.

575
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:30,714
[SPEAKER_21]: My only concern is that 2019 and 2024 and 25 is a big difference.

576
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,672
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, that's a five-year span.

577
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,694
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think the process takes that long, to be quite honest.

578
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:40,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And it may not.

579
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not.

580
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:43,316
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been here through the building of the new schools.

581
00:46:43,456 --> 00:46:44,957
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been here through the DPW.

582
00:46:45,258 --> 00:46:46,699
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been here under a lot of projects.

583
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:48,840
[SPEAKER_21]: And it seems like a long time.

584
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:50,441
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to fight it.

585
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:50,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And it may not.

586
00:46:50,902 --> 00:46:52,523
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to avoid escalation costs.

587
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:58,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to start and get architectural services and get cost estimates and then wait three years.

588
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:01,054
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to lose money.

589
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:04,238
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to wait so we don't have to go towards proposition two and a half, correct?

590
00:47:04,979 --> 00:47:06,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we can't do that in 2017.

591
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:06,822
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I mean, even 2020.

592
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:12,728
[SPEAKER_07]: 2020 is going to be a tough year, yes.

593
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:22,610
[SPEAKER_21]: If the process was sped up, just say the process weren't perfect, in 2020 would we be able to go out for a bond with a new fire station?

594
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:22,771
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

595
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:24,671
[SPEAKER_21]: No, okay, so that's what I'm getting at.

596
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:28,312
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're looking down the line for a purpose.

597
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:30,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not looking at 2025.

598
00:47:32,593 --> 00:47:35,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when our debt service becomes due.

599
00:47:35,514 --> 00:47:37,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, so it might be the year before that, I understand.

600
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

601
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:44,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand your situation where you're saying there's a big time gap between 2019 and 2024.

602
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,501
[SPEAKER_07]: There's five years there.

603
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not necessarily how it's all going to happen.

604
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when you're at the end of fiscal 19, you're going to move right into fiscal 20.

605
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,847
[SPEAKER_07]: You're already in fiscal 20.

606
00:47:57,927 --> 00:47:59,768
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the year that we have to get through.

607
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:09,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would still be waiting for architectural services to do their plans and to come back to us and have cost estimates and do our FPs

608
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:13,639
[SPEAKER_07]: and then decide how much we're going to spend and how we're going to pay for it.

609
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:15,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we would start the bonding process.

610
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:16,780
[SPEAKER_21]: But remember, it's 2017.

611
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,162
[SPEAKER_21]: We already kicked the can to 2019, saying this is when their recommendation is going to come out.

612
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:25,723
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've already bought ourselves almost two years.

613
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:30,885
[SPEAKER_21]: So it just sounds like a real lengthy process.

614
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:35,127
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want the firefighters to know when we could eventually see a building

615
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:41,502
[SPEAKER_21]: and having a timeline, just a sketch of a draft saying this is the timeline.

616
00:48:41,762 --> 00:48:48,687
[SPEAKER_21]: We look to get back the firefighters proposal this, you know, 2019 in May of 2019.

617
00:48:50,189 --> 00:48:54,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Shortly after that, the Bay is going to go out for an architectural design in June of 2019.

618
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:58,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we're going to get back and review this for six months.

619
00:48:58,555 --> 00:49:00,196
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you could put that together.

620
00:49:00,236 --> 00:49:01,037
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't seem like

621
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,320
[SPEAKER_21]: complex.

622
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:16,427
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said there are a lot of factors that go into that and you know the mayor's had conversations regarding this and she's eager to get this headquarters built or fire station built.

623
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:20,749
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have to be patient with regard to our debt and that's all I can tell you.

624
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:22,589
[SPEAKER_21]: I know she's eager but we're equally as eager.

625
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:28,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody is eager and as I said the longer we go the escalation costs are greater

626
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:32,742
[SPEAKER_07]: and it doesn't behoove us to, would there are other projects that are going to want to come online?

627
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:34,283
[SPEAKER_21]: And I agree with you.

628
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:42,725
[SPEAKER_21]: I was prepared to vote on a combined center last week, so I don't want to wait another day, but needless to say, that doesn't seem to be the druthers of the administration.

629
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:45,506
[SPEAKER_21]: So all I want to know is what is the timeline?

630
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:52,988
[SPEAKER_21]: If you don't have it tonight, I would ask that the administration provide us, at least for myself, would be very helpful to see a timeline.

631
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:55,580
[SPEAKER_21]: on when this is all gonna take place.

632
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I just gave you anticipated dates.

633
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:01,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can extrapolate from there.

634
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:05,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot guarantee you when we're gonna have a ribbon cutting at a fire station.

635
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:10,630
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't wanna guarantee, but I think the firefighters should have an idea if it's 2024 or if it's 2027.

636
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,652
[SPEAKER_21]: I think they should have an idea.

637
00:50:12,692 --> 00:50:20,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, clearly we've factored it in as a debt service payment for 2025, which means that it would be bonded sometime in 2020.

638
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:23,195
[SPEAKER_07]: 21, 22 maybe, maybe 23.

639
00:50:23,276 --> 00:50:24,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're looking at 24, 2024.

640
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:25,396
[SPEAKER_07]: For the building to open?

641
00:50:25,576 --> 00:50:25,997
[SPEAKER_07]: For it to open?

642
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,881
[SPEAKER_07]: We got some type of building.

643
00:50:36,762 --> 00:50:41,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not the procurement person, and I'm not the builder.

644
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:43,326
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just trying to get a handle in.

645
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:43,727
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all.

646
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:44,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

647
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:52,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the mayor has worked with the firefighters to let them know how eager she is to have this happen, as we all are.

648
00:50:52,934 --> 00:51:03,782
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, no one's going to be dragging their feet in 2022 about- Point of clarification, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

649
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:08,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though nobody's dragging their feet and we're eager, you also just said we can't afford it till 2025.

650
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:14,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we can, we're still going to have to take $1,000,000.25 from free cash to do it.

651
00:51:14,177 --> 00:51:18,078
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said we couldn't afford really to do a dual facility.

652
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:27,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But your breakdown says we're still going to have to take almost $1,000,000.25 from free cash in 2025 when the fire station comes on the books.

653
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:28,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

654
00:51:28,342 --> 00:51:29,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And we could do that in 2024.

655
00:51:31,014 --> 00:51:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the schools will no longer be online.

656
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,918
[SPEAKER_07]: That goes away, all that debt.

657
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:39,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but I thought that was factored in and we still needed to take from free cash.

658
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:43,504
[SPEAKER_07]: We still will need to take from free cash because we have other borrowings.

659
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:45,986
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my, yeah.

660
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:47,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

661
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:49,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

662
00:51:49,369 --> 00:52:00,678
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all assuming that we don't receive any outside funding sources, number one, and number two, that we don't also incur any acquisition, land acquisition costs to find a new facility.

663
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:03,537
[SPEAKER_11]: for to locate a new facility.

664
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:07,438
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not in the existing facility, then there might be land acquisition costs as well.

665
00:52:07,718 --> 00:52:09,218
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be a dynamic and moving object.

666
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:09,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

667
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:12,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Member O'Connor.

668
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:13,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you all set?

669
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:16,099
[SPEAKER_21]: I had another question.

670
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

671
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,780
[SPEAKER_21]: And Anne, I appreciate all the information.

672
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,761
[SPEAKER_21]: If you could put together some type of timeline, that'd be very helpful.

673
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:28,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure the firefighters would like to see a timeline.

674
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,002
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know it's not exact,

675
00:52:30,623 --> 00:52:32,284
[SPEAKER_21]: something that at least we can go by.

676
00:52:32,304 --> 00:52:37,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be happy to work with ShopCon, who's our procurement director, and with the mayor's office.

677
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:38,046
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great.

678
00:52:38,066 --> 00:52:38,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

679
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:47,190
[SPEAKER_21]: My other question, Mr. President, is regarding the advisory committee that's set up under this particular agreement.

680
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:52,392
[SPEAKER_21]: It is just consisting of all firefighter personnel.

681
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:53,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

682
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:55,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe so, no.

683
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:58,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's a working group that will be

684
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:02,460
[SPEAKER_07]: have mayoral appointees, and have appointees by the fire chief.

685
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,403
[SPEAKER_21]: So it says, I will appoint a working group of fire personnel.

686
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:11,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there will be people besides fire personnel on there.

687
00:53:15,511 --> 00:53:15,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

688
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:21,115
[SPEAKER_21]: So do we know what it's going to consist of?

689
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:24,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me, Treasurer.

690
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:35,765
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't, no one has been appointed yet, but when I was speaking to the mayor today, she talked about her conversations with the chief and the chief alluded to that last night, that he was going to be providing her with some suggestions also.

691
00:53:36,325 --> 00:53:42,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know that she had also talked with the president of the union about that, but there have been no names designated.

692
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:51,550
[SPEAKER_20]: I think if your question is if they are going to be exclusively Medford firefighters, I think that certainly they're going to be represented to a significant and substantive degree.

693
00:53:51,863 --> 00:54:03,892
[SPEAKER_20]: but there could be other professional people that are engaged in not necessarily like fire departments and buildings and that sort of thing or the proper locations.

694
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,593
[SPEAKER_20]: There are all kinds of people that could

695
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:07,975
[SPEAKER_20]: lend relevant information to this.

696
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:13,337
[SPEAKER_20]: But the thrust of this and the substance of this is to have fire personnel on this working group.

697
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:16,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Even the numbers, I haven't heard what numbers they're going to be like.

698
00:54:16,718 --> 00:54:17,098
[SPEAKER_20]: How many?

699
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,919
[SPEAKER_21]: So could we just reword that?

700
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:27,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Because when you read it, honestly, this is I understand your sentiments, Councilor, and the reason we can't reword it is this is a statement of commitment by the mayor

701
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,643
[SPEAKER_20]: and I'm not authorized to change that wording.

702
00:54:29,743 --> 00:54:33,664
[SPEAKER_21]: But under this commitment, the mayor is saying it's going to exist solely of fire personnel.

703
00:54:33,724 --> 00:54:36,906
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the way, I don't see how else you'd read that.

704
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:42,088
[SPEAKER_20]: You can define fire personnel as being members of the Medford Fire Department, and that certainly would be true.

705
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:47,690
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can also define it as fire professionals, perhaps who are retired, who are not on the active force.

706
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, fire personnel.

707
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:48,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

708
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:57,194
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we're going to get down to nuance, definitionally, what working group of fire personnel means, we could take some time with that

709
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:08,643
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think that the honest truth is that this commitment indicates that the mayor is working with our immediate fire personnel, being the chief, and has talked to the union leadership about this.

710
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:20,486
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't think anybody feels for one second that Medford fire personnel are not going to be a substantial part of this, but there's always the possibility there could be retirees or others who could lend their experience and talents to this.

711
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:27,107
[SPEAKER_21]: The only reason why I want to bring it up is because when the original proposal was made two weeks ago,

712
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,640
[SPEAKER_21]: there was no input from, uh, the fire rank and fire personnel.

713
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,301
[SPEAKER_21]: There was no input from the rank and file police department.

714
00:55:34,661 --> 00:55:44,064
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to make sure now as this process goes along, that at least where we're talking about a new fire headquarters, that the fire department personnel be at the table.

715
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:44,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

716
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:46,765
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's the only reason why I bring it up.

717
00:55:47,005 --> 00:55:47,205
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

718
00:55:47,285 --> 00:55:48,825
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think those sentiments are prudent.

719
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:53,327
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand those, those sentiments and there is the mayoral commitment before the council this evening.

720
00:55:54,327 --> 00:55:54,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

721
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:59,809
[SPEAKER_21]: So Mr. President, just one of the, one of the question if I could.

722
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:23,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, so, uh, onto a council and I mentioned if, uh, this working group were to get together and decide that, uh, uh, they need a new fire station possibly, uh, behind here at city hall and a lot behind city hall and, uh, their training, uh, tower, uh, possibly in another section of the city on a private property that needs to be purchased.

723
00:56:24,386 --> 00:56:30,350
[SPEAKER_21]: These factors will all be taken into consideration regarding the cost, correct?

724
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:31,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

725
00:56:31,651 --> 00:56:43,099
[SPEAKER_07]: But the architect has a $10 million land acquisition line item in the proposal that he has if we were to build a dual facility on a new site.

726
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:51,445
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously, the $18 million price tag for the fire station at the current site would change if there were land acquisition costs.

727
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,773
[SPEAKER_21]: So the current cost of $38 million has a $10 million built in or no?

728
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,596
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's what would be for dual site at the present site.

729
00:57:01,196 --> 00:57:06,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But the larger one, which I think is 49 million includes a $10 million land acquisition fee.

730
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:06,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

731
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,683
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember seeing that one, but was that part of what we were given?

732
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:11,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That was part of the original one.

733
00:57:11,884 --> 00:57:12,684
[SPEAKER_21]: 49 million.

734
00:57:13,345 --> 00:57:13,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

735
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:15,426
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

736
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:17,028
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

737
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

738
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:31,996
[SPEAKER_06]: A few things with regards to, I know there's a number of requests and serious issues on the police side that need to be taken care of before this build out in two years.

739
00:57:32,096 --> 00:57:35,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that has been provided to the administration.

740
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:45,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So with regards to, is there any going to be anything done to the police station, current police station within the two year period to resolve those issues?

741
00:57:45,746 --> 00:57:50,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the same token, we have now nine years before,

742
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,556
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, possible nine years before a new fire station is built.

743
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:58,598
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be online before nine years.

744
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:00,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, 2017, 2025, eight, nine years.

745
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:06,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but 2025 is, again, when a debt service payment would be made, so it could be two years before that.

746
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:12,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Point being, there's some serious concerns in station one on the fire side.

747
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:17,684
[SPEAKER_06]: What will we be doing for both departments in the meantime to make sure

748
00:58:19,123 --> 00:58:31,507
[SPEAKER_06]: living conditions and working conditions are up to par, such as the mold and the asbestos and the building coming apart with rainwater coming in.

749
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:32,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some of the living conditions.

750
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:35,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to put any money into either department?

751
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:41,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if it's a question for you, but... I would have to defer to either the chief of staff or the city solicitor.

752
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:47,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if we can maybe get an idea on that, because not only that, but thankfully,

753
00:58:48,299 --> 00:59:06,483
[SPEAKER_06]: If this all pans out, we have two years for the police, 789 for the fire department, and there's some, we discussed them last night, those issues I've already mentioned, plus the diesel trucks in with the kitchen, in with the equipment, you know, a number of different things that need to be addressed now.

754
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know, Chief, I know there's been a list given to the mayor.

755
00:59:10,644 --> 00:59:17,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly what's on it, but when I walk in your station, I feel like it's unsafe for the officers that are in there.

756
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, no bulletproof glass.

757
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:21,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe something's been put in recently, but not up to par.

758
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That concerns me.

759
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have two, two, two years before this is built.

760
00:59:25,454 --> 00:59:28,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So on both sides, what are we, what are, what is the city going to do?

761
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:30,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

762
00:59:30,477 --> 00:59:34,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Jennifer Dever, Chief of Staff to Mayor Burke, 85 George P Hazard Drive.

763
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I may, good evening all.

764
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:47,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, to address Councilor Curran's concerns relative to what is going to be done between now and then in respects to the firefighter, uh, to fire headquarters, um,

765
00:59:48,263 --> 01:00:09,156
[SPEAKER_05]: The chief and I have an active dialogue in respects to any kind of needs or concerns that may happen, um, that will happen relative to the working conditions, much like we've had with chief Sacco relative to the cleanliness of the police headquarters, in addition to the replacement of the windows for bulletproof glass.

766
01:00:09,597 --> 01:00:17,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will listen to, um, future concerns, current concerns, uh, relative to the safety and the conditions of the fire.

767
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:18,942
[SPEAKER_05]: headquarters.

768
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:27,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'll state that we will work with the chief and we will work with the union as well to listen to these concerns and move forward much like we have, um, with chief Sacco.

769
01:00:28,388 --> 01:00:28,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

770
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:32,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

771
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Leo Sacco, chief police, uh, was added to 27 Elm street in Medford.

772
01:00:37,653 --> 01:00:42,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've been authorized by the mayor to make the necessary corrections in the police department.

773
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but obviously we're not going to do anything that's going to be a budget break.

774
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of the items that we need is, is a, uh, the female officers locker room facility and a shower facility.

775
01:00:54,412 --> 01:01:01,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the cost of that, putting that into an old building, uh, would be prohibitive would make any, any sense at all.

776
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:03,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to make some minor modifications.

777
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:06,339
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been some bulletproof glass.

778
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:14,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anything's really bulletproof, bullet resistant glass, uh, on the forefront windows that are on the outside and two of the lobby windows.

779
01:01:15,245 --> 01:01:15,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh,

780
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:23,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that was something that the mayor probably could have waited where she decided to move forward with a new station, but she didn't.

781
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:29,013
[SPEAKER_02]: She went ahead and authorized that purchase and it didn't come out of the police department budget.

782
01:01:30,214 --> 01:01:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So things are being done to remedy the situation.

783
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:43,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's going to make it perfect, but definitely there was a cleanup over a couple of weekend periods and we need to continue the maintenance recently.

784
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:51,010
[SPEAKER_02]: the custodian that's been provided by the company has changed and is doing a much better job than what we've had in the past.

785
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So the place is a little more cleaner and just a lot of work needs to be done and we're not going to spend a lot of money on.

786
01:01:59,032 --> 01:02:03,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to waste it, but the necessary repairs will be made.

787
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:06,614
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, if I, thank you, chief.

788
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:12,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if I could add a B paper that, um, I know the asbestos was cleaned up in the police department side.

789
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:18,220
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can add a B paper that mold testing and air quality testing be done on the fire department.

790
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's extremely one of the major concerns.

791
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:34,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, along with a whole list of others, but I think that's one of the major concerns that is causing potential or possible health conditions for our firefighters that it needs to be addressed.

792
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:38,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the asbestos and the mold has been remediation in the police department.

793
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one of the, so the fire department, yes.

794
01:02:42,756 --> 01:02:46,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it'd be great to do it in both, but we know work has been done in the police department.

795
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:51,106
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two, you know, depending on this vote, I think it needs to be done in the fire department.

796
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:53,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be done in the first floor and the second floor.

797
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can have that as a B paper.

798
01:02:56,493 --> 01:03:00,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

799
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,631
[SPEAKER_26]: Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parish Street.

800
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,552
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a few points as they pertain to finance.

801
01:03:09,473 --> 01:03:22,038
[SPEAKER_26]: We've talked a lot about Prop 2.5 and tripping Prop 2.5, but no one has mentioned at all the offset of the maintenance of the systems that are in place

802
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:25,459
[SPEAKER_26]: for the fire department if they wait another five years.

803
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:32,421
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't imagine that those costs will come down to continue to repair old equipment.

804
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:40,243
[SPEAKER_26]: So there also has to be an offset value on the operating side of the equation that I don't hear being factored in.

805
01:03:43,624 --> 01:03:46,585
[SPEAKER_26]: I hear, and I'm glad to hear,

806
01:03:47,425 --> 01:03:52,248
[SPEAKER_26]: that discussions are underway about additional maintenance to these facilities.

807
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:59,272
[SPEAKER_26]: But respectfully, the City of Medford does not do a good job at preventative maintenance anywhere.

808
01:04:00,072 --> 01:04:07,497
[SPEAKER_26]: So our buildings wouldn't be in the conditions that they're in right now for fire and police, the two sides of these facilities.

809
01:04:08,357 --> 01:04:12,701
[SPEAKER_26]: if we had the proper preventative maintenance in place.

810
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:18,425
[SPEAKER_26]: So instead, we're doing these emergency repairs and these Band-Aid solutions, and they cost significantly more.

811
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:20,587
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd be interested in hearing that.

812
01:04:21,467 --> 01:04:30,434
[SPEAKER_26]: Additionally, with respect to finance, we're talking about $18 million with respect to the fire department getting a new facility at some point.

813
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,997
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm hearing five or so years.

814
01:04:35,057 --> 01:04:40,839
[SPEAKER_26]: The escalation right now for construction sits at about 5%, and it's upticking since 2009, 2010.

815
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,541
[SPEAKER_26]: It was in the negatives then.

816
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:45,801
[SPEAKER_26]: It started to tick back up.

817
01:04:47,062 --> 01:04:51,603
[SPEAKER_26]: And it looks like it's increasing about a percent, a half a percent, depending upon the year.

818
01:04:52,464 --> 01:04:56,865
[SPEAKER_26]: So five today, next year, five and a half to six, et cetera.

819
01:04:56,965 --> 01:05:03,308
[SPEAKER_26]: And that doesn't include if the current administration under

820
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:10,321
[SPEAKER_26]: If President Trump passes anything to do with infrastructure, you're going to see those costs increase exponentially.

821
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:14,684
[SPEAKER_26]: So everyone's saying $18 million, but it's significantly more than that.

822
01:05:16,465 --> 01:05:24,510
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, I think there's a lot of complexities, and I respect that there are a lot of underlying issues that need to be addressed.

823
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:30,935
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that also stresses the need to really look at this overall.

824
01:05:32,957 --> 01:05:45,187
[SPEAKER_26]: The other point I would make with respect to committees and work groups, I think it's pivotal, and I'm glad to hear that the police will have representation among their membership as will fire.

825
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:52,734
[SPEAKER_26]: However, the mayor stood here last night and said it is potentially her intention to redevelop that property.

826
01:05:53,175 --> 01:06:03,479
[SPEAKER_26]: So there should be some citizen represented on that committee as well, because if that parcel is going to go up for redevelopment, voters and taxpayers should have a say as well.

827
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:10,282
[SPEAKER_26]: And right now we don't have a good venue to be involved.

828
01:06:10,302 --> 01:06:14,664
[SPEAKER_26]: We have some other committees that do a good job, but we don't have a citizen development committee.

829
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:21,567
[SPEAKER_26]: So if there are people at the table, there should be some folks that represent the general population to talk about

830
01:06:22,169 --> 01:06:26,593
[SPEAKER_26]: who and how they may redevelop that lot if the fire department moves.

831
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:39,143
[SPEAKER_26]: And the last point I wanted to make with respect to financing and schedule, in all of these conversations these past few minutes, I've heard repeatedly about the architect.

832
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:41,985
[SPEAKER_26]: I've heard repeatedly about what construction's gonna be.

833
01:06:42,726 --> 01:06:44,947
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm still not hearing anything about an OPM.

834
01:06:45,528 --> 01:06:48,050
[SPEAKER_26]: And an OPM will be able to help you guys navigate

835
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:55,505
[SPEAKER_26]: will help to determine some value engineering and we'll put together that schedule you're looking for very quickly.

836
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,047
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you for your time.

837
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:58,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

838
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:00,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Dello Russo.

839
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Move the question.

840
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:05,973
[SPEAKER_15]: We have citizens still willing to speak.

841
01:07:06,013 --> 01:07:06,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor.

842
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:08,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

843
01:07:09,756 --> 01:07:11,778
[SPEAKER_03]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

844
01:07:12,338 --> 01:07:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make a comment about the, um,

845
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:18,450
[SPEAKER_03]: cost of the dual facility.

846
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:26,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard $38 million for a dual facility, and I know it would take a couple of years, and then I heard that it would be $10 million to purchase property.

847
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:28,798
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, is it up to $10 million?

848
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're moving the facility and going to another area, is it really $10 million to purchase a piece of property?

849
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:36,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly,

850
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:43,303
[SPEAKER_03]: offsetting that cost, wouldn't you be redeveloping or selling the property that exists currently?

851
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, you're not looking at $38 million, I mean, $49 million.

852
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking at something that's much, much lower than what's being presented.

853
01:07:52,706 --> 01:08:01,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And you won't know that until there's a cost analysis done on either the property you're currently in or both properties, the one that you're considering or the property

854
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:05,574
[SPEAKER_03]: or the property that you're in right now and the property that you're considering.

855
01:08:06,054 --> 01:08:10,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it just might offset entirely and you're still back to the 38 million.

856
01:08:11,076 --> 01:08:12,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something to consider.

857
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:23,260
[SPEAKER_06]: When the clarification council, the administration's estimating 38 million if you stayed on site and then a potential up to 49 if we did not.

858
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So, right, correct.

859
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:29,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you did not and you went to another area, are you, are you seriously paying $10 million for a piece of property?

860
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:30,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so,

861
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:32,928
[SPEAKER_03]: is your property worth $10 million.

862
01:08:33,849 --> 01:08:38,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your property is worth $5 million, wouldn't you purchase a piece of property worth $5 million?

863
01:08:38,374 --> 01:08:39,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It would make sense.

864
01:08:39,475 --> 01:08:41,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd stay at the $38 million cost.

865
01:08:42,097 --> 01:08:42,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's number one.

866
01:08:43,178 --> 01:08:46,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, as far as the OPM, I've heard it a couple of times.

867
01:08:46,762 --> 01:08:54,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something that actually, if you read into this law, the Massachusetts law that was presented earlier, at the bottom of it, there is an addendum

868
01:08:55,003 --> 01:09:17,098
[SPEAKER_03]: that basically clarifies the law allows a public agency to assign an existing employee to serve as its OPM provided that the designated employee meets or exceeds the minimum of qualifications set forth for retaining a private sector project manager and has experience in the construction and supervision of construction of building of similar size and scope of complexity

869
01:09:18,553 --> 01:09:21,495
[SPEAKER_03]: as the project to which the existing employee would be assigned.

870
01:09:21,855 --> 01:09:23,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that helps you or not.

871
01:09:23,556 --> 01:09:35,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you read into that, if there's somebody that is on board right now that has had that experience, you could probably bring them in as an interim until you find the OPM that you need to get this project going the way it should go.

872
01:09:35,662 --> 01:09:40,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think everybody in Medford would agree that this is something that is incredibly important.

873
01:09:41,565 --> 01:09:45,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should have a state-of-the-art facility for both the firemen and the police.

874
01:09:45,768 --> 01:09:46,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

875
01:09:46,588 --> 01:09:46,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

876
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:49,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

877
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:55,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I was wondering if someone from the administration can clarify.

878
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:00,372
[SPEAKER_21]: We were talking about the dates when we could get a possible headquarters.

879
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:17,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the headquarters and the training tower have to come on board at the same time, or can the training tower be something that can quickly be arrived at, knowing that the nature of building a training tower is far less of an endeavor than

880
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:19,155
[SPEAKER_21]: building a headquarters.

881
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that something that?

882
01:10:20,395 --> 01:10:42,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I'd be happy to address that because the discussion that I had with with the mayor of the members of the administration and Jeff Shaw in the course of the last few days, let's segregate out to what you consider to be the lesser of the two, obviously, which is the training tower that could be done separately from waiting for a new fire department that does not have to wait that period of time.

883
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:45,066
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's clear that that that

884
01:10:45,568 --> 01:11:01,779
[SPEAKER_20]: While that will both be under the domain of the working group, that their recommendations on a training tower could easily and well precede their later recommendations, which I would presume would be later, on the fire headquarters slash station.

885
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:03,080
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

886
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:08,243
[SPEAKER_21]: And Mr. President, maybe Chief Gilberti can answer this question.

887
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:14,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we got, you know, we heard a lot tonight about the condition of the fire department.

888
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:16,876
[SPEAKER_21]: We know already the condition of the police department.

889
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:21,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, the fire department has a number of specialized equipment trucks.

890
01:11:22,822 --> 01:11:32,392
[SPEAKER_21]: And if we're looking at a potential building in 2025 or 24, can you address chief the need for additional space?

891
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:43,750
[SPEAKER_21]: We know the deplorable condition of the station, but the needs of the equipment needs and space is equally as important.

892
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:48,893
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you address what's gonna happen over the next eight years relative to the equipment?

893
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:54,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you asking me if we're gonna incorporate it into a new station, the additional space?

894
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:55,657
[SPEAKER_21]: No, the storage need.

895
01:11:56,377 --> 01:12:00,300
[SPEAKER_21]: We know even with the police department now, and that's one of the reasons, in addition to

896
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:09,597
[SPEAKER_21]: the condition of the building, the fact that these buildings are no longer suitable because they lack the storage for our equipment.

897
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:11,838
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going to be done in the meantime?

898
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,060
[SPEAKER_21]: There's about a seven or eight year span.

899
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,483
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, if we have no way to put, I mean, we have to live with what we have.

900
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:18,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

901
01:12:19,304 --> 01:12:22,367
[SPEAKER_24]: We're as cramped as can be.

902
01:12:22,447 --> 01:12:25,509
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm storing equipment outside today.

903
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,390
[SPEAKER_24]: So the plans are to

904
01:12:28,404 --> 01:12:29,845
[SPEAKER_24]: continue to store equipment outside?

905
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:30,845
[SPEAKER_24]: Where else can I put it?

906
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:32,626
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, that's what I'm asking you.

907
01:12:32,926 --> 01:12:33,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Where else can I put it?

908
01:12:34,346 --> 01:12:36,167
[SPEAKER_24]: We put as much as inside as we can.

909
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:41,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're losing storage when we lose the training academy, correct?

910
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:41,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I will.

911
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:46,611
[SPEAKER_24]: I will lose two bays over there that we keep reserve equipment in.

912
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:46,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

913
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:50,652
[SPEAKER_24]: And the anticipation is that equipment is going to just be stored outside.

914
01:12:50,672 --> 01:12:57,935
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, we're going to have to find we're going to have to either auction off some equipment, some older equipment to make room.

915
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,302
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's really been no thought process in what we're going to do with this storage need?

916
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:09,544
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we haven't talked to DPW.

917
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:12,745
[SPEAKER_24]: We haven't talked to even maybe- We have talked to the DPW.

918
01:13:12,765 --> 01:13:15,126
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no room down at the DPW to store equipment.

919
01:13:15,627 --> 01:13:17,607
[SPEAKER_24]: And that storage is all outside anyway.

920
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:21,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't store a fire engine outside in the wintertime.

921
01:13:22,888 --> 01:13:24,049
[SPEAKER_21]: What about the private sector?

922
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:28,490
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it possible in some of the garages on Mystic Ave or Commercial Street?

923
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:31,431
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, maybe that is a possibility, but we haven't explored that yet.

924
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:44,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think, Chief, the reason why I bring it up, I think it's an important issue because I think we're centered around the deplorable condition of the buildings, but equally we're moving forward because of the lack of storage within these both sides, police and fire.

925
01:13:45,056 --> 01:13:46,777
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's equally an important issue.

926
01:13:47,317 --> 01:13:50,018
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you know, we saw what happened to the DPW.

927
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:53,572
[SPEAKER_21]: They left there because their garages were leaking and so forth.

928
01:13:53,872 --> 01:13:55,153
[SPEAKER_21]: They left their equipment outside.

929
01:13:55,573 --> 01:14:01,136
[SPEAKER_21]: And vehicles that were purchased two or three years ago were becoming rusted and a whole other host of issues.

930
01:14:01,556 --> 01:14:14,244
[SPEAKER_21]: And the last thing I want to see, even though our equipment needs some to desire in the fire department as well as the police department, I'd hate to see this equipment being stored outside, this precious equipment that we have.

931
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:19,367
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to at least get some feedback on what are the plans over the next seven or eight years.

932
01:14:20,758 --> 01:14:21,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Chief.

933
01:14:21,298 --> 01:14:21,659
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome.

934
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:23,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

935
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

936
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:32,945
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Council President Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

937
01:14:36,407 --> 01:14:40,689
[SPEAKER_23]: I've said many times, if the city needs it, we should just get it done.

938
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:47,033
[SPEAKER_23]: What I don't understand is, however, the building's only 55 years old, it's brick and mortar,

939
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:49,158
[SPEAKER_23]: and now it's almost condemned.

940
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:54,080
[SPEAKER_23]: We have thousands of homes that are over 200 years old, and they seem to be in fine shape.

941
01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:01,844
[SPEAKER_23]: How did this station or multiple buildings get to this situation?

942
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:04,825
[SPEAKER_23]: It seems like we have a maintenance problem for sure.

943
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:07,607
[SPEAKER_23]: Very sad.

944
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:12,649
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm now hearing the city's using new growth.

945
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,112
[SPEAKER_23]: We, the taxpayers, should get all that new growth.

946
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:33,527
[SPEAKER_23]: that new real estate tax to offset prop two and a half, or in this city it seems to be prop 2.49%, and give the middle class a break on the real estate, home real estate taxes.

947
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,209
[SPEAKER_23]: And now I'm here and talking about an override.

948
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:42,092
[SPEAKER_23]: It's never happened as far as I know in 02155, Winchester,

949
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:47,941
[SPEAKER_23]: has had many prop two and a half overrides.

950
01:15:49,122 --> 01:15:53,205
[SPEAKER_23]: But here, I don't think that would be a wise move against the real estate taxpayer.

951
01:15:57,189 --> 01:16:03,634
[SPEAKER_23]: And I believe for every $20 million borrowed, it's gonna cost us, the taxpayers, 50% more.

952
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:07,438
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be a $3 million bill in the 20-year payback.

953
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,881
[SPEAKER_23]: By the way, maintenance is still key.

954
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:13,543
[SPEAKER_23]: If anything is done,

955
01:16:16,392 --> 01:16:23,974
[SPEAKER_23]: If I was in charge, I would make damn sure that so much is put aside for maintenance.

956
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:31,716
[SPEAKER_23]: Because the old high school on Forest Street will still be standing, and the new schools will turn to dust.

957
01:16:32,757 --> 01:16:33,397
[SPEAKER_23]: Please adhere.

958
01:16:33,557 --> 01:16:34,437
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for listening.

959
01:16:34,977 --> 01:16:35,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

960
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:42,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Pinter, I think you cut in front of that young lady.

961
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,000
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we agreed.

962
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:43,620
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay.

963
01:16:44,482 --> 01:16:45,542
[SPEAKER_27]: Name and address of the record, please.

964
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:46,462
[SPEAKER_27]: I wouldn't be that rude.

965
01:16:47,183 --> 01:16:48,043
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. President.

966
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:48,383
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening.

967
01:16:48,423 --> 01:16:49,403
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Robert Pinter.

968
01:16:49,423 --> 01:16:53,204
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party.

969
01:16:53,544 --> 01:16:59,725
[SPEAKER_27]: I have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department.

970
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:10,567
[SPEAKER_27]: And the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be.

971
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:13,508
[SPEAKER_27]: Why didn't that take place for the police department?

972
01:17:14,354 --> 01:17:19,418
[SPEAKER_27]: If she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that then she was less concerned about the police department.

973
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:22,200
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's quite obvious by this particular writing here.

974
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:30,265
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this.

975
01:17:31,106 --> 01:17:37,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Second thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here.

976
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:38,972
[SPEAKER_27]: He can answer for himself.

977
01:17:39,012 --> 01:17:43,715
[SPEAKER_27]: But last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire

978
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:46,536
[SPEAKER_27]: location here in the city of Medford for its headquarters.

979
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:55,038
[SPEAKER_27]: So we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time.

980
01:17:55,658 --> 01:18:04,160
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year.

981
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:08,741
[SPEAKER_27]: That brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that.

982
01:18:09,582 --> 01:18:10,722
[SPEAKER_27]: But all you're going to be getting

983
01:18:11,142 --> 01:18:14,624
[SPEAKER_27]: is allegedly a proposal for one, a new station.

984
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:18,146
[SPEAKER_27]: And number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be.

985
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:26,911
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants.

986
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:31,053
[SPEAKER_27]: She's still looking for grants, as she said last night, she's on the hunt.

987
01:18:31,113 --> 01:18:33,394
[SPEAKER_27]: And in some places there's no grants to be found.

988
01:18:34,155 --> 01:18:38,697
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it.

989
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:43,401
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration.

990
01:18:44,142 --> 01:18:46,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city.

991
01:18:48,004 --> 01:18:51,106
[SPEAKER_27]: It's approximate $28 million pension deficit.

992
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:53,167
[SPEAKER_27]: You folks haven't mentioned that yet.

993
01:18:53,207 --> 01:18:58,751
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher.

994
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:07,496
[SPEAKER_27]: The other night there was a contract, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multi-million dollar refurbishing of Medford High School.

995
01:19:08,268 --> 01:19:10,229
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to cost factor that's going to have to come in.

996
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:16,910
[SPEAKER_27]: Most recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond.

997
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:20,211
[SPEAKER_27]: And if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side.

998
01:19:21,232 --> 01:19:24,092
[SPEAKER_27]: These are things that really have to be taken into consideration.

999
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:34,855
[SPEAKER_27]: And you, President Caraviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools.

1000
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,916
[SPEAKER_27]: That's up to almost a million point five right now.

1001
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,712
[SPEAKER_27]: This city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings.

1002
01:19:41,272 --> 01:19:43,854
[SPEAKER_27]: The private administration ignored all these buildings.

1003
01:19:44,435 --> 01:19:50,139
[SPEAKER_27]: This city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues.

1004
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,202
[SPEAKER_27]: It's obvious that the priorities have not been set.

1005
01:19:53,982 --> 01:20:05,111
[SPEAKER_27]: But the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks.

1006
01:20:06,112 --> 01:20:07,213
[SPEAKER_27]: This is totally unfair.

1007
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:24,488
[SPEAKER_27]: You folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, never mind the location, never mind the 35,000 square foot building, never mind a three-story building, never mind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards.

1008
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:33,153
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone,

1009
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:40,846
[SPEAKER_27]: What you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years.

1010
01:20:41,226 --> 01:20:43,668
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration.

1011
01:20:44,569 --> 01:20:54,998
[SPEAKER_27]: If you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that.

1012
01:20:55,258 --> 01:20:56,940
[SPEAKER_27]: The OPM needs to be hired first.

1013
01:20:57,861 --> 01:20:58,982
[SPEAKER_27]: Once you put that together,

1014
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:02,230
[SPEAKER_27]: Why wait and do an 18-month period?

1015
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,251
[SPEAKER_27]: Why can't you do both at the same time?

1016
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:12,814
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments.

1017
01:21:13,395 --> 01:21:17,198
[SPEAKER_27]: as it relates to building a new police station, and then working on the fire station.

1018
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:23,302
[SPEAKER_27]: Because we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and in better condition than the police side.

1019
01:21:24,082 --> 01:21:29,526
[SPEAKER_27]: But who's to say it isn't, because nobody's gone through there, and Councilor Longo hit it right in the head, maybe you should go in there and have any equality.

1020
01:21:29,846 --> 01:21:34,209
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe that building should be reviewed for its aesthetic qualities, and whatever it might be.

1021
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:41,834
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, running around not having any money from the outside, and only dealing with approximately $9 million in your free cash,

1022
01:21:43,522 --> 01:21:57,551
[SPEAKER_27]: That doesn't leave an awful lot, because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account, for which Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer has been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work.

1023
01:21:58,392 --> 01:22:00,153
[SPEAKER_27]: And you're hitting the taxpayers with that money.

1024
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:11,460
[SPEAKER_27]: You're also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it.

1025
01:22:12,437 --> 01:22:27,943
[SPEAKER_27]: So how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them, we're charging you for this, this is what the cost is going to be, and readily acknowledge by our own treasurer the fact that the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset.

1026
01:22:28,983 --> 01:22:29,863
[SPEAKER_27]: Who's going to pay for it?

1027
01:22:30,504 --> 01:22:34,485
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override?

1028
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:36,386
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you really want to sell that?

1029
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:39,967
[SPEAKER_27]: And if everything comes before you, Mr. President, before your council,

1030
01:22:40,885 --> 01:22:41,185
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay?

1031
01:22:41,626 --> 01:22:43,668
[SPEAKER_27]: Where's the conversation as it relates to that?

1032
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:45,390
[SPEAKER_27]: Where's the priority going to be?

1033
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:46,551
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it going to be the high school?

1034
01:22:46,851 --> 01:22:47,872
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it going to be the library?

1035
01:22:48,113 --> 01:22:49,354
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it going to be the police department?

1036
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:50,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it going to be the fire station?

1037
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:55,621
[SPEAKER_27]: The fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up.

1038
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,282
[SPEAKER_27]: Talking about storage.

1039
01:22:58,236 --> 01:23:04,481
[SPEAKER_27]: If you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now, where in God's creation are you gonna put that?

1040
01:23:04,781 --> 01:23:08,043
[SPEAKER_27]: He said possibly auctioning it off, two bays you're gonna possibly be losing.

1041
01:23:08,744 --> 01:23:10,605
[SPEAKER_27]: You talked about regionalization the other night.

1042
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:14,188
[SPEAKER_27]: The mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization.

1043
01:23:14,608 --> 01:23:25,937
[SPEAKER_27]: And I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there and to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak,

1044
01:23:26,237 --> 01:23:28,457
[SPEAKER_27]: There needs to be a backup here in this city.

1045
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:31,078
[SPEAKER_27]: And where's the backup to the backup in the city?

1046
01:23:31,098 --> 01:23:33,138
[SPEAKER_27]: God forbid there's a major fire that takes place.

1047
01:23:33,879 --> 01:23:35,479
[SPEAKER_27]: These are things that haven't been discussed.

1048
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:40,620
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward.

1049
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,681
[SPEAKER_27]: There is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in a police station.

1050
01:23:44,781 --> 01:23:45,701
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think there's anybody.

1051
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:48,061
[SPEAKER_27]: We'd all be crazy if there was one person.

1052
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:55,723
[SPEAKER_27]: We all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent and not maintaining its buildings.

1053
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,424
[SPEAKER_27]: But there needs to be a priority that's set.

1054
01:23:59,004 --> 01:24:02,565
[SPEAKER_27]: There has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met.

1055
01:24:03,045 --> 01:24:14,228
[SPEAKER_27]: And if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station?

1056
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:15,948
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. McCulloch made an excellent point.

1057
01:24:16,288 --> 01:24:17,348
[SPEAKER_27]: And the point is simply this.

1058
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:22,909
[SPEAKER_27]: If you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million?

1059
01:24:23,049 --> 01:24:23,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Are thereabouts?

1060
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:31,051
[SPEAKER_27]: And if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going.

1061
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:32,371
[SPEAKER_27]: These are things.

1062
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:33,291
[SPEAKER_27]: And I thank you folks.

1063
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:42,913
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it was you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around.

1064
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:49,947
[SPEAKER_27]: You seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there.

1065
01:24:50,387 --> 01:24:52,648
[SPEAKER_27]: But the new public works building was being discussed.

1066
01:24:52,849 --> 01:25:04,156
[SPEAKER_27]: What was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be.

1067
01:25:04,716 --> 01:25:06,878
[SPEAKER_27]: And there was a pushback by the then administration.

1068
01:25:07,538 --> 01:25:08,599
[SPEAKER_27]: Why was there a pushback?

1069
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:09,140
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1070
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,526
[SPEAKER_27]: And there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police.

1071
01:25:16,006 --> 01:25:23,973
[SPEAKER_27]: And all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space.

1072
01:25:24,174 --> 01:25:32,681
[SPEAKER_27]: As a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square.

1073
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:39,763
[SPEAKER_27]: Police department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could.

1074
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:45,672
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this, or yes, we're going to vote for that.

1075
01:25:46,192 --> 01:25:47,232
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the process.

1076
01:25:47,832 --> 01:25:50,173
[SPEAKER_27]: And once again, the process has been broken down.

1077
01:25:50,633 --> 01:25:56,656
[SPEAKER_27]: It's been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council.

1078
01:25:57,176 --> 01:26:03,378
[SPEAKER_27]: And all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input.

1079
01:26:04,091 --> 01:26:06,492
[SPEAKER_27]: And today is another perfect example of what took place.

1080
01:26:06,952 --> 01:26:15,857
[SPEAKER_27]: If the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after?

1081
01:26:16,477 --> 01:26:20,079
[SPEAKER_27]: And who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months?

1082
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:21,780
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the question.

1083
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,781
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's what you need to ask yourself.

1084
01:26:24,281 --> 01:26:32,105
[SPEAKER_27]: So why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time?

1085
01:26:32,905 --> 01:26:41,967
[SPEAKER_27]: That way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said.

1086
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:51,570
[SPEAKER_27]: That report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why

1087
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:53,192
[SPEAKER_27]: a dual building should work.

1088
01:26:53,692 --> 01:26:59,959
[SPEAKER_27]: But if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion.

1089
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:09,130
[SPEAKER_27]: And one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco, when you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there, it might cost $500,000,

1090
01:27:11,232 --> 01:27:12,653
[SPEAKER_27]: But where in the city is it going to be?

1091
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:14,813
[SPEAKER_27]: And you don't want that to be regionalized.

1092
01:27:14,853 --> 01:27:19,075
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community.

1093
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:21,596
[SPEAKER_27]: You're taking a truck out of our service, out of our community.

1094
01:27:21,796 --> 01:27:24,797
[SPEAKER_27]: You're putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup.

1095
01:27:25,137 --> 01:27:26,617
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the problem that we're going to have.

1096
01:27:26,878 --> 01:27:27,238
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1097
01:27:27,258 --> 01:27:27,618
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1098
01:27:35,661 --> 01:27:36,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1099
01:27:37,201 --> 01:27:39,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford.

1100
01:27:40,627 --> 01:27:42,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not here to criticize.

1101
01:27:42,668 --> 01:27:48,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just here to express my opinion, my concern, and some amazement.

1102
01:27:49,132 --> 01:27:56,616
[SPEAKER_04]: We all understand that we have major decisions to be made and, uh, that major money is involved.

1103
01:27:58,477 --> 01:28:02,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a contracting officer for the federal government for 22 years.

1104
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I dealt with from the architectural services to the completion of the building.

1105
01:28:10,813 --> 01:28:16,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I dealt with the new federal courthouse at Springfield, border stations, the Coast Guard building.

1106
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:37,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel every time I come here and I listen to what goes on, we don't understand, we have misinformation, we have lots of questions, and it's very difficult for me to understand why things are happening with the mayor, if you will, offside,

1107
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,204
[SPEAKER_04]: and why you people most especially are being excluded.

1108
01:28:43,965 --> 01:28:49,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We hired you, voted for you, in essence hired you to represent us.

1109
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:54,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like it is very unfair the way you are being treated.

1110
01:28:55,875 --> 01:29:03,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you are being asked to, two weeks ago or last week, I was watching it on television, it was like,

1111
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:04,305
[SPEAKER_04]: $2 million.

1112
01:29:04,345 --> 01:29:07,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, $2 million, like it's nothing.

1113
01:29:08,128 --> 01:29:12,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Property taxes have gone up, I think, 35 years in a row.

1114
01:29:13,032 --> 01:29:18,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, as I understood it, we definitely need the police station.

1115
01:29:18,596 --> 01:29:20,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We've needed it for like 20 years.

1116
01:29:20,638 --> 01:29:23,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden, out of nowhere comes, we need the fire station.

1117
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not disagreeing.

1118
01:29:26,202 --> 01:29:30,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But yikes, every time you turn around, there's this or that.

1119
01:29:30,225 --> 01:29:31,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the mayor has some kind of meeting.

1120
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:39,659
[SPEAKER_04]: and something happens and the communication to me is just awful.

1121
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you are being expected to vote on things, this is not the way things should be handled.

1122
01:29:47,585 --> 01:29:52,628
[SPEAKER_04]: The federal government wanted open, found that open government worked.

1123
01:29:53,350 --> 01:30:01,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would suggest that we need some of that in Medford, because we, the taxpayers, are going to pay for this.

1124
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:04,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd like it to work.

1125
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:10,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are being held responsible for things that I think it's just very poorly

1126
01:30:11,638 --> 01:30:13,900
[SPEAKER_04]: very poor management, and I don't blame you.

1127
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:21,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think there's all this cloak and dagger stuff going on that's really not right, and it's really not fair.

1128
01:30:21,907 --> 01:30:29,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope things get better for you, because I hope things get better for us, and things get a little bit better organized.

1129
01:30:29,534 --> 01:30:29,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1130
01:30:29,994 --> 01:30:30,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1131
01:30:30,915 --> 01:30:31,715
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Falco.

1132
01:30:33,737 --> 01:30:34,418
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1133
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:37,180
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to go back to Mr. Petra's point about the

1134
01:30:37,702 --> 01:30:39,163
[SPEAKER_30]: regionalization of the tower.

1135
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,084
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not in favor of regionalizing the tower.

1136
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:46,727
[SPEAKER_30]: The questions I had last night were just basically, what are the disadvantages of regionalizing the tower?

1137
01:30:46,747 --> 01:30:49,749
[SPEAKER_30]: That was it, but I want to keep the tower here.

1138
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:52,991
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's advantageous to us.

1139
01:30:53,251 --> 01:30:54,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I think our tower is the regional tower.

1140
01:30:55,432 --> 01:30:59,054
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, and it benefits our firefighters, so I mean, I want to keep the tower here.

1141
01:30:59,074 --> 01:30:59,895
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to make that clear.

1142
01:31:00,355 --> 01:31:00,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1143
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,135
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1144
01:31:01,776 --> 01:31:05,818
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, as seconded by Councilor Knight.

1145
01:31:08,482 --> 01:31:09,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1146
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:13,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Bill O'Brien, present local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street.

1147
01:31:15,106 --> 01:31:22,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks, I just wanted to clarify something or have something clarified, is that you had a very good question of when the fire

1148
01:31:23,366 --> 01:31:25,007
[SPEAKER_22]: when the fire headquarters could be built.

1149
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:36,337
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that, you know, that wasn't the agreement that we, we worked out was that we're looking down the road for five years and not 2025 for a new fire station.

1150
01:31:36,857 --> 01:31:50,068
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and if the, if the treasurer can have that information, I believe what our understanding was we could go out to bond, um, and have a fire station in the city by 2023 it's physically, it's financially possible.

1151
01:31:50,688 --> 01:31:51,129
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I correct?

1152
01:31:52,482 --> 01:31:53,482
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, yes.

1153
01:31:54,582 --> 01:32:05,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there is a little sort of misunderstanding with regard to debt service versus ability to bond and start projects.

1154
01:32:05,725 --> 01:32:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that does need to be clarified that I do believe that we would be able to have a fire station certainly underway.

1155
01:32:15,487 --> 01:32:22,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't say when it would be completed, but 2023 would certainly be what was in the

1156
01:32:23,008 --> 01:32:28,332
[SPEAKER_07]: what was being planned, I would, I would think five years out and a debt service payment would be in 2025.

1157
01:32:29,513 --> 01:32:31,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone's on the same page on that.

1158
01:32:36,197 --> 01:32:36,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1159
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:49,607
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's precisely why I asked for, for a timeframe because I wasn't privy to the meeting this afternoon between the union and the mayor, but it's clear to me that they weren't on the same page.

1160
01:32:50,307 --> 01:32:51,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, because from what I heard tonight,

1161
01:32:52,021 --> 01:32:54,182
[SPEAKER_21]: We're looking at more of 2024.

1162
01:32:54,622 --> 01:33:08,768
[SPEAKER_21]: But needless to say, Mr. President, you know, to get everything lined up and to make sure that we're working on a process now where one didn't exist the last two weeks is extremely important if we're going to move forward.

1163
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:15,031
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think it's vital, Mr. President, that we get some type of timeline from the administration on this on this issue.

1164
01:33:16,491 --> 01:33:20,493
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know if you know, I'm prepared to make a vote tonight.

1165
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:29,319
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be quite frank, I am not happy, Mr. President, with the results that took place after today's meeting.

1166
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:37,285
[SPEAKER_21]: I still feel strongly that a combined center is the fiscally prudent thing to do for this community.

1167
01:33:37,986 --> 01:33:39,347
[SPEAKER_21]: According to the $100,000 report,

1168
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:48,513
[SPEAKER_21]: that we commissioned for feasibility study back in 2013 from Dunham and Sweeney for the Medford Police and Fire Station.

1169
01:33:49,013 --> 01:33:51,955
[SPEAKER_21]: They recommended a combined center.

1170
01:33:53,375 --> 01:34:07,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, the mayor's transition team that was put together by Mayor Burke, the Business and Economic Development Committee, held countless meetings, met with the general public, and their recommendation was to sell the land and build a combined center somewhere else.

1171
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:24,771
[SPEAKER_21]: So clearly, Mr. President, we have not taken the recommendations of the mayor's transition team, and we have not taken the recommendations of $100,000 study that we commissioned, and we went off in a different direction, and with very little fanfare, very little input.

1172
01:34:25,171 --> 01:34:37,798
[SPEAKER_21]: So I am not happy, but again, as I told the union reps today that contacted me, I will not stand in the way, Mr. President, but I think clearly for everyone's sake, for the unions, for the taxpayers of this community,

1173
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,883
[SPEAKER_21]: and for this council that we should have a timeline on this project.

1174
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:54,814
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't state it enough, Mr. President, because I don't want tomorrow for the union to pick up the phone and say, you know what, we didn't realize this was going to take place because you know, if we vote on a first reading tonight, there's no, there's no going back.

1175
01:34:54,834 --> 01:34:56,776
[SPEAKER_22]: We understand that councilor.

1176
01:34:57,076 --> 01:35:04,462
[SPEAKER_22]: And we did talk, we talked at length about a timeline and it's spelled out.

1177
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:05,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Now we can't,

1178
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:20,690
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't predict about, you know, this fire personnel, the working group of fire personnel will be prepared in 18 months to make a recommendation to the mayor of where a new fire headquarters will go.

1179
01:35:21,491 --> 01:35:22,771
[SPEAKER_22]: We will be ready in 18 months.

1180
01:35:23,572 --> 01:35:25,533
[SPEAKER_22]: That's our timeline going forward.

1181
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:33,877
[SPEAKER_22]: After the 18 months, by fiscal year 19, which starts, fiscal year starts July 1st of 2020.

1182
01:35:36,112 --> 01:35:43,417
[SPEAKER_22]: 18.

1183
01:35:36,793 --> 01:35:43,417
[SPEAKER_22]: So anytime between that, we're looking to have this council vote on a bond for an architectural services.

1184
01:35:43,998 --> 01:35:52,003
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what we're looking for with assurances from this administration that once we're done, do this and we're moving forward with the new fire headquarters.

1185
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:56,546
[SPEAKER_22]: That's, I can't predict month to month, you know, week to week or what goes on.

1186
01:35:56,767 --> 01:36:00,509
[SPEAKER_22]: And I, and I agree with you and make sure you guys know what's happening.

1187
01:36:00,549 --> 01:36:01,630
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with your Councilor and

1188
01:36:02,063 --> 01:36:11,308
[SPEAKER_22]: And from what, you know, we're going to, we sat down and we talked to the administration and we're hoping that, you know, going forward, they're going to hold up their rent because we're going to make sure they hold up their rent.

1189
01:36:13,809 --> 01:36:14,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1190
01:36:14,309 --> 01:36:14,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1191
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lococoon.

1192
01:36:17,311 --> 01:36:17,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll yield.

1193
01:36:20,112 --> 01:36:21,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1194
01:36:21,993 --> 01:36:24,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford.

1195
01:36:25,115 --> 01:36:28,736
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've heard a lot of people talking about the combined facility would be $38 million.

1196
01:36:30,677 --> 01:36:40,082
[SPEAKER_12]: We heard at the debates that they got $10 million in Malden for their police station, and that this administration didn't apply for any because of time restrictions.

1197
01:36:40,162 --> 01:36:50,807
[SPEAKER_12]: But if they had gotten $10 million for the facility, that would have brought our costs down to $28 million, which would be only $6 million more than they were talking about for just building a police station.

1198
01:36:51,292 --> 01:36:54,895
[SPEAKER_12]: when we still have a fire station that will be looming over our heads waiting.

1199
01:36:55,395 --> 01:37:02,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any assurances that there'll be time to file for grants for the fire station or are we just going to pay full price for that one too?

1200
01:37:02,821 --> 01:37:07,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I heard that they're very concerned about us as taxpayers having to shoulder these bills.

1201
01:37:08,725 --> 01:37:13,368
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't heard of any grant applications going out to help us to offset these bills.

1202
01:37:13,709 --> 01:37:14,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen grants for libraries.

1203
01:37:15,009 --> 01:37:17,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen grants for renovating sidewalks.

1204
01:37:17,191 --> 01:37:21,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we're renovating sidewalks at a cost to the taxpayer of a quarter of a million dollars.

1205
01:37:22,114 --> 01:37:27,098
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would encourage, strongly encourage, and I hope that other people do encourage

1206
01:37:27,518 --> 01:37:33,521
[SPEAKER_12]: the administration to go after these grants because we just left $10 million on the table for the police station at a minimum.

1207
01:37:33,821 --> 01:37:36,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps there were more grants if we combined a police and fire station.

1208
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:43,265
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could be having a ribbon cutting or a shoveling for a combined police and fire station.

1209
01:37:43,285 --> 01:37:46,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Rodriguez, can I ask you where this $10 million grant was?

1210
01:37:47,745 --> 01:37:53,527
[SPEAKER_12]: When we had the debates, there was a Malden city councilor who was overseeing it at the high school.

1211
01:37:53,547 --> 01:37:53,967
[SPEAKER_12]: That was in Malden.

1212
01:37:54,488 --> 01:37:58,169
[SPEAKER_12]: And he said that in Malden, they got $9.8 million for their police station.

1213
01:37:58,589 --> 01:38:03,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So we know that the mayor is aware of these grants because she was present at the stage

1214
01:38:03,728 --> 01:38:06,229
[SPEAKER_12]: and clapped vigorously at the grants that he received.

1215
01:38:07,029 --> 01:38:11,971
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would have assumed that a phone call to the mayor would have yielded details.

1216
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:12,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not the mayor.

1217
01:38:13,311 --> 01:38:16,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Had I made the phone call, it wouldn't have had any effect on this process.

1218
01:38:16,692 --> 01:38:20,933
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm more than happy to make the phone call and call the mayor's office and let her know what the grants are.

1219
01:38:22,634 --> 01:38:22,794
[SPEAKER_12]: But

1220
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:33,940
[SPEAKER_12]: What we need to do now is since we're clearly going to go forward on just a police station, before the fire tower is knocked down, a new location should be picked for that fire tower.

1221
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Money should be allocated for that fire tower.

1222
01:38:36,881 --> 01:38:43,742
[SPEAKER_12]: The firefighters should be confident that in conjunction with their tower being torn down, a new one will be placed.

1223
01:38:43,782 --> 01:38:44,582
[SPEAKER_12]: They shouldn't wait until 2023 or 2024.

1224
01:38:48,126 --> 01:38:50,207
[SPEAKER_12]: or 2022 or whenever to get their tower.

1225
01:38:50,227 --> 01:38:57,689
[SPEAKER_12]: They should get their tower immediately because as we're told, our insurance rates will go up if they don't have a tower because they'll not be able to do training here.

1226
01:38:58,029 --> 01:39:10,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also need to figure out where they're going to store their equipment because the very idea of the police, the fire chief thinking that he has to auction off equipment because he has nowhere to store it is chilling and upsetting to me as a taxpayer.

1227
01:39:10,792 --> 01:39:11,052
[SPEAKER_12]: And I,

1228
01:39:12,106 --> 01:39:15,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw the reaction on some of the councilors' faces, and it was upsetting to them as well.

1229
01:39:15,567 --> 01:39:26,292
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something that would have been addressed had these meetings not taken place behind closed doors with a handful of people who all nodded in unison because they agreed with what was happening.

1230
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:31,734
[SPEAKER_12]: We need diverse voices at the table so that multiple layered conversations can take place.

1231
01:39:32,114 --> 01:39:34,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And these things don't come upon us at the last minute.

1232
01:39:35,196 --> 01:39:38,057
[SPEAKER_12]: So I encourage the administration to invite people to the table

1233
01:39:38,657 --> 01:39:42,459
[SPEAKER_12]: who will give her different ideas, and not just ideas that agree with hers.

1234
01:39:42,699 --> 01:39:48,862
[SPEAKER_12]: That's very important to any administration, and I encourage a future administration in Medford to do the same.

1235
01:39:49,382 --> 01:39:49,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1236
01:39:49,822 --> 01:39:50,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1237
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:56,765
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know the administration did state that they are looking for grants, both the federal and state level.

1238
01:39:57,865 --> 01:39:58,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Longo-Chagran.

1239
01:39:59,366 --> 01:40:01,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1240
01:40:01,267 --> 01:40:08,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I stated two weeks ago, this is probably the worst way anything's ever been proposed with regards to a grant.

1241
01:40:08,929 --> 01:40:11,551
[SPEAKER_06]: a bond in 16 years I've been on the council.

1242
01:40:12,612 --> 01:40:31,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the right way to do it is exactly what's written in the memo today, dated February 28th, where a working group will be set up and it will take 18 months to assess and figure out the best location and figure out everything that's going to be needed for a new fire station.

1243
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:35,890
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the proper way to do business and that's what should have been done

1244
01:40:36,794 --> 01:40:37,495
[SPEAKER_06]: nine months ago.

1245
01:40:37,775 --> 01:40:39,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have been open and transparent.

1246
01:40:40,378 --> 01:40:44,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having a tough time knowing, really, the position we were put in.

1247
01:40:44,602 --> 01:40:47,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extremely tough to make a decision.

1248
01:40:48,646 --> 01:40:56,354
[SPEAKER_06]: The lack of transparency, lack of communication, closed-door discussions, I feel like this is being shoved down our throat.

1249
01:41:01,071 --> 01:41:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: truly feel that a dual facility is going to be the most fiscally responsible way to go.

1250
01:41:07,234 --> 01:41:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that has to take place after a few months of multiple, multiple working groups to figure out, number one, a working group to research grants.

1251
01:41:18,299 --> 01:41:27,644
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor stated yesterday that she's been in discussions with, I believe, Representative Donato, Catherine Clark, but

1252
01:41:28,097 --> 01:41:33,659
[SPEAKER_06]: what time has been put into finding a grant, and are there grants out there for a dual facility?

1253
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: That needs to come first.

1254
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:43,362
[SPEAKER_06]: For the taxpayers, we're under a lot of pressure tonight, one way or another.

1255
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:57,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the ones that are trying to figure out the best way to go here, and it is very upsetting how much we need a new police station, and obviously now know the concerns of the fire station, and this is still being pushed down our throat.

1256
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:24,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how I will vote if the questions move forward, but I think three months of multiple working groups, that be it the fire department, the police department, the administration, with the city council, with the people, with the taxpayers and the citizens of this community, I believe if everybody puts their heads together, we can figure out a way to rule out or continue on with a dual facility.

1257
01:42:25,676 --> 01:42:26,677
[SPEAKER_06]: In a few months after

1258
01:42:27,265 --> 01:42:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: cost analysis are done.

1259
01:42:29,086 --> 01:42:30,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. McKillop is exactly right.

1260
01:42:31,246 --> 01:42:32,347
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the cost analysis?

1261
01:42:32,807 --> 01:42:33,927
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any.

1262
01:42:34,467 --> 01:42:39,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We were given five days before we could even ask any questions and we were asked to vote on it.

1263
01:42:40,409 --> 01:42:45,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, thankfully, we've got two weeks, we've got some breakdowns, we've got some questions answered.

1264
01:42:45,631 --> 01:42:46,331
[SPEAKER_06]: We still don't know.

1265
01:42:46,371 --> 01:42:48,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Councilor Scarpelli last night that asked

1266
01:42:49,462 --> 01:42:51,383
[SPEAKER_06]: What other locations were looked at?

1267
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't be told until those property owners are discussed.

1268
01:42:56,106 --> 01:42:58,768
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something we should know before we take this vote.

1269
01:42:59,288 --> 01:43:05,111
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's not what the police department wants to hear, nor should they have to hear it, because it has been too long.

1270
01:43:05,592 --> 01:43:06,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the truth.

1271
01:43:06,512 --> 01:43:14,137
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way this council should be moving forward for the benefit of the whole community and what is right.

1272
01:43:15,018 --> 01:43:26,840
[SPEAKER_06]: and for us to be completely 100% educated on a financial decision that is gonna impact us for 30 to 39 years that our children will be paying for.

1273
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna move that we take three months to create multiple working groups and we get started tomorrow to figure out the right way to do this.

1274
01:43:50,838 --> 01:43:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief.

1275
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, Leo Sacco, Chief of Police.

1276
01:43:55,722 --> 01:44:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make a couple of comments, so basically one major comment with regard to the grants.

1277
01:44:02,427 --> 01:44:04,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's talking about all the grants that are out there.

1278
01:44:05,069 --> 01:44:14,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that I've been chief now a little over 26 years, and a couple of weeks ago I told you for the past 20 years we needed a police station.

1279
01:44:15,677 --> 01:44:19,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you at least once a week I've been scouring

1280
01:44:19,785 --> 01:44:21,186
[SPEAKER_02]: different areas looking for grants.

1281
01:44:22,206 --> 01:44:23,667
[SPEAKER_02]: No money was left on the table.

1282
01:44:23,987 --> 01:44:34,611
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been no money, whether at the federal level or the state level, for brick and mortar construction, absolutely nothing, because they believe that's a local issue that should be dealt with locally.

1283
01:44:35,851 --> 01:44:45,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden, to the best of my understanding, received money because they relocated their police station to Eastern Avenue, the further end of the city.

1284
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I guess it's labeled as a redevelopment zone.

1285
01:44:49,441 --> 01:44:51,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So they receive redevelopment money for that.

1286
01:44:52,842 --> 01:45:01,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have such an area, or at least I don't think we have such an area in our city, but I don't want anyone, people have come up to the podium and talked about grants and money left on the table.

1287
01:45:01,786 --> 01:45:09,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want the public to think that the city of Medford was negligent and not looking for funding sources because if it was out there, we would have nailed it.

1288
01:45:10,049 --> 01:45:13,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Ladies in the back, please have respect for the chief on the podium.

1289
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:13,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1290
01:45:14,797 --> 01:45:15,717
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I wanted to say.

1291
01:45:15,737 --> 01:45:17,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure the record is straight.

1292
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:27,821
[SPEAKER_02]: We have looked for grants for the, at least the past 20 years for a police station, either through block grants or through federal government, through the state and to private entities for grants.

1293
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been nothing out there.

1294
01:45:30,402 --> 01:45:31,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So no money was left behind.

1295
01:45:32,042 --> 01:45:34,523
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was, if it was out there, we would have been looking for it.

1296
01:45:35,023 --> 01:45:35,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, chief.

1297
01:45:37,584 --> 01:45:41,405
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo is seconded by Councilor Knight.

1298
01:45:43,426 --> 01:45:43,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk.

1299
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:54,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Dello Russo has made the first motion.

1300
01:45:54,121 --> 01:46:02,443
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a financial paper.

1301
01:46:02,903 --> 01:46:11,825
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could, Mr. Clerk, if you could make that as a B paper.

1302
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:18,888
[SPEAKER_15]: We already have one B paper you gave already about the mold.

1303
01:46:20,429 --> 01:46:22,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Make this a C paper.

1304
01:46:24,772 --> 01:46:30,655
[SPEAKER_15]: You take a three month study group, is that correct?

1305
01:46:30,915 --> 01:46:32,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Multiple working groups.

1306
01:46:48,127 --> 01:46:51,068
[SPEAKER_15]: On the C paper, all those in favor?

1307
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:55,351
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1308
01:46:56,411 --> 01:46:57,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1309
01:47:03,596 --> 01:47:08,358
[SPEAKER_15]: C paper is for the three month work study group, Councilor Knight.

1310
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:12,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1311
01:47:15,182 --> 01:47:15,623
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a,

1312
01:47:17,195 --> 01:47:30,623
[SPEAKER_15]: a work-study group of police and fire officials and its residents to determine location, finances of all the police and fire stations.

1313
01:47:30,723 --> 01:47:31,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct, Councilor Lohengrin?

1314
01:47:32,664 --> 01:47:33,905
[SPEAKER_28]: Multiple options, yes.

1315
01:47:33,945 --> 01:47:34,905
[SPEAKER_15]: And all the options available.

1316
01:47:34,925 --> 01:47:44,591
[SPEAKER_28]: Analysis to figure out where we're gonna store our equipment, where will the Calabasas be confined.

1317
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:45,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1318
01:47:45,051 --> 01:47:45,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1319
01:47:45,331 --> 01:47:46,732
Thank you for the clarification, Mr. President.

1320
01:47:47,263 --> 01:47:48,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clay, please call the roll.

1321
01:47:48,464 --> 01:47:49,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dello Russo?

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1323
01:47:51,005 --> 01:47:51,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

1324
01:47:51,806 --> 01:47:52,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1325
01:47:52,866 --> 01:47:53,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

1326
01:47:53,527 --> 01:47:53,727
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1327
01:47:55,027 --> 01:47:55,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor McCurdy?

1328
01:47:55,808 --> 01:47:56,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

01:47:57,609 --> 01:47:58,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Montz?

1330
01:47:58,489 --> 01:47:58,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1331
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:00,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli?

[SPEAKER_16]: President Caraviello?

1334
01:48:02,412 --> 01:48:02,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1335
01:48:04,553 --> 01:48:06,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

1336
01:48:07,154 --> 01:48:12,677
[SPEAKER_15]: On the B paper, that the city do a mold study in the fire station?

1337
01:48:13,778 --> 01:48:15,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Mold and air quality in the fire station.

1338
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:17,586
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1339
01:48:19,567 --> 01:48:20,087
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

1340
01:48:20,107 --> 01:48:20,307
[SPEAKER_15]: None.

1341
01:48:20,948 --> 01:48:21,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1342
01:48:23,049 --> 01:48:23,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

1343
01:48:25,631 --> 01:48:31,215
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm of a motion, but I did ask several times that we have a project timeline for both the police and the fire station.

1344
01:48:31,235 --> 01:48:31,395
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1345
01:48:31,976 --> 01:48:36,379
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could take a vote on that too, Mr. President.

1346
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:37,280
[SPEAKER_15]: That'll be a separate paper.

1347
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:38,841
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.

1348
01:48:38,981 --> 01:48:39,421
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine.

1349
01:48:40,162 --> 01:48:43,304
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Marks that we have a timeline,

1350
01:48:43,875 --> 01:48:45,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Project timeline.

1351
01:48:45,235 --> 01:48:46,095
[SPEAKER_15]: For both fire and police.

1352
01:48:46,115 --> 01:48:47,096
[SPEAKER_15]: For both fire and police.

1353
01:48:47,476 --> 01:48:48,116
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1354
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:49,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1355
01:48:49,576 --> 01:48:50,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1356
01:48:51,176 --> 01:48:58,337
[SPEAKER_15]: On Councilor Dello Russo's motion that is take the first reading, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1357
01:48:58,377 --> 01:49:00,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1358
01:49:00,698 --> 01:49:02,198
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may.

1359
01:49:02,218 --> 01:49:03,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1360
01:49:04,218 --> 01:49:05,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I have these interruptions, Mr. President.

1361
01:49:06,699 --> 01:49:07,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you interrupt all the time.

1362
01:49:08,419 --> 01:49:09,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1363
01:49:09,999 --> 01:49:12,820
[SPEAKER_06]: The C paper, I believe they kind of

1364
01:49:13,707 --> 01:49:15,708
[SPEAKER_06]: The seat paper and the main motion.

1365
01:49:15,788 --> 01:49:16,748
[SPEAKER_15]: They are kind of contradictory.

1366
01:49:16,768 --> 01:49:17,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they are.

1367
01:49:17,048 --> 01:49:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Contradictory.

1368
01:49:17,548 --> 01:49:18,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we can have a little discussion.

1369
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:20,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I would move to table.

1370
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:23,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no discussion if I table it.

1371
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:24,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Table what?

1372
01:49:24,171 --> 01:49:24,891
[SPEAKER_15]: The bond motion?

1373
01:49:25,331 --> 01:49:26,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm tabling that.

1374
01:49:26,652 --> 01:49:28,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've already tabled it once.

1375
01:49:28,573 --> 01:49:30,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it is tabled two weeks ago.

1376
01:49:30,834 --> 01:49:31,794
[SPEAKER_06]: You can table it any time.

1377
01:49:31,814 --> 01:49:32,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't section 22 it.

1378
01:49:34,695 --> 01:49:36,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if we can table that.

1379
01:49:36,116 --> 01:49:36,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure you can.

1380
01:49:37,376 --> 01:49:38,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure you can.

1381
01:49:38,337 --> 01:49:38,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

1382
01:49:38,617 --> 01:49:39,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me table it for a second time.

1383
01:49:39,837 --> 01:49:41,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Third, fourth, fifth time.

1384
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:42,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure you can.

1385
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:44,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Floor, Madam Presidents.

1386
01:49:46,482 --> 01:49:47,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I move to table.

1387
01:49:49,905 --> 01:49:53,748
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, if you will, a section 22 can only be invoked once.

1388
01:49:54,168 --> 01:49:57,370
[SPEAKER_20]: That's under the mass general law, section 22 of chapter 43.

1389
01:49:57,711 --> 01:50:03,335
[SPEAKER_20]: The motion to table is separate from a request for it to invoke section 22.

1390
01:50:03,695 --> 01:50:06,738
[SPEAKER_20]: And a motion for table would require the acquiescence of the council.

1391
01:50:07,378 --> 01:50:09,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Although the ruling is the chairs, but that is the back.

1392
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:12,222
[SPEAKER_15]: On council, council member occurrence motion to table,

1393
01:50:12,975 --> 01:50:13,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by.

1394
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:18,297
[SPEAKER_21]: What's the reasoning for the table?

1395
01:50:18,557 --> 01:50:19,118
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a second.

1396
01:50:19,158 --> 01:50:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it contradicts to paper C. If we're going to explore, create working groups to explore dual facility and different locations and get cost analysis, wouldn't it be contradictory to approving the bond?

1397
01:50:36,645 --> 01:50:38,646
[SPEAKER_15]: One is a resolution and one is a bond order.

1398
01:50:42,051 --> 01:50:43,392
[SPEAKER_15]: The resolution would go to the mayor.

1399
01:50:45,332 --> 01:50:47,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, so why can't we do both together?

1400
01:50:48,013 --> 01:50:49,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Why can't we do both together?

1401
01:50:51,515 --> 01:50:54,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they're contradictory.

1402
01:50:54,376 --> 01:50:55,336
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not contradictory.

1403
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:58,657
[SPEAKER_21]: They're creating a working group while the process is going on.

1404
01:51:00,178 --> 01:51:01,298
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see that as contradictory.

1405
01:51:02,939 --> 01:51:04,900
[SPEAKER_15]: On Councilor Langoukian's motion to table.

1406
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have a second?

1407
01:51:08,141 --> 01:51:08,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1408
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:09,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Martz.

1409
01:51:10,102 --> 01:51:10,802
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1410
01:51:13,602 --> 01:51:17,324
[SPEAKER_16]: The chair seems to be in doubt.

1411
01:51:17,804 --> 01:51:19,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll.

1412
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:26,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1413
01:51:26,386 --> 01:51:26,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1414
01:51:26,486 --> 01:51:26,526
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1415
01:51:40,017 --> 01:51:41,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

1416
01:51:41,578 --> 01:51:42,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion fails.

1417
01:51:44,199 --> 01:51:47,601
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo and seconded by any for the main motion.

1418
01:51:47,641 --> 01:51:50,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll for the law and order.

1419
01:51:52,504 --> 01:51:54,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, please.

1420
01:51:54,586 --> 01:51:56,026
[SPEAKER_17]: You did not get into the roll call vote.

1421
01:52:01,724 --> 01:52:03,045
[SPEAKER_21]: He can speak as many times as he wants.

1422
01:52:03,065 --> 01:52:06,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, you just don't like me, so that's your problem, Councilor Dello Russo.

1423
01:52:06,828 --> 01:52:09,170
[SPEAKER_27]: The people out there have elected you people.

1424
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:10,171
[SPEAKER_27]: We're voting on the motion.

1425
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:11,872
[SPEAKER_27]: On your motion, Mr. President.

1426
01:52:11,912 --> 01:52:12,933
[SPEAKER_15]: We are voting on the motion.

1427
01:52:13,253 --> 01:52:23,261
[SPEAKER_27]: On the motion, but apparently, as Councilor Longo-Kearns alluded to, it is contradictory to the point number C. Councilor Longo-Kearns is a resolution that will go to the mayor's office.

1428
01:52:23,281 --> 01:52:24,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay?

1429
01:52:24,903 --> 01:52:28,946
[SPEAKER_15]: That will go to the mayor's office, which the mayor can decide to accept or decline.

1430
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:33,161
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the mayor's, it's not the mayor's privilege, it's the council's privilege.

1431
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:35,942
[SPEAKER_27]: It's your prerogative, not the mayor's.

1432
01:52:35,962 --> 01:52:38,262
[SPEAKER_15]: We are voting on the loan order right at the moment.

1433
01:52:38,663 --> 01:52:40,263
[SPEAKER_27]: On the loan order in and of itself.

1434
01:52:40,343 --> 01:52:43,644
[SPEAKER_27]: It's your prerogative, not prerogative, not the mayor's prerogative.

1435
01:52:44,084 --> 01:52:48,785
[SPEAKER_27]: And you've already voted on point number C, which is contradictory to the main motion.

1436
01:52:49,166 --> 01:52:51,306
[SPEAKER_15]: We are voting on the loan order, Councilor Penta.

1437
01:52:52,587 --> 01:52:53,127
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you better.

1438
01:52:53,427 --> 01:52:53,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1439
01:52:55,173 --> 01:53:00,098
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo and seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1440
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:02,780
[SPEAKER_15]: To take its first reading.

1441
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:03,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1442
01:53:03,961 --> 01:53:04,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1443
01:53:04,762 --> 01:53:05,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

1444
01:53:05,483 --> 01:53:05,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1445
01:53:06,203 --> 01:53:06,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

1446
01:53:06,824 --> 01:53:07,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1447
01:53:07,585 --> 01:53:08,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Allen-Curran?

1448
01:53:09,006 --> 01:53:09,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1449
01:53:10,367 --> 01:53:11,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice-President Marks?

1450
01:53:11,508 --> 01:53:11,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1451
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:13,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott-Bell?

1452
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:13,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1453
01:53:14,231 --> 01:53:14,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice-President Caraviello?

1454
01:53:15,392 --> 01:53:15,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1455
01:53:17,294 --> 01:53:19,516
[SPEAKER_15]: The paper will take its first reading.

1456
01:53:20,187 --> 01:53:20,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1457
01:53:23,249 --> 01:53:24,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Suspension by Councilor Knight.

1458
01:53:31,736 --> 01:53:40,463
[SPEAKER_15]: This paper is eligible for its third reading this evening, which is the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Education, Chapter 26.

1459
01:53:41,304 --> 01:53:44,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1460
01:53:44,646 --> 01:53:44,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1461
01:53:47,062 --> 01:53:49,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1462
01:53:49,465 --> 01:53:54,430
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll wait for the audience to clear out, Mr. President.

1463
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:59,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I just wanted to say thank you to all the council members for your support.

1464
01:53:59,194 --> 01:54:05,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it's been a long grind, but you've always been supportive of what we needed in the police station.

1465
01:54:06,202 --> 01:54:07,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna say thank you for that.

1466
01:54:07,763 --> 01:54:12,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna thank the mayor for her efforts and her staff for all the work that they've done in making this possible.

1467
01:54:13,385 --> 01:54:19,948
[SPEAKER_02]: But one group I have to note is the police officers, the patrol officers and the superiors.

1468
01:54:20,849 --> 01:54:25,371
[SPEAKER_02]: They made this a front burner item and they kept it there and they deserve a lot of credit for it.

1469
01:54:25,411 --> 01:54:29,573
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like we heard the other night about a home, that's their home.

1470
01:54:29,673 --> 01:54:33,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, thank you and I wanna thank all of them as well, thanks.

1471
01:54:42,156 --> 01:54:42,276
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1472
01:54:42,296 --> 01:54:43,377
[SPEAKER_21]: We got one more question, Mr. President.

1473
01:54:44,497 --> 01:54:48,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Walter Buckley, Vice President, Local 1032, 340 Salem Street.

1474
01:54:49,879 --> 01:54:57,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to thank the councilors that were in favor of at least taking the two weeks to consider and answer some questions that we had.

1475
01:54:58,903 --> 01:55:06,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it didn't come out in our favor tonight, but we want to thank you who put the time and effort into answering our questions.

1476
01:55:07,507 --> 01:55:09,488
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all I got.

1477
01:55:09,768 --> 01:55:10,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1478
01:55:12,347 --> 01:55:19,349
[SPEAKER_15]: 15, 16, 5, 7, 4, as offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, that it take its third reading this evening.

1479
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:22,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call.

1480
01:55:22,030 --> 01:55:22,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call, Mr. Clerk.

1481
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:23,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry?

1482
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:24,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval.

1483
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:25,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval.

1484
01:55:26,891 --> 01:55:27,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote.

1485
01:55:27,551 --> 01:55:28,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

1486
01:55:30,012 --> 01:55:30,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

1487
01:55:32,212 --> 01:55:36,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe for the edification of the audience, they don't really know what this paper is about.

1488
01:55:36,233 --> 01:55:37,994
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to give a brief synopsis?

1489
01:55:38,034 --> 01:55:38,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1490
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:48,593
[SPEAKER_15]: This paper is in regards to Tufts University notifying the city of Medford of all their students that are living in the city.

1491
01:55:49,273 --> 01:55:54,034
[SPEAKER_15]: And the address is and how many people are living in each apartment.

1492
01:55:54,054 --> 01:56:05,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there are any code violations that our code enforcement officer will be able to rectify them so we don't have any further tragedies going forward like we had seven years ago.

1493
01:56:07,698 --> 01:56:08,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Well said, Mr. President.

1494
01:56:09,139 --> 01:56:12,961
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could, I wanna thank the Ad Hoc Education Committee.

1495
01:56:12,981 --> 01:56:19,025
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was chaired by Councilor Falco, Councilor Cohen, and Councilor Scarpelli.

1496
01:56:20,026 --> 01:56:36,016
[SPEAKER_21]: They did yeoman's work in an issue that's been lingering in this community for a number of years, and one that has an impact on neighborhoods that abut, in particular, Tufts University, and the issues that

1497
01:56:37,177 --> 01:56:38,458
[SPEAKER_21]: are involved, Mr. President.

1498
01:56:38,979 --> 01:56:54,428
[SPEAKER_21]: This is not gonna solve all the issues, but as was mentioned in the subcommittee meeting, it's gonna be another tool in the toolbox to allow our code enforcement officers to be proactive in some cases and reactive in other cases.

1499
01:56:54,988 --> 01:56:57,750
[SPEAKER_21]: So I see this as a good step forward.

1500
01:56:58,410 --> 01:57:02,853
[SPEAKER_21]: As I stated at the meeting, Mr. President, I think we need something citywide.

1501
01:57:03,723 --> 01:57:08,427
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is an issue that impacts every segment of this community.

1502
01:57:08,767 --> 01:57:17,914
[SPEAKER_21]: We have illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and at some point, it's a quality of life issue in all our neighborhoods.

1503
01:57:18,374 --> 01:57:21,457
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm thankful of the subcommittee's work on this.

1504
01:57:21,817 --> 01:57:25,280
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thankful for the neighbors that showed up at each of the meetings.

1505
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:54,047
[SPEAKER_21]: to express their opinions on this very issue, Mr. President, and I'm thankful that we now have a tool like Somerville in Boston that will allow us to not only safeguard neighborhoods and the quality of life in a neighborhood, but also, Mr. President, safeguard the students that are living within these apartments, Mr. President, that landlords don't have any care regarding the number of people they're trying to

1506
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:55,570
[SPEAKER_21]: cram into an apartment.

1507
01:57:56,531 --> 01:58:06,093
[SPEAKER_21]: So I look forward to the implementation of this and eventual use as an effective tool for the neighbors of Salt Method in the Hillside area.

1508
01:58:08,174 --> 01:58:08,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1509
01:58:08,674 --> 01:58:09,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1510
01:58:11,655 --> 01:58:12,675
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Falco.

1511
01:58:12,755 --> 01:58:13,495
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll be very brief.

1512
01:58:13,515 --> 01:58:22,818
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to thank my subcommittee members as well and the committee as a whole because at some point this did go to committee as a whole as well and there were a lot of great questions that were asked

1513
01:58:23,435 --> 01:58:30,801
[SPEAKER_30]: And just thank the city solicitor Romley and John Babuso, our code enforcement officer as well.

1514
01:58:30,941 --> 01:58:39,027
[SPEAKER_30]: But also to thank the neighbors that showed up to the meetings, that attended the meetings, and that there are some neighbors that are here tonight that just want to.

1515
01:58:39,482 --> 01:58:42,064
[SPEAKER_30]: assure that this gets through, and I'm confident that it will.

1516
01:58:42,344 --> 01:58:52,250
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that, like Councilor Mark said, this is another tool that the Code Enforcement Officer has to keep our neighborhoods safe.

1517
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:53,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1518
01:58:53,551 --> 01:58:53,871
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1519
01:58:54,391 --> 01:58:54,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1520
01:58:55,412 --> 01:59:04,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out the work of Barbara Rubel and Rocco DiRico and their work with the Council in ensuring that this is an ordinance that is going to be operational.

1521
01:59:04,507 --> 01:59:10,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to thank the work of the Tufts University Community Affairs Office, especially Mr. DeRico, who's here in the audience this evening.

1522
01:59:11,194 --> 01:59:14,197
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of work was done by a lot of people on this very good mission.

1523
01:59:14,497 --> 01:59:15,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1524
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:18,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1525
01:59:18,381 --> 01:59:18,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1526
01:59:19,122 --> 01:59:19,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

1527
01:59:19,923 --> 01:59:20,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1528
01:59:20,603 --> 01:59:21,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Nett?

1529
01:59:21,244 --> 01:59:21,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1530
01:59:22,005 --> 01:59:22,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Carter?

1531
01:59:22,826 --> 01:59:22,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1532
01:59:23,607 --> 01:59:24,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice-President Marks.

1533
01:59:24,608 --> 01:59:24,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1534
01:59:25,308 --> 01:59:26,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1535
01:59:26,148 --> 01:59:26,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1536
01:59:26,969 --> 01:59:27,689
[SPEAKER_16]: President Caraviello.

1537
01:59:27,749 --> 01:59:27,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1538
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:29,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative.

1539
01:59:29,650 --> 01:59:30,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1540
01:59:30,611 --> 01:59:35,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

1541
01:59:36,434 --> 01:59:38,655
[SPEAKER_15]: 17085 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1542
01:59:39,336 --> 01:59:49,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to how the plans for the potential new police station were presented to the public last week and how they were paid for.

1543
01:59:50,001 --> 01:59:51,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1544
01:59:52,699 --> 01:59:54,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1545
01:59:54,721 --> 01:59:58,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these questions were answered last night during our committee of the whole meeting.

1546
01:59:58,623 --> 02:00:03,807
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Donovan Sweeney was paid $150 an hour.

1547
02:00:03,827 --> 02:00:10,893
[SPEAKER_06]: They estimated less than $10,000 has been spent for their services thus far.

1548
02:00:11,033 --> 02:00:19,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could just get, the only question now that needs to be answered is where did that $10,000, what account or which line item did that $10,000 come from?

1549
02:00:19,539 --> 02:00:21,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion by,

1550
02:00:22,827 --> 02:00:27,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lococo that we find out where the $10,000 came from.

1551
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:29,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a second?

1552
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:33,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

1553
02:00:33,094 --> 02:00:33,895
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1554
02:00:34,275 --> 02:00:34,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1555
02:00:34,815 --> 02:00:35,636
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1556
02:00:35,656 --> 02:00:35,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1557
02:00:36,937 --> 02:00:40,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1558
02:00:40,819 --> 02:00:42,580
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-088 offered by Councilor Knight.

1559
02:00:43,021 --> 02:00:48,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request MassDOT take the appropriate steps

1560
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,582
[SPEAKER_15]: to have the graffiti at Roosevelt Circle removed.

1561
02:00:52,702 --> 02:00:53,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1562
02:00:53,322 --> 02:00:55,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1563
02:00:55,683 --> 02:00:58,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently this quarter it's my turn to bring this resolution forward.

1564
02:00:58,705 --> 02:01:13,793
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of us at one time or another have taken the opportunity to bring this resolution forward and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department, MassDOT, come down and beautify the retaining wall along Roosevelt Circle, which is right now plagued with very pretty pink graffiti.

1565
02:01:14,493 --> 02:01:19,596
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues support me in sending a correspondence to MassDOT requesting that that issue be resolved.

1566
02:01:20,248 --> 02:01:27,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could maybe send it to Councilor, Representative Donato, that is his district, for his help.

1567
02:01:28,311 --> 02:01:29,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Alango Kern.

1568
02:01:30,651 --> 02:01:31,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record.

1569
02:01:31,872 --> 02:01:33,172
[SPEAKER_23]: Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

1570
02:01:33,472 --> 02:01:35,813
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing up graffiti.

1571
02:01:35,853 --> 02:01:38,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Sometimes it is a problem, visually to the eyes.

1572
02:01:39,734 --> 02:01:48,157
[SPEAKER_23]: On the other hand, it's more important that the state, whoever's in charge, around that circle, near 93, getting on and off

1573
02:01:49,609 --> 02:01:51,490
[SPEAKER_23]: going up towards our rights pond.

1574
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:59,794
[SPEAKER_23]: That area, a lot of times, is overgrown with kind of like trees that are wild.

1575
02:02:00,314 --> 02:02:04,776
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a visual obstruction to the drivers.

1576
02:02:05,396 --> 02:02:08,998
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's not an easy place to negotiate vehicles back and forth.

1577
02:02:09,518 --> 02:02:10,479
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1578
02:02:10,499 --> 02:02:10,799
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1579
02:02:10,879 --> 02:02:17,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department submit to the Medford City Council a maintenance schedule for the area.

1580
02:02:17,582 --> 02:02:17,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1581
02:02:18,192 --> 02:02:19,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1582
02:02:20,993 --> 02:02:22,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1583
02:02:22,433 --> 02:02:23,133
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1584
02:02:23,994 --> 02:02:26,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1585
02:02:26,855 --> 02:02:27,975
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-089 offered by Councilor Knight.

1586
02:02:28,335 --> 02:02:35,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way.

1587
02:02:35,997 --> 02:02:36,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1588
02:02:37,057 --> 02:02:38,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1589
02:02:38,698 --> 02:02:45,640
[SPEAKER_11]: As the council and the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances begins its discussion on zoning, one of the concerns that's been raised is the

1590
02:02:46,403 --> 02:02:59,427
[SPEAKER_11]: number of commercial and industrial parcels that are coming off the rolls with residential development and the city's future ability to provide an equitable tax shift from the residential tax burden to the commercial and industrial properties, Mr. President.

1591
02:03:00,187 --> 02:03:11,170
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, there are certain streets in the vicinity of large commercial developments, such as the Meadowglen Mall, Linden Street being one, that is a dead-end street that abuts the private property of the Meadowglen Mall site.

1592
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:14,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm asking the city solicitor, with the support of this council, hopefully,

1593
02:03:15,518 --> 02:03:28,252
[SPEAKER_11]: To provide us with an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a thruway for the purpose of future examination of developing a strong commercial or industrial based district down there for tax revenues purposes, Mr. President.

1594
02:03:28,312 --> 02:03:37,802
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked with some of the neighbors in the area, some of the residents and property owners on the street, and it's something that they've expressed concern about for a number of years in terms of making Linden Street a thruway.

1595
02:03:38,509 --> 02:03:46,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, currently, at the present time, there is a construction fence that is up at the end of the dead-end roadway, Mr. President.

1596
02:03:47,133 --> 02:04:06,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And in previous years past, due to the involvement and efforts of Fire Chief McCabe at the time, there was a breakaway fence that was put there for public safety purposes so that if there was ever a situation where fire trucks could not enter Linden Street from the Riverside Ave side of the property, they would be able to do so through the abutting property of Meadowland Mall, Mr. President.

1597
02:04:06,658 --> 02:04:07,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask that this paper be approved.

1598
02:04:07,879 --> 02:04:09,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

1599
02:04:09,401 --> 02:04:12,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we move forward, I look forward to updating you with any information that we receive.

1600
02:04:13,485 --> 02:04:14,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Member O'Karn.

1601
02:04:14,425 --> 02:04:14,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1602
02:04:15,106 --> 02:04:18,209
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello, I don't mind getting an opinion on this.

1603
02:04:18,289 --> 02:04:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I just do want to point out there are neighbors that have reached out to me within the last week, curious why this was on.

1604
02:04:25,455 --> 02:04:32,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're, you know, I don't know if they're necessarily opposed to it, but they had very grave concerns of opening up Linden Street.

1605
02:04:33,151 --> 02:04:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to point that out, and an opinion is fine, but whether or not we do it, I definitely think it's something that we need to get that whole neighborhood involved with before we move forward on anything.

1606
02:04:43,413 --> 02:04:44,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Nice.

1607
02:04:44,174 --> 02:04:54,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd certainly make myself readily available to any constituent that has a question about a piece of paper or legislation that I've put forward, so they're always more than welcome to contact me directly as well, Mr. President.

1608
02:04:54,596 --> 02:04:54,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1609
02:04:55,616 --> 02:05:00,398
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Nice, as seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor.

1610
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:01,858
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion is.

1611
02:05:03,672 --> 02:05:11,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way.

1612
02:05:11,293 --> 02:05:16,534
[SPEAKER_15]: There's currently a gate at the end because it will go on to private property.

1613
02:05:17,774 --> 02:05:20,975
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a fire gate, which the fire department has the keys to.

1614
02:05:21,035 --> 02:05:25,156
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're looking for the city solicitor to render an opinion?

1615
02:05:25,356 --> 02:05:32,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether that gate can come down and that public street can go on to private property.

1616
02:05:32,557 --> 02:05:33,457
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not asking for the answer.

1617
02:05:33,915 --> 02:05:35,336
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we're just asking for an opinion.

1618
02:05:36,417 --> 02:05:36,897
[SPEAKER_15]: An opinion.

1619
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:40,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1620
02:05:42,382 --> 02:05:45,605
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, a seconded by Councilor Falco.

1621
02:05:45,645 --> 02:05:46,385
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1622
02:05:47,606 --> 02:05:48,907
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1623
02:05:49,648 --> 02:05:51,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1624
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:53,891
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-090 offered by Councilor Knight.

1625
02:05:54,492 --> 02:05:57,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request

1626
02:05:57,738 --> 02:06:04,083
[SPEAKER_15]: a cost estimate for the repointing of the wall and replacement of the wrought iron gates at Royal Park.

1627
02:06:04,263 --> 02:06:04,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1628
02:06:05,463 --> 02:06:06,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1629
02:06:06,744 --> 02:06:10,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been brought to my attention that the gates down at Royal Park were removed.

1630
02:06:11,228 --> 02:06:19,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason that they were removed was because for a number of years they were not being utilized as open and closed as often as they have been in recent past.

1631
02:06:20,194 --> 02:06:23,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The infrastructure wasn't able to sustain the ongoing use.

1632
02:06:24,016 --> 02:06:24,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the

1633
02:06:25,555 --> 02:06:31,498
[SPEAKER_11]: gates were put up sometime in the 20s, according to some of the research that Mr. Lincoln and the Friends of the Royal House and the Slave Quarters have done.

1634
02:06:31,878 --> 02:06:36,040
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, they're ornate gates that did serve a purpose.

1635
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:38,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel as though it's something that should go back up.

1636
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:42,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel as though the rotating wall surrounding Royal Park is in disrepair at this point in time.

1637
02:06:43,403 --> 02:06:50,666
[SPEAKER_11]: And a cost estimate as to what it would take to repoint the brick wall and put up the wrought iron gates is the subject matter of this resolution.

1638
02:06:51,286 --> 02:06:51,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1639
02:06:51,786 --> 02:06:53,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1640
02:06:54,783 --> 02:06:55,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll yield to Mr. Lincoln.

1641
02:06:55,963 --> 02:06:59,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Fackl, we yield to the gentleman at the podium.

1642
02:06:59,464 --> 02:07:01,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Tom Lincoln.

1643
02:07:01,205 --> 02:07:04,846
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street.

1644
02:07:04,906 --> 02:07:08,247
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been a neighbor of the park for well over 100 years.

1645
02:07:08,267 --> 02:07:11,088
[SPEAKER_25]: It wasn't there then, but sometimes it feels like it.

1646
02:07:11,488 --> 02:07:18,150
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, I believe the park was actually either given or sold to the city of Medford in the 1920s as part of the royal estate.

1647
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:23,732
[SPEAKER_25]: We get a lot of visitors from out of town that come to Medford to visit the Royal House and Slave Quarters.

1648
02:07:24,414 --> 02:07:29,636
[SPEAKER_25]: I had a few comments about the state of the gates in the park, and we'd certainly like to see this done.

1649
02:07:29,696 --> 02:07:35,637
[SPEAKER_25]: And we greatly appreciate Councilor Knight's resolution along these lines.

1650
02:07:35,657 --> 02:07:47,200
[SPEAKER_25]: You may recall, just as a piece of this, that there was an auto accident on the main street side of the park sometime in the last 10 years, I would guess, which caused a lot of damage.

1651
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:48,881
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was repaired.

1652
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:52,882
[SPEAKER_25]: But the masonry, including the low base of some of the wall,

1653
02:07:53,929 --> 02:07:55,850
[SPEAKER_25]: on the George Street side is not in good shape.

1654
02:07:56,070 --> 02:08:06,633
[SPEAKER_25]: In addition, we share a common border, a common boundary with the park, a mixed masonry and historic wooden fence.

1655
02:08:06,973 --> 02:08:18,937
[SPEAKER_25]: And we've actually had some discussion previously with the DPW and the city about working on that, which we intend to revisit.

1656
02:08:19,177 --> 02:08:21,078
[SPEAKER_25]: We'd be delighted as neighbors

1657
02:08:22,725 --> 02:08:27,866
[SPEAKER_25]: sort of historic co-owners, shall we say, to see some progress on this.

1658
02:08:27,906 --> 02:08:39,129
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure the gates, I assume the gates have been stored someplace and could be put up, but I had not realized that the estate of the masonry was the main reason that they were removed.

1659
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:40,069
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you.

1660
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:42,010
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Falco.

1661
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:43,010
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1662
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:50,792
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Lincoln, if I can ask you a quick question, just because while we're on the topic of the Royal House, you know, it's a historic,

1663
02:08:51,437 --> 02:08:58,559
[SPEAKER_30]: It's something that people drive by and it's part of Medford and it's been here for hundreds of years.

1664
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:03,400
[SPEAKER_30]: But if you drive by at night, you never know who's there.

1665
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:06,781
[SPEAKER_30]: So my question is, has there ever been lighting in the front?

1666
02:09:06,801 --> 02:09:07,841
[SPEAKER_30]: Because I don't know if there has.

1667
02:09:11,521 --> 02:09:16,025
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there any thought of actually reinstalling lighting or putting lighting in so people can see it at night?

1668
02:09:16,245 --> 02:09:16,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1669
02:09:17,206 --> 02:09:20,769
[SPEAKER_25]: I know this question was raised earlier, and I think I sent a letter to the council about it.

1670
02:09:21,169 --> 02:09:24,632
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Jay Griffin actually was here about it a few weeks ago.

1671
02:09:24,652 --> 02:09:27,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that possible?

1672
02:09:27,815 --> 02:09:35,281
[SPEAKER_25]: At one time, we had what's called architectural lighting on our property to light up the facade of the main building.

1673
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:37,683
[SPEAKER_25]: There was also a light on the slave quarters.

1674
02:09:38,612 --> 02:09:42,573
[SPEAKER_25]: On the slave quarters, we provided other lighting, more like security lighting.

1675
02:09:43,373 --> 02:09:47,194
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, we have another problem with the lantern actually on George Street.

1676
02:09:48,694 --> 02:09:52,154
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of this conduit, et cetera, was installed many, many years ago.

1677
02:09:53,455 --> 02:10:07,217
[SPEAKER_25]: Since that time, the lighting failed on the facade, but in this period, the whole practice for historic monuments, like National Historic Landmarks, which this is, which is the highest category of historic

1678
02:10:08,165 --> 02:10:13,006
[SPEAKER_25]: protection in the United States have changed, the technology has changed.

1679
02:10:14,707 --> 02:10:23,749
[SPEAKER_25]: At this point, we don't feel we can, two things, we're struggling with, struggling is too strong a word, we're debating about what to do, if anything, on that.

1680
02:10:23,969 --> 02:10:27,570
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, the building is set way back from the Main Street side.

1681
02:10:29,391 --> 02:10:32,952
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that you need a lot of lighting.

1682
02:10:34,252 --> 02:10:37,573
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, the cost of that, the aesthetics,

1683
02:10:38,438 --> 02:10:39,178
[SPEAKER_25]: There's some debate.

1684
02:10:40,159 --> 02:10:48,401
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the co-presidents, Peter Gittleman of the Royal House Board, actually manages 36 buildings for Historic New England.

1685
02:10:49,321 --> 02:11:04,446
[SPEAKER_25]: They have the Otis House downtown, and they've had a lot of issues involving architectural lighting, and I think that's become, it's an issue in the rather rarefied world of historic

1686
02:11:05,492 --> 02:11:05,972
[SPEAKER_25]: properties.

1687
02:11:06,073 --> 02:11:08,874
[SPEAKER_25]: We've made other improvements on the ground.

1688
02:11:08,914 --> 02:11:27,387
[SPEAKER_25]: If you haven't been there for a while, the front entrance has been, we've added an accessible pathway, repaved a long section from the sidewalk up to the slave quarters entrance, and we've done other work on the grounds.

1689
02:11:29,288 --> 02:11:32,390
[SPEAKER_25]: It's often said in the historic preservation business, at least

1690
02:11:32,809 --> 02:11:45,540
[SPEAKER_25]: with 18th century buildings, these buildings are almost 300 years old at this point, that you might be better off digging a hole in the ground and shoveling $100 bills in terms of the costs of maintenance.

1691
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:48,062
[SPEAKER_25]: But rest assured, it's something that we're thinking about.

1692
02:11:48,122 --> 02:11:49,003
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not my decision.

1693
02:11:49,043 --> 02:11:54,468
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm merely the administrator in terms of further lighting there.

1694
02:11:55,429 --> 02:11:59,272
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you know if, has anybody taken a look at what that would cost?

1695
02:12:00,702 --> 02:12:02,763
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't have a cost estimate.

1696
02:12:02,783 --> 02:12:04,423
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been playing catch-up ball.

1697
02:12:04,463 --> 02:12:06,764
[SPEAKER_25]: We redid the decorative fence last year.

1698
02:12:06,824 --> 02:12:10,525
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to work on the fence between the royal house and the park, as I mentioned.

1699
02:12:11,385 --> 02:12:14,846
[SPEAKER_25]: We've replaced two restrooms.

1700
02:12:15,486 --> 02:12:17,627
[SPEAKER_25]: We've done a lot of plumbing, a lot of electrical upgrade.

1701
02:12:19,067 --> 02:12:23,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Construction in old buildings with these very high standards is very expensive.

1702
02:12:23,929 --> 02:12:24,849
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't have an estimate.

1703
02:12:25,889 --> 02:12:29,090
[SPEAKER_25]: It would involve a new conduit.

1704
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:40,864
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the tricky part, as I understand it, and I'm no expert on technology, is what kind of lights, how far away they are, what they get you in efficiency.

1705
02:12:41,324 --> 02:12:46,866
[SPEAKER_25]: The lights we had there were the low sodium, which are incredibly inefficient.

1706
02:12:48,487 --> 02:12:54,149
[SPEAKER_25]: And in fact, the bulbs are like $75 now, and they don't last long.

1707
02:12:54,449 --> 02:12:57,610
[SPEAKER_25]: But the problem is that the conduit is shot, so there's not even any power.

1708
02:12:58,031 --> 02:12:59,272
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's on the list.

1709
02:12:59,452 --> 02:13:07,879
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a fairly long list of interior and exterior maintenance and restoration items.

1710
02:13:07,939 --> 02:13:08,040
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

1711
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:08,360
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1712
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:09,481
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for your hard work.

1713
02:13:09,561 --> 02:13:10,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

1714
02:13:10,402 --> 02:13:10,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1715
02:13:13,244 --> 02:13:16,207
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Nunez, seconded by Councilor Powell.

1716
02:13:17,047 --> 02:13:17,728
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1717
02:13:17,748 --> 02:13:18,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1718
02:13:18,448 --> 02:13:19,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1719
02:13:22,712 --> 02:13:26,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take hands of the clerk.

1720
02:13:33,953 --> 02:13:44,622
[SPEAKER_15]: 170094.

1721
02:13:36,375 --> 02:13:44,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the code enforcement officer contact the representative of Planet Aid donation boxes.

1722
02:13:45,142 --> 02:13:50,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of the sites where the boxes are located are overflowing with bags and falling onto the ground.

1723
02:13:52,488 --> 02:13:58,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I have gone by the box on Mystic Avenue, up in the heights on Fulton Street and the one at the

1724
02:13:58,977 --> 02:14:02,318
[SPEAKER_15]: book school, there's bags all over the place, so they haven't been emptied for some time.

1725
02:14:02,919 --> 02:14:09,721
[SPEAKER_15]: If the code enforcement officer could contact them to get them emptied, because they are quite unsightly.

1726
02:14:12,803 --> 02:14:13,523
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1727
02:14:15,164 --> 02:14:15,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

1728
02:14:18,405 --> 02:14:19,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1729
02:14:19,525 --> 02:14:23,607
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe at some point we could send this issue to one of our subcommittees.

1730
02:14:24,158 --> 02:14:29,323
[SPEAKER_21]: because it's a real large issue in this community regarding these metal boxes.

1731
02:14:30,364 --> 02:14:42,617
[SPEAKER_21]: I've had the circumstance to go down to Fells Plaza on a number of occasions, and I've talked to the management company, and I've asked them about particular boxes because it may be a clothing box, but there's 22 TVs that are broken.

1732
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,041
[SPEAKER_21]: outside the clothing box.

1733
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:49,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Or it's a box just for books, and there's all old clothes out in front of the box.

1734
02:14:49,785 --> 02:14:54,548
[SPEAKER_21]: And the management company said, we don't even know why the box is here.

1735
02:14:55,268 --> 02:15:00,632
[SPEAKER_21]: So these companies are going around, and I'm not gonna pinpoint any company, and they're throwing them on private lots.

1736
02:15:01,472 --> 02:15:02,992
[SPEAKER_21]: that's just leaving them there.

1737
02:15:03,313 --> 02:15:07,554
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we need an ordinance, Mr. President, that addresses these boxes.

1738
02:15:07,834 --> 02:15:18,457
[SPEAKER_21]: They should have a contact number on the side of the box, a person's name, a phone number, and there should be some type of permitting process if you want to put one of these large metal boxes on your property.

1739
02:15:18,817 --> 02:15:22,258
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we need to send that to a subcommittee, Mr. President.

1740
02:15:22,278 --> 02:15:22,738
[SPEAKER_21]: You are correct.

1741
02:15:22,778 --> 02:15:23,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure which one, but.

1742
02:15:24,279 --> 02:15:27,500
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would go to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

1743
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:29,060
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you would like to refer that there.

1744
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,741
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to refer that there, Mr. President.

1745
02:15:31,522 --> 02:15:35,343
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by President Caraviello, all those in favor?

1746
02:15:36,323 --> 02:15:37,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1747
02:15:38,584 --> 02:15:51,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by President Caraviello and Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its consolences and have a moment of silence to the family of Anna Consolino on her recent passing after a long illness.

1748
02:15:52,028 --> 02:15:55,629
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're from West Medford, anyone who knows Anna Consolino,

1749
02:15:56,370 --> 02:16:03,280
[SPEAKER_15]: She was a fixture in that square for many, many years, and she passed away last week after a lengthy illness.

1750
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:03,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1751
02:16:04,782 --> 02:16:09,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, just if I could, I grew up with the family in West Method.

1752
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:14,501
[SPEAKER_21]: And the Consolino's name is synonymous with West Medford Square.

1753
02:16:15,482 --> 02:16:20,983
[SPEAKER_21]: The ARCO service station was in business under Dick Consolino for 61 years.

1754
02:16:22,164 --> 02:16:24,725
[SPEAKER_21]: And that service station was a landmark.

1755
02:16:25,105 --> 02:16:32,187
[SPEAKER_21]: And every time I drive by and see a bank there, I just, I don't even recognize the area anymore, Mr. President.

1756
02:16:32,547 --> 02:16:35,008
[SPEAKER_21]: But Anna Consolino will solely be missed.

1757
02:16:35,682 --> 02:16:45,026
[SPEAKER_21]: and she was a terrific mother and grandmother and a loving wife and a tremendous business person for a lot of people in West Medford.

1758
02:16:45,246 --> 02:16:50,588
[SPEAKER_21]: When you brought your car down there and you didn't have the funds to pay, Mr. President, the Consolinos would say, don't worry about it.

1759
02:16:50,848 --> 02:16:52,509
[SPEAKER_21]: When you have the money, give it to us.

1760
02:16:52,969 --> 02:16:54,930
[SPEAKER_21]: And that just doesn't happen in this day and age anymore.

1761
02:16:55,210 --> 02:16:59,892
[SPEAKER_15]: I, being a long time customer, my dad was a customer of the Consolinos and good people, good family.

1762
02:17:11,544 --> 02:17:21,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

1763
02:17:21,849 --> 02:17:27,792
[SPEAKER_15]: 17092, communications to the Medford City Council from the registrar of voters and the chief election office.

1764
02:17:29,253 --> 02:17:37,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it ordered that the Medford City Council hereby fix following dates and hours for the 2017 city preliminary and election

02:20:18,194 --> 02:20:20,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by council for approval.

1793
02:20:22,936 --> 02:20:35,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, if we could, I believe last year this council made a recommendation that the poll workers that are so diligent and do a great job in the city elections be fed because they're spending 13 hours

1794
02:20:37,007 --> 02:20:42,569
[SPEAKER_21]: And in some locations, because of the lack of personnel, it's tough for people to get out.

1795
02:20:43,069 --> 02:20:55,833
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would ask, once again, if the city clerk would be so kind to make sure the poll workers get some type of bagged lunch or pizza or something, Mr. President, to show our appreciation for the effort that they put in.

1796
02:20:55,853 --> 02:20:57,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

1797
02:20:57,194 --> 02:20:58,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1798
02:20:58,734 --> 02:20:59,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1799
02:21:00,055 --> 02:21:00,735
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion.

1800
02:21:01,455 --> 02:21:02,035
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1801
02:21:02,055 --> 02:21:02,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1802
02:21:03,016 --> 02:21:03,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1803
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:13,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scarpelli.

1804
02:21:13,165 --> 02:21:14,686
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-093 offered by President Caraviello.

1805
02:21:14,706 --> 02:21:30,476
[SPEAKER_15]: It resolved that the Medford City Council announced that the mayor will be re-commemorating the plaques at War Memorial Park and the city will be looking for any additional names to be added to the list there.

1806
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:32,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad that the mayor took this up pretty quickly.

1807
02:21:32,457 --> 02:21:34,118
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something we asked for a couple of weeks ago.

1808
02:21:35,007 --> 02:21:46,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anyone knows of any names that need to be added, please inform the Veterans Services or the Mayor's Office as soon as possible so we can get the names on the plaque.

1809
02:21:48,453 --> 02:21:53,175
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, Councilor Scarpelli.

1810
02:21:53,675 --> 02:21:57,217
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can real quick, is there a timeline when we'd like to have that on?

1811
02:21:57,237 --> 02:21:57,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's been.

1812
02:21:58,538 --> 02:22:01,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I think our original paper said we would

1813
02:22:01,946 --> 02:22:06,410
[SPEAKER_15]: like to maybe get them done by maybe Memorial Day or at the least by Veterans Day.

1814
02:22:06,430 --> 02:22:08,572
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we can get that in.

1815
02:22:08,652 --> 02:22:11,074
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's about 10-ish names there at the moment.

1816
02:22:11,635 --> 02:22:14,697
[SPEAKER_15]: So if anybody else knows of any names, please get them in.

1817
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:18,681
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1818
02:22:19,842 --> 02:22:20,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

1819
02:22:21,423 --> 02:22:23,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1820
02:22:24,406 --> 02:22:26,848
[SPEAKER_21]: You called on me and then you went to Scarpelli, but that's all right.

1821
02:22:34,529 --> 02:22:44,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I think I'm not sure if it was you or one of the other councils offered a resolution to have many of the plaques on our veteran memorials to be refurbished.

1822
02:22:44,835 --> 02:22:45,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1823
02:22:45,135 --> 02:22:48,377
[SPEAKER_21]: If we got any response regarding the plaques, we have not.

1824
02:22:49,678 --> 02:22:52,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I have spoken to the veteran service office and I think that's a funding issue.

1825
02:22:53,321 --> 02:22:55,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the plaques are old and 10 and, um,

1826
02:22:58,045 --> 02:23:00,127
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have talked to some people who do it there.

1827
02:23:00,167 --> 02:23:05,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure if they can even be redone again because of the age and the wear of them.

1828
02:23:06,931 --> 02:23:07,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1829
02:23:07,151 --> 02:23:09,113
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we can't refurbish them, we have to replace them.

1830
02:23:09,193 --> 02:23:13,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I would hope that the mayor would appropriate some funds to get that done.

1831
02:23:14,617 --> 02:23:20,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I would ask that that be part of your paper also, Mr. President, that we get an update on the refurbishment.

1832
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:21,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clark, if we could add that on to the paper.

1833
02:23:21,842 --> 02:23:22,202
[SPEAKER_15]: The plaques.

1834
02:23:22,242 --> 02:23:26,445
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could look at adding some additional funds to get some of the older plaques.

1835
02:23:26,945 --> 02:23:31,206
[SPEAKER_15]: while the city cleaned and replaced.

1836
02:23:36,727 --> 02:23:43,028
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1837
02:23:43,048 --> 02:23:52,429
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-0-9-1, petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford Mass, to address the council on not erasing Medford's history.

1838
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:54,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1839
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:55,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1840
02:23:56,463 --> 02:24:02,027
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm in a great mood tonight because I played pickleball, and I never played pickleball before, and it was a lot of fun.

1841
02:24:02,707 --> 02:24:03,328
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.

1842
02:24:03,868 --> 02:24:09,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be adversarial, but educational.

1843
02:24:10,152 --> 02:24:12,214
[SPEAKER_01]: After attending the Mayor's State of the City Address,

1844
02:24:12,828 --> 02:24:24,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm once again compelled by conscience to challenge Mea Burke's political view, which this council signed off on, as it is inaccurate and harmful, as it denies our legacy in reality.

1845
02:24:24,712 --> 02:24:35,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford was discovered as a, discovered in quotes, as a result of the Sprague brothers finding the existing footpaths of the Indian inhabitants from Salem to Charlestown in 1629.

1846
02:24:37,820 --> 02:24:45,485
[SPEAKER_01]: They crossed the Saugus Plains into Malden, and then to the edge of the Middlesex Fells, all the way to what would become Medford Square.

1847
02:24:46,106 --> 02:24:57,914
[SPEAKER_01]: The square is a result of the continued use of this area as it was the narrowest point in the river at low tide for crossing over, as originally used by the Indian population.

1848
02:24:58,814 --> 02:25:07,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on the other side was another Indian footpath up to present day Winter Hill, and from there the Sprague brothers continued down to Charlestown.

1849
02:25:08,745 --> 02:25:22,594
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1630, the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Matthew Craddock, London merchant and dedicated Puritan, formed his own peculiar plantation, which became our city today.

1850
02:25:24,015 --> 02:25:31,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It was seen as peculiar because unlike Cambridge, it was not set up as a town, but a private plantation.

1851
02:25:32,021 --> 02:25:36,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The original people whose land started to be taken away from them

1852
02:25:37,453 --> 02:25:40,295
[SPEAKER_01]: by these English intruders were known as the Pawtuckets.

1853
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:43,338
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the name of the native tribe, the Pawtuckets.

1854
02:25:44,239 --> 02:25:47,301
[SPEAKER_01]: A man named Sagamore John was chief of the Pawtuckets.

1855
02:25:47,942 --> 02:25:51,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Sagamore John and his people died of smallpox in 1633.

1856
02:25:52,686 --> 02:25:59,552
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1644, the Indians remaining in Massachusetts put themselves under the English government.

1857
02:26:01,053 --> 02:26:05,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Once there had been about 20,000 Indians within 50 miles of Plymouth alone.

1858
02:26:06,310 --> 02:26:08,951
[SPEAKER_01]: By the close of the century, there were only about 4,000.

1859
02:26:10,671 --> 02:26:13,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that by the 18th century, not all residents were free.

1860
02:26:15,052 --> 02:26:15,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in Medford.

1861
02:26:16,752 --> 02:26:23,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Blacks, Indians, and forgive me for using the term mulattoes, that is what is written in the history book that I got this from.

1862
02:26:23,694 --> 02:26:28,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Medford on the Mystic, and it was by Carl Seberg, who lived in West Medford on Madison Street.

1863
02:26:28,575 --> 02:26:30,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew him because I took care of his aunt.

1864
02:26:30,935 --> 02:26:32,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing man.

1865
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:37,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what was I?

1866
02:26:38,382 --> 02:26:39,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1867
02:26:39,923 --> 02:26:42,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Servants, so these servants were held in slavery.

1868
02:26:42,805 --> 02:26:51,912
[SPEAKER_01]: In a census of Negro slaves in Massachusetts in 1755, there were 34 slaves over the age of 16 living in Medford.

1869
02:26:51,932 --> 02:26:55,055
[SPEAKER_01]: 27 were men and seven were women.

1870
02:26:55,875 --> 02:27:00,939
[SPEAKER_01]: By 1764, the slave population in Medford had increased to 49.

1871
02:27:05,058 --> 02:27:09,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case you were wondering if northern slavery was any better than southern slavery, think again.

1872
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:30,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Selectman in 1734 voted, quote, all Negro, Indian, and mulatto servants that are found abroad without leave and not on their master's business shall be taken up and whipped to 10 stripes on their naked body by any freeholder of the town and be carried to that respective master's.

1873
02:27:31,444 --> 02:27:42,391
[SPEAKER_01]: and said masters shall be obligated to pay the sum of 2S6D in money to said person that shall do so."

1874
02:27:42,731 --> 02:27:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Unquote.

1875
02:27:43,471 --> 02:27:51,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Slavery existed in Medford until 1787, when in the case of the Commonwealth versus Jenison, this institution was finally outlawed.

1876
02:27:52,217 --> 02:27:58,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Our nation was not founded on the, quote, fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection under law, unquote.

1877
02:27:58,801 --> 02:28:00,622
[SPEAKER_01]: The Declaration of Independence, paragraph 2,

1878
02:28:01,428 --> 02:28:13,765
[SPEAKER_01]: When Thomas Jefferson wrote, quote, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, he currently owned 175 black slaves, including five of his own children, by Sally Hemings.
