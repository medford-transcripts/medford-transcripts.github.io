[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

17
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,303
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get a hard copy of that, and we usually do.

18
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have a chance to look through that at all.

19
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:07,008
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any questions, can I ask them at the next meeting?

20
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:09,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to table it?

21
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,292
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sure they need to be approved to be paid, right?

22
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:13,533
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

23
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:14,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

24
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:18,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need approval tonight to pay those?

25
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:19,157
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

26
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:20,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the, no.

27
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,326
[SPEAKER_11]: They've already been on the wall.

28
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,189
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so can we table that so we can just look at them before we?

29
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to table by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Giro.

[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

34
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:32,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

35
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:34,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of secretary.

36
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,040
[SPEAKER_11]: None?

37
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,200
[SPEAKER_11]: None.

38
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:38,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of committee.

39
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:39,706
[SPEAKER_11]: None?

40
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:43,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Community participation, Mayor Burke.

41
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:43,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

42
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,440
[SPEAKER_10]: DiBenedetto.

43
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:45,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

44
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:57,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping if there's anybody in the community that needs to speak first, but I've received a few phone calls and emails about a few issues and I'd like to bring them up under this community participation section.

45
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:04,439
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are issues that the school committee needs to deliberate on and it's not of emergency nature, it needs to be on the agenda.

46
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:14,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I could at least bring up the ideas that were brought forward to me so we can put them on the agenda for next week and deliberate at that time, so at least they're brought forward.

47
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:20,871
[SPEAKER_10]: First was a concern about the gymnastic floor, and I'm requesting an update on that.

48
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:33,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that there was some kind of presentation at the city council meeting last week, and that there was a work order requested for either the floor or some equipment, and that

49
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:40,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of what was said at that meeting, the gymnastic room has been closed.

50
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're not using it as a school.

51
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And community schools aren't using it.

52
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:51,344
[SPEAKER_10]: So the little cute little three-year-olds I see when I go to Zuma on Saturday mornings aren't there and able to use it.

53
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just wondering if an inspection has been completed.

54
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,185
[SPEAKER_10]: It's scheduled for this week.

55
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:56,926
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

56
00:10:57,246 --> 00:11:00,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And so could we get a follow-up at our next meeting of where we are?

57
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:07,204
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe even an email if that's able to open prior to our next meeting, that would be great.

58
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:11,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to add that to the next agenda.

59
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:28,870
[SPEAKER_10]: The other item is, I got a call about using drain fields for our middle school children for softball, and that the field is gonna be permitted to the middle school

60
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And there might be some conflict with the youth baseball program.

61
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:40,776
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody has some information on that, is our middle school?

62
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Hormel committee.

63
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It's with the Hormel Commission, the permitting of that field.

64
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:48,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, but they said that it was- And it's girls softball.

65
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:51,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a middle school softball program.

66
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:54,546
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually girls youth soccer 12-year-old program.

67
00:11:55,346 --> 00:12:16,313
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's girls youth softball using it, because the information I got today that it was the middle school club or middle school was using it for a youth softball team in that they were permitted the use of it after the youth little league already got permitted for that.

68
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:32,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So if maybe we could get a report from either the middle school teachers or the Hormel commissioner, or whoever, if Bobby Maloney is the person who takes care of the Hormel, or whoever takes care of scheduling it.

69
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:33,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Hormel commission.

70
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:34,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

71
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Hormel commission.

72
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,555
[SPEAKER_10]: If they could report to us at our next meeting and confirm that it's not through the schools, it's through.

73
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:46,754
[SPEAKER_10]: The youth programs, just to clarify because I was informed today that it was under

74
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,489
[SPEAKER_10]: the middle school program.

75
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:56,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I was advised last week it was the girls youth soccer program, I'm sorry, softball program that petitioned.

76
00:12:56,513 --> 00:13:07,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So one field is girls youth, one field is the little league, and there's also time allotted for t-ball and what's the little t-ball, farm league.

77
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:14,007
[SPEAKER_10]: So could we have the commission come forward and just assure us that or send us a letter saying that

78
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,462
[SPEAKER_10]: It has nothing to do with the school district pulling permits for that field.

79
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:24,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my second request for the item for the agenda for next week.

80
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:32,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just was wondering if there were any issues with the traffic due to the bridge closing in Somerville.

81
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:40,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Any updates on how that affected our Columbus school parents and our children on buses getting to and from school?

82
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:43,673
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could have the- We can't take action right now,

83
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:46,169
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to write your items to get on the agenda.

84
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,991
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't take any action right now.

85
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,391
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is, yeah.

86
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:53,354
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an item, someone wanted to move on to suspension?

87
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:53,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

88
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:56,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for suspension?

89
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:56,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

94
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:00,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

95
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:01,920
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

96
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is granted.

97
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,962
[SPEAKER_11]: And you wanted to take paper.

98
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,164
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a paper on the suspension.

99
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:11,326
[SPEAKER_11]: It just came up, I believe, in the past day.

100
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:17,754
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for, where is it?

101
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:25,999
[SPEAKER_11]: An anonymous donation has been offered to Medford High School's ethics team in the amount of $300.

102
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm requesting that the school committee accept this anonymous donation of $300 on behalf of the team.

103
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:37,986
[SPEAKER_11]: The donor's intent is for the money to be used to transport students on the team to and from the airport.

104
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:38,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:38,907

00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:47,369
[SPEAKER_19]: just going to say, so I'm just, I am requesting approval for this gift from the parent.

107
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:49,670

[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore, she is not at this meeting tonight and she's handling the items for her family.

139
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:51,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:52,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Caldwell.

00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:53,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm speaking on behalf of Dr. Vincent.

143
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,260

[SPEAKER_05]: So we're pleased to announce that Albert, who is in the class of 2020, has been selected as a Massachusetts delegate to the International Science and Engineering Fair.

146
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,422

148
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,859

149
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,322

150
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:37,868

[SPEAKER_05]: The previous delegates were Erica Budina, who was in the class of 2014, I'm sure you all remember, and Ann Lee in the class of 2017.

152
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:54,432
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of these students worked in conjunction with Tufts University to develop or refine their research.

153
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,715
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate our partnership with Tufts University.

154
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:04,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Albert first attended the Brooks Elementary School, then the McGlynn Middle School prior to attending Medford High School.

155
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to Albert.

156
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:12,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Andrews Middle School students did a cleanup this week.

157
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:18,630
[SPEAKER_05]: On the first day of spring, the Andrews Middle School students decided to begin cleaning around school's green space.

158
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Over 500 students cleaned around the Mystic River walking path and other areas surrounding the school.

159
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:32,491
[SPEAKER_05]: The students did a great job of raking, picking up trash, and clearing twigs and branches.

160
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:42,213
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate the assistance of Mike Nestor of the Medford DPW for providing supplies for the cleanup and carting away the debris.

161
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:43,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks, Mike Nestor.

162
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:55,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Medford Family Network's major fundraiser of the year, 10,000 Lights, will be held here at City Hall on Saturday, April 6th at 7 p.m.

163
00:17:56,865 --> 00:18:00,987
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an incredible event for all to attend, so I encourage you to come.

164
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:09,710
[SPEAKER_05]: This is fabulous, to support the many programs and projects offered to our families by Marie Cassidy of our Medford Family Network.

165
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So please come this Saturday.

166
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:14,592
[SPEAKER_05]: The middle school lottery update.

167
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:19,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week we had the opportunity to meet with the fifth grade parents of all the elementary schools

168
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:27,564
[SPEAKER_05]: to address their concerns about the middle school lottery, and we appreciate that parents took the time to meet with the team here.

169
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:34,890
[SPEAKER_05]: We had approximately 110 5th grade parents combined at all of our elementary schools.

170
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:43,037
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel that it alleviated a lot of the stress that parents had and were feeling, and we hopefully addressed their concerns.

171
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,993
[SPEAKER_05]: The lottery itself will be handled by an independent company.

172
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:54,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously we will not be hosting open houses, but rather welcome orientations at the middle school in May.

173
00:18:55,977 --> 00:19:01,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to announce again important dates that parents want to be aware of regarding the lottery process.

174
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:12,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So tomorrow, Tuesday, April 2nd, sibling opt-in forms will be sent home with the fifth grade students, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working on that.

175
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:18,835
[SPEAKER_05]: On Tuesday, April 9th, the sibling opt-in forms are due back.

176
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:25,659
[SPEAKER_05]: On April 19th, we have vacation week from the 15th to the 19th.

177
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:32,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday, April 23rd, each fifth grade student will receive a lottery number.

178
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:42,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And on Tuesday, April 30th, between 3 and 4 p.m., the lottery will take place in the Medford High School Library.

179
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So parents and families are welcome to attend.

180
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:49,238
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want to bring their children, they may also bring their children.

181
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,921
[SPEAKER_05]: The orientation dates for the middle schools will be held on the following dates.

182
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is following our lottery.

183
00:19:56,943 --> 00:19:59,484
[SPEAKER_05]: The McGlynn and the Andrews will then have orientation.

184
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:12,966
[SPEAKER_05]: On Wednesday, May 8th, will be the Andrews Middle School orientation, and on Tuesday, May 14th, the McGlynn will have their orientation as well.

185
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:17,808
[SPEAKER_05]: The time for both schools will be 6 to 8 p.m.

186
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:25,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would like to extend our thanks to everyone who was included in helping out with the lottery.

187
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:28,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Director of Instruction, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli,

188
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:43,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Director of EL Paul Texera, Director of Pupil Services Kathy Madaglio, and all of our elementary principals, we have Suzanne Galuzzi at the Brooks School, Dr. Kathleen Kaye at the Columbus School, Ms.

189
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:51,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Diane Garino at the McGlynn, and Mr. Kirk Johnson at the Roberts Elementary School, along with Emily Lazaro and Lisa Evangelista.

190
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:52,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

191
00:20:54,437 --> 00:21:10,687
[SPEAKER_05]: This Thursday, April 4th, the Medford Vocational Technical High School will host its CTE Grade 9 Showcase, which will enable students to discuss options for next year with Medford High School administrators and make selections for courses for next year.

192
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Last Thursday, family nights were held at both the McGlynn and the Columbus elementary schools.

193
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:22,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Our math coaches, Grace Basile, attended the McGlynn, and Elio Leary attended the Columbus night.

194
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:24,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really a fun-filled night.

195
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I attended both events.

196
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:31,389
[SPEAKER_05]: There were parents, teachers, kids playing games together at the schools.

197
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:36,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of math, the Pathways to Mathematics presentation has been planned for Thursday.

198
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:45,014
[SPEAKER_05]: April 11th for 6th grade parents from 630 to 730 in room B310 at Medford High School.

199
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:50,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Our math director, Faiza Khan, will discuss shifts in middle school mathematics education,

200
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:58,541
[SPEAKER_05]: the impact of mathematics curriculum on high school decisions, and the opportunities for middle and high school mathematics courses.

201
00:21:59,222 --> 00:22:02,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We encourage all 6th grade parents to attend.

202
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:11,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And please don't forget, Medford's Credit for Life Financial Literacy Fair will be held in the MHS and BU

203
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:15,886
[SPEAKER_05]: DHS junior class on Friday, April 5th.

204
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is something that I think everyone should attend.

205
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:26,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some of you went last year, but it is something to watch the students know they have so much money to spend.

206
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:34,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that Christine Patterson, everybody goes to her to see if they have enough money or do they have to refinance.

207
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,380
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to think about whether they can live in an apartment, a condo, have a car, take a bus to work.

208
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:44,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes when that doesn't work, they have to go back and figure out what to do.

209
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they have to live with mom and dad or something.

210
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's something for people to attend.

211
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:54,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Lisa was telling me earlier today, we have 65 volunteers coming.

212
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:56,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So without those people, we wouldn't be able to do this.

213
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:58,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So come one, come all this Friday.

214
00:22:59,109 --> 00:22:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

215
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:01,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

216
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:02,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

217
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:09,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 2, report, Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility Update.

218
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:12,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Richard Trotter and Mr. Michael Skorka.

219
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:15,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

220
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:16,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

221
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Trotter, director of the CCSR.

222
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,822
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor to be here.

223
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:25,065
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with a great deal of pride that I present this report.

224
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,947
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, you received a copy.

225
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:28,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 70 pages long.

226
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:31,764
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interest of time, I'm only going to read the first 35 pages.

227
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:38,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it's great to be here.

228
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:48,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank the school committee and the mayor because of your support.

229
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:55,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Without your support in terms of financial and otherwise, we wouldn't have the great program that we have.

230
00:23:56,966 --> 00:24:03,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Having Michael Skorka work with us on this project and spare the high school

231
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:08,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the schedule that allows that to happen makes a great big difference.

232
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really want to thank you for supporting us.

233
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:17,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to mention that we are supported by several of the organizations around us.

234
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Tufts always helps out a great deal.

235
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:26,108
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kiwanis and the Rotary, whenever we have some fundraising going on or trying to do an activity, they step up and help us.

236
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:29,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were there last week, and they gave us a donation.

237
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the Kiwanis.

238
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:33,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really thankful for the support in the community.

239
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:44,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank Superintendent Vincent, Associate Superintendent Caldwell, and Assistant Superintendent Patterson for their support, because central office is critical.

240
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:52,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And also all the principals, because as we will talk about, we are now in every school, and the principal's support is really important.

241
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to thank them too.

242
00:24:55,709 --> 00:25:02,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first point I want to make is that we now have advisors in every school building this year, first time.

243
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:06,764
[SPEAKER_01]: So every school has a leadership program operating.

244
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:11,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say much about that because Michael's going to talk about that, but he's the key person in that operation.

245
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:19,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on his experience and his knowledge and also his spirit, he's the right person to run that program.

246
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:25,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the highlights, just quickly, we have many grants that we distribute.

247
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:31,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about all of them, but one of them I want to point out was done by Andrew Milam, a teacher at the high school.

248
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:40,251
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a mini grant, and what he did was he arranged with the Arlington Theater to host parents and students from the AP history class.

249
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:42,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, one grandparent showed up.

250
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And they watched the movie Green Book.

251
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the movie, they had a discussion about racism.

252
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:50,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the things that Andrew did.

253
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also is going to do another one coming up.

254
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:58,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's on Solo, the one, the climber, the rock climber.

255
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:01,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to bring in different aspects about

256
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:04,314
[SPEAKER_01]: society, and he's done a great job.

257
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:05,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's done, this is his second year doing that.

258
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:08,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an idea of what a main grant is like.

259
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:13,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So teachers can use funds from our budget to do projects inside the classroom.

260
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:16,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a different aspect than just the advisors.

261
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:22,227
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had a walk for veterans when the mayor helped sponsor with us, and we raised $3,000.

262
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:25,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go to local veterans services.

263
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're very happy with the people who supported us.

264
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:31,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a good, decent turnout.

265
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,802
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a memorial day, and it's the first time.

266
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we hope to do it next year, too.

267
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's coming up.

268
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:46,091
[SPEAKER_01]: We also took some of the Crystal Campbell funds and set up a SAFE project at the high school, middle school.

269
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:49,833
[SPEAKER_01]: SAFE stands for Students Advocating for the Earth.

270
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:56,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think it's very important that the environment is a key focus of education and above politics.

271
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to stimulate

272
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:04,556
[SPEAKER_01]: students and parents and people in the community to think about the environment, to care about the environment.

273
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,117
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a couple guest speakers.

274
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:15,801
[SPEAKER_01]: We had David Flood at the Andrews, who's a speaker about students being empathetic, also having respect and compassion for others.

275
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big success.

276
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:23,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Tucci coordinated at the McGlynn, and it was the second year of doing that, and that was well received.

277
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:26,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up, we have Dr. Chopra.

278
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:31,873
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the McGlynn again with Mr. Tucci for the students and the parents at night.

279
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Chopra is not Deepak Chopra.

280
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:37,894
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his brother, who's a surgeon at Harvard.

281
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:42,755
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the director of surgery at Harvard Medical School.

282
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:43,855
[SPEAKER_01]: But he has written 10 books.

283
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:46,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's an expert on a number of things.

284
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:49,516
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's going to talk about leadership with the students and the parents.

285
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:52,656
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.30 on May 29.

286
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:57,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So May 29th is the date.

287
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:05,007
[SPEAKER_01]: During the day it will be at 9.30 if you're around, but at night it will be 6.30 at the McGlynn.

288
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:07,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open to anyone who would like to go.

289
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:13,229
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I instituted an internship at Tufts University.

290
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:14,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We have nine interns.

291
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We just started to do that now, so we're in the early stages.

292
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,332
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll be helping with student projects.

293
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,993
[SPEAKER_01]: They're helping do things like research projects.

294
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:29,759
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the students write a report on self-esteem and how important self-esteem is.

295
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,943
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I would like to forward you some of the research reports at a future date, because we've done like three or four of them now.

296
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:41,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're short and brief, and they're very understandable for lay people, and not the human people.

297
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:44,407
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not psychologists, so it would be easy to read.

298
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:53,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they're developing things like databases and so forth, keeping a database of resources that

299
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,010
[SPEAKER_01]: apply to what we do.

300
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:00,252
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, compassion, empathy, project-based learning, community service.

301
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:08,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last point, we applied to be part of the Mass.

302
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:14,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Association of Superintendents Executive Institute in July, and we were selected.

303
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to be at that institute, you'll see us there.

304
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CCSI will have a presence.

305
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:25,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite sure what we're doing yet, but I think we're doing either a workshop or a table.

306
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,863
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will be there in the summer.

307
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look forward to seeing you there.

308
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it for my report.

309
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:35,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I promised Diana I would be brief.

310
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to introduce Michael.

311
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:50,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And Michael, as you know Michael, he will be talking more about the different projects each building is doing and the building-based program, which

312
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:59,120
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had to pick one of the essential things that we do, it's the building-based program, because we're creating not just projects, but student leaders as well.

313
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, we'll take questions afterwards.

314
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:05,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further ado, Michael Skorka.

315
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:13,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the applause.

316
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:18,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I will try to keep this brief.

317
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:23,858
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to start off by saying to thank you to all of you for being so supportive of the program.

318
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:37,089
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a journey that has been one of the best journeys of my career, and it's so wonderful to work besides these children who are really awe-inspiring and just really make the world a better place.

319
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, if you give them

320
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,011
[SPEAKER_12]: the space to be creative.

321
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:46,093
[SPEAKER_12]: They not only meet your expectations, they significantly exceed them, and I always say that, and that proves true every single year.

322
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:51,876
[SPEAKER_12]: This year we have approximately 400 students participating in the program district-wide.

323
00:30:52,816 --> 00:31:00,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Since our last presentation, Curtis Tufts has joined the CCSR, and Mary Montero is the advisor at that school.

324
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,662
[SPEAKER_12]: We meet every single month to collaborate with one another, to bounce ideas off of one another,

325
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:16,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Some have just started their program this year, where others are already one year in the program, so it really is helpful to have that time to collaborate with one another, which has been great.

326
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:23,937
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the project fair season, so I want to give you the date of the high school project fair, where I hope you can come.

327
00:31:24,438 --> 00:31:25,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's April 25th.

328
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,842
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a Thursday from 2.30 to 4 at the high school.

329
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:35,513
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the other schools in the district are also going to have project fairs this year.

330
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:44,963
[SPEAKER_12]: They are working on those dates, so I don't have all of those to give to you right now, but I will email you by next week with all of the dates for the project fairs for the other schools.

331
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,885
[SPEAKER_12]: That includes the Curtis Tufts as well.

332
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,227
[SPEAKER_12]: They're very excited.

333
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:58,351
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said, I also want to focus on a couple highlights over the past couple of months that the CCSR has had.

334
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:03,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of you were able to attend the Mustang Way Assembly that we put on.

335
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:06,414
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a collaboration between the high school and the middle school.

336
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:16,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Nick Tucci and I sat down, and we thought it would be a great idea to get the high school over to the middle schools, and we created this assembly called the Mustang Way, which promoted respect and kindness and acceptance.

337
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,060
[SPEAKER_12]: a ton of speeches, and I know some of you attended.

338
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,702
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really well received by the faculty, students, and staff at both middle schools.

339
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:27,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's something we hope to continue for next year.

340
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,247
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to say thank you to everyone who attended.

341
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:32,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I know Ms.

342
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:35,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Massone and your daughter spoke at the Andrews.

343
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:36,550
[SPEAKER_12]: She was fabulous.

344
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And she was amazing.

345
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:39,772
[SPEAKER_12]: She was so wonderful.

346
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:42,113
[SPEAKER_12]: She's such a bright light, so we're very lucky to have her.

347
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:58,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, and I'm going to read this part because I don't want to get anything incorrect, but last Monday, CCSR and students advocates for Earth members Evian Abshire, Audrey Sol, Rachel Klein, and Katie Stefani won a grant from Captain Planet Foundation.

348
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:05,769
[SPEAKER_12]: This foundation's mission is to empower youth to become local and global environmental changemakers.

349
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:07,770
[SPEAKER_12]: These students were awarded a $2,500 grant

350
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:16,925
[SPEAKER_12]: to continue with their CCSR project of implementing composting bins and pickups in Medford High School cafeterias.

351
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,918
[SPEAKER_12]: We just found this out on Monday, so we'll have more information when that comes.

352
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they have to fill out some paperwork before we can move forward.

353
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:34,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, and I know all of you know this, but I'd like to give another shout out to Rubia Fernandez.

354
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:35,987
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a student leader.

355
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:41,292
[SPEAKER_12]: She has been working with the mayor's office, too, for the plastic bag ordinance, and she made that happen.

356
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:45,176
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would also like to give her a round of applause for all the work that she has done.

357
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:53,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And last but certainly not least, I'd like to give a big shout out to Jasper Hsu.

358
00:33:53,809 --> 00:34:01,852
[SPEAKER_12]: The booklet that you see in front of you, Jasper is sort of, he calls himself my secretary.

359
00:34:02,812 --> 00:34:12,736
[SPEAKER_12]: So he really has been such an integral part of making that booklet happen and sort of being a second set of eyes and just making all of the necessary tweaks and helping me put it together.

360
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:15,357
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really am just indebted to Jasper.

361
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:20,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all I have.

362
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:21,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I told you I'd keep it brief.

363
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:22,250
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to pass.

364
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,932
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to listen to two student presentations that are brief, and then we'll move on.

365
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:29,595
[SPEAKER_12]: So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Jenny Lu and Joseph Schmidt.

366
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:30,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

367
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:38,921
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, everyone.

368
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:39,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

369
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,063
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for having us here.

370
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:42,704
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm Jenny Lu.

371
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:43,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm Joe Schmidt.

372
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:46,727
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're seniors from the Medford High CCSR.

373
00:34:47,278 --> 00:34:50,621
[SPEAKER_22]: And our project this year is called the Medford Slavery Memorial.

374
00:34:51,302 --> 00:35:01,831
[SPEAKER_22]: And it is in collaboration with the Brooks branch of the CCSR with two fourth graders, Jasmine Hagborn and Liam Brady, as well as Michael Coates, who is the advisor for the Brooks CCSR.

375
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:11,320
[SPEAKER_22]: And our project focuses on erecting a memorial for the 50 enslaved people buried in the Salem Street burial ground without any grave markers.

376
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:19,151
[SPEAKER_22]: And also we are hosting an event to memorialize them and also as a social gathering for Medford.

377
00:35:20,132 --> 00:35:26,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so this event will take place on June 8th, which is a Saturday, at 10.30am.

378
00:35:27,218 --> 00:35:32,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you guys could share that around, you know, come yourselves, come one, come all, tell your family.

379
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:36,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there will be unveiling a monument.

380
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:44,566
[SPEAKER_03]: as a memorial for these slaves who have been buried there since the 17th century.

381
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:51,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And with regards to funds for this project, we've raised over $2,000 from a GoFundMe.

382
00:35:56,475 --> 00:36:01,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are waiting to hear back from a Freedom's Way partnership matching grant, which would provide an additional $2,000.

383
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:09,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And with these funds, we will be able to obtain and engrave a monument that would be unveiled at our ceremony on June 8th.

384
00:36:09,964 --> 00:36:10,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

385
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,565
[SPEAKER_11]: What a wonderful thing that you're doing.

386
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:26,411
[SPEAKER_11]: The four came before me to talk about their project, and I was just stunned, first off, to hear that there were no markers for these individuals, enslaved individuals that were buried there, and that you were taking that on.

387
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,033
[SPEAKER_11]: So you, amazing, amazing project.

388
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:30,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so proud of both of you.

389
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:30,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

390
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having us.

391
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:39,248
[SPEAKER_22]: So, and now we'd like to introduce John Antapa.

392
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:40,569
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be talking about his project.

393
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:41,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

394
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

395
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,838
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, it's good to see you all again.

396
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:50,818
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is John Antapa.

397
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:54,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the senior class president of the class of 2019 and a member of the CCSR.

398
00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:03,182
[SPEAKER_20]: I run Project Little Library, which is goal is to bring the love of literature and more reading towards the Heights and North Medford area.

399
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:10,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the CCSR, I have been able to fine tune and work on my social responsibility and leadership skills.

400
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:22,636
[SPEAKER_20]: And by doing so, I can proudly say that Project Little Library is 100% locally business funded from businesses such as Modern Hardware, Fabrizio Wood Products, and the Vogue graphics department.

401
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:29,561
[SPEAKER_20]: And I couldn't have done it without help from the mayor's office and the Bill Cummings and Crystal Campbell Fund.

402
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:31,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

403
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:31,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice job, John.

404
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:41,630
[SPEAKER_11]: John, can you provide the locations of your little libraries up in North Medford for us?

405
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,231
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's one right now and I'm working on many more.

406
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:47,833
[SPEAKER_20]: The one that I'm working on will be on display at the project fair on April 25th.

407
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:52,316
[SPEAKER_20]: The one that we're doing right now will be on Murray Hill Road in the North Medford.

408
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:53,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

409
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:54,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job.

410
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:54,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

411
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats.

412
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say something about the project, about the enslaved people.

413
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:08,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with Jen and the other students trying to come up with a way of raising money.

414
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:13,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really aren't allowed to do GoFundMe through the schools.

415
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of complicated.

416
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:16,961
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jen volunteered.

417
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:17,562
[SPEAKER_01]: She did it.

418
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Her and her parents.

419
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:22,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give them some credit for doing that and raising the money.

420
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:24,125
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was above your estimate, correct?

421
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, much above what you projected.

422
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,667
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we concluded our report.

423
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless there are any questions, we'll say thank you and leave.

424
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you.

425
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,040
[SPEAKER_11]: This is thank you.

426
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:40,001
[SPEAKER_11]: An amazing program and reaching out to the youngsters in the elementaries is fabulous.

427
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there's a meeting.

428
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:42,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you guys heading to the Brooks tomorrow?

429
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:43,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

430
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:44,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

431
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:44,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I might see you there.

432
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:47,823
[SPEAKER_01]: See you later.

433
00:38:49,223 --> 00:38:49,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Mia?

434
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:49,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

435
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:50,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Stone?

436
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:54,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's Mr. Squawford because it's the elementary school.

437
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:55,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

438
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:58,125
[SPEAKER_09]: For the elementary, is this my honor?

439
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:05,878
[SPEAKER_09]: For the elementary schools, can you tell us how many kids are in each of the elementary school programs?

440
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:11,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the McGlynn as well, and even for the high school, because I'm sure your high school numbers have grown.

441
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,704
[SPEAKER_12]: The high school numbers, currently we have about 120 students.

442
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:19,627
[SPEAKER_12]: The Roberts, approximately 30 students.

443
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,230
[SPEAKER_12]: The McGlynn has approximately 25 students.

444
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,172
[SPEAKER_12]: The Andrews has approximately 11 students.

445
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:27,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Who am I missing?

446
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:29,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Brooks.

447
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:32,201
[SPEAKER_12]: The Brooks has approximately 20 students.

448
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:33,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Columbus.

449
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:37,566
[SPEAKER_12]: The Columbus has approximately 20 to 25 students.

450
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And did you do McGlynn Middle or McGlynn Elementary?

451
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:47,170
[SPEAKER_11]: The McGlynn Elementary has 67 students.

452
00:39:47,750 --> 00:40:00,895
[SPEAKER_12]: So actually I know that one thing that the advisors at the McGlynn Elementary are asking for are parent volunteers during the meetings because there are only a couple of adults and they are desperately looking for

453
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:22,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Parent volunteers to come into the meetings and to help them because there's only two of our advisors and so many students So we'd appreciate any help that we could get so the numbers are growing And I I say approximately because sometimes the elementary schools do sessions so sometimes some schools have two sessions some schools has three sessions so the numbers fluctuate depending on the session and

454
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:23,779
[SPEAKER_12]: but that's an approximate number.

455
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:33,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, what I found out this year, doing this for the second year, is that most of the students who signed up for the first session come back for the second session because they like it so much.

456
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:36,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And did you say the Curtis Tufts is starting one or has one currently?

457
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,784
[SPEAKER_12]: It just started this year.

458
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:40,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think she told me she has approximately 10 students.

459
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:41,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's great.

460
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:48,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Cummings Grant that funds this, is that running its course?

461
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,370
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the second year of a three-year grant.

462
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year is the last year of the grant.

463
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:03,592
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about $30,000 a year, which most of it funds stipends for people and many grants and things like that.

464
00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have another year.

465
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:09,014
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there an option to renew with Cummings?

466
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:12,635
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an option for an extension that we're going to apply for, of course.

467
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:16,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also, well, one of my jobs is I'm still looking for money.

468
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:20,497
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did get some from Crystal Campbell, which helps.

469
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:28,667
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perpetual, but it's only an interest on 115,000, so it's not going to be able to run the program, per se.

470
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:32,608
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm looking for other sources.

471
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:34,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I constantly look for other sources.

472
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:42,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm constantly reaching out for publicity and support for our program, because we both believe this should be in every school system.

473
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:42,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

474
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:47,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skorka, do you, I mean, I feel like I see you at a lot of events.

475
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,460
[SPEAKER_09]: What would be the idea?

476
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:54,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be a full-time job to be the director of this program?

477
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:57,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Rich is the director.

478
00:41:58,044 --> 00:41:59,084
[SPEAKER_09]: You're up here, Rich, right?

479
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:03,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the administrator.

480
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:04,286
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the administrator.

481
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:08,808
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the schools, meaning with the kids and you supervise all the coordinators?

482
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is correct.

483
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

484
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,072
[SPEAKER_09]: A year, it would be horrible if we let this go, and a year if there's no funding from Cummings.

485
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:21,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a plan after year three?

486
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:24,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I definitely would come back and ask for a budget.

487
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:25,509
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

488
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:30,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would, whatever would happen, as long as he's here, I would be fine.

489
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:31,151
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

490
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:32,571
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

491
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:33,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

492
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:36,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

493
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:37,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

494
00:42:37,452 --> 00:42:41,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just explain to people how this works for people who are watching from home?

495
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:44,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is it an after school program?

496
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:46,195
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it affect their day at school?

497
00:42:46,640 --> 00:43:08,531
[SPEAKER_10]: how many children, how children are selected, is it to open to all children, you know, regardless of that child's needs, just a little bit more about it, a little bit more basics, so people tuning in tonight that haven't really, are seeing the growth, especially in our elementary schools, get a clearer understanding of what we're offering and what our purpose is.

498
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:15,555
[SPEAKER_01]: The program was designed as an after-school activity, partly because

499
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:21,123
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt it would be difficult to do this program by incorporating it into the curriculum.

500
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:25,004
[SPEAKER_01]: The curriculum, having worked here a long time, is very tight.

501
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:28,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need to put more pressure on teachers and staff.

502
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:31,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So we designed it for an after-school program.

503
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it is open to every student regardless.

504
00:43:35,928 --> 00:43:36,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't turn anyone away.

505
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,470
[SPEAKER_01]: We encourage people, students.

506
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And Michael is a perfect example of that.

507
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:45,272
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 125 students at the high school probably because Michael

508
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:46,969
[SPEAKER_01]: because he does such a great job.

509
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:52,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And his spirit carries through to the students, and he's like, you know, the Pied Piper side of things.

510
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:58,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So having good people like Michael at schools after school is what really works for us.

511
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:08,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's movement to make SEL, social-emotional learning, part of the curriculum, and so that's sort of a tangent to what we do, but we're really an after-school program.

512
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:15,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what they're doing with everybody, and it's during the school year, and Michael can talk about how often they meet,

513
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:17,330
[SPEAKER_01]: and what the meanings are like.

514
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't you do that?

515
00:44:20,112 --> 00:44:21,994
[SPEAKER_12]: So for the high school, we meet twice a month.

516
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:28,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody at the high school who's watching, parents, all they have to do is come chat with me and they can get involved.

517
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:29,300
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't exclude anybody.

518
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:36,085
[SPEAKER_12]: If they have a passion, then we have two advisors at the high school, myself and Sarah Fard.

519
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:40,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So they come to one of us and we sort of work on what their passion is and sort of direct them in the right

520
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:44,212
[SPEAKER_12]: in the right direction and sort of how to make a project happen from that.

521
00:44:44,793 --> 00:45:00,589
[SPEAKER_12]: The middle schools and the elementary schools meet every single week and those, so my recommendation if somebody's looking to get involved or it's a parent watching right now and you want to have your child involved is to talk to the advisor at that school, find out who the advisor is or contact me and I can tell you.

522
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:07,211
[SPEAKER_12]: seek out that advisor, and then all they would have to do is show up after school for the meeting, and then they would automatically be involved.

523
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:12,594
[SPEAKER_12]: So, for example, for a student that didn't get involved in September, it doesn't mean they can't get involved now.

524
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:13,995
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still time to get involved.

525
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:20,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I always say, I get a ton of kids who join after January, because their sports season is over.

526
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,801
[SPEAKER_12]: So they wanted to use that time and sort of do a project, because they have a little bit of downtime.

527
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:25,582
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

528
00:45:25,842 --> 00:45:29,164
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea is that we're trying to teach these kids how to be socially responsible.

529
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:35,849
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I can get them for three months to do a project that's going to make the world a better place, I'll take them for the three months.

530
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:37,270
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a problem at all.

531
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,850
[SPEAKER_12]: So in terms of that, does that answer your question, Erin?

532
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:41,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

533
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:44,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

534
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:44,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

535
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:44,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Grutz.

536
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:50,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to also mention, I read in here, and I'm trying to find what page, but there's a website.

537
00:45:51,213 --> 00:45:55,014
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can log on with your phone or with your tablet or on the computer.

538
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:56,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to mention what the website is?

539
00:45:56,814 --> 00:46:00,575
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe people could tune in, and they could see a little bit about what we're seeing here in this book.

540
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:06,099
[SPEAKER_15]: because you can look at all the projects, and you can click and go into more and more projects.

541
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know what the website is?

542
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we do.

543
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Off the top of my head, do you know what I'm talking about?

544
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:13,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I know it's in here.

545
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:14,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Jasper knows, right?

546
00:46:14,283 --> 00:46:14,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Jasper knows.

547
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:15,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, excellent.

548
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:16,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Jasper.

549
00:46:16,884 --> 00:46:17,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

550
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And then maybe people could tune in.

551
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:24,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, cool.

552
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:29,128
[SPEAKER_21]: So my friend Darwin Doe has been, he's the webmaster for the CCSR.

553
00:46:29,148 --> 00:46:36,475
[SPEAKER_21]: He's been working very hard this year to transition us from kind of a lower end website management to a really high end one.

554
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:37,376
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's really smooth.

555
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:42,060
[SPEAKER_21]: You can find it at www.medfordccsr.org.

556
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:44,763
[SPEAKER_21]: And there we have updates on

557
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:46,852
[SPEAKER_21]: just the projects that are coming in.

558
00:46:46,892 --> 00:46:50,973
[SPEAKER_21]: You can look at all the advisors, find information about that if you're looking to get connected.

559
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:56,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Dive really deep into projects that are happening this year, but also past projects that we have.

560
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Get information on the grants that we have.

561
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:04,438
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can also check out my blog page, which is updated every now and then when I have time.

562
00:47:04,518 --> 00:47:07,299
[SPEAKER_21]: To be honest with you, I'm kind of busy, but I try my best.

563
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,201
[SPEAKER_21]: So go check out that website again, www.medfordccsr.org.

564
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:13,982
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you.

565
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:17,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, thank you Jasper.

566
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:23,566
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, Darren and Jasper, they're our technology people and Darren's done a fantastic job as he mentioned.

567
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:27,147
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find it on the webpage for the school district.

568
00:47:27,207 --> 00:47:28,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the right hand side, it's a tab.

569
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:32,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Just click on that tab, it says the Center for City.

570
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:34,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easier doing Medford CCSR than Medford K-12.

571
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you can do both, right?

572
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:38,492
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot easier.

573
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:40,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good, thank you so much.

574
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:43,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful job both of you and all of the students, fabulous.

575
00:47:44,163 --> 00:47:44,883
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much.

576
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:45,284
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

577
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:46,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

578
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:46,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

579
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

580
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloot, seconded by Ms.

581
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:57,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Kretz.

582
00:47:57,412 --> 00:47:58,152
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

583
00:47:58,612 --> 00:47:58,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

584
00:47:58,893 --> 00:47:59,593
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

585
00:47:59,673 --> 00:48:00,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

586
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:04,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Item three, recognition of SkillsUSA winners.

587
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:04,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

588
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:05,417
[SPEAKER_11]: DeFallin.

589
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:13,773
[SPEAKER_18]: and their advisors come up first, please.

590
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:30,277
[SPEAKER_18]: So recently, members of Medford Vocational Technical High School competed in the district competition, which was in Framingham, Massachusetts.

591
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:36,679
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I'm going to do right now is have the gold winners please come up and introduce themselves with their name, grade, and program.

592
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:40,652
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Daniel Gross.

593
00:48:41,072 --> 00:48:45,394
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sophomore, 10th grade, and I'm in the graphics design department.

594
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:55,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I won gold.

595
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:56,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Adriana Folks.

596
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a sophomore, and I'm in the graphic design shop, and I got a silver medal.

597
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:16,671
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I just want to introduce our two advisors, both graphic design teachers, Lou Spagnola and John Spagnola, or as we call them, Spagnola Squared.

598
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:22,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, thank you very much.

599
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:24,977
[SPEAKER_17]: I am the older of the two.

600
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:30,541
[SPEAKER_17]: There was also Jared Westcott, couldn't be here today, and he's another sophomore.

601
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,062
[SPEAKER_17]: He won gold medal.

602
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Edward Butler, another sophomore.

603
00:49:37,002 --> 00:49:43,770
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually had four sophomores win medals, so we couldn't have been happier for them.

604
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:48,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

605
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations.

606
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:56,479
[SPEAKER_18]: So also, we will be asking, it's two items down, but since they're up here, we're asking for approval for SkillsUSA.

607
00:49:56,499 --> 00:50:00,341
[SPEAKER_18]: So the next level of competition is the state championship, which is in Marlboro.

608
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:07,426
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an overnight trip, so you'll see in your package we are asking for approval for an overnight trip as well as for them to be able to compete.

609
00:50:08,247 --> 00:50:13,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Fundraising has changed a little bit in your, or not fundraising, but the price for the better.

610
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,332
[SPEAKER_18]: In your package that I sent last week,

611
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,942
[SPEAKER_18]: We had estimated that we would raise about $2,500.

612
00:50:19,002 --> 00:50:20,122
[SPEAKER_18]: We actually exceeded that.

613
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:20,743
[SPEAKER_18]: They raised over $3,000.

614
00:50:20,823 --> 00:50:22,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, nice job.

615
00:50:23,044 --> 00:50:29,828
[SPEAKER_18]: So the cost went from us having to come up with about $2,600 down to $300.

616
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:48,333
[SPEAKER_18]: That was really in part to a combination of efforts of Janet Esposito, who's a mother of two of our students at the high school and also works in our school store, along with the graphics team designed the SkillsUSA calendar.

617
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:49,954
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe some of you bought into it.

618
00:50:49,994 --> 00:50:52,995
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's basically for the month of April, different prizes on each day.

619
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Those calendars were $10 each.

620
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:56,436
[SPEAKER_18]: that raised probably close to $3,000.

621
00:50:56,476 --> 00:50:59,178
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was a big fundraiser for this group.

622
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:00,159
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great.

623
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:01,520
[SPEAKER_18]: So I kind of jumped ahead on the items.

624
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,180
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

625
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,380
[SPEAKER_11]: That's OK.

626
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,181
[SPEAKER_11]: But since they were up here.

627
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:07,223
[SPEAKER_11]: So a little tidbit.

628
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:12,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the parent of a SkillsUSA gold medal winner in the nationals.

629
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:13,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

630
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:17,350
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know how exciting this is because I witnessed it with him.

631
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So good job.

632
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:19,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it up.

633
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:19,812
[SPEAKER_11]: All the way.

634
00:51:19,892 --> 00:51:20,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it up.

635
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:25,038
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have awards.

636
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:26,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we give out a couple of awards?

637
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

638
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:34,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Adriana Fulks for winning the SkillsUSA Silver Medal in Graphic Imaging Sublimation.

639
00:51:35,049 --> 00:51:35,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to step up?

640
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:52,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you tell the world what sublimation is?

641
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us, right here, right here.

642
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:57,341
[SPEAKER_11]: What's sublimation?

643
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,684
[SPEAKER_08]: You can stand up.

644
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:07,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's like making t-shirts with a hot press.

645
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:07,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, cool.

646
00:52:08,486 --> 00:52:08,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

647
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,668
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't wear one tonight.

648
00:52:11,688 --> 00:52:13,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no.

649
00:52:13,669 --> 00:52:14,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

650
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:15,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

651
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it up.

652
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:19,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Daniel?

653
00:52:19,812 --> 00:52:20,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Daniel Gross?

654
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:28,813
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Daniel Gross for winning the SkillsUSA Gold Medal in Advertising Design.

655
00:52:30,353 --> 00:52:36,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations, Daniel.

656
00:52:36,596 --> 00:52:48,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have two, Edward Butler for winning the SkillsUSA Bronze Medal in Graphic Imaging Sublimation, and Jared Westcott, SkillsUSA Gold Medal in Graphic Imaging Sublimation.

657
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome job for all of you.

658
00:53:16,053 --> 00:53:20,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And next up, we have recognition of DECA winners by Mr. Fallon as well.

659
00:53:27,522 --> 00:53:33,546
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you'll remember in, I believe it was the first meeting in March, I had these students come in.

660
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:38,730
[SPEAKER_18]: They recently competed in Boston at the, where were you guys?

661
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:41,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Copley, right?

662
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:49,307
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have moved on to the national convention, the national conference, which will be in Orlando, Florida.

663
00:53:50,388 --> 00:53:51,289
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is Hunter.

664
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:57,420
[SPEAKER_18]: David, and Richie, and I'm just going to have them introduce themselves and a little bit about the program.

665
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:03,443
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Richard Warren, and I'm a senior in the business program.

666
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:11,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And with this project, we got it in sophomore year, so I got to see it unfold all the way to senior year.

667
00:54:12,224 --> 00:54:16,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that it's getting gold standard now, my senior year is a good thing to see.

668
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:23,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, now the underclassmen, when they want to recertify this, it will be way easier for them to do it.

669
00:54:23,706 --> 00:54:24,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

670
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

671
00:54:28,427 --> 00:54:28,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

672
00:54:30,248 --> 00:54:34,069
[SPEAKER_23]: We've met you before.

673
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:36,949
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so I'm a senior at the vocational business program.

674
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:40,750
[SPEAKER_23]: Me and Richie also, we've been working on it since our sophomore year.

675
00:54:41,357 --> 00:54:46,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Every day, it was always trying to get new forms done, get everything reset, make everything perfect.

676
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,820
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was a lot of hard work just to get to where we are now.

677
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,160
[SPEAKER_23]: And obviously, we had great success at States.

678
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,542
[SPEAKER_23]: We got to go on stage in front of everyone there and show our award off.

679
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:58,443
[SPEAKER_23]: They're like, hey, we're awesome.

680
00:54:59,003 --> 00:54:59,744
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to nationals.

681
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:00,904
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to keep doing that.

682
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:03,345
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to show everyone else, the whole world, that we're awesome.

683
00:55:03,725 --> 00:55:04,245
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

684
00:55:04,445 --> 00:55:04,845
[SPEAKER_23]: Awesome.

685
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:05,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful job.

686
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:08,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And you continue from the last school committee meeting to now.

687
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:08,607
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

688
00:55:10,203 --> 00:55:10,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

689
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:11,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job.

691
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:12,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

692
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:15,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm David May, and this is my first year, so I'm a sophomore.

693
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:20,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been a really fun project because I get to work with these seniors, and they've been really good people.

694
00:55:20,756 --> 00:55:21,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just been a fun time.

695
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:22,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

696
00:55:22,538 --> 00:55:24,221
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to carry the torch into the future.

697
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:25,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

698
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:25,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

699
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:26,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

700
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,841
[SPEAKER_11]: We have little awards for you as well.

701
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:41,055
[SPEAKER_11]: The Memphis Public Schools is proud to recognize Hunter Tognarelli for winning the DECA, Distributive Education Clubs of America, Gold Certificate in qualifying for the DECA Internationals.

702
00:55:41,836 --> 00:55:42,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on up Hunter.

703
00:55:54,732 --> 00:56:00,456
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going, come on, say a few words.

704
00:56:01,396 --> 00:56:02,137
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

705
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I won something.

706
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:06,639
[SPEAKER_23]: You're on the stage here.

707
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,022
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, and I'm on another stage showing everyone I'm awesome.

708
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:12,843
[SPEAKER_23]: My parents aren't here, so I just want to say thanks to my parents for helping me.

709
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:16,265
[SPEAKER_23]: Because they had to wake me up to get to school every morning.

710
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,307
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I don't wake up in the morning.

711
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:20,548
[SPEAKER_23]: But yeah, so without them, that was cool.

712
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:22,939
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought Mr. Fallon helped me out throughout the way.

713
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:25,441
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought Richie and David helped me with the project.

714
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:29,965
[SPEAKER_23]: And kids that aren't here right now, Anthony, he was helping us a lot with the project as well.

715
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:33,408
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have a lot of people that were helping along the way that I just wanted to recognize.

716
00:56:33,568 --> 00:56:34,589
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you.

717
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:35,470
Great job.

718
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:40,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Richard, would you like to have a moment too?

719
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:42,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Richard Horn.

720
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say thank you to Mrs. Miles, Mrs. Lewin, and everyone in our business program for all the support.

721
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:06,910
Great job.

722
00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:11,636
[SPEAKER_11]: David, come on up.

723
00:57:26,168 --> 00:57:36,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping to make it to nationals for all two of the rest of the year so this is just like one step forward and I think we can really win it this year with the seniors and I think we really do well.

724
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:50,187
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, as everyone knows, there's really no stipend that's large enough for the amount of work that these advisors do throughout our school.

725
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:53,668
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really just have to recognize all of the advisors here tonight, Ms.

726
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:56,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Kulin, and Mr. Spagnola, and Mr. Spagnola.

727
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:56,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

728
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Kloot.

729
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:12,395
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could remind me, Mr. Fallon, for the expenses for the students to travel to the next competition, how are we covering those?

730
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:21,034
[SPEAKER_18]: So with a combination of fundraising and through our budget, we are looking at a cost of about $1,600, which is down from about $4,000.

731
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:22,915
[SPEAKER_18]: So $4,000 was the total through fundraising.

732
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:23,776
[SPEAKER_18]: We're down to $1,600 remaining.

733
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:38,702
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, we've had other students come before us, and my personal feeling is that these students are bringing the pride of Medford with them.

734
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:47,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to see, again, if we could look towards a budget or perhaps, again, every so often the mayor's been able to come up with somebody who can cover the costs.

735
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:56,407
[SPEAKER_16]: I really believe that we should be building in some costs, that this automatically, we now have participation

736
00:58:57,762 --> 00:59:07,222
[SPEAKER_16]: in DECA and it would seem that we should build in a budget line item to cover costs for this because we are

737
00:59:07,698 --> 00:59:15,882
[SPEAKER_16]: optimistic about the success of our students, whether it be in this or the ethics team, and even before we talked about Albert's success.

738
00:59:16,782 --> 00:59:24,545
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would make that as a recommendation in general now, but as we talk about in our budget meetings, I'm going to come back to that.

739
00:59:25,446 --> 00:59:29,568
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, if we could look for funding, I'll put the request in that way.

740
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:35,250
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that you are successful, have been successful doing some fundraising, and I think that's wonderful.

741
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:41,954
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly appreciate that, but I'd also like to see the rest of the cost covered if at all possible.

742
00:59:42,635 --> 00:59:42,955
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

743
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:52,221
[SPEAKER_18]: And like you, with the rising enrollment in these programs, I have mentioned that to Assistant Superintendent Patterson as well, that we are going to look for that for next year.

744
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:53,162
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for that.

745
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:53,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

746
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:53,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

747
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:54,402
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate your support.

748
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:54,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

749
00:59:54,923 --> 00:59:55,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

750
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:56,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys.

751
00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:57,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

752
00:59:58,405 --> 01:00:05,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only do I agree that we've had great successes, and we're seeing more and more of our students in MEDFED,

753
01:00:06,245 --> 01:00:11,069
[SPEAKER_10]: take advantage of these learning opportunities both in school and out of school.

754
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:13,291
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the CCSR group here today.

755
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:22,338
[SPEAKER_10]: But when it comes down to send these children, there's a lot of pressure on these families and these groups to raise the money to be able to go to these events.

756
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:32,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would hate to take anything away from books, pencils, paper that was budgeted for in a different way to help fund.

757
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,688
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would be terrible if we

758
01:00:35,118 --> 01:00:39,921
[SPEAKER_10]: came down to it and didn't have the funds available for our students to take part in these things.

759
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:42,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So I second what my colleague is saying.

760
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:54,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be a priority for me throughout the budget process, and it will be one of my top priorities to make sure that every child that gets to that point shouldn't have to worry about how they get there.

761
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:56,370
[SPEAKER_10]: They're representing MedFed.

762
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,711
[SPEAKER_10]: All I want to say is good luck.

763
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:02,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring home the whole big awards,

764
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,297
[SPEAKER_10]: the shiny trophies.

765
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:05,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Do your best.

766
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:14,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And while you're at it, be yourself, because if they see how you are here, if you present that way there, your glow will shine.

767
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:21,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And tell your parents to watch those hashtags up there, because all the parents are online talking to you guys while you're there.

768
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:24,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Give them all the codes.

769
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:25,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

770
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:26,522
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to approve some things.

771
01:01:27,242 --> 01:01:30,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, recommendation to approve field trip, DECA national competition.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

778

[SPEAKER_11]: Paulette, yes.

780
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommendation to approve Field Trip Skills USA State Conference.

781
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:04,095

01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:06,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

783
01:02:06,317 --> 01:02:06,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Kratz.

01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:07,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

785
01:02:08,638 --> 01:02:09,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

786
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:19,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

787
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:19,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

788
01:02:20,747 --> 01:02:21,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job, people.

789
01:02:22,008 --> 01:02:22,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

790
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, report, Metro Vocational Technical High School update.

791
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:31,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Fallon.

792
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:37,480
[SPEAKER_18]: So I had a little technical difficulty being the guy from the technical high school.

793
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,660
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awfully embarrassing.

794
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,662
[SPEAKER_18]: But Christine is helping me today.

795
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:44,745
[SPEAKER_18]: I brought two laptops, but it's on the domain at the high school.

796
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:46,346
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thought I'd bring it on a thumb drive.

797
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:47,807
[SPEAKER_18]: And Emily and I had to, yeah.

798
01:02:47,827 --> 01:02:48,347
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we are.

799
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:49,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Christine.

800
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:51,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Could I just have a little help with the screen?

801
01:02:53,151 --> 01:02:53,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

802
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:55,212
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I do that, John?

803
01:02:55,532 --> 01:02:56,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never done it.

804
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:26,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

805
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you for allowing me this time to come and give an update.

806
01:03:30,968 --> 01:03:34,030
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a little bit of time since I've been in front of you, so I just want to

807
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, reiterate, we had our DECA winners.

808
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:38,973
[SPEAKER_18]: That was Hunter, David, and Richie off to nationals.

809
01:03:39,633 --> 01:03:41,234
[SPEAKER_18]: We had our skills participants.

810
01:03:41,274 --> 01:03:46,875
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, you should know, this year was the most participants we've had in skills in a very long time in Medford.

811
01:03:46,895 --> 01:03:49,736
[SPEAKER_18]: So we had three van loads go out to Framingham.

812
01:03:49,876 --> 01:03:54,957
[SPEAKER_18]: And to have that many gold and bronze winner and silver winners, we were really excited.

813
01:03:55,017 --> 01:03:56,337
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for your support on that.

814
01:03:57,898 --> 01:03:59,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I do want to mention some new additions.

815
01:03:59,558 --> 01:04:00,298
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been busy.

816
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:01,679
[SPEAKER_18]: We've done a lot of hiring.

817
01:04:02,954 --> 01:04:05,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Just in case you don't know, I'm going to run through this really quickly.

818
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:12,038
[SPEAKER_18]: We did hire a new automotive instructor who is also a graduate of Medford Vocational Technical High School's automotive program.

819
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:20,623
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a new vocational instructor who's specializing in early childhood education and will also be our special education support liaison when the time comes.

820
01:04:21,383 --> 01:04:23,564
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a new teacher in robotics and engineering.

821
01:04:24,264 --> 01:04:25,745
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a new teacher in carpentry.

822
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:32,028
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a new teacher in cosmetology who was helping us last year as a substitute and is now the full-time teacher this year.

823
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:35,238
[SPEAKER_18]: You met Mr. Spagnola tonight for graphic design.

824
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:39,121
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was able to hire an English language support instructor, Ms.

825
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:49,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Kathy Vigueux, who has been able to help us navigate with the merge to be able to accommodate our students that are English language learners.

826
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:57,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, in our main office, we have Kim Flaherty, who was a paraprofessional in the school and has come over to join us.

827
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:59,176
[SPEAKER_18]: She's been a wonderful addition to the school.

828
01:04:59,237 --> 01:05:00,858
[SPEAKER_18]: She's kind, and she's hardworking.

829
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:11,256
[SPEAKER_18]: And the last but not least, I want to reintroduce to you our new assistant principal director, Alice Beth Fitzpatrick.

830
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:25,446
[SPEAKER_18]: As you may or may not know, Alice Beth has 12 years at Medford Vocational Technical High School, and she spent the last 10 as both a career counselor and a guidance counselor.

831
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:30,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to say she makes wonderful connections with students and families.

832
01:05:30,976 --> 01:05:35,600
[SPEAKER_18]: She's very knowledgeable in the vocational technical education model.

833
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:41,966
[SPEAKER_18]: And probably one of her best accomplishments that she would probably agree with, she's a mother of two great kids, ages six and four.

834
01:05:42,126 --> 01:05:46,390
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can't tell you how good it is to have her on board, and I'm very grateful for this partnership.

835
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,772
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for a great first month.

836
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a reminder of our current offerings, I did put an asterisk next to environmental science and HVAC.

837
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:11,185
[SPEAKER_18]: So environmental science, what we're going to be doing, and I'll talk a little bit more about this in a minute, on April 4th when we have our CTE showcase, I'm going to have a table set up with a teacher from another school who teaches environmental science.

838
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:20,367
[SPEAKER_18]: When the teacher who we had, who was part-time, left at the beginning of this year, there were no freshmen last year that were picking it as a sophomore for this year.

839
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:22,208
[SPEAKER_18]: So we were in an interesting predicament.

840
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:27,713
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a half-funded position, so that was going to be tough budget-wise.

841
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:30,634
[SPEAKER_18]: And there were really no upper-class students, so we took a year.

842
01:06:31,315 --> 01:06:46,403
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be kind of reinvigorating the program, and I'm going to be asking this individual to be available on the fourth so that if parents come in, current freshmen, I'm trying to gain interest to see how many sophomores might be interested, to see how many rising sophomores might be interested in this program, so stand by on that.

843
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:52,186
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the other one is HVAC, and I should mention that this is a problem that is

844
01:06:53,285 --> 01:07:02,947
[SPEAKER_18]: not only statewide, but in the regional vocational technical high schools, there are eight openings right now, which is really bad news for us because they're scattered throughout the state.

845
01:07:03,907 --> 01:07:08,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the regional schools are hiring multiple positions for this program.

846
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:11,128
[SPEAKER_18]: One in particular is looking for two HVAC instructors.

847
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:13,969
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is obviously a problem statewide.

848
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:21,170
[SPEAKER_18]: We will continue to do everything we can to recruit, but you should know it still is a definite concern of ours.

849
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:26,790
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have some interesting news for enrollment.

850
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:31,213
[SPEAKER_18]: We just had 215 freshmen complete the CTE Exploratory Program.

851
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:33,154
[SPEAKER_18]: That's up from about 180 last year.

852
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:36,536
[SPEAKER_18]: And all the students rotated through nine of our 15 programs.

853
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,898
[SPEAKER_18]: So now all students are in their program of choice.

854
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:44,462
[SPEAKER_18]: 95% of the students received their first choice, which was really good for them.

855
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:44,962
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to

856
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:46,495
[SPEAKER_18]: unfortunately go dead.

857
01:07:46,515 --> 01:07:48,876
[SPEAKER_18]: That percentage will go down as enrollment rises.

858
01:07:49,496 --> 01:07:55,798
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why we stress the importance to the students to really make a first, a really good first choice and a really good second choice.

859
01:07:55,879 --> 01:08:05,482
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's a program you didn't do maybe so well in during your freshman year, but you have to be careful because where the enrollment increases, the first choice percentage will go down.

860
01:08:07,242 --> 01:08:12,244
[SPEAKER_18]: But to give you an update, we have 82 seniors, 45 of those seniors are on co-op right now.

861
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:17,247
[SPEAKER_18]: One third of the class has applied to college and working with their counselor at this time.

862
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:22,650
[SPEAKER_18]: We have 83 juniors, and our sophomore numbers really jumped up, and that's as a result of last year.

863
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:26,412
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now we have 127 sophomores and 215 freshmen.

864
01:08:26,993 --> 01:08:31,955
[SPEAKER_18]: So all in all, we're representing about 507 students in the CTE pathway right now.

865
01:08:32,936 --> 01:08:34,517
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about 80 more from last year.

866
01:08:36,474 --> 01:08:40,597
[SPEAKER_18]: To highlight some community involvement, we have done a lot of work for the city of Medford.

867
01:08:40,637 --> 01:08:41,638
[SPEAKER_18]: We're happy to do so.

868
01:08:41,738 --> 01:08:45,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to highlight a few things here, our graphic design program does printing.

869
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,242
[SPEAKER_18]: We had the mayor's bookmark.

870
01:08:47,482 --> 01:08:49,444
[SPEAKER_18]: We do a lot of work with the Office of Diversity.

871
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:54,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Our culinary arts program just held a breakfast, the Mass Partnership for Diversity.

872
01:08:55,668 --> 01:09:01,512
[SPEAKER_18]: We did a Friends of the Fells event, and we have an ongoing relationship with the Senior Center and the Council on Aging.

873
01:09:01,532 --> 01:09:03,514
[SPEAKER_18]: They come over to culinary and cosmetology.

874
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:04,915
[SPEAKER_18]: The other day,

875
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:12,855
[SPEAKER_18]: We had the West Medford seniors over and they had lunch and manicures and a haircut and styling done in cosmetology.

876
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:22,202
[SPEAKER_18]: For our carpentry and construction trades, we're working on projects right now that really started in the spring of last year from design and now it's implementation.

877
01:09:22,982 --> 01:09:25,684
[SPEAKER_18]: We are building six picnic tables and benches for the Tufts Pool.

878
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,207
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working with the West Medford Community Center to build them a storage shed.

879
01:09:29,587 --> 01:09:32,009
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working with the Housing Authority for a prototype shed.

880
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:35,131
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're working at the Riverside Dog Park to build them a gazebo.

881
01:09:35,978 --> 01:09:40,443
[SPEAKER_18]: pergola type structure so that the people with their dogs have some shade and I'll show you some sketches of that.

882
01:09:41,423 --> 01:09:49,731
[SPEAKER_18]: I mentioned cosmetology and then metal fabrication recently took a trip over to the elementary schools and installed some brackets on the top of laptop carts for printers.

883
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:52,133
[SPEAKER_18]: So just to give you an idea of what we're doing.

884
01:09:53,114 --> 01:09:59,400
[SPEAKER_18]: This was the community shed in the bottom and then over on the right I just wanted to put that in there for cosmetology.

885
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:01,182
[SPEAKER_18]: One of our teachers, Lauren,

886
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,664
[SPEAKER_18]: decided that she wanted to reach out to the students at St.

887
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:09,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Raphael's, for example, because they may not know or may not have had the opportunity to come to an open house.

888
01:10:09,927 --> 01:10:12,528
[SPEAKER_18]: So she extended that to the families and students of St.

889
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:16,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Raphael's to come over for a day of pampering, just in case they hadn't seen what Medford has to offer.

890
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:17,771
[SPEAKER_18]: And that went really well.

891
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:20,492
[SPEAKER_18]: A few other projects to tell you about.

892
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:22,814
[SPEAKER_18]: We have what's called the Brightside Bus Project.

893
01:10:22,854 --> 01:10:26,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to get too much into that today, but probably at a later date.

894
01:10:26,575 --> 01:10:29,997
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really a collaboration and a partnership we have with a community member.

895
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:30,798
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a resident.

896
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:31,598
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a parent.

897
01:10:32,814 --> 01:10:38,158
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have this incredible project they're working on that's pretty much centered around a bus.

898
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:39,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe some of you know it.

899
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Really they're going to travel the country this summer.

900
01:10:42,462 --> 01:10:49,689
[SPEAKER_18]: An amazing family really has, we've as a school family, have really taken this on and we want to do everything we can.

901
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:55,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Bottom line is that it's a school bus that's been converted into an RV.

902
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:02,364
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to help with the finishing touches inside to make beds, cabinets, floors, and to get them roadworthy so they can head out in the spring.

903
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,806
[SPEAKER_18]: And then one other partnership we have is with the PTO.

904
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:09,347
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been helping them with some events held in our Bistro 489.

905
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:13,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a few pictures of the Fells event.

906
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,051
[SPEAKER_18]: We have our instructor and the students in the kitchen.

907
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:20,073
[SPEAKER_18]: That was their cheese board and vegetable display that the students helped work on.

908
01:11:21,885 --> 01:11:23,306
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was us at the dog park.

909
01:11:23,326 --> 01:11:32,829
[SPEAKER_18]: So we went over in the spring, and this is the pergola gazebo that the students designed and will be building.

910
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:43,453
[SPEAKER_18]: So in terms of upgrades, through Perkins funding last year, I wrote for upgrades in automotive technology because the equipment was out of date.

911
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:52,302
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, if you had a car that was anything over, I think, 2014 or 2015, we wouldn't be able to do an alignment or a proper vehicle diagnostic on it.

912
01:11:52,822 --> 01:12:02,427
[SPEAKER_18]: So through Perkins funding, I wrote for equipment for a new vehicle lift, an alignment machine, a diagnostic scanner, and some other items there.

913
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:03,407
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to read each one.

914
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:10,028
[SPEAKER_18]: but I just wanted you to be aware that that's one way that we look outside our working budget to see what we can do for upgrades.

915
01:12:10,088 --> 01:12:25,853
[SPEAKER_18]: As you know, Perkins really supports equipment in Chapter 74 programs, so that was our, really, in partnership with the project we did last year, which was all of the new lighting in the automotive shop, so we're happy to say the automotive program will be up to standard, industry standard.

916
01:12:27,714 --> 01:12:30,655
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have been in the high school recently, and I have to thank

917
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:36,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Vincent for this, and she's not here, but I'll make sure to see her after to thank her again.

918
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:40,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Really, when she came in, she saw a vision that we were just so excited about.

919
01:12:40,472 --> 01:12:45,175
[SPEAKER_18]: She saw a spot for the school store in the front of the school, which was so important, because right now it was in the middle.

920
01:12:45,776 --> 01:12:53,060
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'd have people coming in all the time, not able to find it, and they're walking through the building, and when we think of safety, and there was a whole host of reasons why that wasn't working.

921
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:54,878
[SPEAKER_18]: We are now open.

922
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:59,263
[SPEAKER_18]: The grand opening will be during the first week in May, so you'll hear about that.

923
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:03,288
[SPEAKER_18]: But just so you do know, we are fully operational in our new space, which has beautiful windows.

924
01:13:03,328 --> 01:13:04,710
[SPEAKER_18]: They're displaying things in the windows.

925
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,231
[SPEAKER_18]: It's bigger space.

926
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,052
[SPEAKER_18]: It's better space.

927
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:09,135
[SPEAKER_18]: So we thank you for your support on that.

928
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:13,020
[SPEAKER_18]: The last item is really a big one.

929
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,844
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be starting in the spring, starting now, starting within the next couple of weeks.

930
01:13:17,424 --> 01:13:20,648
[SPEAKER_18]: We are moving the salon from downstairs upstairs.

931
01:13:20,948 --> 01:13:23,110
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's going to be more accessible to our clientele.

932
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:30,958
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to have parking out front, and it's going to be where it really should be, on the same level as the bistro, so that we can incorporate that with the cosmetology services.

933
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:46,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, something I'll probably get into at a later date, but we do have some funding that is going to be given to us through a donor and that has kind of really pushed this all into motion at this point.

934
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:47,913
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a big project.

935
01:13:48,234 --> 01:13:50,014
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand what it's going to take.

936
01:13:50,054 --> 01:13:53,856
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not even going to say it's going to be fully open in the fall, because I learned my lesson with the bistro.

937
01:13:55,037 --> 01:13:56,977
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is going to be happening.

938
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,879
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to try to utilize as much as we can from the old salon.

939
01:13:59,919 --> 01:14:02,700
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm meeting with both cosmetology instructors this week.

940
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,701
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is step one to get the design and the layout.

941
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:07,682
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I'll bring my electricians in, and we'll start.

942
01:14:07,702 --> 01:14:13,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that's really the most, the biggest expense in that project is going to be an HVAC system for the roof, which is about $15,000 to $20,000.

943
01:14:14,902 --> 01:14:18,065
[SPEAKER_18]: and then some electrical upgrades inside for the equipment.

944
01:14:18,966 --> 01:14:21,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than that, a lot of it's just aesthetic and design and paint.

945
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:23,831
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're excited for that.

946
01:14:23,911 --> 01:14:25,894
[SPEAKER_18]: So stay tuned for that.

947
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:30,459
[SPEAKER_18]: And just an update on some events right now.

948
01:14:30,519 --> 01:14:32,120
[SPEAKER_18]: We have our Grade 9 Student Showcase.

949
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,940
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is what you might have heard about before as formerly known as the CTE Selection Night.

950
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:46,342
[SPEAKER_18]: I changed it this year because I felt as though to have parents come in in January when students were yet, they had yet to, freshmen had yet to spend some time in their program.

951
01:14:46,382 --> 01:14:49,223
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a better way for parents to see what their son and daughter is really doing.

952
01:14:49,923 --> 01:14:54,644
[SPEAKER_18]: So the idea is these students have been in their program now since the beginning of February.

953
01:14:54,684 --> 01:14:56,784
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've invited all freshman parents to come in.

954
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:01,127
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have invites for you all as well here tonight to come in.

955
01:15:01,227 --> 01:15:05,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Every program will be open so that students can bring their parent to their respective program.

956
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:06,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Parents can ask the questions.

957
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:07,930
[SPEAKER_18]: We can clear up any myths.

958
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,670
[SPEAKER_18]: We can talk about course scheduling.

959
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:12,051
[SPEAKER_18]: We can answer any questions the parents might have that night.

960
01:15:12,531 --> 01:15:13,732
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're hoping for a good turnout.

961
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:15,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, we have about 215 freshmen.

962
01:15:15,872 --> 01:15:17,733
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're hoping to get all those parents.

963
01:15:19,205 --> 01:15:23,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Our spring program advisory, you school committee members will also be getting an invite to that.

964
01:15:23,589 --> 01:15:24,709
[SPEAKER_18]: That's April 25th at 630.

965
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,572
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the second of our two advisory committee meetings this year.

966
01:15:30,954 --> 01:15:35,317
[SPEAKER_18]: And just an update on our coordinated program review that was last year.

967
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:45,045
[SPEAKER_18]: We are just about complete with our safety component of this, which has been very cumbersome, but a learning experience to say the least.

968
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:49,249
[SPEAKER_18]: So when all that's complete, there will be a few things that I'll be meeting with Ms.

969
01:15:49,269 --> 01:15:52,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Patterson about in terms of budgetary recommendations.

970
01:15:52,411 --> 01:15:53,251
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really not a lot.

971
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,252
[SPEAKER_18]: The good news is there wasn't anything that was major.

972
01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:56,573
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the good news.

973
01:15:58,374 --> 01:15:59,695
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll be wrapping that up soon.

974
01:16:00,395 --> 01:16:05,178
[SPEAKER_18]: I spoke about the recruitment of the HVAC instructor, and I spoke about the environmental science piece.

975
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:11,573
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, and again, she's not here, but this really goes for everyone in this room.

976
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:15,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your support, and especially Superintendent Vincent, who comes around all the time.

977
01:16:16,257 --> 01:16:17,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Students are used to her by this point.

978
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:20,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Whenever she has a guest, she comes by, she brings them through our programs.

979
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:23,724
[SPEAKER_18]: And we really appreciate her support and enthusiasm for what we do.

980
01:16:24,364 --> 01:16:29,869
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you to all of you, because I do feel the support, and I appreciate you for supporting us, really.

981
01:16:30,009 --> 01:16:30,470
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

982
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:34,033
[SPEAKER_18]: And at this time, any questions, please, that I can answer?

983
01:16:34,753 --> 01:16:34,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

984
01:16:34,954 --> 01:16:35,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Van Kloot.

985
01:16:36,942 --> 01:16:41,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Fallon, I just want to ask you, what space the new salon is going to be in?

986
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:50,610
[SPEAKER_18]: So directly above the former auto collision space is where the OT and PT, occupational therapy, physical therapy has space.

987
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:57,994
[SPEAKER_18]: So they've known for over a year and a half now that this was going to be kind of taken back by the vocational school.

988
01:16:58,475 --> 01:17:05,979
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we're doing is I'm moving our business technology program out of not only the school store, but the two classrooms that were behind that.

989
01:17:06,403 --> 01:17:09,664
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a better space for them because it's closer to the MEEP classrooms.

990
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:15,627
[SPEAKER_18]: So it gets them out of the corner and it gets them more into the central part of the building, which is more appropriate for their work.

991
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:17,148
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're just really moving.

992
01:17:17,248 --> 01:17:24,951
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing we're up against now is that space has a, for lack of a better term, it's a swing.

993
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,252
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a big swing on an I-beam.

994
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:31,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're having some difficulty because the ceiling height isn't what we had hoped it was in the classroom.

995
01:17:31,854 --> 01:17:33,655
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're looking at alternatives to that because

996
01:17:34,355 --> 01:17:41,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than that, Jan Hollenbeck and I have been, we've been talking about this for about a year, so luckily they've had a heads up, but that's the space in the corner.

997
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:45,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and certainly in terms of access from the outside in the bistro, it makes a lot of sense.

998
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:51,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's 100 times better, and again, it keeps patrons out of the school building.

999
01:17:51,784 --> 01:18:01,109
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the one thing that, it's great that we get to provide these services, but it's very awkward to have people from the outside be coming in, going downstairs where the students are, going down a hallway.

1000
01:18:01,129 --> 01:18:03,130
[SPEAKER_18]: There's just too much activity from the outside.

1001
01:18:04,422 --> 01:18:05,182
[SPEAKER_18]: that I'm comfortable with.

1002
01:18:05,663 --> 01:18:10,344
[SPEAKER_18]: So this will also, and this is a great spot for a salon because it's all windows, looks out to the fells and to the front of the school.

1003
01:18:11,005 --> 01:18:11,185
[SPEAKER_18]: So.

1004
01:18:11,545 --> 01:18:12,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you very much.

1005
01:18:12,465 --> 01:18:13,806
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1006
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:13,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1007
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:14,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Kratz?

1008
01:18:14,626 --> 01:18:17,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I wanted to say thank you very much for the report, Mr. Fallon.

1009
01:18:17,847 --> 01:18:25,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I asked you for some information and a lot of people were curious and wanted to know this information, so I'm really happy that you shared it tonight.

1010
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,571
[SPEAKER_15]: It was an excellent presentation.

1011
01:18:26,951 --> 01:18:27,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1012
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:28,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

1013
01:18:28,511 --> 01:18:29,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Very exciting.

1014
01:18:30,352 --> 01:18:30,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1015
01:18:30,612 --> 01:18:30,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Jasper?

1016
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:34,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1017
01:18:35,982 --> 01:18:36,723
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to step up?

1018
01:18:36,943 --> 01:18:37,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1019
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:40,264
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to get a mic for that.

1020
01:18:40,484 --> 01:18:43,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Just highlighting on the ninth grade CTE program.

1021
01:18:43,605 --> 01:18:48,266
[SPEAKER_21]: When I went through it, I did metal fabrication and HVAC with Mr. Small and Mr. Emerald.

1022
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:50,406
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've really enjoyed my time there.

1023
01:18:51,207 --> 01:18:59,589
[SPEAKER_21]: But when it came to my ninth grade year, I had to choose between whether I wanted to take honors classes in high school or continue with my vocational education.

1024
01:19:00,311 --> 01:19:02,674
[SPEAKER_21]: And that kind of really devastated me.

1025
01:19:02,794 --> 01:19:12,266
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was wondering, I know it's probably like many years in the future if you were to make any movements, but are there any movements in place to further integrate the vocational and the high school together?

1026
01:19:12,306 --> 01:19:19,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe make certain shops like an elective for high school students or even have vocational students take AP classes like they want to.

1027
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there any movements going towards that direction?

1028
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:23,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I was looking forward to that maybe in my junior year.

1029
01:19:23,862 --> 01:19:27,849
[SPEAKER_21]: I was talking to Dr. Perrella about it a little bit during my junior year.

1030
01:19:27,869 --> 01:19:30,253
[SPEAKER_21]: But I was just wondering if there were any movements toward that.

1031
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:34,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's a loaded question.

1032
01:19:34,994 --> 01:19:35,195
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1033
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:46,081
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I will say, and I think probably everyone in this room has heard it, we do not have a schedule within the Medford High School complex.

1034
01:19:46,242 --> 01:19:49,804
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have a schedule that can fully align both schools.

1035
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:50,804
[SPEAKER_18]: So here's what I'll say.

1036
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:54,147
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe phase one was the merge, if you will.

1037
01:19:54,227 --> 01:19:56,008
[SPEAKER_18]: That was phase one, and we've done some great things.

1038
01:19:56,568 --> 01:19:58,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Phase two needs to be a master schedule.

1039
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:02,091
[SPEAKER_18]: The high school operates on a six-day rotating cycle.

1040
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:03,832
[SPEAKER_18]: We operate on a five-day.

1041
01:20:06,554 --> 01:20:10,776
[SPEAKER_18]: There are growing pains, I'll say, with the merge.

1042
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,637
[SPEAKER_18]: We believe we've identified all of them.

1043
01:20:13,898 --> 01:20:15,879
[SPEAKER_18]: My main concern is exactly what you're saying.

1044
01:20:16,039 --> 01:20:20,101
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we make sure that a high school student can come take part in what we do?

1045
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:27,047
[SPEAKER_18]: and how do we make sure that a vocational student on that pathway has access to honors level classes and advanced placement.

1046
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:28,488
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have some of that going on now.

1047
01:20:30,629 --> 01:20:37,014
[SPEAKER_18]: However, we've kind of come to this point where there's only so much we can do when we have two schedules working like this.

1048
01:20:38,275 --> 01:20:49,803
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I will say is that in terms of an elective, it's hard for us because our programs are all really, there's opportunities for a high school student to come in for some of our programs,

1049
01:20:50,196 --> 01:20:51,336
[SPEAKER_18]: but not for all of them.

1050
01:20:52,156 --> 01:20:52,937
[SPEAKER_18]: So what Ms.

1051
01:20:52,957 --> 01:21:00,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Fitzpatrick and I have been doing, spending a lot of time doing, and with Mr. DeLeva, who I didn't mention, but I should mention, a great partner principal.

1052
01:21:00,118 --> 01:21:02,039
[SPEAKER_18]: So you should all know that, that this has been a great year.

1053
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:06,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Him and I share a vision, and we are trying to figure out the best way to make that happen.

1054
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,760
[SPEAKER_18]: I promise you it's coming.

1055
01:21:09,221 --> 01:21:10,201
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just going to take some work.

1056
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:11,381
[SPEAKER_18]: We need a new schedule.

1057
01:21:12,261 --> 01:21:13,121
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what it comes down to.

1058
01:21:13,882 --> 01:21:15,602
[SPEAKER_18]: But a good concern, and I share it with you.

1059
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:16,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Great question.

1060
01:21:16,582 --> 01:21:16,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1061
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:19,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1062
01:21:19,821 --> 01:21:20,521
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm sorry.

1063
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:21,102
[SPEAKER_18]: You're all set?

1064
01:21:21,242 --> 01:21:22,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

1065
01:21:24,023 --> 01:21:26,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. Fallon.

1066
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:27,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck everybody.

1067
01:21:27,405 --> 01:21:35,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, report on professional development day, Dr. Riccadeli.

1068
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:44,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1069
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:54,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am here tonight in one of my new roles, and that is to oversee the professional development program for the district.

1070
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:59,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a great mentor, Diane Caldwell, the associate superintendent.

1071
01:22:00,396 --> 01:22:06,021
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, has had that role for many years, and it is newly mine, and she has been a great help.

1072
01:22:06,081 --> 01:22:07,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.

1073
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:15,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am here tonight to talk about the second professional development day of the 2018-2019 school year.

1074
01:22:16,113 --> 01:22:25,036
[SPEAKER_06]: This day occurred on Tuesday, March 12th, and in looking at the evaluations from that day of teachers, most of them felt that

1075
01:22:25,546 --> 01:22:30,608
[SPEAKER_06]: For the most part, they were exposed to some very fulfilling experiences, so that was great to hear.

1076
01:22:31,928 --> 01:22:35,370
[SPEAKER_06]: We always aim to improve upon what we've done in the past.

1077
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:39,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So just in sum, the schedule went like this.

1078
01:22:40,152 --> 01:22:46,094
[SPEAKER_06]: On the elementary school level, a majority of faculty members engaged in FOSS training.

1079
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:48,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So the new science program, they engaged in that.

1080
01:22:48,775 --> 01:22:51,656
[SPEAKER_06]: That took place at the McGlynn Middle School.

1081
01:22:52,096 --> 01:22:53,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It began in the theater, and then

1082
01:22:54,829 --> 01:23:02,235
[SPEAKER_06]: The teachers went out into breakout groups, into classrooms, and those workshops were led by FOSS training specialists.

1083
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:06,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was an all-day training.

1084
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:17,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Specialists, so speech language pathologists and other special ed specialists, many of them went into their own workshops.

1085
01:23:19,431 --> 01:23:22,192
[SPEAKER_06]: On the secondary level, in the morning, it was building-based.

1086
01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:37,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So high school teachers and middle school teachers worked with their respective principals on topics such as unpacking ACE in plain sight, instructional strategies for struggling learners, and response to intervention.

1087
01:23:38,498 --> 01:23:47,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So these topics or these workshops had to do with relationship building, team-building, and strategic and enhanced instructional support.

1088
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:54,660
[SPEAKER_06]: In the afternoon, middle and high school teachers engaged in work with their department directors.

1089
01:23:57,402 --> 01:24:14,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had in total 34 workshops, so if I had to sum up those workshops into different themes, I would say they had to do with curriculum development and mapping, promoting self-determination, instructional strategy development, MCAS review,

1090
01:24:16,255 --> 01:24:19,637
[SPEAKER_06]: and Department of Education Framework Review.

1091
01:24:19,758 --> 01:24:25,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, those 34 workshops summed up within those five themes.

1092
01:24:26,242 --> 01:24:28,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think overall it was well received.

1093
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:39,552
[SPEAKER_06]: As we think about what we're going to do for the next school year, it's going to be, well, we've begun thinking about it, but the planning is going to begin with the Professional Development Committee.

1094
01:24:39,912 --> 01:24:43,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you know, in our current contract with the Teachers Association,

1095
01:24:44,655 --> 01:24:50,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It calls for the establishment of a joint labor management professional development committee.

1096
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:53,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So those meetings are planned for May.

1097
01:24:54,123 --> 01:24:58,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will sit on that committee along with three of my administrative colleagues.

1098
01:24:58,866 --> 01:25:05,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the teachers' side, they will have representatives representing their desire for professional development.

1099
01:25:07,923 --> 01:25:11,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Working to develop our people is really important.

1100
01:25:11,385 --> 01:25:22,971
[SPEAKER_06]: We can talk about programs, and certainly programs are important, but I think there's nothing more important than working with our professionals, making them feel good about what they do and giving them the tools that they need to move forward.

1101
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:26,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to take any questions that you may have.

1102
01:25:26,713 --> 01:25:27,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1103
01:25:27,534 --> 01:25:27,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1104
01:25:27,834 --> 01:25:28,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Caldwell.

1105
01:25:30,955 --> 01:25:35,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to take a moment just to thank Dr. Riccadeli for all the hard work that she's done in professional development.

1106
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:44,829
[SPEAKER_05]: As I took on additional responsibilities this year, it was very difficult or challenging for me to continue all the work that I did.

1107
01:25:44,949 --> 01:25:52,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we decided that Dr. Riccadeli would take over professional development, I was more than happy to give that up.

1108
01:25:52,894 --> 01:25:54,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for what you've done.

1109
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:55,536
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

1110
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:56,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1111
01:25:57,473 --> 01:26:00,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report, place it on file by Ms.

1112
01:26:00,394 --> 01:26:02,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Mustone, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

1113
01:26:02,455 --> 01:26:03,075
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1114
01:26:03,095 --> 01:26:03,155

[SPEAKER_11]: Report on Superintendent's Entry Plan Findings.

[SPEAKER_08]: I make a motion to table that motion.

1120
01:26:15,521 --> 01:26:17,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor to table, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

1121
01:26:17,982 --> 01:26:18,782
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1122
01:26:18,802 --> 01:26:18,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1123
01:26:19,563 --> 01:26:20,183
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1124
01:26:20,263 --> 01:26:21,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1125
01:26:21,524 --> 01:26:21,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Table.

[SPEAKER_11]: New business.

1127
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:26,769

[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Louise Bianchi.

[SPEAKER_11]: Bianchi was the mother of Nancy Zero, Special Ed Secretary for Medford Public Schools.

1131

[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Donna Duranian.

[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

01:26:42,642 --> 01:26:48,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Duranian was the sister of Angela Donahue, Evaluation Team Leader for Medford Public Schools.

1134
01:26:49,367 --> 01:26:53,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express sincere condolences to the family of Richard Elliott.

1135
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:59,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Elliott was the father of Kelly Chiquinto, occupational therapist for Medford Public Schools.
