00:08:52,552 --> 00:09:01,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're going to move on to the meat of the meeting and hopefully it will be a meeting by the time we're done here.

151
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:16,356
[SPEAKER_03]: As you all know, we got 4 proposals from designers and the goal for tonight is for myself, for the mayor and for Dr. Pelosi to really hear from all of you about your impressions.

152
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:18,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not ranking.

153
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:19,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot rank.

154
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,730
[SPEAKER_03]: that.

155
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:39,226
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these four folks are watching us either now or in the future and the MSBA is really explicit about not wanting us to be talking in terms of ranking favorites etc.

156
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:45,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we tried to do was give you all a set of questions to think about

157
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:57,691
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would like for us to just go 1 proposal at a time and go through these questions.

158
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're really interested in hearing from all of you.

159
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:05,095
[SPEAKER_03]: We are sensitive to the fact that we are 3 of 13 votes.

160
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:10,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have our work cut out for us when we go to designer selection next week.

161
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:12,158
[SPEAKER_03]: However.

162
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:17,901
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of collective experience at this table and we want to hear from.

163
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:25,716
[SPEAKER_03]: From all of you from from your lenses, from your impressions of the proposals that were shared and that will help us.

164
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:31,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Get ready for that for that meeting and there's 2 meetings.

165
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:31,759
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 is.

166
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we will talk about all of the proposals and then the 2nd meeting where there will be.

167
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:56,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the questions that we did want to talk about with all of you, and I'm thinking to just take them one at a time so that we give everybody equal shape.

168
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,766
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you like about the proposal compared to others?

169
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,526
[SPEAKER_03]: What stuck out as advantageous?

170
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,907
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you dislike about a particular proposal as compared to others?

171
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you view as being less than advantageous?

172
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:15,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what questions would you have for this applicant about their proposal?

173
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the three questions.

174
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:21,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We can maybe just start.

175
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have a proposal they want to start with that they feel very strongly about, Luke?

176
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hold on, hold on.

177
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do one question at a time so that everybody can stick with us.

178
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:38,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

179
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's everyone has DLR's proposal.

180
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

181
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:47,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So this proposal is from DLR in collaboration

182
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, Will, can you keep track of who is raising their hand online?

183
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:09,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little hard for us to see.

184
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:11,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave the questions up.

185
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

186
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,334
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we like about this?

187
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:29,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Letty, I like that they have experience working together.

188
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently had a large project that took it.

189
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that Letty shows really strong design skills.

190
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:42,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's an example of a successful team.

191
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

192
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:47,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Any else?

193
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:50,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

194
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:55,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that they were pretty explicit in their

195
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:58,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions online?

196
00:12:59,173 --> 00:12:59,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,

197
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

198
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,751
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you dislike about the DLR proposal as compared to others?

199
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:32,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what did you view as being less advantageous or less than advantageous?

200
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:33,314
Yep.

201
00:13:55,664 --> 00:14:01,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to continue to speak to that.

202
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:08,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Their experience is spread across the country, and also even to the U.S.

203
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:13,598
[SPEAKER_02]: territories, which I felt was less advantageous.

204
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:18,122
I also

205
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:30,007
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the advantage of playing your team?

206
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:35,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very high.

207
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that people are having a hard time hearing us.

208
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:19,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So Emily, so far, the comments in the less advantageous category are that this group has light on experience with MSBA, that they seem to have a relatively large headcount.

209
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And that there are two firms in the mix with which to coordinate about the design.

210
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,751
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we've covered so far.

211
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:31,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for those of you trying to listen here.

212
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:32,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

213
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

214
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:46,502
[SPEAKER_03]: speak loudly for the crowd.

215
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to speak up earlier, but then I got distracted looking at the paper.

216
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:57,107
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually think the fact that it's two firms is actually something that could be seen as advantageous.

217
00:15:57,147 --> 00:16:08,533
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a lot of different voices, and you get to take the expertise of each of those firms and leave behind the things that the firms aren't as good at.

218
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think looking at them as one entity, it's not on us to figure out

219
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:20,193
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to like, who's going to be in charge of this part of design?

220
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to be in charge of that part of the design?

221
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:33,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Having worked on both sides of projects where I've been either the architect of record or the design architect, all of this would be hammered out between two firms in advance.

222
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Skipping ahead a little bit.

223
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:43,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how are they going to handle these things?

224
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:56,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have extensive experience working together already, which leads me to believe that they already have this process in their minds of how they're going to handle it.

225
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:08,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it is actually very advantageous to take a firm that's really rooted in kind of the programming and analysis and then a firm that's really rooted in

226
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:13,877
[SPEAKER_03]: really good design and bringing them together to create one super team.

227
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:17,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Marissa.

228
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Will, is there anybody online who's got their hand up?

229
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:25,286
[SPEAKER_01]: All the members of the, oh, oh.

230
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Maria Dorsey.

231
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Maria?

232
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

233
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:39,177
[SPEAKER_08]: From an educational angle, I had the feeling that this group, their focus was more on

234
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:44,009
[SPEAKER_08]: CTE than on the classrooms, as opposed to the other groups.

235
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:53,575
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them, the others were either on equal footing or had a strong sense of what the needs of the classroom are with CTE combined.

236
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:59,518
[SPEAKER_08]: This one, I felt that they were, they had a leaning, more leaning towards the shops.

237
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was just my impression on what I read.

238
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Maria.

239
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:08,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anybody else online?

240
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?

241
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:16,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian?

242
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:27,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things I feel is a little bit advantageous is that there are candidates that maybe we want to get this done.

243
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:37,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of a problem there that we don't know how it turned out and how that can manifest itself.

244
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:43,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you online, the comment was that they're like sort of

245
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: prime example for us is still a work in progress, and it's not yet complete.

246
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't know how it turned out.

247
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,028
Luke?

248
00:18:53,048 --> 00:19:00,832
[SPEAKER_02]: When I looked at all the consultants, I didn't find a library consultant.

249
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find a lab consultant.

250
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:08,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find a landscape consultant.

251
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that typical, Matt and Jen?

252
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about what is typical in terms of like how teams get put together?

253
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:40,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So they need to provide consultants that are listed up in the RFS.

254
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:45,061
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a very specific set of consultants that we're expecting to see.

255
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,808
[SPEAKER_06]: or not a pool consultant is required or not.

256
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:58,149
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that the asset was required.

257
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,389
[SPEAKER_06]: They can certainly include one.

258
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:09,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can think of maybe one where the parent pool consultant and the resident pool consultant have.

259
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:20,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's typically, and I can pull up the sub-consultant spreadsheet of where I found everybody just to make sure that they get involved.

260
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:21,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they did.

261
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are maybe a little hard to find because of some of the names.

262
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:32,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll take a look and see what it would be.

263
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they have in-house experience, so they look to themselves for those categories.

264
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes that makes it a little less clear.

265
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:45,152
[SPEAKER_03]: example.

266
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:45,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So every question.

267
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:50,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like the teams will not necessarily look at because of how they come together.

268
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Other not advantageous things.

269
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:17,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

270
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:22,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a lot of the projects that they're looking at.

271
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:22,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?

272
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:58,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So just so you know, this is the spreadsheet that required to fill up the MSBA.

273
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:01,435
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all of their consultants, all of the board members.

274
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see them here.

275
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they did have structural landscaping.

276
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have the CT consultants.

277
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:19,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a question.

278
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:26,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe for for Lucy and her team.

279
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:26,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like.

280
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:29,413
[SPEAKER_05]: What I hear about vocational is that.

281
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: What we think of as vocational in Massachusetts is quite different than what vocational looks like in other places in the country.

282
00:22:55,867 --> 00:23:00,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you respond to that from a programming perspective?

283
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:16,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I think that we're in a unique situation where we are a comprehensive high school.

284
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:40,155
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not a single vocational school, so all of our programs are Chapter 74, which means that there are requirements and regulations pertaining to content that we provide our students, the number of hours that they have in shop, as well as their academics, and then the number of hours that they are doing in the industry fields, whatever that may be, particular to the shop.

285
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:50,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we are to expand our programming and that some of the vocational programming standards have recently been increased.

286
00:23:52,022 --> 00:24:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what I would just say that like from the lens of me reviewing a lot of these proposals would be like looking at that experience that a firm does have with the CTE programming.

287
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:31,996
[SPEAKER_03]: that is aligned and parallel to Medford, not a standalone CTE school, but one that's comprehensive, that at this time has full Chapter 74 shops, and one sort of space that is unique and brings with it a lot of flexibility.

288
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:34,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need more detail?

289
00:24:34,496 --> 00:24:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm good, thank you.

290
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:36,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to

291
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,421
[SPEAKER_03]: not being in that world understand.

292
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:43,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same everywhere or is it different?

293
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:44,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

294
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:55,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I also would say that maybe also for me, I do not have a lot of MSBA experience coming into this project.

295
00:24:55,073 --> 00:25:06,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think for someone like me reading these proposals, I found it very difficult to get a true understanding from the visuals.

296
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:17,685
[SPEAKER_03]: on the clarity of the image, the detail or lack of detail.

297
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:26,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really hard for me to get a true understanding as to what the vision was for the proposals.

298
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:47,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

299
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:11,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?

300
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:11,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Libby?

301
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:17,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd ask just how frequently do they expect to be physically present in Boston for those who are not local?

302
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:20,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So are they flying in or doing remote meetings?

303
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Just how often are they here in person?

304
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:31,167
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, this was the team that was not terribly local, is that right?

305
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:32,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Libby's local.

306
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:36,168
[SPEAKER_03]: DLR has some of them are local in Boston, but some are not.

307
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:41,600
[SPEAKER_03]: What other questions would we have for DLR?

308
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

309
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:50,287
Any last?

310
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:50,547
Brian?

311
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:26,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you at home wanting some more information on their cluster design concept.

312
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions for DLR?

313
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:47,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about Perkinsville next.

314
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,166
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we like about Perkinsville?

315
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:08,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke?

316
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:27,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that they included a estimated

317
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:52,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that they try to

318
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:28,278
[SPEAKER_04]: of central space in between the addition renovating space today, the first kind of slideshow, trying to incorporate the idea that this is an opportunity for the community to be involved.

319
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That's as well as outdoor learning spaces.

320
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:38,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We're learning a lot now that there's a huge benefit to having that available space for students and teachers to kind of get outside the classroom from time to time.

321
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:47,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be able to incorporate that and have that be used as a shared space with the community.

322
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:48,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Other likes?

323
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:48,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

324
00:29:50,937 --> 00:30:11,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, I think the students are very clear, the graphics are very clear, and this gives me hope for and faith for our team, for how we move forward as a student community.

325
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:14,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think that there's some very clarity in the fact that

326
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,715
[SPEAKER_03]: they actually are going to be able to work on our project of splitting wood in Salem.

327
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:25,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the work I think is done both, but the team doing the work in the database is our project.

328
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:32,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Lori.

329
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:38,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like the idea that we take into account interdisciplinary learning.

330
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,769
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not just CTE, but

331
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:06,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for those of you online so far, we, we've heard.

332
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:12,559
[SPEAKER_03]: The likes include experience working with left field that Salem high school.

333
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:18,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Is ongoing and ahead of us that they took a stab at a timeline.

334
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,691
[SPEAKER_03]: That they're prioritizing community space, outdoor learning, geothermal.

335
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Messaging was quite clear.

336
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:35,898
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not splitting their team with other projects like Salem and they are focused on interdisciplinary learning.

337
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:39,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so that you, in case you all were having a hard time hearing.

338
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:46,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Also.

339
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:47,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Full consultants.

340
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:06,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when when we were we were doing the tour, there were lots of questions about those kinds of things.

341
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:10,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really tried to paint a picture for everybody who is here that

342
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:14,604
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some interesting spaces in this building that.

343
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be looking at to say, is this worth preserving or.

344
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:28,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not for some reason, but that that was 1 of the spaces we talked about wanting explicitly to be able to evaluate.

345
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:32,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it stay does it goes what happens.

346
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:36,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That also included the gym because it's quite big.

347
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:50,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in terms of how they were trying to serve.

348
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what was less advantageous.

349
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer that question.

350
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

351
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:24,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that seem.

352
00:33:51,562 --> 00:34:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: There aren't a lot of seats.

353
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:09,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And their team also didn't seem to have lots of vocational experience.

354
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:12,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I remembering that correctly?

355
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:29,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

356
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

357
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

358
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

359
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

360
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.

361
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:32,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.

362
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:32,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.

363
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.

364
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:33,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.

365
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:33,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.

366
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:33,941
I'm so sorry.

367
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:34,202
I'm so sorry.

368
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:34,522
I'm so sorry.

369
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:34,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

370
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:35,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

371
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:35,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

372
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:35,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

373
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:36,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

374
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:36,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

375
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:36,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

376
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

377
00:34:36,982 --> 00:34:37,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

378
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:37,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

379
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:37,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

380
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:38,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

381
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:38,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

382
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:39,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

383
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:39,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

384
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

385
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:41,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

386
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:41,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

387
00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:42,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

388
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:42,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

389
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:42,785
I'm so sorry.

390
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:47,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

391
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:48,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

392
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:48,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

393
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:48,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

394
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

395
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

396
00:34:51,347 --> 00:34:51,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

397
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:51,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

398
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:52,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

399
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:52,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

400
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:36,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not the same things, obviously, but like the same, just like not the same stuff that you don't necessarily need in a regular classroom, like that type of experience.

401
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:43,835
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, their experience spans beyond public schools and beyond high schools.

402
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:47,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And while it might, I have a similar question to you,

403
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:01,413
[SPEAKER_03]: strictly educational spaces.

404
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:18,737
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, I would be very curious to see how does that experience match up to what we need here in Medford with a very unique site and the possibilities of being able to do something

405
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things we thought were less advantageous.

406
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:51,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what questions do you have for this firm?

407
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:57,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Share questions for all of us.

408
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:18,566
[SPEAKER_03]: renovating Jibsville, CTE, or anything else for that matter, to all the ones that experience some sort of solar, whether that's solar, public parking lot, buildings, to the components of whatever project we choose.

409
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:22,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?

410
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:36,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they, in their, in kind of all their designs, they don't clarify what their expectations are.

411
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:49,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that they kind of discuss interdisciplinarity, collaboration, CT, pre-K, innovation sections on what design plans, but they don't actually clarify if they want that to be built in an adjacent building, in the building, what their thinking is with that.

412
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:57,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, it's a clarity on what their vision would be and how that kind of plays into what we're looking for, which is probably the best prospective program.

413
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So they clarify everything else.

414
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:04,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?

415
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:15,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

416
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Two down, two to go.

417
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do AI3 next.

418
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Happens to be one right in front of me.

419
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:39,131
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, what did we find advantageous about AI3?

420
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:40,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken?

421
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:46,973
[SPEAKER_02]: If I count it correctly, it sounded like it had six CTE schools in the last 12 years, having in-house CTE experts.

422
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:50,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

423
00:38:51,554 --> 00:39:01,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to throw in part of the idea that it's taking up a lot of space.

424
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

425
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,772
[SPEAKER_02]: We can dream, right?

426
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:45,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I just am really in love with the use of wood inside the building.

427
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's one of the designs.

428
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:05,658
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to kind of lay it all at the same level.

429
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:14,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this one, I think it would be an exciting opportunity to use multi-level construction builds, either for the additional, like additional renovations or for the construction.

430
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:22,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's a very interesting way to kind of consider what the vision would look like and how we can use multi-level.

431
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

432
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if the firm decided on 75% of the time.

433
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's the majority.

434
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:39,605
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a smaller consulting team locally.

435
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:50,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible that they're going to be a part of the integral project.

436
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:52,749
So I thought that was a good idea.

437
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,450
They're task-oriented.

438
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,310
You have to work with a complex group.

439
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:59,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.

440
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:07,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So during this fall, a large number of students

441
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:18,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Like us, it's a very large plot.

442
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 40 acres by 270 acres.

443
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:29,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you looked at the pictures of these various high schools, you can see the aesthetics vary quite a lot.

444
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:33,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very key will be executing the stock.

445
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Watertown is almost completed by the beginning of the spring.

446
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:52,443
[SPEAKER_02]: There are schools in that area that are open to it.

447
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:58,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's an opportunity to celebrate the high school as a large CTE program.

448
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:28,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say what I think is very advantageous about AI3 is that, as you mentioned previously, during the tour, I felt like this proposal captured a lot of what we have said in our profile, as well as what's mentioned on the tour.

449
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:37,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were very specific to call out some details about how we want to make sure we have a collaborative space for teachers and staff.

450
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:53,924
[SPEAKER_03]: how different options for how the learning environment can be staffed while maintaining some of these spaces and how they can be creative to Aaron's point about using the scope of our land.

451
00:42:54,725 --> 00:43:09,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I just felt like they were listening and really specifically targeting their examples to the specifics of it, right down to even like the community outreach and some of the local

452
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:13,834
[SPEAKER_03]: The events going to, I just, I just probably.

453
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:21,635
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you online, I'm going to give you a quick rundown of what has been said if you all can hear me.

454
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:22,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

455
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Thumbs up.

456
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:25,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

457
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:27,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here's the list that I've captured.

458
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:30,637
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done 60 projects.

459
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:33,758
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an in house CTE expert.

460
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:38,139
[SPEAKER_03]: They had creative ideas around underground parking.

461
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:45,943
[SPEAKER_03]: At a separate aquatic center, they've identified bids that are under budget, which is exciting.

462
00:43:47,764 --> 00:43:51,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Their aesthetic design appeals to more than 1 person in the room.

463
00:43:52,908 --> 00:43:57,091
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they sort of worked with our on the hill.

464
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Idea rather than trying to flatten it.

465
00:44:02,394 --> 00:44:05,776
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as the founder being directly involved in the project.

466
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hopefully less tension and more cohesion on the team.

467
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:16,548
[SPEAKER_03]: They have worked with left field before.

468
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,470
[SPEAKER_03]: The Watertown building that's set to open in the spring is a net zero building.

469
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:31,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they were very clearly listening to the tour and the kinds of things that we were talking about that were important.

470
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:33,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an expedited timeline.

471
00:44:33,634 --> 00:44:34,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And the.

472
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,666
[SPEAKER_03]: overall their, you know, clear commitment to public input.

473
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:48,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's been going on here in case you all have been having a hard time hearing us.

474
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:53,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any likes from the group on the phone that you wanted to share?

475
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a comment from Maria.

476
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:08,957
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a strong focus on integrating CTE in the classroom.

477
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:09,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Maria.

478
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:15,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny, this is Tracy.

479
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:27,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I just listed, because you may have already gone through this, but I listed four questions that I think should be asked to each consultant, and I just dropped them in the chat.

480
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:28,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

481
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:31,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I will grab those out at the end.

482
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, were there things that we saw about this presentation that were.

483
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:44,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Not advantageous or such.

484
00:45:45,128 --> 00:45:48,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Fairly diverse and diversifying and.

485
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:56,856
[SPEAKER_03]: The people on the team, I didn't see very much diversity in the group, which is always a concern to me.

486
00:45:57,617 --> 00:45:57,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously.

487
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:18,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things that were not advantageous.

488
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:46,160
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little bit personal, but I think just compared to other firms, their designs just feel a little bit leaning towards an online-free design.

489
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:52,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that was over-elevated towards, I know, not higher education, but you know, 9 through 12, as opposed to younger children.

490
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:57,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just to make a sense.

491
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

492
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:02,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Flash that out a little bit.

493
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:07,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Colors, just materials, chaos.

494
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:13,768
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get to high school level, it's just a personal opinion.

495
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes things skew a little bit too far.

496
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun and silly, and that's better for kids.

497
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Other, not advantageous.

498
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:55,564
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you on the phone, the two that came up is that the team is not very diverse in its composition, and then that the design leans towards younger children rather than towards young adults and almost adults, nearly adults, which gives me a little bit of a heart attack personally with two kids in this building now.

499
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:58,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what questions would we have for AI?

500
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:11,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question just to say, maybe the way they structure their team, but they're a person they call project manager, so they have 25% of their time available for the project.

501
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:20,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they have other people that have more, so it might just be that that person isn't doing the same manager job that someone else is, but I just wanted to be very clear about this requirement.

502
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:25,723
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's looking at 25%, that means that those tasks are being done by someone else.

503
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:28,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

504
00:48:28,244 --> 00:48:29,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?

505
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?

506
00:48:38,127 --> 00:48:54,354
[SPEAKER_04]: As I'm looking at them, so the smaller hill design compared to the other two, the amount of space in there for student learning in general, seems visually smaller than the other two suggestive designs.

507
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:59,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to understand where the space is going a little bit.

508
00:48:59,596 --> 00:49:01,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first and second design.

509
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's how it is.

510
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

511
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,498
I understand.

512
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.

513
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:07,271
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.

514
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:07,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

515
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I retract my question.

516
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:10,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have more stories, too.

517
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:40,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I do think, you know, whoever works with us,

518
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:21,440
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that this other vendor did and tell us about sort of that.

519
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a good point.

520
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they might and they might not.

521
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:38,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's, there's many reasons to rule things out on the site, like, you know, in terms of timing, landscape, ledge, and all the other things that could be going on that they just may have some

522
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:47,200
[SPEAKER_03]: There are questions for, were we talking about AI3?

523
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a question that was for everybody.

524
00:50:50,302 --> 00:51:02,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was basically, nobody in any of their thoughts thought about addressing the entry, the traffic entry, everybody just making it one driveway.

525
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:06,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that that was like a big thing that we all talked about already.

526
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like a question.

527
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:23,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a lot to take all of this in and be like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

528
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:24,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, which one am I in?

529
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:25,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?

530
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:28,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the pieces and parts were hard to keep track of.

531
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

532
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:39,354
[SPEAKER_02]: An additional positive thing was that the driveway, all of that, is incredibly long and vast.

533
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:45,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a helpful factor.

534
00:51:52,297 --> 00:52:00,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I mean, they all are being on site.

535
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:03,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so just like one way for everybody.

536
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:06,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to get into the road.

537
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:10,787
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the like, road coming.

538
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:11,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

539
00:52:13,108 --> 00:52:13,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

540
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:16,510
[SPEAKER_03]: The other questions about AI is great.

541
00:52:21,968 --> 00:52:23,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And number four, SMMA.

542
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we like?

543
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:43,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I really like that they had a call on solar and hybrid circuits.

544
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:44,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I didn't see.

545
00:52:58,138 --> 00:53:10,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like a really cohesive proposal, like all of the parts were cohesive with the other parts.

546
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:36,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the choice of agency is smart because that's what our master plan would say.

547
00:53:36,701 --> 00:53:39,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a landscape architect, but for what I want.

548
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:39,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

549
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:51,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the fact that the concepts are still real.

550
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:55,663
[SPEAKER_02]: carry a lot of weight with it.

551
00:53:55,683 --> 00:53:59,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a conversation going on.

552
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:03,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the concept of free and open responses.

553
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:07,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting things going.

554
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:10,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot to work through.

555
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Specific and generic at the same time.

556
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's information.

557
00:54:20,912 --> 00:54:36,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other side of that for someone like me, who doesn't have an architect background, an engineering, design background, I was wanting just a little bit more detail as to where this is headed.

558
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:41,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's a double-edged sword, I would say.

559
00:54:41,885 --> 00:54:49,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I think some of it is just a past experience, but you know that it does end up in theory.

560
00:54:52,068 --> 00:55:04,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long process, so this is what you have to do.

561
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:04,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Their likes.

562
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:12,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that they had a lot of disabled projects at a wide range of price points.

563
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:30,870
[SPEAKER_04]: of discovery, it's like this growing experiential learning opportunity.

564
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So the whole, again, they kind of try to incorporate different levels.

565
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:40,296
[SPEAKER_04]: The building kind of rises as you go from the main entrance, the level going to where the teacher's currently sits.

566
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole building's supposed to kind of be this movement throughout the whole.

567
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:49,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a really interesting way to kind of incorporate what we want to accomplish as educators.

568
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:55,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the,

569
00:55:59,308 --> 00:56:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: side cut view on the bottom.

570
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:09,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Because also really like just gave so much information.

571
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have flooding problems.

572
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:22,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

573
00:56:22,753 --> 00:56:23,513
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the guy.

574
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:27,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more lights?

575
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, on to things that are less advantageous.

576
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:41,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll just tell you my thought on that.

577
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:48,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to disagree with Erin, but when you look at these, this is all pretty flat.

578
00:56:48,182 --> 00:56:51,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the top floor at the very beginning is really just

579
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:08,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I've walked this place enough times to know that there's much more grain than that.

580
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what's the plan there?

581
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just knock a bunch down, build it up?

582
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:19,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm a little bit amused by how flat things actually are.

583
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:25,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big site.

584
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:33,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just counting the stories Other dislikes

585
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:12,773
Wakefield High School, which just began construction.

586
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:16,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the car detectives were inside.

587
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:27,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, I don't feel like we've let them from the top of the street down to the top of the street.

588
00:58:27,223 --> 00:58:34,688
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly, there could be negative impacts on the operation of that building.

589
00:58:37,203 --> 00:58:43,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some evidence of that actually materializing in their estimated schedule.

590
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:53,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, if you compare it with the Perkins-Willis, they're not exactly obvious, but you can tell where the design phase has evolved.

591
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:57,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just looking at that.

592
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:02,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed to be maybe six to eight months after UW.

593
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:14,497
[SPEAKER_02]: For the folks on the phone, I'll just do a quick recap so that we can make sure you're still with us.

594
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:38,738
[SPEAKER_03]: For advantages, they have done 3 CTE programs very recently.

595
00:59:39,278 --> 00:59:41,059
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got whole hog on solar.

596
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:47,020
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the largest in-house team.

597
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Their proposal was cohesive from beginning to end.

598
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have some sub consultants who were involved in Bedford's comprehensive plan, so they would have a connection to Bedford.

599
00:59:58,003 --> 00:59:59,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Their concept seemed very open-ended.

600
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:03,705
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a wide range of projects in terms of price points, so that

601
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:11,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the dislike side, so far, we have some questions about, like.

602
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:25,489
[SPEAKER_03]: that.

603
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:32,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that they are simultaneously doing Wakefield and Lexington at different phases.

604
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:38,318
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are shared resources in this proposed team that also are working on Lexington.

605
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:45,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lexington is going to be a monster of a project based on what it's a very, very large high school.

606
01:00:47,225 --> 01:00:47,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Lexington.

607
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:48,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

608
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:50,027
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

609
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:54,490
[SPEAKER_03]: They did put a visual in their proposal about

610
01:00:55,418 --> 01:01:01,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I think trying to tell us that the timing, the phasing of our project versus Lexington was different.

611
01:01:01,243 --> 01:01:03,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what this visual was trying to tell us.

612
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:09,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had some questions much like Luke about doesn't this sound like it's longer?

613
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:16,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that visual just probably needs some clarification.

614
01:01:17,516 --> 01:01:19,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything from the folks online?

615
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:24,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I see another hand.

616
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:26,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just a quick follow up.

617
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:46,512
[SPEAKER_02]: creating those big old moves, but sometimes it's harder to get all the people who are programming into those spaces, and it gets, I don't know, too much into constraints.

618
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the other projects, some of the other proposals are getting their space to each other.

619
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:56,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the way this

620
01:01:59,088 --> 01:02:00,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Other dislikes, Will?

621
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:06,211
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, one of their designs seems like a lot of work for a student.

622
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:29,715
[SPEAKER_02]: upstairs.

623
01:02:29,775 --> 01:02:31,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Respectfully.

624
01:02:31,896 --> 01:02:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: To sort of elaborate on that, it doesn't matter.

625
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a lot of time in class.

626
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:45,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably a question

627
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:09,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want us to do this.

628
01:03:10,046 --> 01:03:14,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants the five minutes.

629
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:17,331
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that is a concern.

630
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:20,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my question was going to be other questions.

631
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:46,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just wondering, is Left Field allowed to suggest questions for us, having worked with some of them or not worked with some of the others?

632
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:52,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there questions you think we should be asking, or are you allowed to say that?

633
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:57,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of the questions that are coming up are along the lines of what we typically ask.

634
01:03:58,173 --> 01:04:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: We think those vary from project to project, designer to designer.

635
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:04,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the questions seem to be varied.

636
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:08,338
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I've heard here, I think the questions that are being asked

637
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:15,902
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get a chance after this first part of the meeting.

638
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,628
[SPEAKER_03]: We're asked to open for questions.

639
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:46,706
[SPEAKER_03]: questions are going to be asked across the board.

640
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:54,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So it won't be specific to one proposal or one architect, those blank questions in relation to the project.

641
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:58,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me follow up to that.

642
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:03,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, so I know originally, please correct me, the thought was we'd get a bunch

643
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:13,683
[SPEAKER_03]: do you think that is so narrow for you to purview or exactly what that means.

644
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:14,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right, right.

645
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:21,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be the three voices on the panel.

646
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:25,434
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will decide if they want to be right, they might go for it.

647
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:29,238
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to see it all.

648
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:30,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the

649
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:41,382
[SPEAKER_05]: You have this kind of discussion.

650
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:46,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Relatively close to today, before.

651
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:01,065
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be a ranking with all of the MP numbers.

652
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:14,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, if they see there's two better run runners, and the other one starts ranking so far below, they might just pick two, or everybody has the same field ranking.

653
01:06:14,252 --> 01:06:18,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question.

654
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:30,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on page 71.

655
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the top right.

656
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:39,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's like a little pie chart.

657
01:06:57,886 --> 01:07:01,929
[SPEAKER_03]: that it takes to put into the materials.

658
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:08,334
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what this is saying, my chart, is the proposed design, body carbon is 20% less than the typical.

659
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:12,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's saying that the body carbon reduction is 20%.

660
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:13,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So bigger green is good.

661
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:16,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger green is better, yeah.

662
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:17,100
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's good.

663
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's through use of sustainable materials, like certified wood.

664
01:07:22,023 --> 01:07:24,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I was confused by the proposed design.

665
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:43,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, other questions that we would want to ask?

666
01:07:50,557 --> 01:07:51,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think.

667
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other questions that we feel like.

668
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,071
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a lot of schedule on some of it.

669
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:43,803
[SPEAKER_03]: My biggest thing that I do is about storage and places to put supplies and things of that nature.

670
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So are there any questions online about either SMMA or maybe the field overall?

671
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:23,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions you'd want to be asking everybody?

672
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:33,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

673
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm capturing them right now.

674
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a question.

675
01:09:40,694 --> 01:09:49,220
[SPEAKER_02]: But were there any of the specific things that we were wanting that they did not include?

676
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:13,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm going to miss this, but how is parking heat forecasted?

677
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:23,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything in your design that would change the parking heat?

678
01:10:23,283 --> 01:10:33,251
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was from a parking heat perspective, is that a formula or how is that determined and how does that integrate into your design?

679
01:10:34,932 --> 01:10:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that get determined on these projects?

680
01:10:40,179 --> 01:10:55,048
[SPEAKER_04]: sessions, they have desire, you know, it's not working that way, they will have a specific number of ED spots that are just a discussion.

681
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:55,328
Yeah.

682
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:20,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions for vendors?

683
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:24,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about the concepts.

684
01:11:25,303 --> 01:11:31,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Which concepts would absolutely require plastic?

685
01:11:50,383 --> 01:11:52,825
[SPEAKER_01]: My bones rattle twice a day, every day for months.

686
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:53,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

687
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:53,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?

688
01:11:53,906 --> 01:11:54,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready?

689
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:26,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, energy code.

690
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:30,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been something I'll make sure their energy is clear and they're ready for it.

691
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So, or if they need an extra consultant to help them navigate that.

692
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:36,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty ambitious.

693
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:39,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's about it.

694
01:12:39,945 --> 01:12:40,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

695
01:12:40,665 --> 01:12:50,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

696
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:05,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the 1st designer selection panel meeting is next week, Thursday.

697
01:13:05,184 --> 01:13:12,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will know once the meeting is over what our finalists are.

698
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

699
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:13,706
Okay.

700
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:19,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we will let you all know.

701
01:13:19,147 --> 01:13:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: What the outcome of that meeting is so that you're aware of what's coming next.

702
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:35,543
[SPEAKER_03]: 6, we will interview and then we will know during that meeting.

703
01:13:35,924 --> 01:13:36,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

704
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:37,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

705
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:56,270
[SPEAKER_03]: You do, probably.

706
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:05,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We can collect a list if there's anybody who would like to participate because they usually ask us in advance.

707
01:14:07,534 --> 01:14:08,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll send out an email.

708
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:13,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have one thing.

709
01:14:13,836 --> 01:14:13,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

710
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that we had originally scheduled a meeting.

711
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:51,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think you necessarily need to be on 24, but I wanted to just let everybody know that there was a slight schedule change in the MSBA, so that would be on 24.

712
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:10,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to schedule that or just wait until the October meeting, which I think is quite late in the month, so maybe we can get that up.

713
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,543
[SPEAKER_05]: But just wanted to kind of see what people saw.

714
01:15:15,664 --> 01:15:20,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we see if we can move that up to the October 7th meeting.

715
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the 27th.

716
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:23,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty late.

717
01:15:24,012 --> 01:15:25,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see if we can get that up.

718
01:15:45,152 --> 01:15:47,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

719
01:15:49,773 --> 01:15:51,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I move.

720
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:57,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will call the roll.

721
01:15:57,256 --> 01:15:57,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenny Graham?

722
01:15:57,876 --> 01:15:58,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

723
01:15:58,676 --> 01:15:59,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Lundo Kern?

724
01:15:59,516 --> 01:15:59,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

725
01:16:00,397 --> 01:16:01,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Guzzi?

726
01:16:01,117 --> 01:16:01,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

727
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:02,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Marta Cabral?

728
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:02,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

729
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:04,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Libby Brown?

730
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:05,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

731
01:16:05,121 --> 01:16:05,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

732
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:05,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

733
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:05,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

734
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:05,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

735
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
