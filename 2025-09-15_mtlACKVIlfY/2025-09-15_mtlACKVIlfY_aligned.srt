00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:07,194
Thank you all for being here tonight.

45
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:14,438
We have some preliminary business to take care of and then the vast majority of the discussion

46
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:29,588
But before we do that, the next thing on the agenda is the approval of the August 11th school building committee meeting minutes.

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,729

Nicole Morrell, absent.

70
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:06,005

12 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two

79
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:27,730
Extension to ask.

80
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:29,953
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

81
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:34,298
11 in the affirmative 0, the negative 2 extension to absent.

82
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:37,301
It's a lost track.

83
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,442
Okay, I remember 3.

84
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:47,759
We actually are welcoming 2 new members to the building committee.

85
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:54,703
So, as you all know, Dr. Cushing has taken a job in Beverly as the superintendent of schools there.

86
00:04:54,723 --> 00:05:03,487
He was a voting member of the committee and he has been replaced by Ken Lord, who has joined MedBird as the chief operating officer.

87
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:07,529
And Dr. Kim Talbot has also joined the team.

88
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:08,790
She is our

89
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:22,909
introduce yourselves at all, and kind of have like wheels of experience in this space.

90
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,809
So it might be nice for everyone to hear.

91
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:26,510
Sure.

92
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,291
So this is a little deja vu.

93
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,151
So it's been really interesting for me.

94
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:36,211
I'm excited to participate in this project.

95
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:43,373
I've been involved in technology for over 30 years.

96
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:03,376
Welcome both of you.

97
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:07,819
If there's anything that happens along the way and you're like, what are you all talking about?

98
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,022
Please feel free to stop us and ask because we're happy to answer.

99
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:17,146
So welcome and if there's things you need, just let me know.

100
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:22,910
I'll figure out how to get you what you need about anything that's happened so far.

101
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,132
Tracy, can you hear me okay?

102
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:42,438
I can hear jenny okay, but I could not hear can and doctor Talbot at all.

103
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,962
So, everyone just use your teacher voice and let's see how it goes Tracy just keep us.

104
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,384
Posted if you are having a hard time hearing.

105
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:57,505
Okay, we'll do Thank you.

106
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,808
Item number 4 is approval of the August 2025 voice.

107
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,194
So I'm going to turn that over to Matt.

108
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:11,062
You would like to walk us through what's here?

109
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:15,490
Yeah, so this is just our third invoice.

110
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,264
of our OPM services for the month of August.

111
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,848
It's our agreed compound sum of $25,000.

112
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:33,594
We don't have any additional sub consultants or other reimbursement costs at this point.

113
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,376
It's very straightforward.

114
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,021
Any questions for Ken?

115
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,306
Hi, is there a motion to approve the invoice?

116
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:51,805
Motion to approve by Ken, seconded by Luke.

117
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,206
I will call the roll.

118
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,086
Jenny Graham?

119
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:57,546
Yes.

120
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,686
Mayor Longo Kern?

121
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,026
Yes.

122
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,487
Dr. Galussi?

123
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:00,847
Yes.

124
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:01,907
Marta Cabral?

125
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:11,149
We're absent for now.

126
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:12,529
Libby Brown?

127
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,849
Yes.

128
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:14,590
Marissa Desmond?

129
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,010
Yes.

130
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,050
Maria Dorsey?

131
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,150
Thank you.

132
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:23,312
Brian Hilliard.

133
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:23,652
Yes.

134
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:24,713
Tracy Keene.

135
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:25,574
Yes.

136
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,116
Emily Lazaro.

137
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:28,756
Yes.

138
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,018
Nicole Morrell.

139
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:32,539
Still on her way.

140
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,302
Aaron Olopade.

141
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:36,722
Yes.

142
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:37,823
Luke Pricer.

143
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:38,303
Yes.

144
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,284
Joan Bowen.

145
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:39,684
Yes.

146
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:40,585
Ken Lord.

147
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:41,025
Yes.

148
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:47,430
So that is 13 in the affirmative, two absent.

149
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,371
Motion passes.

150
00:08:52,552 --> 00:09:01,054
Okay, so we're going to move on to the meat of the meeting and hopefully it will be a meeting by the time we're done here.

151
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:16,356
As you all know, we got 4 proposals from designers and the goal for tonight is for myself, for the mayor and for Dr. Pelosi to really hear from all of you about your impressions.

152
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:18,157
We are not ranking.

153
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:19,557
We cannot rank.

154
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,730
that.

155
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:39,226
All of these four folks are watching us either now or in the future and the MSBA is really explicit about not wanting us to be talking in terms of ranking favorites etc.

156
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:45,812
So what we tried to do was give you all a set of questions to think about

157
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:57,691
What I would like for us to just go 1 proposal at a time and go through these questions.

158
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,973
I think we're really interested in hearing from all of you.

159
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:05,095
We are sensitive to the fact that we are 3 of 13 votes.

160
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:10,257
So we have our work cut out for us when we go to designer selection next week.

161
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:12,158
However.

162
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:17,901
You know, there's a lot of collective experience at this table and we want to hear from.

163
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:25,716
From all of you from from your lenses, from your impressions of the proposals that were shared and that will help us.

164
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:31,318
Get ready for that for that meeting and there's 2 meetings.

165
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:31,759
1 is.

166
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,081
Where we will talk about all of the proposals and then the 2nd meeting where there will be.

167
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:56,153
So, the questions that we did want to talk about with all of you, and I'm thinking to just take them one at a time so that we give everybody equal shape.

168
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,766
What did you like about the proposal compared to others?

169
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,526
What stuck out as advantageous?

170
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,907
What did you dislike about a particular proposal as compared to others?

171
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,228
What did you view as being less than advantageous?

172
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:15,809
And then what questions would you have for this applicant about their proposal?

173
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,069
So those are the three questions.

174
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:21,210
We can maybe just start.

175
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,631
Does anyone have a proposal they want to start with that they feel very strongly about, Luke?

176
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:33,289
Okay, hold on, hold on.

177
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,614
We're going to do one question at a time so that everybody can stick with us.

178
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:38,014
Okay.

179
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,917
So let's everyone has DLR's proposal.

180
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:41,858
Okay.

181
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:47,104
So this proposal is from DLR in collaboration

182
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,085
And then, Will, can you keep track of who is raising their hand online?

183
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:09,147
It's a little hard for us to see.

184
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:11,389
I'll leave the questions up.

185
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,631
Okay.

186
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,334
What did we like about this?

187
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:29,149
Letty, I like that they have experience working together.

188
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,191
I recently had a large project that took it.

189
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,234
And I think that Letty shows really strong design skills.

190
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:42,279
So I think that's an example of a successful team.

191
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Great.

192
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:47,783
Any else?

193
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:50,284
Paul?

194
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:55,088
I like that they were pretty explicit in their

195
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:58,913
Any questions online?

196
00:12:59,173 --> 00:12:59,413
Well,

197
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,729
Okay.

198
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,751
What did you dislike about the DLR proposal as compared to others?

199
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:32,514
Or what did you view as being less advantageous or less than advantageous?

200
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:33,314
Yep.

201
00:13:55,664 --> 00:14:01,188
I'm trying to continue to speak to that.

202
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:08,474
Their experience is spread across the country, and also even to the U.S.

203
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:13,598
territories, which I felt was less advantageous.

204
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:18,122
I also

205
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:30,007
What's the advantage of playing your team?

206
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:35,930
It's not very high.

207
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,197
I've seen that people are having a hard time hearing us.

208
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:19,527
So Emily, so far, the comments in the less advantageous category are that this group has light on experience with MSBA, that they seem to have a relatively large headcount.

209
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:26,930
And that there are two firms in the mix with which to coordinate about the design.

210
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,751
That's what we've covered so far.

211
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:31,654
Just for those of you trying to listen here.

212
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:32,875
Sure.

213
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:33,056
Yeah.

214
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:46,502
speak loudly for the crowd.

215
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,944
I meant to speak up earlier, but then I got distracted looking at the paper.

216
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:57,107
But I actually think the fact that it's two firms is actually something that could be seen as advantageous.

217
00:15:57,147 --> 00:16:08,533
You have a lot of different voices, and you get to take the expertise of each of those firms and leave behind the things that the firms aren't as good at.

218
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:12,955
So I think looking at them as one entity, it's not on us to figure out

219
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:20,193
There's going to like, who's going to be in charge of this part of design?

220
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,254
Who's going to be in charge of that part of the design?

221
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:33,838
Having worked on both sides of projects where I've been either the architect of record or the design architect, all of this would be hammered out between two firms in advance.

222
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,639
Skipping ahead a little bit.

223
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:43,266
Like, how are they going to handle these things?

224
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:56,496
You know, they have extensive experience working together already, which leads me to believe that they already have this process in their minds of how they're going to handle it.

225
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:08,406
And so I think it is actually very advantageous to take a firm that's really rooted in kind of the programming and analysis and then a firm that's really rooted in

226
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:13,877
really good design and bringing them together to create one super team.

227
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:17,680
Thanks, Marissa.

228
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,663
Will, is there anybody online who's got their hand up?

229
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:25,286
All the members of the, oh, oh.

230
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,568
Maria Dorsey.

231
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,530
Maria?

232
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,030
Hi.

233
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:39,177
From an educational angle, I had the feeling that this group, their focus was more on

234
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:44,009
CTE than on the classrooms, as opposed to the other groups.

235
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:53,575
A lot of them, the others were either on equal footing or had a strong sense of what the needs of the classroom are with CTE combined.

236
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:59,518
This one, I felt that they were, they had a leaning, more leaning towards the shops.

237
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,000
So that was just my impression on what I read.

238
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,642
Thanks, Maria.

239
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:08,003
Is anybody else online?

240
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,360
Anybody else?

241
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:16,920
Brian?

242
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:27,326
I think one of the things I feel is a little bit advantageous is that there are candidates that maybe we want to get this done.

243
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:37,652
So a little bit of a problem there that we don't know how it turned out and how that can manifest itself.

244
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:43,115
So for those of you online, the comment was that they're like sort of

245
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:49,506
prime example for us is still a work in progress, and it's not yet complete.

246
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,088
So we don't know how it turned out.

247
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,028
Luke?

248
00:18:53,048 --> 00:19:00,832
When I looked at all the consultants, I didn't find a library consultant.

249
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,674
I didn't find a lab consultant.

250
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:08,957
I didn't find a landscape consultant.

251
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,090
Is that typical, Matt and Jen?

252
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,794
Can you talk a little bit about what is typical in terms of like how teams get put together?

253
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:40,378
So they need to provide consultants that are listed up in the RFS.

254
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:45,061
We have a very specific set of consultants that we're expecting to see.

255
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,808
or not a pool consultant is required or not.

256
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:58,149
It's not something that the asset was required.

257
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,389
They can certainly include one.

258
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:09,451
So I can think of maybe one where the parent pool consultant and the resident pool consultant have.

259
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:20,234
So that's typically, and I can pull up the sub-consultant spreadsheet of where I found everybody just to make sure that they get involved.

260
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:21,776
I don't think they did.

261
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:26,258
Some of them are maybe a little hard to find because of some of the names.

262
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:32,380
But I'll take a look and see what it would be.

263
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,822
Sometimes they have in-house experience, so they look to themselves for those categories.

264
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,543
Sometimes that makes it a little less clear.

265
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:45,152
example.

266
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:45,712
So every question.

267
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:50,894
So it sounds like the teams will not necessarily look at because of how they come together.

268
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,315
Other not advantageous things.

269
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:17,683
Right.

270
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:22,125
Also, a lot of the projects that they're looking at.

271
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:22,666
Questions?

272
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:58,213
So just so you know, this is the spreadsheet that required to fill up the MSBA.

273
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:01,435
This is all of their consultants, all of the board members.

274
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,377
So you can see them here.

275
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,960
So yeah, they did have structural landscaping.

276
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,642
They did have the CT consultants.

277
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:19,569
I did have a question.

278
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:26,132
Or maybe for for Lucy and her team.

279
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:26,632
I feel like.

280
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:29,413
What I hear about vocational is that.

281
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:55,847
What we think of as vocational in Massachusetts is quite different than what vocational looks like in other places in the country.

282
00:22:55,867 --> 00:23:00,035
Can you respond to that from a programming perspective?

283
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:16,630
Yes, and I think that we're in a unique situation where we are a comprehensive high school.

284
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:40,155
We're not a single vocational school, so all of our programs are Chapter 74, which means that there are requirements and regulations pertaining to content that we provide our students, the number of hours that they have in shop, as well as their academics, and then the number of hours that they are doing in the industry fields, whatever that may be, particular to the shop.

285
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:50,522
And I know that we are to expand our programming and that some of the vocational programming standards have recently been increased.

286
00:23:52,022 --> 00:24:08,145
A lot of what I would just say that like from the lens of me reviewing a lot of these proposals would be like looking at that experience that a firm does have with the CTE programming.

287
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:31,996
that is aligned and parallel to Medford, not a standalone CTE school, but one that's comprehensive, that at this time has full Chapter 74 shops, and one sort of space that is unique and brings with it a lot of flexibility.

288
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:34,376
Do you need more detail?

289
00:24:34,496 --> 00:24:35,917
No, I'm good, thank you.

290
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:36,717
I just wanted to

291
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,421
not being in that world understand.

292
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:43,203
Is it the same everywhere or is it different?

293
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:44,464
So thank you.

294
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:55,013
I also would say that maybe also for me, I do not have a lot of MSBA experience coming into this project.

295
00:24:55,073 --> 00:25:06,322
So I think for someone like me reading these proposals, I found it very difficult to get a true understanding from the visuals.

296
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:17,685
on the clarity of the image, the detail or lack of detail.

297
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:26,534
It was really hard for me to get a true understanding as to what the vision was for the proposals.

298
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:47,114
Okay.

299
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:11,362
Questions?

300
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:11,682
Libby?

301
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:17,243
I think I'd ask just how frequently do they expect to be physically present in Boston for those who are not local?

302
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:20,704
So are they flying in or doing remote meetings?

303
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:22,405
Just how often are they here in person?

304
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:31,167
That's right, this was the team that was not terribly local, is that right?

305
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:32,087
Yeah, Libby's local.

306
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:36,168
DLR has some of them are local in Boston, but some are not.

307
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:41,600
What other questions would we have for DLR?

308
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,980
Okay.

309
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:50,287
Any last?

310
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:50,547
Brian?

311
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:26,768
So for those of you at home wanting some more information on their cluster design concept.

312
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,712
Other questions for DLR?

313
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:47,057
I'm going to talk about Perkinsville next.

314
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,166
What did we like about Perkinsville?

315
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:08,048
Luke?

316
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:27,859
I like that they included a estimated

317
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:52,974
I like that they try to

318
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:28,278
of central space in between the addition renovating space today, the first kind of slideshow, trying to incorporate the idea that this is an opportunity for the community to be involved.

319
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,920
That's as well as outdoor learning spaces.

320
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:38,404
We're learning a lot now that there's a huge benefit to having that available space for students and teachers to kind of get outside the classroom from time to time.

321
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:47,489
So to be able to incorporate that and have that be used as a shared space with the community.

322
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:48,110
Other likes?

323
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:48,650
Paul?

324
00:29:50,937 --> 00:30:11,468
Overall, I think the students are very clear, the graphics are very clear, and this gives me hope for and faith for our team, for how we move forward as a student community.

325
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:14,690
And I just think that there's some very clarity in the fact that

326
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,715
they actually are going to be able to work on our project of splitting wood in Salem.

327
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:25,998
And so some of the work I think is done both, but the team doing the work in the database is our project.

328
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:32,823
Thanks, Lori.

329
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:38,288
I also like the idea that we take into account interdisciplinary learning.

330
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,769
That's not just CTE, but

331
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:06,757
So, for those of you online so far, we, we've heard.

332
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:12,559
The likes include experience working with left field that Salem high school.

333
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:18,540
Is ongoing and ahead of us that they took a stab at a timeline.

334
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,691
That they're prioritizing community space, outdoor learning, geothermal.

335
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,893
Messaging was quite clear.

336
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:35,898
They are not splitting their team with other projects like Salem and they are focused on interdisciplinary learning.

337
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:39,140
Just so that you, in case you all were having a hard time hearing.

338
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:46,024
Also.

339
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:47,765
Full consultants.

340
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:06,203
Yeah, when when we were we were doing the tour, there were lots of questions about those kinds of things.

341
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:10,630
And we really tried to paint a picture for everybody who is here that

342
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:14,604
There are some interesting spaces in this building that.

343
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:20,047
We should be looking at to say, is this worth preserving or.

344
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:28,152
Is it not for some reason, but that that was 1 of the spaces we talked about wanting explicitly to be able to evaluate.

345
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:32,755
Does it stay does it goes what happens.

346
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:36,237
That also included the gym because it's quite big.

347
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:50,165
Well, in terms of how they were trying to serve.

348
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,627
Hey, what was less advantageous.

349
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,470
Answer that question.

350
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,471
Okay.

351
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:24,352
Things that seem.

352
00:33:51,562 --> 00:34:00,947
There aren't a lot of seats.

353
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:09,911
And their team also didn't seem to have lots of vocational experience.

354
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:12,753
Am I remembering that correctly?

355
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:29,960
Oh, sorry.

356
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,220
I'm so sorry.

357
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,820
I'm so sorry.

358
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,120
I'm so sorry.

359
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,721
I'm so sorry.

360
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,001
I'm so sorry.

361
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:32,361
I'm so sorry.

362
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:32,701
I'm so sorry.

363
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,021
I'm so sorry.

364
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:33,341
I'm so sorry.

365
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:33,601
I'm so sorry.

366
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:33,941
I'm so sorry.

367
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:34,202
I'm so sorry.

368
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:34,522
I'm so sorry.

369
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:34,942
I'm so sorry.

370
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:35,282
I'm so sorry.

371
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:35,542
I'm so sorry.

372
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:35,802
I'm so sorry.

373
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:36,182
I'm so sorry.

374
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:36,442
I'm so sorry.

375
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:36,702
I'm so sorry.

376
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:36,962
I'm so sorry.

377
00:34:36,982 --> 00:34:37,323
I'm so sorry.

378
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:37,583
I'm so sorry.

379
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:37,863
I'm so sorry.

380
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:38,563
I'm so sorry.

381
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:38,823
I'm so sorry.

382
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:39,103
I'm so sorry.

383
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:39,363
I'm so sorry.

384
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,764
I'm so sorry.

385
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:41,364
I'm so sorry.

386
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:41,864
I'm so sorry.

387
00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:42,164
I'm so sorry.

388
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:42,524
I'm so sorry.

389
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:42,785
I'm so sorry.

390
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:47,586
I'm so sorry.

391
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:48,206
I'm so sorry.

392
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:48,466
I'm so sorry.

393
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:48,867
I'm so sorry.

394
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,007
I'm so sorry.

395
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:51,327
I'm so sorry.

396
00:34:51,347 --> 00:34:51,608
I'm so sorry.

397
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:51,888
I'm so sorry.

398
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:52,208
I'm so sorry.

399
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:52,548
I'm so sorry.

400
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:36,131
I mean, not the same things, obviously, but like the same, just like not the same stuff that you don't necessarily need in a regular classroom, like that type of experience.

401
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:43,835
This one, their experience spans beyond public schools and beyond high schools.

402
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:47,657
And while it might, I have a similar question to you,

403
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:01,413
strictly educational spaces.

404
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:18,737
To me, I would be very curious to see how does that experience match up to what we need here in Medford with a very unique site and the possibilities of being able to do something

405
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,252
Other things we thought were less advantageous.

406
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:51,002
Okay, what questions do you have for this firm?

407
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:57,065
Share questions for all of us.

408
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:18,566
renovating Jibsville, CTE, or anything else for that matter, to all the ones that experience some sort of solar, whether that's solar, public parking lot, buildings, to the components of whatever project we choose.

409
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:22,147
Other questions?

410
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:36,088
Um, they, in their, in kind of all their designs, they don't clarify what their expectations are.

411
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:49,779
I know that they kind of discuss interdisciplinarity, collaboration, CT, pre-K, innovation sections on what design plans, but they don't actually clarify if they want that to be built in an adjacent building, in the building, what their thinking is with that.

412
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:57,605
So it's like, it's a clarity on what their vision would be and how that kind of plays into what we're looking for, which is probably the best prospective program.

413
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,606
So they clarify everything else.

414
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:04,797
Other questions?

415
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:15,181
Okay.

416
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,082
Two down, two to go.

417
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,563
I'm going to do AI3 next.

418
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:24,184
Happens to be one right in front of me.

419
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:39,131
OK, what did we find advantageous about AI3?

420
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:40,491
Ken?

421
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:46,973
If I count it correctly, it sounded like it had six CTE schools in the last 12 years, having in-house CTE experts.

422
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:50,994
Great.

423
00:38:51,554 --> 00:39:01,638
I'd also like to throw in part of the idea that it's taking up a lot of space.

424
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:01,998
I did.

425
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,772
We can dream, right?

426
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:45,378
I just am really in love with the use of wood inside the building.

427
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,336
So I think that's one of the designs.

428
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:05,658
We're trying to kind of lay it all at the same level.

429
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:14,584
But I think this one, I think it would be an exciting opportunity to use multi-level construction builds, either for the additional, like additional renovations or for the construction.

430
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:22,249
So I think it's a very interesting way to kind of consider what the vision would look like and how we can use multi-level.

431
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,930
I don't know.

432
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,132
I don't know if the firm decided on 75% of the time.

433
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,494
I'm sure it's the majority.

434
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:39,605
to be a smaller consulting team locally.

435
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:50,388
It's possible that they're going to be a part of the integral project.

436
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:52,749
So I thought that was a good idea.

437
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,450
They're task-oriented.

438
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,310
You have to work with a complex group.

439
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:59,572
It's important.

440
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:07,568
So during this fall, a large number of students

441
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:18,898
Like us, it's a very large plot.

442
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,459
It's 40 acres by 270 acres.

443
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:29,586
And if you looked at the pictures of these various high schools, you can see the aesthetics vary quite a lot.

444
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:33,088
So the very key will be executing the stock.

445
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,922
Watertown is almost completed by the beginning of the spring.

446
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:52,443
There are schools in that area that are open to it.

447
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:58,745
I'm sure it's an opportunity to celebrate the high school as a large CTE program.

448
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:28,413
I would say what I think is very advantageous about AI3 is that, as you mentioned previously, during the tour, I felt like this proposal captured a lot of what we have said in our profile, as well as what's mentioned on the tour.

449
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:37,816
So they were very specific to call out some details about how we want to make sure we have a collaborative space for teachers and staff.

450
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:53,924
how different options for how the learning environment can be staffed while maintaining some of these spaces and how they can be creative to Aaron's point about using the scope of our land.

451
00:42:54,725 --> 00:43:09,208
I just felt like they were listening and really specifically targeting their examples to the specifics of it, right down to even like the community outreach and some of the local

452
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:13,834
The events going to, I just, I just probably.

453
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:21,635
For those of you online, I'm going to give you a quick rundown of what has been said if you all can hear me.

454
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:22,116
Okay.

455
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:23,116
Thumbs up.

456
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:25,356
Okay.

457
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:27,937
So, here's the list that I've captured.

458
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:30,637
They've done 60 projects.

459
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:33,758
They have an in house CTE expert.

460
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:38,139
They had creative ideas around underground parking.

461
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:45,943
At a separate aquatic center, they've identified bids that are under budget, which is exciting.

462
00:43:47,764 --> 00:43:51,447
Their aesthetic design appeals to more than 1 person in the room.

463
00:43:52,908 --> 00:43:57,091
They, they sort of worked with our on the hill.

464
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,713
Idea rather than trying to flatten it.

465
00:44:02,394 --> 00:44:05,776
As well as the founder being directly involved in the project.

466
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:14,207
So, hopefully less tension and more cohesion on the team.

467
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:16,548
They have worked with left field before.

468
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,470
The Watertown building that's set to open in the spring is a net zero building.

469
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:31,393
And that they were very clearly listening to the tour and the kinds of things that we were talking about that were important.

470
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:33,574
Like an expedited timeline.

471
00:44:33,634 --> 00:44:34,094
And the.

472
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,666
overall their, you know, clear commitment to public input.

473
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:48,752
So that's what's been going on here in case you all have been having a hard time hearing us.

474
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:53,658
Are there any likes from the group on the phone that you wanted to share?

475
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,656
I see a comment from Maria.

476
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:08,957
They have a strong focus on integrating CTE in the classroom.

477
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:09,577
Thanks, Maria.

478
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:15,539
Jenny, this is Tracy.

479
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:27,324
I just listed, because you may have already gone through this, but I listed four questions that I think should be asked to each consultant, and I just dropped them in the chat.

480
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:28,704
Okay, great.

481
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:31,125
I will grab those out at the end.

482
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,783
Um, were there things that we saw about this presentation that were.

483
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:44,868
Not advantageous or such.

484
00:45:45,128 --> 00:45:48,551
Fairly diverse and diversifying and.

485
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:56,856
The people on the team, I didn't see very much diversity in the group, which is always a concern to me.

486
00:45:57,617 --> 00:45:57,977
Obviously.

487
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:18,812
Other things that were not advantageous.

488
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:46,160
This is a little bit personal, but I think just compared to other firms, their designs just feel a little bit leaning towards an online-free design.

489
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:52,841
I think it's something that was over-elevated towards, I know, not higher education, but you know, 9 through 12, as opposed to younger children.

490
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:57,822
So that was just to make a sense.

491
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,042
Thank you.

492
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:02,383
Flash that out a little bit.

493
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:07,587
Colors, just materials, chaos.

494
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:13,768
When you get to high school level, it's just a personal opinion.

495
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,649
And sometimes things skew a little bit too far.

496
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,950
Fun and silly, and that's better for kids.

497
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:29,412
Other, not advantageous.

498
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:55,564
For those of you on the phone, the two that came up is that the team is not very diverse in its composition, and then that the design leans towards younger children rather than towards young adults and almost adults, nearly adults, which gives me a little bit of a heart attack personally with two kids in this building now.

499
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:58,226
Okay, what questions would we have for AI?

500
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:11,978
I have a question just to say, maybe the way they structure their team, but they're a person they call project manager, so they have 25% of their time available for the project.

501
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:20,521
Now they have other people that have more, so it might just be that that person isn't doing the same manager job that someone else is, but I just wanted to be very clear about this requirement.

502
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:25,723
If someone's looking at 25%, that means that those tasks are being done by someone else.

503
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:28,224
Okay.

504
00:48:28,244 --> 00:48:29,385
Other questions?

505
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,027
Any other questions?

506
00:48:38,127 --> 00:48:54,354
As I'm looking at them, so the smaller hill design compared to the other two, the amount of space in there for student learning in general, seems visually smaller than the other two suggestive designs.

507
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:59,156
So I'm trying to understand where the space is going a little bit.

508
00:48:59,596 --> 00:49:01,357
It's the first and second design.

509
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,678
Oh, it's how it is.

510
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:02,818
OK.

511
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,498
I understand.

512
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,831
Thank you, guys.

513
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:07,271
OK, cool.

514
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:07,551
Thank you.

515
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,592
I retract my question.

516
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:10,173
Yeah, they have more stories, too.

517
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:40,454
Yeah, and I do think, you know, whoever works with us,

518
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:21,440
thing that this other vendor did and tell us about sort of that.

519
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,641
So I think that's a good point.

520
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,942
Yeah, they might and they might not.

521
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:38,790
I mean, there's, there's many reasons to rule things out on the site, like, you know, in terms of timing, landscape, ledge, and all the other things that could be going on that they just may have some

522
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:47,200
There are questions for, were we talking about AI3?

523
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,102
I had a question that was for everybody.

524
00:50:50,302 --> 00:51:02,551
And it was basically, nobody in any of their thoughts thought about addressing the entry, the traffic entry, everybody just making it one driveway.

525
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:06,373
I know that that was like a big thing that we all talked about already.

526
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:08,575
So I'd like a question.

527
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:23,688
It was like a lot to take all of this in and be like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

528
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:24,989
Now, which one am I in?

529
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:25,709
Where is it?

530
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:28,490
And all the pieces and parts were hard to keep track of.

531
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,290
So.

532
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:39,354
An additional positive thing was that the driveway, all of that, is incredibly long and vast.

533
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:45,197
I think that's a helpful factor.

534
00:51:52,297 --> 00:52:00,521
Yeah, yeah, I mean, they all are being on site.

535
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:03,603
Oh, so just like one way for everybody.

536
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:06,745
Everybody wants to get into the road.

537
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:10,787
But I think the like, road coming.

538
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:11,887
Yeah.

539
00:52:13,108 --> 00:52:13,368
Right.

540
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:16,510
The other questions about AI is great.

541
00:52:21,968 --> 00:52:23,449
And number four, SMMA.

542
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:28,571
What did we like?

543
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:43,058
Well, I really like that they had a call on solar and hybrid circuits.

544
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:44,919
Which I didn't see.

545
00:52:58,138 --> 00:53:10,349
It felt like a really cohesive proposal, like all of the parts were cohesive with the other parts.

546
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:36,601
I hope the choice of agency is smart because that's what our master plan would say.

547
00:53:36,701 --> 00:53:39,562
It's a landscape architect, but for what I want.

548
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:39,923
Right.

549
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:51,508
I appreciate the fact that the concepts are still real.

550
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:55,663
carry a lot of weight with it.

551
00:53:55,683 --> 00:53:59,304
So it's just a conversation going on.

552
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:03,265
I like the concept of free and open responses.

553
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:07,066
It's getting things going.

554
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:10,588
It's a lot to work through.

555
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,949
Specific and generic at the same time.

556
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,830
It's information.

557
00:54:20,912 --> 00:54:36,862
I think the other side of that for someone like me, who doesn't have an architect background, an engineering, design background, I was wanting just a little bit more detail as to where this is headed.

558
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:41,505
So I guess that's a double-edged sword, I would say.

559
00:54:41,885 --> 00:54:49,090
Honestly, I think some of it is just a past experience, but you know that it does end up in theory.

560
00:54:52,068 --> 00:55:04,273
It's a long process, so this is what you have to do.

561
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:04,694
Their likes.

562
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:12,117
I like that they had a lot of disabled projects at a wide range of price points.

563
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:30,870
of discovery, it's like this growing experiential learning opportunity.

564
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,831
So the whole, again, they kind of try to incorporate different levels.

565
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:40,296
The building kind of rises as you go from the main entrance, the level going to where the teacher's currently sits.

566
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,998
And the whole building's supposed to kind of be this movement throughout the whole.

567
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:49,261
I think it's a really interesting way to kind of incorporate what we want to accomplish as educators.

568
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:55,865
I really like the,

569
00:55:59,308 --> 00:56:02,569
side cut view on the bottom.

570
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:09,990
Because also really like just gave so much information.

571
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,971
You know, we have flooding problems.

572
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:22,353
Thank you.

573
00:56:22,753 --> 00:56:23,513
You know, the guy.

574
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:27,214
Any more lights?

575
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:36,738
Okay, on to things that are less advantageous.

576
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:41,760
Well, I'll just tell you my thought on that.

577
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:48,062
Not to disagree with Erin, but when you look at these, this is all pretty flat.

578
00:56:48,182 --> 00:56:51,443
Like the top floor at the very beginning is really just

579
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:08,499
I've walked this place enough times to know that there's much more grain than that.

580
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:11,060
So, what's the plan there?

581
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,461
Is it just knock a bunch down, build it up?

582
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:19,802
So, I'm a little bit amused by how flat things actually are.

583
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:25,324
It's a big site.

584
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:33,366
But I'm just counting the stories Other dislikes

585
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:12,773
Wakefield High School, which just began construction.

586
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:16,836
And then the car detectives were inside.

587
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:27,043
Certainly, I don't feel like we've let them from the top of the street down to the top of the street.

588
00:58:27,223 --> 00:58:34,688
But certainly, there could be negative impacts on the operation of that building.

589
00:58:37,203 --> 00:58:43,604
I saw some evidence of that actually materializing in their estimated schedule.

590
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:53,166
Certainly, if you compare it with the Perkins-Willis, they're not exactly obvious, but you can tell where the design phase has evolved.

591
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:57,307
So I was just looking at that.

592
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:02,028
And it seemed to be maybe six to eight months after UW.

593
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:14,497
For the folks on the phone, I'll just do a quick recap so that we can make sure you're still with us.

594
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:38,738
For advantages, they have done 3 CTE programs very recently.

595
00:59:39,278 --> 00:59:41,059
They've got whole hog on solar.

596
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:47,020
They have the largest in-house team.

597
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,961
Their proposal was cohesive from beginning to end.

598
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:56,843
They do have some sub consultants who were involved in Bedford's comprehensive plan, so they would have a connection to Bedford.

599
00:59:58,003 --> 00:59:59,704
Their concept seemed very open-ended.

600
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:03,705
They had a wide range of projects in terms of price points, so that

601
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:11,559
And then on the dislike side, so far, we have some questions about, like.

602
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:25,489
that.

603
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:32,494
And then that they are simultaneously doing Wakefield and Lexington at different phases.

604
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:38,318
But there are shared resources in this proposed team that also are working on Lexington.

605
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:45,003
And Lexington is going to be a monster of a project based on what it's a very, very large high school.

606
01:00:47,225 --> 01:00:47,725
Lexington.

607
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:48,766
Yes, they do.

608
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:50,027
They did.

609
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:54,490
They did put a visual in their proposal about

610
01:00:55,418 --> 01:01:01,223
I think trying to tell us that the timing, the phasing of our project versus Lexington was different.

611
01:01:01,243 --> 01:01:03,565
I think that's what this visual was trying to tell us.

612
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:09,370
I actually had some questions much like Luke about doesn't this sound like it's longer?

613
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:16,335
So I think that visual just probably needs some clarification.

614
01:01:17,516 --> 01:01:19,158
Anything from the folks online?

615
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:24,282
I see another hand.

616
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:26,883
Yeah, just a quick follow up.

617
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:46,512
creating those big old moves, but sometimes it's harder to get all the people who are programming into those spaces, and it gets, I don't know, too much into constraints.

618
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:54,879
And some of the other projects, some of the other proposals are getting their space to each other.

619
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:56,500
And if you look at the way this

620
01:01:59,088 --> 01:02:00,829
Other dislikes, Will?

621
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:06,211
To me, one of their designs seems like a lot of work for a student.

622
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:29,715
upstairs.

623
01:02:29,775 --> 01:02:31,856
Respectfully.

624
01:02:31,896 --> 01:02:39,840
To sort of elaborate on that, it doesn't matter.

625
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,001
We don't have a lot of time in class.

626
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:45,963
So this is probably a question

627
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:09,866
I don't want us to do this.

628
01:03:10,046 --> 01:03:14,809
Nobody wants the five minutes.

629
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:17,331
But so that is a concern.

630
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:20,412
And then my question was going to be other questions.

631
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:46,667
So I'm just wondering, is Left Field allowed to suggest questions for us, having worked with some of them or not worked with some of the others?

632
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:52,970
Are there questions you think we should be asking, or are you allowed to say that?

633
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:57,893
I think a lot of the questions that are coming up are along the lines of what we typically ask.

634
01:03:58,173 --> 01:04:02,315
We think those vary from project to project, designer to designer.

635
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:04,856
Some of the questions seem to be varied.

636
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:08,338
From what I've heard here, I think the questions that are being asked

637
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:15,902
We'll get a chance after this first part of the meeting.

638
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,628
We're asked to open for questions.

639
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:46,706
questions are going to be asked across the board.

640
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:54,510
So it won't be specific to one proposal or one architect, those blank questions in relation to the project.

641
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:58,772
Let me follow up to that.

642
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:03,134
You said, so I know originally, please correct me, the thought was we'd get a bunch

643
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:13,683
do you think that is so narrow for you to purview or exactly what that means.

644
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:14,383
Right, right, right.

645
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:21,010
It'll be the three voices on the panel.

646
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:25,434
So they will decide if they want to be right, they might go for it.

647
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:29,238
If I want to see it all.

648
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:30,239
But that's the

649
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:41,382
You have this kind of discussion.

650
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:46,564
Relatively close to today, before.

651
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:01,065
there will be a ranking with all of the MP numbers.

652
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:14,152
And at that point, if they see there's two better run runners, and the other one starts ranking so far below, they might just pick two, or everybody has the same field ranking.

653
01:06:14,252 --> 01:06:18,515
Next question.

654
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:30,312
It's on page 71.

655
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:36,858
It's on the top right.

656
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:39,080
Oh, it's like a little pie chart.

657
01:06:57,886 --> 01:07:01,929
that it takes to put into the materials.

658
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:08,334
But I think what this is saying, my chart, is the proposed design, body carbon is 20% less than the typical.

659
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:12,356
So it's saying that the body carbon reduction is 20%.

660
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:13,677
So bigger green is good.

661
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:16,199
Bigger green is better, yeah.

662
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:17,100
But that's good.

663
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,283
It's through use of sustainable materials, like certified wood.

664
01:07:22,023 --> 01:07:24,265
I guess I was confused by the proposed design.

665
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:43,651
Okay, other questions that we would want to ask?

666
01:07:50,557 --> 01:07:51,378
And then I think.

667
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,642
Are there other questions that we feel like.

668
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,071
spend a lot of schedule on some of it.

669
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:43,803
My biggest thing that I do is about storage and places to put supplies and things of that nature.

670
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:21,423
So are there any questions online about either SMMA or maybe the field overall?

671
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:23,904
Questions you'd want to be asking everybody?

672
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:33,590
Yes.

673
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,371
Oh, I'm capturing them right now.

674
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,693
I do have a question.

675
01:09:40,694 --> 01:09:49,220
But were there any of the specific things that we were wanting that they did not include?

676
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:13,816
Sorry, I'm going to miss this, but how is parking heat forecasted?

677
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:23,243
Is there anything in your design that would change the parking heat?

678
01:10:23,283 --> 01:10:33,251
The question was from a parking heat perspective, is that a formula or how is that determined and how does that integrate into your design?

679
01:10:34,932 --> 01:10:36,654
How does that get determined on these projects?

680
01:10:40,179 --> 01:10:55,048
sessions, they have desire, you know, it's not working that way, they will have a specific number of ED spots that are just a discussion.

681
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:55,328
Yeah.

682
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:20,541
Other questions for vendors?

683
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:24,883
I was thinking about the concepts.

684
01:11:25,303 --> 01:11:31,405
Which concepts would absolutely require plastic?

685
01:11:50,383 --> 01:11:52,825
My bones rattle twice a day, every day for months.

686
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:53,025
Yeah.

687
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:53,766
Other questions?

688
01:11:53,906 --> 01:11:54,546
Ready?

689
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:26,438
Sorry, energy code.

690
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:30,980
It's been something I'll make sure their energy is clear and they're ready for it.

691
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,763
So, or if they need an extra consultant to help them navigate that.

692
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:36,923
It's pretty ambitious.

693
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:39,825
I think that's about it.

694
01:12:39,945 --> 01:12:40,545
Yes.

695
01:12:40,665 --> 01:12:50,971
Anything else?

696
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:05,164
Um, so the 1st designer selection panel meeting is next week, Thursday.

697
01:13:05,184 --> 01:13:12,105
And we will know once the meeting is over what our finalists are.

698
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:12,906
Is that correct?

699
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:13,706
Okay.

700
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:19,127
And so we will let you all know.

701
01:13:19,147 --> 01:13:25,529
What the outcome of that meeting is so that you're aware of what's coming next.

702
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:35,543
6, we will interview and then we will know during that meeting.

703
01:13:35,924 --> 01:13:36,646
Okay.

704
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:37,487
Okay.

705
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:56,270
You do, probably.

706
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:05,513
We can collect a list if there's anybody who would like to participate because they usually ask us in advance.

707
01:14:07,534 --> 01:14:08,894
So we'll send out an email.

708
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:13,716
I did have one thing.

709
01:14:13,836 --> 01:14:13,996
Sure.

710
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,805
Um, that we had originally scheduled a meeting.

711
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:51,248
So I don't think you necessarily need to be on 24, but I wanted to just let everybody know that there was a slight schedule change in the MSBA, so that would be on 24.

712
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:10,759
You want to schedule that or just wait until the October meeting, which I think is quite late in the month, so maybe we can get that up.

713
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,543
But just wanted to kind of see what people saw.

714
01:15:15,664 --> 01:15:20,989
Maybe we see if we can move that up to the October 7th meeting.

715
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,051
Yeah, it's the 27th.

716
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:23,992
It was pretty late.

717
01:15:24,012 --> 01:15:25,934
So we'll see if we can get that up.

718
01:15:45,152 --> 01:15:47,413
Is there a motion to adjourn?

719
01:15:49,773 --> 01:15:51,494
I move.

720
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:57,236
Okay, I will call the roll.

721
01:15:57,256 --> 01:15:57,836
Jenny Graham?

722
01:15:57,876 --> 01:15:58,216
Yes.

723
01:15:58,676 --> 01:15:59,496
Mayor Lundo Kern?

724
01:15:59,516 --> 01:15:59,757
Yes.

725
01:16:00,397 --> 01:16:01,077
Dr. Guzzi?

726
01:16:01,117 --> 01:16:01,297
Yes.

727
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:02,457
Marta Cabral?

728
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:02,958
Yes.

729
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:04,218
Libby Brown?

730
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:05,101
Yes.

731
01:16:05,121 --> 01:16:05,241
Yes.

732
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:05,401
Yes.

733
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:05,481
Yes.

734
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:05,702
Yes.

735
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:05,882
Yes.
