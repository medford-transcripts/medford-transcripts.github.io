1
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:05,556
Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:16,226
Before we get to today's conversation, I wanted to read parts of a press release from City Life Vida Urbana, a group working with Medford residents who are in the process of being convicted from their homes.

3
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:26,275
On Friday, May 6, the Bradley Road Tenant Association rallied outside their 34-unit building, demanding negotiations with their landlord Savage Properties.

4
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:34,472
They were joined by 40 protesters, including neighbors, allied community groups, and Malden tenants facing similar displacement pressure.

5
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:43,918
Medford City Councilors Kit Collins, Richard Caraviello, Zach Behrs, and State Representative Paul Donato also attended and spoke in support of the tenant group.

6
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:54,505
Savage Properties handed out notices to quit to all tenants at will, but the residents, many of whom have lived at Bradley Road for several years, want to stay in their homes.

7
00:00:55,647 --> 00:01:01,432
Now more than ever, tenants and families need housing stability as Boston-area housing costs are at an all-time high.

8
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:05,795
22-26 Bradley Road is located just outside of Medford Square.

9
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:14,862
The Bradley Road building was a close community for many years, and tenants often shared responsibilities like shoveling, cleaning common areas, and looking after one another.

10
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:17,304
In March 2021, Malden owner Joseph DiNano

11
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:21,342
sold the building to Savage Properties of Boston.

12
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:32,144
A year later, in March 2022, Savage sent out mass no-fault 30-day notices to quit to all tenants at will in the building, which tenants received under their doors.

13
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:39,806
The tenants with leases in the buildings received rent increases of at least 20 to 25 percent.

14
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:42,166
We aren't activists.

15
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:47,087
We're just residents who want to stay in our homes, says Liza Maloney of the Bradley Road Tenant Association.

16
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,882
We come from all walks of life.

17
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:59,366
Some are seniors with no computer or computer skills to search for another home, a resident on public assistance, families with children in the Medford school system, and working professionals.

18
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,167
Some have lived here for 20 to 25 years.

19
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:09,010
To ask residents to simply pack up their lives and find new housing on such short notice is an unbelievably cruel task.

20
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,151
And for many, it's proven to be legitimately impossible.

21
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,392
Medford City Councilor Kit Collins addressed the crowd stating,

22
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,692
If we want to be a welcoming city, we must stand against forced displacement and against putting profit over people.

23
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:35,616
State Representative Paul Donato added, this demonstrates today that we have a major housing crisis in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and we have to work toward getting affordable housing for those who need it and need it the most.

24
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:41,558
We're hoping for the best outcome for these residents and for more attention to housing matters like this in Medford.

25
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:52,409
Today's episode is another collaboration with Jelly Keshavan, in which we discuss last week's Leaks to SCOTUS draft that addressed the overturning of abortion rights.

26
00:02:53,210 --> 00:03:00,475
Since neither of us are experts in this topic, this conversation reflects our thoughts and opinions, as well as some talking points supplied by Grace Caldera.

27
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:01,095
Thanks, Grace.

28
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:07,620
If you have any reactions, questions, or feedback, we'd love to hear from you at medfordpod at gmail.com.

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,961
Hope you enjoy.

30
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:21,355
All right, so it's me, Danielle again, sitting here with Chelly.

31
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,655
Hi guys, it's Chelly.

32
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,716
We'll remind you my pronouns are she and hers.

33
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:26,777
She and hers.

34
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:27,837
Chelly's as well.

35
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:35,260
So the first time that the two of us were sitting together for a podcast was to talk about sexual assault awareness month.

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:50,634
And today we decided to get back together to just talk through some of the leaked Supreme Court draft about overturning Roe v. Wade, which allows federal access to abortion.

37
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:58,401
So we kind of wanted to talk through some of the things that are coming out about that, and then some of our thoughts and reflections.

38
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:15,175
So, last week we heard about this draft that was written by Justice Alito, and I think implicated a majority of the Supreme Court in voting their preliminary votes to overturn Roe v. Wade.

39
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:22,962
And what we sort of know is there was what the Supreme Court was deciding was a case about

40
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:39,549
a women's health organization in Mississippi that banned abortion after 15 weeks and this was at odds with what Roe currently says about abortion being legal until fetal viability which was determined to be 23 weeks.

41
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,271
So siding with

42
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:49,508
the side that would limit abortion, would change, would overturn this decision that Roe v. Wade makes.

43
00:04:51,708 --> 00:05:01,351
And the argument that was written talks about the Constitution not saying anything about abortion, and that no such right is protected in the Constitution.

44
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:12,275
And previously, the way that abortion was defended was under the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause, stating that we should not be deprived of

45
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:16,419
life, liberty, or property without due process of the law.

46
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,884
They connected abortion to liberty.

47
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,949
Yeah, so I'll pause there and see if you have any thoughts or reactions.

48
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:40,015
So I have, so everybody, Danielle is being super graceful with me because lots of my reactions are emotionally based, justice based, coming from the perspective of a person who has carried children.

49
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,677
So lots of initial big thoughts.

50
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:59,965
largely coming from a timeline that thinks about what would happen if men got pregnant and how indisputable this right would be in the reverse.

51
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:09,036
how it would be free and it would be accessible everywhere and there would be paid recovery time and there would be paid child care for said recovery time.

52
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:17,766
So that piece that just kind of male-based anger, you don't have to deal with this, you have never been asked to deal with it and frankly I don't see enough of you.

53
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:22,788
to all the guys who call themselves feminists, where are you, what are you doing about this?

54
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:46,015
So that piece, the level of professional and financial and academic achievement afforded to men if and when women in their lives choose to get abortions, I think it's largely considered a choice that affects women's advancement, but it also affects male advancement every day, and I don't know that we're naming that loudly enough.

55
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:58,383
Also, making sure that folks are tethering the argument that says lack of abortion access really builds and maintains a lower class.

56
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:07,690
And so connecting it to sort of class warfare, criminalizing poverty, building or maintaining sort of an imperial presence.

57
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,713
You can't really have soldiers that are working blindly for the U.S.

58
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:13,794
unless you have folks who have been

59
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:29,490
Underserved you're not going to have the type of brain that just needs the desperately needs that support What else lots of things just some bodily autonomy we can stay out of my uterus I'm not doing this with you

60
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:49,581
Yeah, and we asked for reactions from residents to this news, which I shared on the last podcast, but I think there was some amount of shock, which I think is normal, but also, at the same time, not shocked, which I think we sort of saw some of this coming.

61
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:59,043
I think even though some of the newer justices on the Supreme Court said that, in their hearing said Rose settled law, we wouldn't try to overturn settled law.

62
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:13,467
I think this argument states that there have been times that we've overturned settle law, but those were times like Brown versus Board of Education, when we're talking about anti-sodomy laws, those were things that increased people's rights.

63
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:17,469
This is something that will definitely take away rights, take away some of our civil rights.

64
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,349
And I think you said sort of...

65
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,715
make worse some of these disparities that already exist.

66
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,777
And who is the Constitution written for?

67
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:30,240
Is it a relevant document?

68
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:30,881
Exactly.

69
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:31,562
I don't know.

70
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,746
I'm going to say no.

71
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:38,110
For me, it is not a sound argument to base current law.

72
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,452
This should be an indisputable constitutional right.

73
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:47,757
Sure, and they mentioned that abortion is not in the Constitution, but lots of things are not in the Constitution, including like women.

74
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:49,998
Including women, absolutely.

75
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:55,482
I think also another sort of loud reaction for me was

76
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:01,025
yes, we sort of see this coming, but also, I can't believe this is gonna be a part of my daughter's life.

77
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:12,731
I remember being, you know, whatever age I was when I started to interact with what birth control meant for me, it never occurred to me that this conversation would be more difficult for her.

78
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:22,536
And that was, I knew that at some point I would be a mom, fast forward whatever amount of years I am, and it's infuriating that we're moving backwards.

79
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:34,477
Yeah, and I think that just to remember that in Massachusetts, we do have different protections in the law if something like this were to happen.

80
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:46,788
And I think that's what I've been hearing is like, this will sort of turn our country into sort of two states, you know, it'll divide our country around like, where can I get abortion, where can't I?

81
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:54,870
But sort of undoubtedly, the places where you will be able to access abortion, I'm sure, will become overwhelmed by those places where you can't.

82
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,110
And, like, who's getting them?

83
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,211
Who's still going to be able to get them in the places where it's not, where it becomes illegal?

84
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:09,073
And sort of like the, the wealthy archetype will still get a safe, like folks will still get abortions.

85
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:10,253
It's just, will they be safe?

86
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:12,294
And who will die?

87
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:13,374
Yeah.

88
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:13,594
Yeah.

89
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,275
And I think always, I think an argument around

90
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:30,327
choice when it comes to abortion has been about like whose life are we valuing like do we value are we because I think this is obviously like we said this is not about a woman's it's like you know

91
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:35,710
directly, I think, ignoring the life of the pregnant person, right?

92
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:41,574
And prioritizing this language they use is like this unborn child rather than potential life, right?

93
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:50,521
But I think we hear a lot about, okay, well, if that's your value, then you need to also think about that baby when they become a person, right?

94
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,401
How do we take care of them?

95
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:52,142
How do we support them?

96
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,663
How do we support their family, their mother?

97
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:59,504
in order to be able to take care of this life that you have determined will come into the world, right?

98
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:21,770
And I actually heard this really interesting argument yesterday, which was that even if that were true, right, even if we had a country where everyone's needs were taken care of in that way, abortion would still be necessary because there's still gonna be times when, you know, rape or incest, but also times when carrying a baby to term is,

99
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,283
so harmful or potentially lethal to the person carrying it, right?

100
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,146
Like that we'll always need that as an option in those cases.

101
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:32,830
And also like the person doesn't owe you a validation for their reason.

102
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,993
They just don't want to have a child today.

103
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:35,493
That's it.

104
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,155
That's there are no other questions.

105
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:42,041
And yes, if it were about the babies, we would have paid family leave and we would have paid

106
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:46,902
daycare and childcare, and we would have school transitions, and we would have universal education.

107
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:51,903
We have zero of those things, and insurance would not mean deductibles and co-pays.

108
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,443
It would mean universal insurance.

109
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,764
Yeah.

110
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:02,805
Also, like, never mind the, like, do I get to claim the fetus on my taxes, or what's up?

111
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:09,687
It's a slippery slope to make a claim around life for a, at seven weeks' gestation.

112
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,007
That's a really interesting claim.

113
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:18,973
I've heard this, like, if we're calling a fetus a life, then when do I get to start claiming them as a dependent, which is valid, right?

114
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:19,814
Yes.

115
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:23,537
We had talked a little bit before we started recording about what this means.

116
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:27,399
You know, we talked about kind of what this means for Massachusetts, but also what this could mean for Medford.

117
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:31,482
And you and I were wondering, like, how does it work, right?

118
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:37,887
How do people in Medford access these sort of family planning services?

119
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:38,454
Sure.

120
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,015
Where can I go?

121
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:42,977
And is it local?

122
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:49,260
And if I walk in and share what my need is, what is the response?

123
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,081
Am I going to be sent somewhere else?

124
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:52,502
How much does it cost to go there?

125
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,522
Who will be there?

126
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:59,225
I think also we touched on the notion of privacy, where something like a Planned Parenthood is

127
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:20,833
foundationally necessary, but also does out a person in a certain way whereby you can't walk in, if you walk into sort of a generic hospital, you get some protection against your presence and your visit, and it's, you just have a privacy that's not afforded in a different, under different circumstances.

128
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,575
So where is that happening in Medford, and when will it be happening in Medford?

129
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:51,382
That's a good question and I think we we've talked about this before in different episodes but like sort of how this is being talked about with youth like how we talk about it and like health classes um yeah and we talk this gets back to that emotional piece but we talked about that piece around like sexual health for men versus women and you and I were talking about how uh sort of like

130
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:55,344
male enhancement medicine can be so easily accessible.

131
00:13:55,945 --> 00:14:03,609
And I think there's some statistic about how that's covered by insurance even for like the government, right?

132
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:04,870
Like our government workers.

133
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:12,054
And so easily, you know, people can get it sent, that kind of medicine sent to their homes discreetly.

134
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:16,957
And we were talking about plan B and like you had a little story about that.

135
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:18,018
I have so many stories.

136
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:30,570
First of all, I think zooming out, I don't know that men are forced to think about how many steps it takes for women to be sexually active safely.

137
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:40,135
Like, it seems like the investment is grossly, there's a gross discrepancy there.

138
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:46,103
And with something like Plan B, it's expensive.

139
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:49,367
I think it's like $55 right now.

140
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,891
It's also the drug itself, misoprostol, is nauseating.

141
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:58,394
So if you are to vomit, if you are to lose the medication, now we're in for another 55 bucks.

142
00:14:58,434 --> 00:14:59,334
Do you even have that?

143
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:00,794
Now it's approaching $110.

144
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,455
It's sickening.

145
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,996
What's your transportation like?

146
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,276
The logistics of really using it effectively.

147
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:08,697
Do you have someone who can drive you home?

148
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,218
You need to be on the train.

149
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,500
It's also just cumbersome.

150
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,900
The packaging is enormous.

151
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,322
It's literally hard to take it out.

152
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:20,123
And it's noisy.

153
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,585
It's akin to a video game or something.

154
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,926
The process feels very, very public.

155
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:29,989
And you don't know what someone's insurance moment is like or a family moment.

156
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,850
And where can they be seen doing what?

157
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,611
And really, whose business is it?

158
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:39,054
the questions you might get asked at the desk when you really just need to get in and out.

159
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:50,202
I am of the belief if someone is asking for birth control, like talk to them about safe options and then keep it moving because it takes a lot of capital to come to the moment where you can ask for help anyways.

160
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,046
Yeah, it's a racket.

161
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,028
It's a racket and I don't think we are.

162
00:15:56,048 --> 00:16:01,254
I am working to get better at teaching men about how much it takes.

163
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:08,722
Also just like regular sort of preventative monthly birth control or how invasive OB visits are.

164
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:11,987
Yeah.

165
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:13,528
It's a lot of responsibility.

166
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:13,808
Yeah.

167
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:23,453
And it does seem like really in conflict, this idea of like, how much of is there, how much of the burden is on like a woman in that situation?

168
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:29,976
And then we're, and I would say like, you know, that pressure around like engaging in sexual activity.

169
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:30,236
Right.

170
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:36,680
And then on the other side, like, but if you do happen to get pregnant, like here's like, you know, we're talking about eliminating all of those choices.

171
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,760
Sure.

172
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,340
Sure.

173
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:52,266
Um, and also like the nuance of if I choose to take something like plan B, if I choose to get an abortion or further down the line, do I, if I choose to get an abortion, how much do I say, do I tell the person that I was intimate with?

174
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,447
What will that response look like?

175
00:16:54,708 --> 00:17:02,531
It's, and if I'm already an emotional place because I'm questioning parenting, like it's, it's a lot and I'm not sure where,

176
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,622
I'm not sure where men are asked to step up.

177
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:09,609
Sure.

178
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:24,137
Yeah, and one of the things that I think about when we talk about limiting, you know, not just like taking away the right to have an abortion, but limiting the number of weeks that you're allowed to do that, right, Liz?

179
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:29,320
Like, you know, I think about most, like some people who don't know they're pregnant, right?

180
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,403
Like they might be like 10, 12 weeks pregnant before they realize, right?

181
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:36,325
And what that means for them.

182
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:42,006
I think with these changes and restrictions, how long would it take for you to actually get an abortion?

183
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:50,389
So if I don't know I'm pregnant until 10 weeks, and I can't schedule that abortion, there's no one to do it for five weeks, or I have to travel to another state to get that done.

184
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,649
What does that mean?

185
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,870
And how much does it cost to do the traveling?

186
00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:00,872
And then there's weird predatory, like, well, you should wait for two weeks, or we need to look at the heartbeat first, or all that.

187
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,193
It's heavy.

188
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:16,138
I just remember I took a class in college called the Anthropology of Reproduction and there was this case that we read about where this woman was, I don't exactly remember the circumstances, but she was pregnant and somehow became brain dead.

189
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:25,402
And so the decision was like, do we keep her on life support in order to keep this fetus growing or do we lose both lives, right?

190
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:49,367
it was I that was like just like a real moment of clarity to me where it was like this woman was like literally being used as an incubator yes when like you know she was going to die anyways but how do we give her that um that sort of respect and like grace and how do we respect her in the process of all that too it's like yes yeah yeah I mean it also bleeds into like conversations of

191
00:18:50,713 --> 00:19:05,556
what it means for people who are ready to parent to be parenting, what that means socially, like as a larger society, that it's, there's a huge difference in folks who are ready and prepared and wanted it, rather than folks who feel taken from.

192
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:17,579
And then the value of what strong parenting is, like monetarily, like if mothers had jobs, they'd make like over $300,000 a year because we just do everything, every day, all the time.

193
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,091
And then, like, where was her life?

194
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,693
What about her life?

195
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:25,596
And even just even for people who choose parenting, what about her life?

196
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:31,324
Also, like, still the paid childcare and acknowledgement of the work that goes into it.

197
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:47,749
I'm getting to know some really great dads and families where there is more equity in the home in terms of caregiving and responsibility, but I don't think that's largely the truth.

198
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:58,556
It's more of a responsibility, more of just limiting the potential of the mother in a lot of these situations, and we're taking away choice.

199
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:03,998
And normalizing when you look at something like a resume to say, it's not that I was doing nothing.

200
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:07,360
I was building other human beings' futures.

201
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,261
So that's what I was doing, and let me have that.

202
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,363
And also respecting the skill set that comes out of parenting.

203
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:16,992
Yeah.

204
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:28,700
And I think not to mention, like, I think, you know, another scenario when, you know, there already is an existing family unit and somebody is pregnant and, you know, can't afford or doesn't want another child, right?

205
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,604
And what that means not only for the mother, but also the other kids and, like, the family unit.

206
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:54,021
I think something that came up in some of our comments, and Grace Caldera, who's like a friend of the podcast, did send us some talking points from Planned Parenthood, but about sort of what, so this was a draft opinion that came out, and so it's not decided, but it seems like it will likely be decided in June.

207
00:20:55,802 --> 00:21:01,867
But what are the types of things that we can do, what we can get involved with, while there's still time?

208
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:10,719
I mean, I guess my general sense would be keep making noise.

209
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:15,903
Leverage the platforms or the networks that you have.

210
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,986
Continue to be part of the conversation.

211
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:20,887
Continue to call in.

212
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:25,211
Ask folks to reflect on really what abortion has meant for them and theirs and why.

213
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:31,923
Yeah, for folks who have dollars to move places, maybe that's an option.

214
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:35,753
For other people, maybe just showing up with hands-on work makes sense.

215
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:44,436
And some that Grace shared with us were, like you said, being able to support funding abortion funds.

216
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:48,079
So one that she listed was keepourclinics.org.

217
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,204
And to affirm that abortion is legal for everyone you know, spread the word with every platform and channel you have.

218
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,465
So letting people, I think some people were probably

219
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:20,174
Misunderstood this draft opinion to mean like this is now like what's happening and people still have access to abortion So if you're needing one now, like you can still obtain it at least here Keep sharing information in action so that we can be a resource to our community members So if you're hearing about actions if you're hearing about protests to just share those things I

220
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,977
and attend when you can, also taking care of yourself.

221
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:40,672
There was a remark on our last podcast about how I think there can feel like a lot of pressure to take action and to have fully formed opinions and arguments, and this is also an emotional issue that impacts a lot of us.

222
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:48,075
I think about, you know, abortion, you know, luckily doesn't affect me personally very much.

223
00:22:48,275 --> 00:23:01,722
I mean, of course it could, but I think that this decision, as I said before, the way that it I think could have an effect on lots of other civil rights, so gay marriage, things like that, that's to me scary, sort of that bigger picture.

224
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:02,983
The domino effect, yes.

225
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:17,126
And I think too, like, even though we aren't a state where, you know, we'll be as affected as other states, I think the attitudes towards women, attitudes towards abortion are changing.

226
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:21,827
And I think it, like, lets people talk about the way they feel about these things.

227
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:29,289
And that, like, you know, I think when we saw, like, Donald Trump, like, you know, people saying, like, they always felt like this, but they thought they couldn't vocalize it.

228
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:32,950
Like, when we're talking about, like, racism and homophobia and things like that.

229
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:46,161
A couple of other things that I got as feedback for actions that we can take are to pressure blue state legislatures and governors to codify and expand state protections of abortion rights.

230
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:50,364
Also calling Congress and asking them to codify Roe at a federal level.

231
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,826
It sounds like this came to a vote yesterday.

232
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:55,348
We're recording this on Thursday.

233
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,752
This came to a vote yesterday, Wednesday, and it did not pass, but it sounds like

234
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:05,637
there may be some pressure that the president can put on the Supreme Court or other bodies.

235
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:09,841
And also running for office at any and every level.

236
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:15,886
If you can't do that, volunteering and donating to candidates that support access to abortion.

237
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,046
All valid.

238
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,026
All valid.

239
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:30,254
You and I had a conversation, I think, on our last sexual assault podcast about calling in, and I think that's maybe what you were sort of referencing before.

240
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:35,218
It's like, I think this is a topic where it does feel like

241
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,059
there are sides, right?

242
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,201
And so it can feel really easy to dismiss somebody else's point of view.

243
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:46,324
But I think that's where the change happens, is being able to hear, OK, what is this about for you?

244
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:54,529
Why is this something that you are sort of so unmovable around?

245
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,070
Yeah, adamant and staunch, yes.

246
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,691
I think, too, for me, like,

247
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:06,804
What I, how I think about like a pro-choice idea is it's a choice, right?

248
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:10,107
I'm not saying you have to have an abortion or I'm always going to have an abortion.

249
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:12,410
I'm saying like you deserve to have that access to that.

250
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,852
If you don't want to choose that, then that's your choice, right?

251
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:20,538
It's hard to sort of reconcile that there's a side that's saying like we shouldn't have any choice.

252
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:23,888
Yeah, I think that's a good sort of caveat.

253
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:28,370
Like this is not about make sure that everybody gets an abortion every time.

254
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,892
This is about make sure that everyone always can.

255
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:35,853
And to kind of put yourself

256
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:39,675
kind of a walk in my shoes, right?

257
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:40,956
I think you can take that anywhere.

258
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:45,903
You can take that to a conversation of race or whatever it might be, classism.

259
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:54,354
I think when you see a marginalized moment, hopefully one of your reactions is, what if it were me or mine or my kids?

260
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:57,236
Lots of reactions.

261
00:25:57,276 --> 00:25:57,956
Yeah.

262
00:25:58,696 --> 00:25:59,917
And we'd like to hear from anyone.

263
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:11,861
So if people have thoughts, if people know more than us, because certainly we've done some reading, we have some experience, like life experience, but we're mostly just sharing our kind of thoughts and opinions here.

264
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:16,722
So if anybody has anything else that they'd like to share or share with us privately.

265
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:17,563
Please, please chime in.

266
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:19,083
Please, yeah.

267
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:20,384
Great.

268
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:20,724
Well.

269
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:21,284
Yay.

270
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:21,524
Yeah.

271
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,905
I don't know if you have anything else to add.

272
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:33,055
I mean something that could likely be thought of as provocative but in my head I keep finding myself thinking our reality is that

273
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:39,713
every time that women engage sexually, we could literally walk away with two heartbeats.

274
00:26:40,514 --> 00:27:00,283
And so to invite men to ponder that reality, that sex always has a burden, or even rather refine that, like sperm has a burden, because we can have sex a lot, and it doesn't have the same ramification, but to really ponder what your body means for women's futures.

275
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,345
That is probably my lasting thought.

276
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,884
I think that's a great way to end, yeah.

277
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,206
Well, thanks, Shelley.

278
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,909
Thank you, Daniel.

279
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:10,171
You'll hear from us soon again.

280
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:11,353
Absolutely.

281
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,227
Thanks as always to Shelley for this conversation.

282
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:28,189
We mentioned some ways to take action and we put some links in the show notes to make them easier to access.

283
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,690
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.

287
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,398
Guys, what's the name of the podcast?

288
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,387
Never Bites.

289
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,285
Never Bites.

290
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:54,729
Good job.
