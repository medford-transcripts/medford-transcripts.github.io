1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:20,968
meeting minutes April 29 2024 motion to approve the consent agenda by member Graham seconded by a second member Bramley all those in favor aye all those opposed motion passes for the consent agenda which was the first item of the May 6 2024 regular meeting 6 p.m.

2
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,692
There are no reports of subcommittees.

3
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:29,337
We have reports of superintendent, updates and comments.

4
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,558
Dr. Edward Vinson.

5
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:34,496
I have very brief comments.

6
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:41,761
I too just want to recognize our teachers and nurses as this week is Teacher and Nurse Appreciation Week.

7
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:50,087
We want to thank you for all the wonderful work that you do on behalf of our students and that you truly make a positive impact in their lives.

8
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:54,070
Wednesday, May 8th is National School Nurse Day.

9
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:02,014
and just encourage everyone to go check out our Mustang Mall for special things that they have going on.

10
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:17,004
Also, this month is Mental Health Awareness Month, and as school leaders and educators, this is an especially important moment to pay attention to the mental health needs of students and youth in our community.

11
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:22,667
According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in six U.S.

12
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:28,731
youth experience a mental health condition each year, and only half of them receive treatment.

13
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:40,820
So I just want to point that piece out, and I want to recognize the good work that is happening with our

14
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:47,075
mental health and social emotional health departments for our students.

15
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:53,377
I wanna just highlight this week, this Wednesday, May 8th from 1 to 2 p.m.

16
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:55,158
is kindergarten open house.

17
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:59,799
This is in-person open house sessions from 1 to 2 p.m.

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,100
at all four elementary schools.

19
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:09,104
Please work with your schedules to be able to attend the open houses in person.

20
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:13,947
Also this Wednesday is early release day for all of our students.

21
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:22,872
So again, middle school students are dismissed at 1130am and high school and elementary students are dismissed at noontime.

22
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:50,487
This evening, Mr. Paul Teixeira is going to present a brief report on the outcomes of our English Learner Tiered Focus Monitoring Review that took place by DESE, and there will be two reports presented by Dr. Cushing for the committee to approve an out-of-state travel trip to Florida and a building repair for the skylight at the McGlynn School.

23
00:02:51,227 --> 00:03:06,059
I also just want to recognize that we had a wonderful first meeting of our MSBA building committee under the direction of Chair Graham and Mayor Rungelkorn and all the wonderful members that were there.

24
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,522
More information is to come, but it was an excellent kickoff.

25
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:11,623
Thank you.

26
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:14,125
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

27
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,486
We have our report on

28
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:22,056
English Learner Targeted and Focused Monitoring by Desi, Mr. Paul Taksara, Director of EL.

29
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:22,717
Welcome.

30
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:24,339
Good evening.

31
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,740
Good evening, everyone.

32
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:27,542
Good evening.

33
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:30,886
Or we should just say evening.

34
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:35,972
Just evening tonight.

35
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:51,525
I will be fast.

36
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,528
All right.

37
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:58,889
So you guys got a pretty thick packet.

38
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,450
We're not gonna go over the whole thing.

39
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:09,156
I sent you the ELE requirements because even though it just says like parent notification, there's like three pages of that.

40
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,958
So I just wanted you to understand what the requirements are.

41
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:16,599
on everything that this review does.

42
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,900
So it occurs every six year with a three-year check-in.

43
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:38,385
And for the past year, I've been working on this with DESE, uploading, they wanna know our procedures, they wanna see samples of all of the documentation that we send home to caregivers, our report cards, our progress reports, and then they pull individual student records.

44
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:51,892
And they look at, you know, they want to make sure if it's a student who's bilingual who has an IEP that there was an interpreter at their meeting and they, you know, want verification for the sign in sheets and all of this gets uploaded to Desi's portal.

45
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:57,514
It was probably about 1000 pages of paperwork that they got in preparation for this review.

46
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,556
They do that every six years.

47
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:09,671
They came to the district, they interviewed caregivers, students, teachers, administrators, and then they did walkthroughs through the classroom.

48
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,276
So that's what the tiered focus monitoring is for the EL department.

49
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:18,546
So this is the criteria.

50
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,427
There are 12 different areas that they look at.

51
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:31,011
Like I said, each area has subgroups and pretty involved compliance at the federal level and also at the state level.

52
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:34,853
And this is the legal requirement and the implementation.

53
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:38,935
This was a sample just to show you what they look for for one criterion.

54
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:50,736
So upon their review, they give a rating system for each criterion, and then if it's implemented, the requirement's substantially met in all important aspects.

55
00:05:50,837 --> 00:06:01,039
If it's partially implemented, the requirement in one or several of those aspects, like the subgroups, may not be met, and then not implemented is the requirement is substantially not met.

56
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:08,801
So we met or exceeded the state and federal implementation requirements in 10 out of 12 focus areas.

57
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:16,197
we received partially implemented in two out of the 12 focus areas.

58
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:28,482
So the two areas we had were ELE program placement and structure, which again, that's like three pages of requirements, and ELE 14, which is the licensure requirements.

59
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:37,005
The program and placement structure was a result of being under 50% for students making progress on the access test.

60
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,187
we are at 38%.

61
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:47,933
But I did pull the state data and surrounding districts just to show you we're all in the same boat.

62
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:55,778
We just happen to have a curriculum, I mean, a coordinated program review or a tiered focus monitoring this year, but we are at 38%.

63
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,141
Now, I realize we don't wanna be in line with the state, we wanna be higher.

64
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:05,103
So we do have to do corrective action on how we're going to adjust that.

65
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:07,744
And so we did.

66
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:19,168
So this is a report that came out in November 23 about the rising numbers of unmet needs with immigrant newcomer students in Massachusetts.

67
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:21,209
So again, this isn't a Medford issue.

68
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:28,411
It is a statewide issue, but we are taking steps to help course correct with this.

69
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:40,059
So this is the action plan to get us out of corrective action for ELE 5, and I'm not going to go over it because you have it all in your packets.

70
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:50,130
This was submitted to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and they approved this plan as a feasible plan to make the adjustments that we need to.

71
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:57,717
There are a lot of things happening in the district that I do believe will contribute to increased scores.

72
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:09,827
Everything from our new curriculum for early literacy, the science of reading that's happening in the schools, because our EL students are integrated in all of those classes, that will be a factor.

73
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:13,709
in achievement and growth.

74
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:21,973
And then we have the MAP growth, we have DIBLS testing, so we can do our formative assessments and check-ins throughout the year and adjust accordingly.

75
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:26,435
ELE 14 was on licensure requirements.

76
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:35,620
This wasn't licensure for EL, this was a concern with Gen Ed classroom teachers not having the SEI endorsement.

77
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:40,429
So this is a relatively easy fix.

78
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:52,995
Because our numbers have grown dramatically in the last few years, there were many teachers who couldn't take the SEI class because they had to have EL students in their classroom in order to take that class.

79
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:57,298
That was one of the requirements when DESE was offering that.

80
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:05,750
And so if they never had an EL student in their class, they were never flagged with DESE as needing the endorsement.

81
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:12,775
But as our numbers have grown and our EL students are in more and more classrooms, that's what triggered this.

82
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:17,919
And we think we have about 18 teachers who need the endorsement.

83
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,043
We're working with principals to get an exact list.

84
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,284
And then in the fall,

85
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:28,626
We will work with the teachers to help them get the endorsement that they need.

86
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:31,747
And so by January of 2025, we should be all set.

87
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:34,468
Any questions?

88
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,350
Have a great night.

89
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:46,033
That was the best presentation I think I've ever seen.

90
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,114
Thank you.

91
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,882
Recommendation to approve basketball trip to Florida, December 2024.

92
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:56,606
How exciting.

93
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:59,492
Dr. Peter Cushing, who will be brief.

94
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,376
He's our assistant superintendent of schools.

95
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:03,658
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:05,179
Coach DeLuca is also online.

97
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:12,343
We're looking for your approval to take what I believe is a first of its kind in Medford athletic trip to Florida.

98
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:17,987
These are organized by a company out of Florida that provides sanctioned athletic events.

99
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:19,948
That's a critical point with MIA.

100
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:23,511
Coach DeLuca, if you have anything else to add or if there are any questions.

101
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,694
Yeah, can you guys hear me?

102
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:31,245
Awesome.

103
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:34,727
So my name is Dominic DeLuca.

104
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:39,009
For those of you that don't know me, I'm the head coach of the girls varsity basketball team at Medford High.

105
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:48,493
And we're looking for final clearance to take my team on a Disney trip where we play in a tournament from December 26th to December 31st.

106
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:56,657
So most importantly, no students will miss any school days and there will be no MIA sanctions if we are approved for this trip.

107
00:10:58,677 --> 00:10:59,278
Motion to approve.

108
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:00,406
Second.

109
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,747
Do you want to speak?

110
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:03,968
I just wanted to thank Coach DeLuca.

111
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,429
He and I spoke over the weekend.

112
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,571
This is a great opportunity for our girls basketball team.

113
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:13,954
Thank you for your tenaciousness and have fun in Disney.

114
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:15,595
Thank you, Member Graham.

115
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,697
Also, I played basketball from Everett High School my whole career and we never went to Disney.

116
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:27,236
Motion for approval by Member, I'm a little upset about this, but Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

117
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,657
All those in favor?

118
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:29,638
All those opposed?

119
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,419
Hearing none, motion's approved.

120
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:32,219
Have a blast.

121
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:32,779
Awesome.

122
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,701
Madam Mayor, we will be looking for chaperones.

123
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:38,023
You know what?

124
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:38,903
Okay, okay.

125
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,144
All right, I do love a good game.

126
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,206
Okay, thank you.

127
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:47,048
Recommendation to approve McGlynn Skylight Repair Project.

128
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:48,409
Again, Dr. Peter Cushing.

129
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:58,219
So we have six skylights at the McGlynn, there are two over the main lobby, four over the best can be described as around portico through two or three, two floors.

130
00:11:58,809 --> 00:11:59,549
into the library.

131
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,293
Those have been leaking significantly over the past, I'd say six months or so.

132
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:08,515
We put out an initial request for quotes.

133
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:15,378
It did not appear that the quotes that were sent to us had followed the scope of work that was issued.

134
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:24,904
So we reissued it and the quote that was issued with the initial had met and they are the successful bidder on this.

135
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,726
Um, so we have followed all procurement law.

136
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,628
We've checked with the city and we're good to go.

137
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,649
Just need your approval.

138
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,450
Uh, 26,000.

139
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:31,810
Hold on.

140
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,514
I just, uh, refresh my memory on the money.

141
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:43,315
We're requesting that this would be through revenue replacement on ARPA through the mayor, a total of $26,800.

142
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:47,798
I've put in a 10% contingency fund.

143
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:52,462
One of the things I've learned working on the McGlynn playground is to have contingency, $2,680 for a total request of $29,480.

144
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,967
We could have this done in six weeks.

145
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,171
There's a little bit of lead time on the skylights, but they won't really know until they're ordered.

146
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:09,477
So it will be done within four, sorry, within 12 weeks or three months, no matter what.

147
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:12,360
Motion to approve.

148
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,881
I had a question.

149
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:16,544
I'm so sorry.

150
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:19,287
This is a short meeting compared to some of our years ago.

151
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,287
Don't say that out loud.

152
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:25,956
So last week we heard comments about roof replacement.

153
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:32,339
This isn't gonna mess with that, or this won't get uprooted immediately with- No, no.

154
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,041
I mean, the bottom line is the skylights are leaking now.

155
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:35,501
Yes.

156
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,243
And a roof replacement is several years away.

157
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,604
But this won't get in the way of that.

158
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:41,164
Should not.

Great.

160
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:50,770

181
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:08,580
Before we move approval member, um Miss McLaughlin.

182
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,401
Name and address for the record, please.

183
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:13,102
And welcome back.

184
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:15,623
Hello.

185
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:16,183
How are you?

186
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:20,611
Hi everyone, Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street in Medford Moss.

187
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,453
Thank you for giving me a moment.

188
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:26,096
I just wanted to comment on 2024 if I could.

189
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:31,140
And I wanted to thank Member Graham for bringing this to the floor.

190
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,745
This is something that I worked on for a couple of years with the Universal Safety Committee and something that I had been really

191
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:41,529
hoping to push forward before my resignation.

192
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:51,677
And so I think this is a really important piece and one that I want folks to consider as you're thinking about the building of the new high school as well.

193
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:57,482
So, you know, while there's a building that we hope is going to be built in the interim, there are a lot of things that are

194
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:09,030
out of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that is the access to our building and particularly our high school is really, there's a lot that needs to be done there.

195
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:15,334
We have applied for MOD grant in the past and have not gotten it for a number of reasons.

196
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,095
So, can you guys hear me?

197
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:19,777
Hello?

198
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:21,583
Yes, yes, we can.

199
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:22,584
Oh, sorry.

200
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:23,424
I was just hearing feedback.

201
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:39,513
So I was just going to say that we have applied for the MOD in the past, and I think that, you know, it's something that needs to be informed, and I would recommend or ask folks if they would consider collaborating with the Disability Commission

202
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:59,152
and or members of the disability community to work on this because I think well-intentioned folks who don't have lived experience with disability can often make errors that are long lasting and I think this is something that you know is long overdue and should be addressed appropriately.

203
00:16:59,233 --> 00:16:59,613
So I would

204
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:16,437
ask the committee to please consider perhaps making an amendment to the motion to include disability advocates in the committee, I mean, in the commission, as they evaluate this process with the ADA compliance.

205
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:19,997
Thank you, Ms.

206
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:20,698
McLaughlin.

207
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:21,898
Thank you.

208
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,878
Thank you, Member Graham, for putting this forward.

209
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:28,759
And maybe we can also make sure that city staff and

210
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:34,977
school admin calendar when that grant is open so that we can apply for it accordingly.

211
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:42,699
Motion to approve with an amendment to include members of the disability community in the meeting and discussions.

212
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:49,321
Motion for approval as amended by member Graham, seconded by member Ntapa.

Offered by Member Rousseau.

231
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:37,142
Mayor, sorry.

232
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:41,905
That motion to, do we then have to actually motion to approve the policy?

233
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:42,565
Yeah.

234
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:43,845
Because we're not having the second reading.

235
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:44,646
I think we have to then

236
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:46,252
Motion to approve.

237
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,674

243
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,571
Motion passes.

244
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,928
2024-27 offered by member Rousseau.

245
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:16,801
Policy BEDB agenda creation and format for regular meetings of the school committee will be updated by inserting approvals of capital purchases immediately after existing policy language, approval of bills, and the consent agenda section of the policy.

246
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:20,344
Motion to approve.

247
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:22,085
Second.

248
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,027
You want me to speak on that, Mayor?

249
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,410
if you could explain, yeah.

250
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:26,670
Sure.

251
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:36,513
So we have our consent agenda and in the policy that explains what's allowed to be in there, it has, well, I don't have the full set.

252
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:40,254
There's a list, a laundry list of things we allow to be in a consent agenda.

253
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:51,416
And as we have discussed, well, I mean, last week, we actually accidentally had them in the consent agenda, but this just simply adds the approvals of capital purchases.

254
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,377
So in our last meeting, we talked about how we wanna be approving them,

255
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:59,890
And then I got a question from an administrator about, so how do you do that?

256
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:08,157
Do we have to come here and do a whole song and dance every time we wanna buy a new skylight to replace something leaking?

257
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:14,542
And I don't think the intent of this committee is that we have a song and dance every time we have to replace the skylight.

258
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:25,850
any of these approvals that are capital purchases, so we're not actually funding them, but the city is, but the assumption is the administration has already talked to the city and the city said, yes, we'll pay for it.

259
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:41,096
Yeah, as long as we make sure that the administration talks to the city staff, especially where ARPA is, it is accounted for, especially with the air conditioning, reconditioning study, turnout gear, it's accounted for.

260
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:45,835
And we can just sever anything we actually need to discuss for real.

261
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:49,899
But it just seemed like, you know, we already had one tonight.

262
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:54,343
And I think actually last week after we had talked about this, there was another one as well.

263
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:59,248
So it's just like, when we don't really think we need to talk about it, a consent agenda sounds great.

264
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,449
So that's about it.

265
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:04,164
Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Rousseau.

266
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:05,045

00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:08,247
Motion passes.

270
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,649
May I make the song and dance again?

271
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,231

We have one condolence.

285
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:49,433
The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincere condolences to the family of Robert D. Kane, English teacher and guidance counselor at the former Roberts Junior High.

286
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:54,076
Additionally, he served as director of the Medford Summer School Program.

287
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,017
I'll rise for a moment of silence.

288
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:06,125
Thank you.

289
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:13,191
Our next regular meeting is May 20th, 2024 here at the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall in addition to Zoom.

290

Motion to adjourn?
