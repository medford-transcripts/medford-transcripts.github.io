1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:00,809
presentation.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,590
Thank you.

3
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:04,371
Mr McHugh.

4
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:05,752
Okay.

5
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:07,933
Um, good evening, everyone.

6
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:09,714
Uh, yeah.

7
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:15,356
Tonight we'll kind of review some of the, um.

8
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:21,119
Budgetary issues with grappling with and kind of our thought

9
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:43,844
marshal resources, new revenue or savings within our current budget to meet those needs.

10
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:51,249
So just a quick review.

11
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:58,413
This is gonna be similar to a presentation I gave to our union leadership last week.

12
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:00,995
We know that

13
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:09,687
Our class size, our enrollment is growing in the elementary grades.

14
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:16,670
We're projecting for now that kindergarten will be relatively the same.

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,232
We still continue to lose a few students at the middle and the high school.

16
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:28,214
And then kind of a deeper dive into what's going on at elementary.

17
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:44,354
With the exception of grade two, which is an outlier, that happened to be a very smaller than usual birth year when those students finally got to kindergarten.

18
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:52,958
But you can see in grades one and grades three, there's significant increase in those grades.

19
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:58,902
Hasn't really hit grade four, grade five this year, but we expect that.

20
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:08,074
Well, we project the grade three, this is a projection of what it's gonna be in 25.

21
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:18,260
So next year we expect to see that continued growth into grade four and then eventually grade five.

22
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:24,364
And then we kind of review a class sizes.

23
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:28,166
Now this is based on this year back in October,

24
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:38,517
And it's taking a look at the general ed classes across the school.

25
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:49,881
So different grade levels might be slightly more, slightly less, but this is the average class sizes in general ed.

26
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:56,863
So for instance, you see the McGlynn Middle is down, but that's because they have

27
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:03,397
significant enrollment in the newcomers program, which is not part of this analysis.

28
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,723
At the high school too, I did a review of their master schedule.

29
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:23,548
And to be honest, it's a little bit difficult to know kind of all the ins and outs of how they schedule.

30
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,850
But I think in general,

31
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:41,457
I'm in the ballpark for what the class sizes are generally, but they could be more or less if I had kind of a more precise, if I could do a more precise analysis on the schedule.

32
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:55,429
So that's just data points for how we're approaching the budget.

33
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:03,735
I outlined kind of four buckets of spending that I think we need to address this year.

34
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:09,059
First of all, we have our salary commitments.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,405
We have a number of contracts that we're already under contract for FY25.

36
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:21,771
And for those contracts, just the cost alone is $2.8 million.

37
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:34,255
Then we have three other unions whose contracts will be expiring at the end of the year.

38
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:38,458
And of course, non-unit personnel go on a year-to-year basis.

39
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:44,141
And we're estimating $735,000 needs to be set aside to be able to negotiate at the bargaining table.

40
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:06,717
We've talked about in previous meetings that we've identified a handful of accounts that are significantly underfunded.

41
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:11,821
Homeless transportation would be one of them, substitute teachers.

42
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:25,292
Special education summer school needs to be increased based on the number of students we're serving in that program.

43
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:34,605
legal expense budget we talked about hasn't really kept up with the spending that is hitting that account.

44
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:45,151
And then of course, facilities, building repairs and custodial supplies have been kind of chronically underfunded for a few years.

45
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:51,274
So the total of those would be an estimated hit on the budget of $1.3 million.

46
00:05:55,632 --> 00:06:02,015
The other bucket or the third bucket would be ESSER funding.

47
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:12,461
So there's a lot of positions that are on this budget that are essential to the operation of the school department.

48
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:25,087
The biggest one of these is our whole ELL or number of the majority positions for the ELL

49
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:33,694
newcomers program is funded at the McGlynn is funded in ESSA currently.

50
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:41,537
We have adjustment counselors, we have all our building substitutes throughout the district are funded on ESSA.

51
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:54,942
Professional development was no, there was no room in the budget this year to have a professional development line and that's,

52
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,384
very important.

53
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:08,252
So we're projecting that we have to bring 21.2 positions funded in ESSA into the general fund.

54
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:16,037
We're going to let go of about nine positions.

55
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:20,761
Some of those are currently vacant.

56
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:25,324
For instance, there were four literacy coaches that were not filled

57
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,067
this year.

58
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:36,532
But the impact again is 1.3 for this group on the budget.

59
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:48,857
And then we've identified kind of the big ticket items that we would look for new spending.

60
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,540
One is we know that through rate setting that all our

61
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:02,184
Out-of-district tuitions for special needs is increasing by 4.69%.

62
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:24,117
We would want to put in additional funding into the facilities department so we can start to undertake some planning, provide proper project management to those projects.

63
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:45,690
conduct building inspections, re-commissioning projects are essential to kind of inform our capital needs and get those buildings back into kind of the condition that they were designed for.

64
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:53,034
Similarly, you know, there's little bandwidth to do our technology

65
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:57,158
upgrade our network and keep that current.

66
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:08,943
There's all kinds of servers, routers, all kinds of connection points that make the network work here.

67
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:21,709
We have, it's a, you know, mission critical activity that we have to, not only for just communication between

68
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:30,168
schools and department heads, but our students are on computers now, they're taking tests, they're doing research.

69
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:34,210
So it's essential to kind of keep that network well-maintained.

70
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:42,232
The high school is undergoing an accreditation process, which they've begun this year.

71
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:48,394
There was some funding provided for kind of the pre-planning that needs to go into that.

72
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:51,235
But during the accreditation year,

73
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:00,455
The high school will be required to host a delegation that will conduct the accreditation.

74
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,958
We will be required to provide food and lodging for them while they're here.

75
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:09,580
And so we're gonna provide the funds to be able to do that.

76
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:21,708
Another area that we want to address this year is the need to kind of refresh our technology for students.

77
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:37,409
We were able to buy a lot of Chromebooks and Apple tablets back when we were flush with COVID funds.

78
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:47,737
There was a lot of school from home, and it was essential to get that technology out to students.

79
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:52,141
But those devices are,

80
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,239
uh, coming to the end of the useful life.

81
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:16,709
So we, we, um, proposing to implement a plan to refresh about 20% of our, uh, device inventory in FY 25, and then continue, uh, that funding so that we're replacing devices, um, every five years.

82
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:22,507
We also would like to increase school supplies.

83
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:35,412
I believe the principal's office supply budgets are underfunded.

84
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:43,475
The vocational technical school, their supply budgets are underfunded.

85
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:47,797
And they're able to supplement their supply budgets

86
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:58,749
tuition account they have, but that tuition account is steadily being drained.

87
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:13,560
And because of the popularity of that program with our students, there's very few seats available to take people from the outside.

88
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,304
So we want to make sure that they have the supply budgets they need.

89
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,725
going forward and not have to rely on that other source of funding.

90
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:30,409
And then we're hoping to launch a fine arts summer program.

91
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,975
And it could be that this program would be grant funded.

92
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,277
I know the fine arts

93
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:45,253
director is looking to get grant funding for that.

94
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:49,154
But it would be similar to the Jump Start program, which is music focused.

95
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:53,596
And that would take place this summer.

96
00:12:57,058 --> 00:13:01,340
So all in all, those slides, they add up to $7.5 million.

97
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,501
When I did give this presentation to the

98
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:28,759
unions, I realized that this figure did not include the ESSER funding, so they will probably notice that this funding is a little bit higher than what I showed them last week.

99
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,021
And then

100
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:45,202
We had gone over the Chapter 70, but I thought it was worth noting that, unfortunately, Chapter 70 isn't gonna be a good source of revenue for us this year.

101
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:59,025
Right now, the legislature is still deliberating on the state budget, but based on the governor's budget, the allocation for MedFed,

102
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:05,206
as an increase over what we got in FY24 was a little over $135,000.

103
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:18,914
And that's primarily because our foundation enrollment has dipped down from 24 to FY25.

104
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:28,399
The foundation budget went up by $1.7 million, the required district

105
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,432
contribution went up by 2.7 million.

106
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,654
Chapter 70 went up a tick.

107
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:38,960
And our net school spending actually went up by 2.9 million.

108
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:50,372
And that's because in calculating the foundation budget, our state aid should actually go down

109
00:14:51,991 --> 00:15:06,678
But because Massachusetts holds school districts harmless from any decreases, they never reduce the amount of Chapter 70 that you're already receiving.

110
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:12,801
But they do require you to spend that extra amount in the coming school year.

111
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:18,264
So that's why this is 1.7 is a little bit different than 2.9.

112
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,063
So how are we going to try to close this gap?

113
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,726
We will have a city appropriation.

114
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:42,734
We are planning to implement a couple of fees to the programs that use the schools.

115
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:50,680
One's a facility expense fee and one's for administrative overhead for

116
00:15:51,772 --> 00:16:00,474
the provision of business office services, human resource services, and technology services.

117
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:07,375
So that can offset some of the spending.

118
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:14,357
And I'm estimating right now that it could be as much as $200,000 that we could help with closing that gap.

119
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:40,031
We're also looking at these programs that we do charge and have revolving funds balances to make sure we're maximizing the use of those funds.

120
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:49,736
And for example, I don't think we've been charging the MEAP tuition account

121
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:52,634
to the fullest extent we can.

122
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:59,156
So we may have an opportunity to kind of add some staff for one or two years to that program.

123
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:03,297
So we're looking at those revolving funds for those opportunities.

124
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:19,402
We are considering increasing fees, potentially for athletics, but also for the outside groups that rent our facilities.

125
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:34,179
to make sure we're recouping the actual cost to the district to provide those spaces and just making sure that we are fully utilizing our grant funds.

126
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,180
We're not turning any funds back.

127
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:46,083
Now, then we have to look at, you know, where can we

128
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:58,725
reprioritize funding within our existing budget to reduce funding in one area so we can increase funding in other areas.

129
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,206
And so we are looking at class sizes.

130
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:12,852
When class sizes are low or teachers are underutilized, we're trying to see if we can take some savings there.

131
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:15,093
And

132
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:32,821
You know, when you look at class size, it doesn't mean you're just reducing the number of positions you have, because you will also find that you have to add positions in certain areas to kind of maintain a reasonable class size.

133
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:43,125
We're looking at our administrative staffing structure to see if there's any opportunities to consolidate

134
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:49,131
the supervision that we provide.

135
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:58,779
Of course, there's a whole administrative support staff that supports that administrative staffing.

136
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:06,085
So that would also present opportunities to kind of reorganize that area.

137
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:10,709
And then we have to look at, you know,

138
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,272
our new spending proposals as well.

139
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:25,420
At the end of this process, we may not be able to afford all the spending that we're projecting.

140
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,785
So with the ESSA-funded positions, can we bring 21 positions over?

141
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:38,369
I think they're needed, but we might have to re-look at that

142
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:45,447
get the cost of that transfer to the general fund down.

143
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:57,816
Those underfunded accounts, I think they need to be adjusted because we'll just be scrambling.

144
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:10,366
We're not reducing the spending in those accounts and we're just scrambling all the time to kind of grab funds from other areas to make those accounts full.

145
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:22,548
but we could possibly, you know, take a two-step approach and try to fund it over a couple of fiscal years.

146
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:32,015
You know, any increases to those funds are gonna kind of make any shortfalls a little bit easier to manage.

147
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:38,320
And then also looking at our proposed new spending to,

148
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:47,773
trim that back if we can't afford to do all that we want to do in that area.

149
00:20:54,378 --> 00:21:01,122
And then we'll hopefully in the next, we have to get our budget proposal finalized.

150
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:09,328
We have to get it in shape so that we can get it printed, but we're still having another

151
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,883
committee at the whole meeting in April, at the end of April.

152
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:38,157
And at that meeting, we'll be able to talk about whatever sources of outside funding outside of the city appropriation that we could introduce into this budget, along with any other questions the committee might have.

153
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:46,119
We have our public hearing on May 6th, so we'll be able to provide a very detailed proposal at that time.

154
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:59,912
And then of course, on May 13th, we are expecting that at a special meeting, we'll be able to vote on the budget and then submit it to the mayor.

155
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,537
So I'm happy to,

156
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:09,096
to answer any questions people might have at this time.

157
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,457
Thank you, CFO McHugh.

158
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:21,018
I'm going to open it up to the committee for questions.

159
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:27,340
Let me just... Member Graham?

160
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:29,467
Thank you.

161
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,309
Thank you, Jerry, for all this information.

162
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:48,378
I had a couple of questions, but before I ask my questions, I just wanted to reiterate, I know we have a big audience here and we have a lot of new members, so I just wanted to reiterate our typical process, which is our budget is a two-step process.

163
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:52,541
So our budget is first made up of, you know,

164
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:56,979
information about what our request to the municipality is.

165
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:01,420
And that number I think is sort of coming out of what I'm hearing tonight.

166
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
And I'll talk about that in just a minute once I get some clarifications.

167
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:16,843
But the first thing the school committee does is tell the municipal government what we believe we need to educate children, maximize outcomes and run the school district responsibly next year.

168
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:19,344
So that's one vote that we typically take.

169
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:26,255
The second vote that we typically take is a reconciliation vote.

170
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:38,950
So essentially, if there is a discrepancy between what we have requested from the municipality and what the municipality allocates to us in the single line item allocation to our operating budget,

171
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,637
then it is incumbent on the school committee to operate within that allocation.

172
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:50,907
So if there is a discrepancy, we then have to identify how do we get from what our request is to how we will actually go forward.

173
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,189
So that's our process.

174
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,094
I think what I'm seeing in terms of the timeline is that

175
00:23:56,815 --> 00:24:07,448
We certainly could be in a position to take a vote about our request to the municipality as early as May 6, but we could also do that on May 13.

176
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:14,036
And then our final vote has typically been much, much later in terms of

177
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:17,978
that reconciliation vote, but doesn't have to be.

178
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:23,700
So it is, I think it is possible we could do that even as early as May 13th as well.

179
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:36,986
Although if the council hasn't started their conversation around the budget and there is still like movement happening around the city's budget overall, like we may not want to take that reconciliation vote in the event that there is a gap.

180
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:49,253
So, and I think we know, and we've been informed by the city CFO that there will be a gap because the initial allocation for the school district, according to the city CFO is $73,500,000.

181
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,854
Last year, our allocation was $71,200,000.

182
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:53,716
It's a little bit more complicated than that because we were using $2.8 million

183
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:06,644
on operating expenses from our ESSER budget.

184
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:12,507
And that was necessary last year because the operating budget couldn't support the operating needs.

185
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:21,653
So it was a conscious decision, as were all the decisions that we've made about ESSER spending and are being made across the country and have been for years.

186
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:25,075
So people are, you know, while you don't want to use one-time funds to

187
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:30,478
support things that have ongoing expense.

188
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:37,059
ESSER afforded districts an opportunity to say, what do our kids need?

189
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:52,784
And in a place where 80 to 85% of the activity and the spending is on humans to educate kids, it's inevitable that that spending would also require people who are really more considered part of the operating budget.

190
00:25:53,924 --> 00:26:00,786
I did have a couple of questions because I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how some of these groups, these buckets break down.

191
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:08,508
Jerry, there was a slide that you showed before the ESSER slide that tallied up to 1.3.

192
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,949
Can you just bring that slide up again for me?

193
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:28,954
Did we lose Jerry?

194
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:30,715
No, I'm back.

195
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,215
Okay.

196
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:34,756
I got a deal with an issue with payroll.

197
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:35,716
Sorry.

198
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:36,777
That's okay.

199
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:42,958
I was wondering if you could bring back up the slide that came before the ESSER slide.

200
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,319
Yeah.

201
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:03,648
This is it.

202
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,191
I can't see anything just yet.

203
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,837
No, can't see it.

204
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:18,058
No, not yet.

205
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:19,980
All right.

206
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:42,343
Coming now.

207
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:43,384
OK.

208
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:44,865
Ah, thank you.

209
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:47,427
OK, so those are the underfunded accounts.

210
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:48,207
And these are

211
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:57,916
Okay, got it.

212
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:04,861
So these are underfunded accounts and it seems like there's maybe some overlap here with some of the other slides.

213
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:05,521
Is that right?

214
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:16,448
Like when I think about substitute teachers, I think about that ESSER bucket because that is where the substitute teachers were put last year in order to balance our budget last year.

215
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:20,590
So- It is separate.

216
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,431
It is?

217
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,773
The ESSER funded positions are,

218
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,346
full-time building substitutes.

219
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:29,706
Okay.

220
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:34,308
So each school has one full-time building substitute.

221
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:38,249
The high school has three, I believe.

222
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:46,152
And then there's another line, district-wide line, that funds

223
00:28:48,166 --> 00:29:00,790
substitute teachers that are paid the daily rate or teachers that I use to sub and miss their prep.

224
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,492
They get paid for a miss prep if they substitute during that prep.

225
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:08,052
Got it.

226
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:08,413
Thank you.

227
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:08,913
That's helpful.

228
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:26,517
And then on your next slide about ESSER conversion, when I look at this list, I think there are at least some number of these positions that are absolutely not discretionary.

229
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,980
So I think specifically about the newcomers program, right?

230
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,381
So.

231
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:30,821
Correct.

232
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,803
We can't not spend that money.

233
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:52,559
Are there other of these 21.2 staff people that are in what is more likely a non-discretionary bucket rather than a bucket where we could operate the district, not that we should, but we could operate the district without that line item?

234
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:02,519
The adjustment counselors are based on need.

235
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:15,051
And I think likely what happened was that we had a need to add more in FY24, and there was no bandwidth in the general fund to do that.

236
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,573
So they were placed on ESSA.

237
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:20,416
We'd have to take a look.

238
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,259
I've done a lot of work.

239
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:29,494
that kind of a caseload analysis for guidance counselors and adjustment counselors and our psychologists.

240
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:52,301
And I think the adjustment, Medfit is doing probably better than other districts in that they're kind of maintaining a ratio of about 250 students per counselor, which is what their national association recommends.

241
00:30:54,181 --> 00:31:02,725
very few districts can, for instance, the average in Massachusetts is about 344 students per counselor.

242
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:17,753
But we all know that there are mental health issues still lingering amongst our students with coming out of COVID.

243
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:19,293
And so I would be,

244
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,594
I would advocate to kind of maintain the current staffing there.

245
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:32,019
The grants manager, we only have one grants manager for the district and we have a number of grants that have to be managed.

246
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,460
I would say that's important.

247
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:45,467
The behavior para is something that the guidance department recommended that we retain.

248
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:49,430
You know, that might be,

249
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,650
a slightly lower priority than some of the others.

250
00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:05,594
The newcomers program, you just, you can't, we have an obligation to provide programming for English learner students.

251
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:13,536
We get reviewed by the state every year to make sure we're in compliance.

252
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,297
And so we would need to,

253
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,121
for sure bring that program into the general fund.

254
00:32:23,222 --> 00:32:28,484
The literacy interventionist is again, is probably like the adjustment counselors.

255
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:37,507
There was probably a need that couldn't be handled on the general fund in 24.

256
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:45,770
That may or may not be kind of a lower tier priority than some of the others.

257
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:56,753
The building substitutes, we just have such a problem with attracting the number of substitutes we need.

258
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:04,958
I know the school committee is kind of looking at that issue as a whole.

259
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:15,505
And the other thing that we kind of haven't tackled with, but it's kind of still on my list and I don't know how we can address it is that

260
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:24,000
We have to take a serious look at the rates that we pay our daily subs and our long-term subs.

261
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:37,650
Many school districts in our surrounding area have had to come to grips with the fact that the days of $75, $85 a day for substitutes is long gone.

262
00:33:45,701 --> 00:34:00,029
even 125 would be low for a daily sub, but you could, it may entice some of our retired teachers to come back and provide those services if needed.

263
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,751
Long-term subs are getting, you know, 250, $275 a day.

264
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:04,752
So that has to be looked at.

265
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:05,292
You know, I'm gonna be

266
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:26,014
recommending some increase to the substitute program, but it doesn't really factor in any kind of rate increases.

267
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:30,138
The re-engagement specialist is going to be needed.

268
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:31,819
We have three on ESSA now.

269
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,322
We're only proposing to bring one

270
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:53,386
back into the general fund and that's because we, these positions do kind of took on the role of or included duties that would be found in a kind of an attendance officer position.

271
00:34:54,327 --> 00:35:02,152
And so there's still a need to have somebody who's kind of responsible for attendance officer duties.

272
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:12,474
And that would be the re-engagement specialist that we're proposing to bring into the general fund.

273
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:24,583
And professional development, we talked about earlier that there should be some amount of money right now in ESSA, there's $110,000 for professional development.

274
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:31,568
And this figure of 1.3 assumes that we'd bring the whole 110

275
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:38,012
into the budget that could probably be shaved a little bit.

276
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:47,259
But for a district this size with this many staff, it's kind of a low number.

277
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:54,585
I think the allocation in the foundation budget is well over a million dollars for professional development.

278
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,046
And no school district

279
00:35:56,914 --> 00:35:58,315
spends what they're allocated.

280
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:15,031
But it just shows you what, in the development of the foundation budget, what the plan is deemed to be kind of an appropriate professional development expense for MedFed.

281
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:17,153
Sure, thank you.

282
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:21,617
And then can you look at, can you go to the new spending page, the $1.4 million page?

283
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:33,932
So again, some of this is not optional, right?

284
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:38,313
Like our tuition increase is not optional.

285
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:42,213
And our NEASC funding is not optional.

286
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,514
Is that right?

287
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:45,274
Yeah.

288
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:45,514
Okay.

289
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:51,875
I would put the technology expense not optional.

290
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:56,296
You know, the Chromebooks now are just like textbooks 10 years ago.

291
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:13,276
You just, every student's gonna have one, and the whole teaching dynamic has shifted to be able to utilize the technology, the applications that are on it.

292
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:20,800
Many books now that we buy are online, have an online feature, so.

293
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:26,304
Yes, I would include that.

294
00:37:27,082 --> 00:37:30,543
So you're saying the Chromebook refresh is the one that you're talking about?

295
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:32,284
Or are you also talking about- Yeah, and the Apple refresh.

296
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:34,425
I would say that that has to be done.

297
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:40,667
Those devices do not last forever.

298
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:48,710
And you don't wanna be in a position where some students have a device that works and some don't.

299
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:50,871
If I may just- Right.

300
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:53,392
Member Graham, may I ask a question?

301
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:55,554
Sure.

302
00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:59,997
Just on the Chromebooks and the Apple Refresh, which I think are actual pieces of equipment.

303
00:38:00,897 --> 00:38:03,099
Jerry, what are we estimating for that?

304
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:10,324
Because that I would think would be something that would fall on the capital improvement plan if it isn't there already.

305
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:12,585
Yeah.

306
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:20,050
I think it's a little over 400,000.

307
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:24,646
Okay.

308
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:25,687
Yeah.

309
00:38:25,747 --> 00:38:39,055
And I think the, you know, I guess Medford has always treated those things as capital, but when you talk about Chromebooks in the same vein as textbooks, like they're, they really aren't capital expenses anymore.

310
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:43,598
They're like expenses that they're it's equipment that depreciates every year.

311
00:38:44,719 --> 00:39:05,855
typical organization like you would you would handle that depreciation in your operating budget so I mean ideally what districts should be doing is having a an amount of money in the budget every year so that there's a cycle and we don't have these big massive changes that have to happen where we have to replace every Chromebook at the same time but instead in some sort of a

312
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,935
like a rolling function.

313
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:15,322
So I will just wrap up my set of questions by saying last year, our budget was $71.2 million.

314
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:22,266
And then we had ESSER of $2.8 million.

315
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:35,170
But if I start from that $71.2 million of last year, and I add up all the things that Jerry described as spending needs, I get $7.5 million for a total of $78,700,000.

316
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,630
And that is,

317
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:53,944
a big distance away from $73.5 million that was preliminarily provided to us.

318
00:39:54,544 --> 00:40:03,949
And I also wanna point out that the amount preliminarily provided to us is a $2.3 million increase, which actually doesn't even account for- 3.2, opposite.

319
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:03,949
3.2?

320
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:04,709
You said 2.3.

321
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:17,849
3.2, okay, so that barely covers our contractual obligations.

322
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:22,572
73.5 minus 71.2.

323
00:40:22,612 --> 00:40:23,072
I have 2.3.

324
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:37,136
3.2%, is that what you mean, Mayor?

325
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:37,257
Yes, 3.2%.

326
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:38,098
I'm talking about dollars.

327
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:39,259
So in dollars, that's $2,300,000.

328
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,301
Our contractual obligations are $2.8 million.

329
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,477
So thank you, Jerry, for all this work.

330
00:40:55,857 --> 00:40:57,159
It's very helpful.

331
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:57,719
Thank you.

332
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,623
I'm sorry, if I can call a point of information real quick.

333
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:04,968
Jerry, when you mentioned long term sub pay, did you say that they were making $275 a day?

334
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:10,935
Remember, on top of with a point of information.

335
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,136
Yeah.

336
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:14,517
Could you repeat that?

337
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:15,598
Sure.

338
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:16,359
Sorry about that.

339
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:23,145
When you mentioned long-term substitute pay, you mentioned $275 a day.

340
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:26,709
Were you mentioning to this current budget or the proposed budget?

341
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:27,630
No.

342
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:35,778
I was suggesting that some school departments have increased their rates into that

343
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:42,255
kind of mark that that's more of the market right now for a long term sub.

344
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:52,417
So a long term sub would be somebody that we would hire because we have a teacher that goes on maternity leave.

345
00:41:54,557 --> 00:42:01,839
And they may be in there for, you know, three or four or five months, and they'd be required to go

346
00:42:03,217 --> 00:42:09,779
to faculty meetings and provide lesson plans and things like that.

347
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:10,639
Right.

348
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,100
Okay.

349
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,740
Sorry, I just wanted to clarify because I wasn't sure if I heard.

350
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,041
I think we pay $120 per day.

351
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:23,944
It's $100 because I will give a personal connection that my partner is a long-term.

352
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:28,065
I'm not thinking that we should go all the way to there, but we do have to

353
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:30,802
think about increasing those rates?

354
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:34,545
Absolutely, because it's like $80 a day with tax.

355
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,487
So I definitely could see the burden of that.

356
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,729
But I wanted to clarify because I wasn't sure if I misheard you.

357
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:40,229
Thank you.

358
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:42,471
Thank you.

359
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:43,512
Is there any questions?

360
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:45,653
Other questions?

361
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:46,514
Member Rousseau?

362
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:49,496
Thank you.

363
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:55,480
I know the point has been made about devices, Chromebooks being treated as capital.

364
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,422
I just, you know,

365
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:06,576
My first experience of Medford as a district was a very long time ago when we were voting whether to buy computers.

366
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:08,977
I don't know, this was at least a decade ago.

367
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:12,199
City Council was voting because it was capital then.

368
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:18,542
And if we can't get this in there as part of our budget, it's

369
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:22,343
It's just not okay.

370
00:43:22,363 --> 00:43:28,125
I mean, we're doing so much here to bring stuff into the budget that should be in the budget, that should have always been in the budget.

371
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:35,668
And to leave behind a day-to-day use item that is literally a critical part of education doesn't make any sense to me.

372
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:39,389
So I just want to support that that number needs to be in the budget.

373
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:40,069
Thank you.

374
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:49,573
Any other questions from the committee before I open up to the floor?

375
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:56,334
I know we have 115 people on, so we'll give anybody who wants to talk two minutes.

376
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:03,038
Anthony Guillen, who already has his name and address for the record, if we could unmute.

377
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:06,900
All right, thank you very much.

378
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,721
My name is Anthony Guillen, 45 Elm Hill Avenue, Levenson, Massachusetts.

379
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:12,302
I am the president of the Medicine and Teaching Association.

380
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:15,424
Jerry, thank you for the presentation.

381
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,785
I just wanted to ask a few questions.

382
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:18,805
Number one,

383
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:28,446
there was listed that nine of the ESSER positions were looking to be let go, and the unfilled literacy coaches count for four of them.

384
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:35,371
So do you have the list of the remaining five that were to be cut?

385
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:40,996
I didn't get that question.

386
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:41,556
I'm sorry.

387
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:42,337
Sure.

388
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:46,780
So you mentioned looking to bring over some ESSER positions.

389
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:50,687
and if I got my notes right, you have nine positions you are looking to let go.

390
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:56,108
We can count the four unhired literacy coaches against that.

391
00:44:56,628 --> 00:45:03,350
Do you have the other five positions that were to be not brought over into the regular budget from the ESSER funds?

392
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,551
Yeah, I don't have it off the top of my head.

393
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:15,673
Well, there were two, in addition to the literacy coaches, there were two re-engagement specialists

394
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:23,893
But I can provide that to you, Anthony.

395
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:26,796
Very good on that one.

396
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:40,707
Are there, is the list of programs that paid to the district to use the facilities as well as the grants we are currently receiving a matter of public record or would that be something we'd need to request?

397
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,711
Oh, go ahead.

398
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:49,894
Just repeat that question, Mr. Hugh.

399
00:45:50,354 --> 00:46:03,863
If I was looking for a list of programs that pay to the district, such as the Japanese school that uses the high school on the weekends, or a list of grants that the school receives, is that a matter of public record or something I would have to request?

400
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,224
Yes, it's public record.

401
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:06,745
Okay, very good.

402
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:10,548
Let's see.

403
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:23,257
And finally, as far as the plan for the budget to be available, I know that you're looking to finalize that.

404
00:46:24,578 --> 00:46:36,126
Will that be sent to the unions for review when it is sent to, before it becomes public, a matter of a public meeting?

405
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:45,329
Well, I'm not sure what the practice is in MedFed, but I don't have a problem with doing that.

406
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,711
Okay, I'll send you a request then.

407
00:46:48,731 --> 00:46:50,012
Mr. Hain, can you repeat the question?

408
00:46:50,032 --> 00:46:50,852
I'm sorry I missed that.

409
00:46:51,393 --> 00:47:06,001
I was just looking to see, once the proposed budget is completed, there is usually a time in which the union receives it, but this timeline seems quite moved up from last year, so I was just making sure that

410
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:15,022
the union and its leadership will receive a copy of the proposed budget before it becomes a matter of public, like a matter of the public meeting you hold.

411
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:16,764
Got it.

412
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,245
I think that's outlined in the contract, right?

413
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:23,008
It is, but not specifically when.

414
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:24,309
Got it.

415
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:24,690
Okay.

416
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:25,590
Thank you.

417
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,951
All right.

418
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:29,153
Thank you.

419
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,174
Thank you very much.

420
00:47:32,896 --> 00:47:33,336
Member Rousseau?

421
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:57,029
Thank you, I just wanted to clarify, when Mr. Guillen was asking about the programs and the chargebacks, which is what Mr. McHugh was talking about earlier, we're not talking about like the rentals, we're talking about meat, we're talking about afterschool, the food services program.

422
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:03,813
In this presentation, I don't think we're talking about rentals in any way, shape or form, unless I'm misunderstanding.

423
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:10,846
I think he's still asking for the amount we bring in for rentals, just for their knowledge.

424
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:12,567
Of course, that's fine.

425
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:18,270
I just wanted to make sure that relevant to this presentation, that won't be included in this particular set of numbers.

426
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,253
Because we can't just dip into that money to use it.

427
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:24,934
There are restrictions.

428
00:48:25,374 --> 00:48:32,999
And at the last committee of the whole, that was part of the revenue presentation.

429
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:39,258
the revolving funds that we maintain, we get private grants as well as state and federal grants.

430
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:43,299
But that can be provided.

431
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,100
Thank you.

432
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:47,201
Thank you.

433
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:48,621
Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

434
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:53,243
Any further questions from the committee or public?

435
00:48:53,383 --> 00:49:01,046
I know we have another meeting, two meetings on Monday the 8th, a regular meeting and a committee of the whole meeting.

436
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:12,642
and our next budget, we have Mr. McHugh did put up a slide up for our next two or three budget hearing meeting.

437
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:14,683
So those will be on the website as well.

438
00:49:17,983 --> 00:49:18,963
Is there a motion on the floor?

439
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:24,125
Motion to adjourn.

440
00:49:24,765 --> 00:49:26,185
I remember Graham seconded by.

441
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:29,666
I can second.

442
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:30,832
Thank you.

443
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,894
Member Brantley, roll call, please.

444
00:49:32,974 --> 00:49:33,635
Member Russo?

445
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:35,056
Member Brantley?

446
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:38,419
Yes.

447
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:40,561
Vice Chair Graham?

448
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:41,402
Yes.

449
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,244
Member Itapa?

450
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:44,125
Yes.

451
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:46,186
Member Olopade?

452
00:49:46,807 --> 00:49:47,067
Yes.

453
00:49:48,108 --> 00:49:48,809
Member Rheinfeld?

454
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:49,590
Yes.

455
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:52,052
Member Russo, yes.

456
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:52,853
Mayor Lengelker?

457
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:53,433
Yes.

458
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:54,214
I'm in the affirmative.
