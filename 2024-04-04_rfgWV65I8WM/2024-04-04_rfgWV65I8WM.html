    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=0.109s">presentation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1.19s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=3.771s">Mr.</a>  McHugh.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=5.312s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=6.092s">Um,</a>  good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=9.013s">Uh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=9.754s">Tonight</a>  we'll kind of review some of the, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=17.177s">Budgetary</a>  issues with grappling with and kind of our thought <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=32.037s">marshal</a>  resources, new revenue or savings within our current budget to meet those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=48.787s">So</a>  just a quick review. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=51.269s">This</a>  is gonna be similar to a presentation I gave to our union leadership last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=60.214s">We</a>  know that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=62.785s">Our</a>  class size, our enrollment is growing in the elementary grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=70.588s">We're</a>  projecting for now that kindergarten will be relatively the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=77.33s">We</a>  still continue to lose a few students at the middle and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=83.432s">And</a>  then kind of a deeper dive into what's going on at elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=90.746s">With</a>  the exception of grade two, which is an outlier, that happened to be a very smaller than usual birth year when those students finally got to kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=105.614s">But</a>  you can see in grades one and grades three, there's significant increase in those grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=113.919s">Hasn't</a>  really hit grade four, grade five this year, but we expect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=121.49s">Well,</a>  we project the grade three, this is a projection of what it's gonna be in 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=128.534s">So</a>  next year we expect to see that continued growth into grade four and then eventually grade five. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=141.302s">And</a>  then we kind of review a class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=144.424s">Now</a>  this is based on this year back in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=150.655s">And</a>  it's taking a look at the general ed classes across the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=158.677s">So</a>  different grade levels might be slightly more, slightly less, but this is the average class sizes in general ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=169.961s">So</a>  for instance, you see the McGlynn Middle is down, but that's because they have <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=177.714s">significant</a>  enrollment in the newcomers program, which is not part of this analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=187.379s">At</a>  the high school too, I did a review of their master schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=194.263s">And</a>  to be honest, it's a little bit difficult to know kind of all the ins and outs of how they schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=203.588s">But</a>  I think in general, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=207.685s">I'm</a>  in the ballpark for what the class sizes are generally, but they could be more or less if I had kind of a more precise, if I could do a more precise analysis on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=227.302s">So</a>  that's just data points for how we're approaching the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=237.069s">I</a>  outlined kind of four buckets of spending that I think we need to address this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=246.317s">First</a>  of all, we have our salary commitments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=250.0s">We</a>  have a number of contracts that we're already under contract for FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=256.486s">And</a>  for those contracts, just the cost alone is $2.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=265.731s">Then</a>  we have three other unions whose contracts will be expiring at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=274.295s">And</a>  of course, non-unit personnel go on a year-to-year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=279.398s">And</a>  we're estimating $735,000 needs to be set aside to be able to negotiate at the bargaining table. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=296.929s">We've</a>  talked about in previous meetings that we've identified a handful of accounts that are significantly underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=308.018s">Homeless</a>  transportation would be one of them, substitute teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=314.063s">Special</a>  education summer school needs to be increased based on the number of students we're serving in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=326.3s">legal</a>  expense budget we talked about hasn't really kept up with the spending that is hitting that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=337.126s">And</a>  then of course, facilities, building repairs and custodial supplies have been kind of chronically underfunded for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=345.791s">So</a>  the total of those would be an estimated hit on the budget of $1.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=355.632s">The</a>  other bucket or the third bucket would be ESSER funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=362.075s">So</a>  there's a lot of positions that are on this budget that are essential to the operation of the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=375.142s">The</a>  biggest one of these is our whole ELL or number of the majority positions for the ELL <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=385.871s">newcomers</a>  program is funded at the McGlynn is funded in ESSA currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=395.215s">We</a>  have adjustment counselors, we have all our building substitutes throughout the district are funded on ESSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=405.558s">Professional</a>  development was no, there was no room in the budget this year to have a professional development line and that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=415.583s">very</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=417.985s">So</a>  we're projecting that we have to bring 21.2 positions funded in ESSA into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=429.713s">We're</a>  going to let go of about nine positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=436.138s">Some</a>  of those are currently vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=440.901s">For</a>  instance, there were four literacy coaches that were not filled <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=446.487s">this</a>  year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=451.089s">But</a>  the impact again is 1.3 for this group on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=459.833s">And</a>  then we've identified kind of the big ticket items that we would look for new spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=472.719s">One</a>  is we know that through rate setting that all our <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=477.201s">Out-of-district</a>  tuitions for special needs is increasing by 4.69%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=486.686s">We</a>  would want to put in additional funding into the facilities department so we can start to undertake some planning, provide proper project management to those projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=506.141s">conduct</a>  building inspections, re-commissioning projects are essential to kind of inform our capital needs and get those buildings back into kind of the condition that they were designed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=527.291s">Similarly,</a>  you know, there's little bandwidth to do our technology <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=533.976s">upgrade</a>  our network and keep that current. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=539.219s">There's</a>  all kinds of servers, routers, all kinds of connection points that make the network work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=549.083s">We</a>  have, it's a, you know, mission critical activity that we have to, not only for just communication between <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=562.546s">schools</a>  and department heads, but our students are on computers now, they're taking tests, they're doing research. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=570.228s">So</a>  it's essential to kind of keep that network well-maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=576.29s">The</a>  high school is undergoing an accreditation process, which they've begun this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=582.812s">There</a>  was some funding provided for kind of the pre-planning that needs to go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=588.534s">But</a>  during the accreditation year, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=592.85s">The</a>  high school will be required to host a delegation that will conduct the accreditation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=600.575s">We</a>  will be required to provide food and lodging for them while they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=605.598s">And</a>  so we're gonna provide the funds to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=612.462s">Another</a>  area that we want to address this year is the need to kind of refresh our technology for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=623.559s">We</a>  were able to buy a lot of Chromebooks and Apple tablets back when we were flush with COVID funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=638.53s">There</a>  was a lot of school from home, and it was essential to get that technology out to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=648.738s">But</a>  those devices are, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=653.217s">uh,</a>  coming to the end of the useful life. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=656.319s">So</a>  we, we, um, proposing to implement a plan to refresh about 20% of our, uh, device inventory in FY 25, and then continue, uh, that funding so that we're replacing devices, um, every five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=679.926s">We</a>  also would like to increase school supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=682.607s">I</a>  believe the principal's office supply budgets are underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=695.552s">The</a>  vocational technical school, their supply budgets are underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=703.895s">And</a>  they're able to supplement their supply budgets <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=709.042s">tuition</a>  account they have, but that tuition account is steadily being drained. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=723.053s">And</a>  because of the popularity of that program with our students, there's very few seats available to take people from the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=733.66s">So</a>  we want to make sure that they have the supply budgets they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=738.82s">going</a>  forward and not have to rely on that other source of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=746.186s">And</a>  then we're hoping to launch a fine arts summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=751.39s">And</a>  it could be that this program would be grant funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=757.075s">I</a>  know the fine arts <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=762.031s">director</a>  is looking to get grant funding for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=765.313s">But</a>  it would be similar to the Jump Start program, which is music focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=770.535s">And</a>  that would take place this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=777.058s">So</a>  all in all, those slides, they add up to $7.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=781.36s">When</a>  I did give this presentation to the <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=792.151s">unions,</a>  I realized that this figure did not include the ESSER funding, so they will probably notice that this funding is a little bit higher than what I showed them last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=811.34s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=813.34s">We</a>  had gone over the Chapter 70, but I thought it was worth noting that, unfortunately, Chapter 70 isn't gonna be a good source of revenue for us this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=826.783s">Right</a>  now, the legislature is still deliberating on the state budget, but based on the governor's budget, the allocation for MedFed, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=840.623s">as</a>  an increase over what we got in FY24 was a little over $135,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=845.246s">And</a>  that's primarily because our foundation enrollment has dipped down from 24 to FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=863.436s">The</a>  foundation budget went up by $1.7 million, the required district <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=868.749s">contribution</a>  went up by 2.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=871.892s">Chapter</a>  70 went up a tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=874.615s">And</a>  our net school spending actually went up by 2.9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=880.622s">And</a>  that's because in calculating the foundation budget, our state aid should actually go down <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=891.991s">But</a>  because Massachusetts holds school districts harmless from any decreases, they never reduce the amount of Chapter 70 that you're already receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=907.458s">But</a>  they do require you to spend that extra amount in the coming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=913.421s">So</a>  that's why this is 1.7 is a little bit different than 2.9. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=922.56s">So</a>  how are we going to try to close this gap? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=929.885s">We</a>  will have a city appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=934.388s">We</a>  are planning to implement a couple of fees to the programs that use the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=944.415s">One's</a>  a facility expense fee and one's for administrative overhead for <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=951.772s">the</a>  provision of business office services, human resource services, and technology services. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=963.014s">So</a>  that can offset some of the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=967.615s">And</a>  I'm estimating right now that it could be as much as $200,000 that we could help with closing that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=982.661s">We're</a>  also looking at these programs that we do charge and have revolving funds balances to make sure we're maximizing the use of those funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1002.012s">And</a>  for example, I don't think we've been charging the MEAP tuition account <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1010.953s">to</a>  the fullest extent we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1012.654s">So</a>  we may have an opportunity to kind of add some staff for one or two years to that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1019.196s">So</a>  we're looking at those revolving funds for those opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1024.857s">We</a>  are considering increasing fees, potentially for athletics, but also for the outside groups that rent our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1040.374s">to</a>  make sure we're recouping the actual cost to the district to provide those spaces and just making sure that we are fully utilizing our grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1054.579s">We're</a>  not turning any funds back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1060.941s">Now,</a>  then we have to look at, you know, where can we <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1067.939s">reprioritize</a>  funding within our existing budget to reduce funding in one area so we can increase funding in other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1079.545s">And</a>  so we are looking at class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1083.407s">When</a>  class sizes are low or teachers are underutilized, we're trying to see if we can take some savings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1094.993s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1097.335s">You</a>  know, when you look at class size, it doesn't mean you're just reducing the number of positions you have, because you will also find that you have to add positions in certain areas to kind of maintain a reasonable class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1114.021s">We're</a>  looking at our administrative staffing structure to see if there's any opportunities to consolidate <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1126.949s">the</a>  supervision that we provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1129.151s">Of</a>  course, there's a whole administrative support staff that supports that administrative staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1138.839s">So</a>  that would also present opportunities to kind of reorganize that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1148.407s">And</a>  then we have to look at, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1151.65s">our</a>  new spending proposals as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1155.593s">At</a>  the end of this process, we may not be able to afford all the spending that we're projecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1165.44s">So</a>  with the ESSA-funded positions, can we bring 21 positions over? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1173.686s">I</a>  think they're needed, but we might have to re-look at that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1181.584s">get</a>  the cost of that transfer to the general fund down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1187.909s">Those</a>  underfunded accounts, I think they need to be adjusted because we'll just be scrambling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1198.397s">We're</a>  not reducing the spending in those accounts and we're just scrambling all the time to kind of grab funds from other areas to make those accounts full. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1211.459s">but</a>  we could possibly, you know, take a two-step approach and try to fund it over a couple of fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1224.909s">You</a>  know, any increases to those funds are gonna kind of make any shortfalls a little bit easier to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1234.577s">And</a>  then also looking at our proposed new spending to, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1240.708s">trim</a>  that back if we can't afford to do all that we want to do in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1254.378s">And</a>  then we'll hopefully in the next, we have to get our budget proposal finalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1261.142s">We</a>  have to get it in shape so that we can get it printed, but we're still having another <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1270.0s">committee</a>  at the whole meeting in April, at the end of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1274.903s">And</a>  at that meeting, we'll be able to talk about whatever sources of outside funding outside of the city appropriation that we could introduce into this budget, along with any other questions the committee might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1299.093s">We</a>  have our public hearing on May 6th, so we'll be able to provide a very detailed proposal at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1307.14s">And</a>  then of course, on May 13th, we are expecting that at a special meeting, we'll be able to vote on the budget and then submit it to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1324.256s">So</a>  I'm happy to, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1326.055s">to</a>  answer any questions people might have at this time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1333.037s">Thank</a>  you, CFO McHugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1336.978s">I'm</a>  going to open it up to the committee for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1341.139s">Let</a>  me just... Member Graham?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1349.087s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1350.248s">Thank</a>  you, Jerry, for all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1353.85s">I</a>  had a couple of questions, but before I ask my questions, I just wanted to reiterate, I know we have a big audience here and we have a lot of new members, so I just wanted to reiterate our typical process, which is our budget is a two-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1368.418s">So</a>  our budget is first made up of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1373.658s">information</a>  about what our request to the municipality is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1377.139s">And</a>  that number I think is sort of coming out of what I'm hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1381.84s">And</a>  I'll talk about that in just a minute once I get some clarifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1384.461s">But</a>  the first thing the school committee does is tell the municipal government what we believe we need to educate children, maximize outcomes and run the school district responsibly next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1396.923s">So</a>  that's one vote that we typically take. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1400.748s">The</a>  second vote that we typically take is a reconciliation vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1406.335s">So</a>  essentially, if there is a discrepancy between what we have requested from the municipality and what the municipality allocates to us in the single line item allocation to our operating budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1419.551s">then</a>  it is incumbent on the school committee to operate within that allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1423.757s">So</a>  if there is a discrepancy, we then have to identify how do we get from what our request is to how we will actually go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1431.007s">So</a>  that's our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1433.33s">I</a>  think what I'm seeing in terms of the timeline is that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1436.815s">We</a>  certainly could be in a position to take a vote about our request to the municipality as early as May 6, but we could also do that on May 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1448.529s">And</a>  then our final vote has typically been much, much later in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1455.197s">that</a>  reconciliation vote, but doesn't have to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1458.038s">So</a>  it is, I think it is possible we could do that even as early as May 13th as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1463.881s">Although</a>  if the council hasn't started their conversation around the budget and there is still like movement happening around the city's budget overall, like we may not want to take that reconciliation vote in the event that there is a gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1478.166s">So,</a>  and I think we know, and we've been informed by the city CFO that there will be a gap because the initial allocation for the school district, according to the city CFO is $73,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1489.293s">Last</a>  year, our allocation was $71,200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1490.934s">It's</a>  a little bit more complicated than that because we were using $2.8 million <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1502.541s">on</a>  operating expenses from our ESSER budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1507.004s">And</a>  that was necessary last year because the operating budget couldn't support the operating needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1512.647s">So</a>  it was a conscious decision, as were all the decisions that we've made about ESSER spending and are being made across the country and have been for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1522.093s">So</a>  people are, you know, while you don't want to use one-time funds to <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1528.217s">support</a>  things that have ongoing expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1531.618s">ESSER</a>  afforded districts an opportunity to say, what do our kids need? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1537.58s">And</a>  in a place where 80 to 85% of the activity and the spending is on humans to educate kids, it's inevitable that that spending would also require people who are really more considered part of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1553.924s">I</a>  did have a couple of questions because I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how some of these groups, these buckets break down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1561.826s">Jerry,</a>  there was a slide that you showed before the ESSER slide that tallied up to 1.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1569.308s">Can</a>  you just bring that slide up again for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1588.134s">Did</a>  we lose Jerry?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1589.634s">No,</a>  I'm back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1591.255s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1592.555s">I</a>  got a deal with an issue with payroll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1595.356s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1596.356s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1597.997s">I</a>  was wondering if you could bring back up the slide that came before the ESSER slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1602.978s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1623.188s">This</a>  is it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1627.091s">I</a>  can't see anything just yet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1635.717s">No,</a>  can't see it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1637.438s">No,</a>  not yet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1638.078s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1661.923s">Coming</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1663.104s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1664.345s">Ah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1665.566s">OK,</a>  so those are the underfunded accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1667.527s">And</a>  these are <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1677.196s">Okay,</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1677.956s">So</a>  these are underfunded accounts and it seems like there's maybe some overlap here with some of the other slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1684.941s">Is</a>  that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1685.581s">Like</a>  when I think about substitute teachers, I think about that ESSER bucket because that is where the substitute teachers were put last year in order to balance our budget last year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1697.248s">So-</a>  It is separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1701.03s">It</a>  is? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1703.692s">The</a>  ESSER funded positions are, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1707.205s">full-time</a>  building substitutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1709.446s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1710.066s">So</a>  each school has one full-time building substitute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1715.328s">The</a>  high school has three, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1719.469s">And</a>  then there's another line, district-wide line, that funds <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1728.166s">substitute</a>  teachers that are paid the daily rate or teachers that I use to sub and miss their prep. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1740.83s">They</a>  get paid for a miss prep if they substitute during that prep.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1747.772s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1748.152s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1748.433s">That's</a>  helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1750.765s">And</a>  then on your next slide about ESSER conversion, when I look at this list, I think there are at least some number of these positions that are absolutely not discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1766.598s">So</a>  I think specifically about the newcomers program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1770.1s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1770.561s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1771.241s">We</a>  can't not spend that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1773.163s">Are</a>  there other of these 21.2 staff people that are in what is more likely a non-discretionary bucket rather than a bucket where we could operate the district, not that we should, but we could operate the district without that line item?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1799.096s">The</a>  adjustment counselors are based on need. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1804.441s">And</a>  I think likely what happened was that we had a need to add more in FY24, and there was no bandwidth in the general fund to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1815.171s">So</a>  they were placed on ESSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1819.435s">We'd</a>  have to take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1821.277s">I've</a>  done a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1823.592s">that</a>  kind of a caseload analysis for guidance counselors and adjustment counselors and our psychologists. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1829.594s">And</a>  I think the adjustment, Medford is doing probably better than other districts in that they're kind of maintaining a ratio of about 250 students per counselor, which is what their national association recommends. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1854.181s">very</a>  few districts can, for instance, the average in Massachusetts is about 344 students per counselor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1864.286s">But</a>  we all know that there are mental health issues still lingering amongst our students with coming out of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1878.013s">And</a>  so I would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1881.212s">I</a>  would advocate to kind of maintain the current staffing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1885.435s">The</a>  grants manager, we only have one grants manager for the district and we have a number of grants that have to be managed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1892.199s">I</a>  would say that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1896.221s">The</a>  behavior para is something that the guidance department recommended that we retain. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1907.889s">You</a>  know, that might be, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1910.089s">a</a>  slightly lower priority than some of the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1913.61s">The</a>  newcomers program, you just, you can't, we have an obligation to provide programming for English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1927.474s">We</a>  get reviewed by the state every year to make sure we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1934.056s">And</a>  so we would need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1938.68s">for</a>  sure bring that program into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1943.222s">The</a>  literacy interventionist is again, is probably like the adjustment counselors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1948.544s">There</a>  was probably a need that couldn't be handled on the general fund in 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1960.268s">That</a>  may or may not be kind of a lower tier priority than some of the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1966.907s">The</a>  building substitutes, we just have such a problem with attracting the number of substitutes we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1977.474s">I</a>  know the school committee is kind of looking at that issue as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1985.319s">And</a>  the other thing that we kind of haven't tackled with, but it's kind of still on my list and I don't know how we can address it is that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=1996.775s">We</a>  have to take a serious look at the rates that we pay our daily subs and our long-term subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2006.182s">Many</a>  school districts in our surrounding area have had to come to grips with the fact that the days of $75, $85 a day for substitutes is long gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2025.701s">even</a>  125 would be low for a daily sub, but you could, it may entice some of our retired teachers to come back and provide those services if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2041.43s">Long-term</a>  subs are getting, you know, 250, $275 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2043.771s">So</a>  that has to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2044.772s">You</a>  know, I'm gonna be <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2053.582s">recommending</a>  some increase to the substitute program, but it doesn't really factor in any kind of rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2067.715s">The</a>  re-engagement specialist is going to be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2070.198s">We</a>  have three on ESSA now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2072.32s">We're</a>  only proposing to bring one <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2075.833s">back</a>  into the general fund and that's because we, these positions do kind of took on the role of or included duties that would be found in a kind of an attendance officer position. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2094.327s">And</a>  so there's still a need to have somebody who's kind of responsible for attendance officer duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2104.028s">And</a>  that would be the re-engagement specialist that we're proposing to bring into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2112.654s">And</a>  professional development, we talked about earlier that there should be some amount of money right now in ESSA, there's $110,000 for professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2125.924s">And</a>  this figure of 1.3 assumes that we'd bring the whole 110 <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2133.228s">into</a>  the budget that could probably be shaved a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2138.192s">But</a>  for a district this size with this many staff, it's kind of a low number. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2147.279s">I</a>  think the allocation in the foundation budget is well over a million dollars for professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2155.005s">And</a>  no school district <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2156.914s">spends</a>  what they're allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2159.476s">But</a>  it just shows you what, in the development of the foundation budget, what the plan is deemed to be kind of an appropriate professional development expense for MedFed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2176.272s">Sure,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2178.374s">And</a>  then can you look at, can you go to the new spending page, the $1.4 million page? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2188.291s">So</a>  again, some of this is not optional, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2193.992s">Like</a>  our tuition increase is not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2199.853s">And</a>  our NEASC funding is not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2202.574s">Is</a>  that right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2203.974s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2205.334s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2205.714s">I</a>  would put the technology expense not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2212.195s">You</a>  know, the Chromebooks now are just like textbooks 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2216.966s">You</a>  just, every student's gonna have one, and the whole teaching dynamic has shifted to be able to utilize the technology, the applications that are on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2233.916s">Many</a>  books now that we buy are online, have an online feature, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2245.183s">Yes,</a>  I would include that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2247.082s">So</a>  you're saying the Chromebook refresh is the one that you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2250.563s">Or</a>  are you also talking about- Yeah, and the Apple refresh.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2252.344s">I</a>  would say that that has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2254.465s">Those</a>  devices do not last forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2260.787s">And</a>  you don't wanna be in a position where some students have a device that works and some don't.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2269.951s">If</a>  I may just- Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2271.911s">Member</a>  Graham, may I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2274.713s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2275.594s">Just</a>  on the Chromebooks and the Apple Refresh, which I think are actual pieces of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2280.897s">Jerry,</a>  what are we estimating for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2283.119s">Because</a>  that I would think would be something that would fall on the capital improvement plan if it isn't there already.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2291.545s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2294.146s">I</a>  think it's a little over 400,000.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2304.406s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2305.487s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2305.747s">And</a>  I think the, you know, I guess Medford has always treated those things as capital, but when you talk about Chromebooks in the same vein as textbooks, like they're, they really aren't capital expenses anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2319.115s">They're</a>  like expenses that they're it's equipment that depreciates every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2324.719s">typical</a>  organization like you would you would handle that depreciation in your operating budget so I mean ideally what districts should be doing is having a an amount of money in the budget every year so that there's a cycle and we don't have these big massive changes that have to happen where we have to replace every Chromebook at the same time but instead in some sort of a <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2346.752s">like</a>  a rolling function. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2349.095s">So</a>  I will just wrap up my set of questions by saying last year, our budget was $71.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2359.505s">And</a>  then we had ESSER of $2.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2362.526s">But</a>  if I start from that $71.2 million of last year, and I add up all the things that Jerry described as spending needs, I get $7.5 million for a total of $78,700,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2375.25s">And</a>  that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2385.14s">a</a>  big distance away from $73.5 million that was preliminarily provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2394.544s">And</a>  I also wanna point out that the amount preliminarily provided to us is a $2.3 million increase, which actually doesn't even account for- 3.2, opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2404.149s">You</a>  said 2.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2411.545s">3.2,</a>  okay, so that barely covers our contractual obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2417.869s">73.5</a>  minus 71.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2422.612s">I</a>  have 2.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2436.135s">3.2%,</a>  is that what you mean, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2437.156s">Yes,</a>  3.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2437.317s">I'm</a>  talking about dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2438.118s">So</a>  in dollars, that's $2,300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2439.319s">Our</a>  contractual obligations are $2.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2453.194s">So</a>  thank you, Jerry, for all this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2455.857s">It's</a>  very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2457.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2458.4s">I'm</a>  sorry, if I can call a point of information real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2460.683s">Jerry,</a>  when you mentioned long term sub pay, did you say that they were making $275 a day?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2465.008s">Remember,</a>  on top of with a point of information.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2472.335s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2473.516s">Could</a>  you repeat that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2475.238s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2475.658s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2477.46s">When</a>  you mentioned long-term substitute pay, you mentioned $275 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2483.326s">Were</a>  you mentioning to this current budget or the proposed budget?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2487.39s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2488.05s">I</a>  was suggesting that some school departments have increased their rates into that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2497.694s">kind</a>  of mark that that's more of the market right now for a long term sub. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2502.335s">So</a>  a long term sub would be somebody that we would hire because we have a teacher that goes on maternity leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2514.557s">And</a>  they may be in there for, you know, three or four or five months, and they'd be required to go <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2523.217s">to</a>  faculty meetings and provide lesson plans and things like that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2530.399s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2530.78s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2531.2s">Sorry,</a>  I just wanted to clarify because I wasn't sure if I heard.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2533.78s">I</a>  think we pay $120 per day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2537.142s">It's</a>  $100 because I will give a personal connection that my partner is a long-term.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2544.044s">I'm</a>  not thinking that we should go all the way to there, but we do have to <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2549.161s">think</a>  about increasing those rates?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2551.343s">Absolutely,</a>  because it's like $80 a day with tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2554.785s">So</a>  I definitely could see the burden of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2557.527s">But</a>  I wanted to clarify because I wasn't sure if I misheard you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2559.869s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2562.151s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2562.531s">Is</a>  there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2565.093s">Other</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2565.713s">Member</a>  Rousseau?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2568.755s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2569.556s">I</a>  know the point has been made about devices, Chromebooks being treated as capital. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2575.5s">I</a>  just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2578.652s">My</a>  first experience of Medford as a district was a very long time ago when we were voting whether to buy computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2586.936s">I</a>  don't know, this was at least a decade ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2589.577s">City</a>  Council was voting because it was capital then. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2593.699s">And</a>  if we can't get this in there as part of our budget, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2600.322s">It's</a>  just not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2602.363s">I</a>  mean, we're doing so much here to bring stuff into the budget that should be in the budget, that should have always been in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2608.605s">And</a>  to leave behind a day-to-day use item that is literally a critical part of education doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2615.848s">So</a>  I just want to support that that number needs to be in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2619.709s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2626.212s">Any</a>  other questions from the committee before I open up to the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2631.772s">I</a>  know we have 115 people on, so we'll give anybody who wants to talk two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2637.235s">Anthony</a>  Guillen, who already has his name and address for the record, if we could unmute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2644.919s">All</a>  right, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2646.92s">My</a>  name is Anthony Guillen, 45 Elm Hill Avenue, Levenson, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2649.921s">I</a>  am the president of the Medicine and Teaching Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2653.363s">Jerry,</a>  thank you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2655.444s">I</a>  just wanted to ask a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2658.345s">Number</a>  one, <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2660.56s">there</a>  was listed that nine of the ESSER positions were looking to be let go, and the unfilled literacy coaches count for four of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2669.127s">So</a>  do you have the list of the remaining five that were to be cut?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2679.795s">I</a>  didn't get that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2681.056s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2682.076s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2682.437s">So</a>  you mentioned looking to bring over some ESSER positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2687.526s">and</a>  if I got my notes right, you have nine positions you are looking to let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2691.887s">We</a>  can count the four unhired literacy coaches against that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2696.628s">Do</a>  you have the other five positions that were to be not brought over into the regular budget from the ESSER funds?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2704.57s">Yeah,</a>  I don't have it off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2707.571s">Well,</a>  there were two, in addition to the literacy coaches, there were two re-engagement specialists <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2720.891s">But</a>  I can provide that to you, Anthony.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2724.334s">Very</a>  good on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2728.257s">Are</a>  there, is the list of programs that paid to the district to use the facilities as well as the grants we are currently receiving a matter of public record or would that be something we'd need to request? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2743.71s">Oh,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2747.712s">Just</a>  repeat that question, Mr. Hugh.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2750.354s">If</a>  I was looking for a list of programs that pay to the district, such as the Japanese school that uses the high school on the weekends, or a list of grants that the school receives, is that a matter of public record or something I would have to request?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2764.083s">Yes,</a>  it's public record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2765.765s">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2770.008s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2774.191s">And</a>  finally, as far as the plan for the budget to be available, I know that you're looking to finalize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2784.578s">Will</a>  that be sent to the unions for review when it is sent to, before it becomes public, a matter of a public meeting?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2800.466s">Well,</a>  I'm not sure what the practice is in MedFed, but I don't have a problem with doing that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2806.39s">Okay,</a>  I'll send you a request then.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2808.731s">Mr.</a>  Hain, can you repeat the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2810.032s">I'm</a>  sorry I missed that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2811.393s">I</a>  was just looking to see, once the proposed budget is completed, there is usually a time in which the union receives it, but this timeline seems quite moved up from last year, so I was just making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2826.516s">the</a>  union and its leadership will receive a copy of the proposed budget before it becomes a matter of public, like a matter of the public meeting you hold.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2836.483s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2837.544s">I</a>  think that's outlined in the contract, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2840.727s">It</a>  is, but not specifically when.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2843.989s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2844.449s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2845.25s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2845.61s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2848.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2849.473s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2852.896s">Member</a>  Rousseau?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2855.998s">Thank</a>  you, I just wanted to clarify, when Mr. Guillen was asking about the programs and the chargebacks, which is what Mr. McHugh was talking about earlier, we're not talking about like the rentals, we're talking about meat, we're talking about afterschool, the food services program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2877.77s">In</a>  this presentation, I don't think we're talking about rentals in any way, shape or form, unless I'm misunderstanding.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2884.622s">I</a>  think he's still asking for the amount we bring in for rentals, just for their knowledge.</p>
