132
00:56:52,790 --> 00:57:11,182
[SPEAKER_02]: The we paid out the FY 22 retroactive payments in the most recent payroll disbursement, and I anticipate at this point that the FY 23 retroactive payments for those five bargaining units will be implemented not in the pay cycle that we're currently in meeting this week but in the following one which will be the week of Thanksgiving.

140
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:55,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's certainly our hope that there'll be a second vote in the near future.

141

151
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:59,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this would allow us to do is provide basically a free half of a master's degree

152
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:08,687
[SPEAKER_03]: and applied linguistics for teachers and paraprofessionals who already possess like a bachelor's degree going into a master's program.

153
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:14,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this would allow us to do is increase our capacity for not only

154
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:35,246
[SPEAKER_03]: hiring teachers to work with English learners, but it would also give us the ability to have content teachers not only be duly certified in their content in EL, but they would have all of the theory for second language acquisition as part of what they could bring to the classroom every day.

155
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:46,056
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be starting this program and this is the first that it's been publicized in the district, so we'll be working to recruit teachers.

156
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:48,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We have teachers and paraprofessionals.

157
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:53,285
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 15 slots available and the classes would begin in January.

158
00:59:54,005 --> 00:59:55,347
[SPEAKER_03]: These teachers would work

159
00:59:57,544 --> 01:00:02,929
[SPEAKER_03]: to get their five core classes completed as part of their master's program.

160
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:08,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And once they complete those five courses, they're eligible for ESL certification.

161
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they can continue on in the program.

162
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,731
[SPEAKER_03]: They can take advantage of Medford's tuition reimbursement.

163
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:24,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't cover the entire remaining portion of the master's degree, but it would pay for a chunk of it as well.

164
01:00:24,593 --> 01:00:35,376
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be available to elementary, middle, and high school teachers looking to obtain this additional master's degree and certification.

165
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:36,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And then,

166
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:57,588
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, there's coaching that's embedded in this for family and community outreach, for providing professional development for other teachers in the buildings that they're currently working on, and they'll be doing that as a cohort throughout the process of their program.

167
01:00:59,249 --> 01:01:00,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions on that part?

168
01:01:05,433 --> 01:01:17,959
[SPEAKER_03]: The second news, which I just added on to this is, as you know, we have a partnership with Lesley University for elementary teachers or teacher seeking elementary certification.

169
01:01:18,419 --> 01:01:23,041
[SPEAKER_03]: They go through a master's program to get their gen ed in grades one through six.

170
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:27,023
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a year long internship in the EL department.

171
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:34,279
[SPEAKER_03]: in any elementary school, typically a newcomer's classroom, but sometimes that doesn't work.

172
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:40,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do a balance of the gen ed classroom and EL pullout.

173
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:46,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And Leslie is extending this program into middle and high school for secondary.

174
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:54,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So teachers that are seeking to get their master's degree in math, the humanities,

175
01:01:56,027 --> 01:02:02,173
[SPEAKER_03]: can also do an add-on Yale license if they do this year-long internship at the secondary level.

176
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:10,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Medford's also working with them to establish that and get some candidates in the district for that program as well.

177
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:14,765
[SPEAKER_06]: No questions?

178
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:17,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau?

179
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:21,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to thank you for the effort to find all this money.

180
01:02:22,453 --> 01:02:25,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Free money, from our perspective, is the best kind.

181
01:02:25,517 --> 01:02:26,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

182
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:31,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have any sense yet on how many teachers will be interested?

183
01:02:31,365 --> 01:02:35,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that you will have to deal with too many people applying?

184
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:43,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, you know, and so that is an interesting question because there are other cohorts that will be, that will begin like in September.

185
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:52,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'll stay in touch if we can't, you know, if they don't, if other districts aren't filling them, you know, to see if we can jump in on that as well.

186
01:02:52,285 --> 01:03:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So this happened because I was looking for interns to come do their student teaching in Medford and,

187
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:04,829
[SPEAKER_03]: through meeting the director and going through that.

188
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:10,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought her down to the McGlynn Middle School to show her the program and program design.

189
01:03:10,514 --> 01:03:15,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when she started talking about this opportunity that they were applying for.

190
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:23,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what like years two, three, and four looked like for them, but Medford would definitely be a part of that.

191
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:24,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

192
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:24,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

193
01:03:26,012 --> 01:03:28,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a limit to the pre-half master's degree?

194
01:03:28,873 --> 01:03:39,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 15 people, 15 teachers and paraprofessionals for this January cohort, but they will have other cohorts throughout the school year.

195
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:41,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

196
01:03:42,677 --> 01:03:43,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

197
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:52,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving right along, number four, report on enrollment, Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation.

198
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:54,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a report was left in our desks.

199
01:03:58,078 --> 01:04:02,059
[SPEAKER_04]: The report that I gave you prior to the meeting, I just want to make sure that you have the third page.

200
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:10,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't sure if that was as part of the submission earlier, but presently we have 1,982 students at our elementary level.

201
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:12,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are also showing 924 students at our middle school level.

202
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:28,629
[SPEAKER_04]: and 1,256 students for a grand total of 4,162 students across the district.

203
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:33,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the breakdowns throughout the entire district per classroom, per grade.

204
01:04:34,233 --> 01:04:49,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also see the breakdown of middle schools for each side at each school and at our vocational and med high school and career technical education with the third page breaking down each individual program

205
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:59,515
[SPEAKER_04]: with their current enrollments in grades 10, 11, 12 as the exploratory programs are still for the freshmen.

206
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:07,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently there are 268 students in CT exploratory out of a class of 342 students.

207
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:15,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Also just wanna call your attention on the last page that we've had 286 students tested in the EL department.

208
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:24,186
[SPEAKER_04]: 117 of those are kindergarten students who have been tested.

209
01:05:25,107 --> 01:05:33,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And so right now we're looking at approximately 134 students out of that testing who received services and are now part of our EL program.

210
01:05:33,957 --> 01:05:35,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to provide that information to you.

211
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:50,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Kim Miles for helping for building this report and pulling the requisite information and for all the teachers and educators who are working as we've had you know students returning to us this year.

212
01:05:53,628 --> 01:05:53,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

213
01:05:55,549 --> 01:05:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russell?

214
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:57,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

215
01:05:57,352 --> 01:06:03,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just looking at last year's numbers, at least according to the DESE report, and we had 39, 37.

216
01:06:03,874 --> 01:06:06,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a good increase.

217
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:08,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we had a drop.

218
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gone back and looked further.

219
01:06:10,656 --> 01:06:17,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there, I mean, I haven't looked through this report since it's just right here.

220
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:23,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a particular area where we're seeing a lot of, I mean, that's what, nearly 200 students?

221
01:06:26,018 --> 01:06:32,219
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing students returning to us from private schools, from charter schools.

222
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:52,364
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, from the preliminary charter and other regional vocational charter and other public school numbers, we wanna try to recruit those students back to us even more so, but we are seeing those students return to us and we are seeing an influx of students from other nations.

223
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:55,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great, thank you.

224
01:06:58,308 --> 01:07:00,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

225
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:14,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us that I'm looking at the charter numbers for enrollment this year so 3.95 is our charter school enrollment and I think that amounts to 7 or $8 million of tuition going out to those charter schools.

226
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:17,523
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that compare to years past the 3.95?

227
01:07:17,563 --> 01:07:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know?

228
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:21,890
[SPEAKER_04]: critical part of your question.

229
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh how does the 395 compare to years past?

230
01:07:25,011 --> 01:07:40,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That's saying that's so that's saying about average with the exception if you'll notice in grades one two and three those numbers are higher than than the later years and

231
01:07:41,112 --> 01:07:53,480
[SPEAKER_04]: The inference is that during the pandemic, other people may have chosen different options based on how other schools may have operated than traditional public schools.

232
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now it's our job to try to recruit those students back.

233
01:07:59,243 --> 01:07:59,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

234
01:08:00,324 --> 01:08:00,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor.

235
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:02,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

236
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:05,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Just on that point, I believe we were at our charter cap.

237
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:09,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So being steady makes sense because we can't exceed the charter cap.

238
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:14,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I thought the charter cap might be a few students over 395, actually.

239
01:08:15,088 --> 01:08:20,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be surprising and lovely if we were under the cap.

240
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:28,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, the smaller the number, the better for us, but that would explain why we have been steady.

241
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:33,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't quickly find the charter numbers because it's the DESE website.

242
01:08:33,895 --> 01:08:36,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough said on that, thank you.

243
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:40,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member Stone.

244
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:45,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.

245
01:08:45,965 --> 01:08:58,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.

246
01:08:58,638 --> 01:09:01,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then

247
01:09:03,237 --> 01:09:04,918
[SPEAKER_05]: fifth class was added to bring it down.

248
01:09:05,338 --> 01:09:11,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.

249
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say that's the average class size?

250
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:22,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for classroom.

251
01:09:22,965 --> 01:09:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Declan has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average.

252
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:28,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that.

253
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:30,768
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,

254
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:33,946
[SPEAKER_05]: community to see those numbers.

255
01:09:34,447 --> 01:09:35,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

256
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:10,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, I can share it right now.

257
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:19,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And is the new EL enrollment numbers, the 134, is that in addition to, or is that's finalized, correct?

258
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,843
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the current numbers, that fluctuated this year.

259
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:29,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for this year.

260
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:29,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

261
01:10:30,366 --> 01:10:30,987
[SPEAKER_04]: New enrollments.

262
01:10:31,267 --> 01:10:33,128
[SPEAKER_09]: New enrollments this year, okay.

263
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:41,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And while Mr. Teixeira will give a further report about this later in the year, I wanted to call attention to 286 students tested.

264
01:10:42,703 --> 01:10:48,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about one to three hours per test based upon a family's home language survey.

265
01:10:48,568 --> 01:10:53,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So us receiving those students, greeting them into the district,

266
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:55,213
[SPEAKER_04]: entering them in.

267
01:10:55,954 --> 01:11:04,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Some students may then never join the district because they may move to somewhere else in Massachusetts, the United States, or may return back to their home country.

268
01:11:13,008 --> 01:11:17,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, we will.

269
01:11:20,314 --> 01:11:20,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, one last.

270
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

271
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

272
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:29,159
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a new format of this report and I just want to say bravo because it's very nicely done.

273
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,182
[SPEAKER_04]: All kudos need to go to Kim Miles, our data specialist on that.

274
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:36,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Please make sure she receives our thank you because this is excellent.

275
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:37,244
Thank you.
