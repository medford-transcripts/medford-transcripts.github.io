60
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,307
[SPEAKER_08]: to the following departments as follows.

61
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:08,573
[SPEAKER_08]: $200,000 for union contracts, $100,000 early retirement incentive, $10,000 translation services, $95,000 facilities manager, $200,000 with facilities maintenance.

62
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:23,405
[SPEAKER_08]: and $65,000 administrative assessor and $70,000 for 9-1-1 supervisor.

63
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:31,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief of staff, David Rodriguez and finance director Alicia Nonley-Benjamin are present to answer any of the council's questions regarding the matter.

[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Brianna Longo-Kern, Mayor.

65
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

66
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:47,404
[SPEAKER_07]: This paper was before us last week, and it's a paper that looks to increase the fiscal year budget by $740,000 to fund union contracts, early retirement incentives, and various other services and positions.

67
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:55,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the course of the last week, as this matter was tabled, we did receive some documentation from the administration, job descriptions and the like.

68
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,496
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, I'd like to have the paper brought to the table for a further presentation by the administration, and hopefully a vote for this.

69
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:03,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

70
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Ioannoni, I'm sorry, did you want, I missed that last part.

71
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you want?

72
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:14,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

73
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:21,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So Alicia and Dave, if you'd like to speak further to this paper, we'd appreciate it.

74
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:22,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll unmute.

75
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Alicia, you have been unmuted.

76
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:25,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

77
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:35,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so tonight's paper is programming some additional funds that we had available due to the governor

78
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:57,730
[SPEAKER_00]: level funding local aid that we wanted to add back to the operations to stable operations for the city because we had to cut positions because we had estimated in a 10% cut to local aid when we had done the budget addition initially before the governor had announced that he was going to level fund back to the fiscal year 20 levels.

79
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to go over each position or is that?

80
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,521
[SPEAKER_00]: All you want to hear for a summary?

81
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:08,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be best to go over each of the positions, just to make sure we're all on the same page, bring everyone up to date.

82
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:09,244
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

83
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:09,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

84
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:19,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pulling it up one moment, please.

85
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:20,389
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

86
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

87
00:07:40,060 --> 00:08:00,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we would like to program $200,000 to negotiated salaries for union contracts, 100,000 for early retirement incentive to negotiated salaries, 10,000 to translation services, 95,000 for a facilities manager, 200,000 for facilities maintenance,

88
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,642
[SPEAKER_00]: 65,000 for an administrative assessor and 70,000 for a 911 supervisor.

89
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:22,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of the documentation that we had sent by previously that was mentioned by councilor Knight included the job descriptions for each one of those positions.

90
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:36,335
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know that a number of the councilors had an opportunity to speak with some people in the administration today, as well as the mayor regarding kind of the different perspectives as it relates to this perspectives in the supplemental budget.

91
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:40,458
[SPEAKER_12]: After some discussion and recognizing and understanding

92
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:44,239
[SPEAKER_12]: strongly held feelings regarding the elections coordinator position.

93
00:08:44,819 --> 00:09:09,883
[SPEAKER_12]: The administration is certainly willing to reduce the amount being placed into the building maintenance line by $100,000, hold that money in abeyance while those conversations continue to take place with the council and among the administration so that we can formulate a plan moving forward together for that, involving, of course, the board of registrars and other interested parties and stakeholders to talk about that in a thoughtful way.

94
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:23,592
[SPEAKER_12]: We're happy to amend that paper tonight to reflect that and move forward and have those conversations after we do our after action reports and our meetings with the clerk and with his team and try to figure out a path moving forward on those issues.

95
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:26,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

96
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:27,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Marks.

97
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:36,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I appreciate the due diligence of the administration providing the job descriptions.

98
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,746
[SPEAKER_09]: It was helpful, Mr. President.

99
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:45,214
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue at hand that I had last week, as Mr. Rodriguez just mentioned, was regarding the

100
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:56,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel, and I won't speak for my other colleagues, that this is an issue that's been discussed at least for the last two to two and a half years.

101
00:09:56,838 --> 00:10:01,559
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a need in the community to have someone coordinate our elections, Mr. President.

102
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:08,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been very fortunate to have a great staff and a clerk that oversees the process.

103
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,382
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Mr. President, we're at a point right now with early voting, mail-in voting, absentee voting,

104
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:27,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And our voting rolls have increased over the last number of years, I believe by almost 10,000 new voters in this community.

105
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:36,651
[SPEAKER_09]: That in my opinion, and I'd like to hear from the city clerk, that this position is well warranted within this community.

106
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:42,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we should get all the stakeholders, I agree, at the table.

107
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:45,313
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Mr. President, this is two years now.

108
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:54,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate the commitment from the administration to take 100,000 out of the facilities, but I would like to have a time frame on that, Mr. President.

109
00:10:54,555 --> 00:11:02,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe a job description has been drafted, sent to the appropriate personnel within the city administration.

110
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can arrive at some type of time frame, Mr. President,

111
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I will give it my support tonight.

112
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,880
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, Mr. President, I am tired of lip service.

113
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to say that that's the case here, but I am tired of lip service.

114
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:23,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to see action, especially on such an important position in this community, Mr. President.

115
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:31,666
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can't guarantee to residents in this community that we can have a fair election, Mr. President, and an election that we know is

116
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:41,234
[SPEAKER_09]: On the utmost regarding security safety, then we're not doing what we were supposed to be doing as elected officials.

117
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:52,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe having this position would secure that, Mr. President, and it would secure us for a number of years moving forward as we see elections changing, not only in Method, but across the nation.

118
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:59,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point, I'd like to ask the city clerk, because this is not something we just want to create a position on.

119
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:01,668
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that's needed.

120
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:10,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to hear from the chief election officer in the community that's been overseeing the process for the last two years, Mr. President.

121
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:11,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

122
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,472
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point, I recognize the city clerk, Adam Hertoghez.

123
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:15,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk Hertoghez.

124
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:16,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

125
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:17,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

126
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:20,534
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let me address

127
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:31,939
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that you said, Councilor Marks, our elections are full and fair and transparent and accurate, and they will continue to be so.

128
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as my predecessor ran full and fair and complete and transparent elections, so have I. At the same time, we do need a full-time election coordinator in this city.

129
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a part-time election coordinator who is outstanding.

130
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:57,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any disagreement there.

131
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she does a terrific job.

132
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:17,067
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal here is to, because there is election work year round, the goal here is to have an election coordinator who works on election planning, election execution year round in addition to me.

133
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:20,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do a little bit of election work every day.

134
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:26,632
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 months out of the year and I do predominantly election work for four to five months out of the year.

135
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:45,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But having an election coordinator whose job is to plan and oversee and execute elections is going to fortify our efforts as a city and to fortify the efforts of the terrific team that I have in the Registrar's of Voters Office.

136
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:52,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we can continue to move into the 21st century with our elections and our election technology.

137
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:58,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just speak to the particular need?

138
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:07,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a critical need because the number of registered voters is over 41,000 right now.

139
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe about 10 years ago, it was significantly less than that.

140
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:14,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It was between 25,000 and 30,000 voters.

141
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:20,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to have additional staff on board to

142
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,438
[SPEAKER_02]: help administer these elections.

143
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:30,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to give you an example, I've been the city clerk for a little over two years, for two years and two months.

144
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last 14 months, I have overseen five elections.

145
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:52,746
[SPEAKER_02]: the preliminary election last year, the city election last year, the presidential primary in March, the state primary in September, and the recently concluded election, the national election, the quote unquote presidential election, which we certified yesterday.

146
00:14:55,187 --> 00:15:02,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Five elections in the course of 14 months is an election, you know, less than every, more frequently than every three months.

147
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:09,491
[SPEAKER_02]: with the number of elections with potential special elections coming coming down the pike.

148
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:12,514
[SPEAKER_02]: If, for example, I'm using an example.

149
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:13,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hypothetical.

150
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:23,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But the hypothetical is if President elect Biden were to appoint Senator Warren to his cabinet, then there would be a

151
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: a preliminary primary election for a special election to Senate, then there would be a general election to the Senate, again, a special election.

152
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,981
[SPEAKER_02]: There are ripple effects from that.

153
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:40,265
[SPEAKER_02]: If our member of Congress happened to run for the Senate seat and win, there would be two more elections.

154
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:47,429
[SPEAKER_02]: If, for example, a state rep then ran for Congress, there would be two more elections, and then there would be two more to fill the state rep's seat.

155
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:49,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So there could be

156
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:59,245
[SPEAKER_02]: In one scenario, up to eight more elections this year, in addition to the two that are coming in September and November.

157
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:01,486
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of elections.

158
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:14,971
[SPEAKER_02]: We're uncertain about whether there will be early voting in the city elections coming up, or whether no excuse mail balloting will be extended for city elections as well.

159
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:16,904
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit unclear.

160
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:26,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But election work is work that requires planning every day, not just the not just during the quote unquote election season.

161
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:28,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a year round job.

162
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,818
[SPEAKER_02]: The city clerk's job is a year round job.

163
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:48,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have an additional staff member working full time on that, who is incredibly well versed in election work and has also become a primary liaison to the Secretary of Commonwealth's office, is a benefit to our city.

164
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:54,219
[SPEAKER_02]: And it only helps with those full and fair and transparent elections that you were speaking of earlier.

165
00:16:57,035 --> 00:17:00,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk, and if I could just follow up, Mr. President.

166
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:08,022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding, and I think I mentioned this last week, that some many years ago, there used to be two separate positions.

167
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:13,286
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the city clerk position and elections coordinator position that existed.

168
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:18,249
[SPEAKER_09]: The person in the election coordinator position, from my understanding, retired.

169
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:25,014
[SPEAKER_09]: And rather than looking for another election coordinator position, the city clerk took it on as a stipend position.

170
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:27,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where we fell for many years.

171
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:39,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can guarantee you in all the surrounding communities that the city clerk is not the person that's in charge or coordinates the elections in all the surrounding communities.

172
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:45,176
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a separate and distinct function and role and separate person.

173
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:50,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're at a point right now in this community and the size of this community that this is warranted.

174
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe anyone in the administration doesn't believe so either.

175
00:17:54,242 --> 00:18:04,428
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to make sure, Mr. President, that we're not here another year from now talking about the same issue and putting our resources into the same things over and over again.

176
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:17,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I'm hoping if we can get a commitment tonight on when we will see this position, I'll give the administration all the needed time they need to meet with the stakeholders and parties and draft the job description and so forth.

177
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:21,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need a time frame, Mr. President, that someone will be in that position.

178
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:25,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how I will vote for this tonight.

179
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:27,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

180
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:30,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk Hernandez.

181
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:47,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that many other cities and towns do have an election coordinator, but in also many of those cities and towns, the city clerk is still the chief election officer in a number of those cities and towns.

182
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know Boston has a separate election commission.

183
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:51,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Somerville has a separate election commission.

184
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:57,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But this position would be a person working directly with me

185
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:05,484
[SPEAKER_02]: on the election work would be sort of a bridge between the full time staff in the right and report directly to my office.

186
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Just just right.

187
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,107
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I understand that.

188
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:09,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

189
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilman Moxley.

190
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:15,137
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, is the job description already been, is that already set?

191
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:16,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Councilman Moxley had asked.

192
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:23,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I did draft a job description and send it to Director Osborne, and I know he's working on it, but I don't know what the final status of it is.

193
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:24,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

194
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:25,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caviello.

195
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

196
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilman Moxley's right again.

197
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:35,225
[SPEAKER_04]: As the clerk said, you have a potential of eight elections coming up next year.

198
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:40,410
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pretty much almost at the end of November here, and we got another.

199
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:48,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And between the holidays or anything, we're going to be into 2021 a lot sooner than we think.

200
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:56,138
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's say, to drag this out four or five months, we'll be right back into the same spot we're in now.

201
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:03,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something I think should be filled by the first of the year.

202
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think that would be acceptable for me if right after in January this gets filled.

203
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,488
[SPEAKER_04]: The job description, Mr. Clerk, does that have to be advertised for other people?

204
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that has to be advertised for other people.

205
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:27,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the answer to that question.

206
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:34,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that there has been precedent for converting part-time employees into full-time employees.

207
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:38,144
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's a brand new job, I don't know the answer to the question.

208
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,125
[SPEAKER_12]: The job will be posted in advertising.

209
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:40,386
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to.

210
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it has to be posted in advertising.

211
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:49,712
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, let's say we're four or five weeks away from 2021.

212
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:59,863
[SPEAKER_04]: this job be filled within the second meeting of the council in January.

213
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:04,347
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got five, six weeks to get this done.

214
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it done.

215
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:11,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we know it, you're going to have an election around the corner, and we're going to be back where we are.

216
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:13,113
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be saying we should have done this before.

217
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:22,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll make the motion that the job be filled by the second meeting in January.

218
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,603
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a motion from Vice President Caviello that the position be filled by the second meeting in January.

219
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the seconded by.

220
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:36,465
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a point of information if I can.

221
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:38,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Councilor Scott Kelly.

222
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:44,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I vote on this, if I can, I know that we all want this.

223
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:48,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I think all of us made it loud and clear that we need this position.

224
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:59,037
[SPEAKER_11]: The Chief of Staff has told us that we're pulling 100,000 aside so we can fund this position, so we have that.

225
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:07,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we really realistically ask the Chief of Staff, what is the timeline for the administration?

226
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we looking at, is six weeks not enough, but are we looking at two months?

227
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:15,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that realistic?

228
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:20,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a time limit that we can look this for time certain, date certain?

229
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:22,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with my colleagues.

230
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:27,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if we could have a date certain, that would really help.

231
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:32,959
[SPEAKER_11]: So I pose the question to the chief of staff.

232
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,180
[SPEAKER_11]: How does this process go?

233
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,622
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you need, truly?

234
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:36,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief of staff.

235
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:43,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the conversation has to happen between the administration and the council.

236
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,146
[SPEAKER_12]: as to what the final decision is.

237
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:54,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there are legitimate differences of opinion in terms of what this looks like, what it does, the job duties I've described, the compensation levels.

238
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:05,675
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a lot of details here that we have to work through and we have to discuss not only with the Council and with the administration, but also with the Board of Registrars and have those conversations.

239
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:08,336
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly can't commit to a final decision tonight.

240
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not authorized to do that.

241
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:21,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I can, of course, authorize to speak in good faith and have these conversations outright and say, within the next 60 to 90 days, we'll have a final decision as to what this looks like and exactly how we proceed together.

242
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So we wouldn't entertain a date, sir?

243
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:31,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I try never to box myself in on dates certain.

244
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd say 60 to 90 days I think is appropriate for a good meaningful conversation to take place.

245
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:45,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Say 30 days, I mean three months is what, this is what we're trying to get to, Mr. Rodriguez.

246
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:52,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we're looking maximum you're saying 90 days, so if we looked at three months and we can all agree to that.

247
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:57,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I think because we're pretty secure what we're looking for on the council, so that piece will go pretty quickly.

248
00:23:57,518 --> 00:24:03,863
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting the registrars, I think getting them met, meeting with them, finalizing the job description, and then moving forward with that.

249
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that our piece here for the council, I think.

250
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:08,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're pretty clear what we want.

251
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,887
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm a little... And getting the mayor to sign off.

252
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:15,669
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor is an important piece of this.

253
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:16,929
[SPEAKER_11]: She has some thoughts on this.

254
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:17,589
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know.

255
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,551
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, I thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

256
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:22,692
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a point of information.

257
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:24,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caviello, at the floor.

258
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:25,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caviello.

259
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: To the chair, to the chief of staff.

260
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little confused with your last explanation that you gave there.

261
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:33,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say that again?

262
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe I missed something in the clarity.

263
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,734
[SPEAKER_04]: and what you were saying.

264
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:39,795
[SPEAKER_12]: To which point, sir?

265
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:45,440
[SPEAKER_04]: When we asked about your date, sir, and you were talking about the job description.

266
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:52,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you go back and repeat what you said just before Councilor Scarpelli came in?

267
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:56,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're not making a commitment to create this position tonight.

268
00:24:56,992 --> 00:25:01,055
[SPEAKER_12]: We're moving to take some of this money out of the maintenance account, hold it in abeyance.

269
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are we moving to grieve the position?

270
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:03,938
[SPEAKER_12]: The position is discussed.

271
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:06,460
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's the commitment that we're willing to make tonight.

272
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying that you won't make a commitment to fund this position?

273
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:12,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you said?

274
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:13,345
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not authorized to do that tonight.

275
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you said?

276
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:19,230
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no commitment to fund this position?

277
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:23,193
[SPEAKER_12]: The commitment is to have the conversation.

278
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,290
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

279
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice-President Caviello, do you have any further questions?

280
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:35,992
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the moment.

281
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:37,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, Vice-President Caviello.

282
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:41,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Pierce.

283
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:50,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to cut anyone off who wants to say something, but given what we just heard, I would suggest that we table this item.

284
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,899
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to cut anyone off, so I'm not going to make that motion until everyone's had a chance to speak.

285
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:57,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

286
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,720
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Councilor Knight.

287
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

288
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:08,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the chief of staff is looking for 90 days to finalize the job description, have a meaningful conversation, and come to a final point.

289
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:17,058
[SPEAKER_07]: May it make sense for us, because there are other positions that are associated with this that I feel are important, like the 911 supervisor, Mr. President.

290
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:18,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it's a very important position.

291
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd hate to see the 911 supervisor position go unfunded for an extended period of time because we're having a dispute.

292
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:27,407
[SPEAKER_07]: about a position that's not on the paper before us.

293
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:36,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have our thoughts and our concerns about the registrar of voters' recommendation or opinion as to whether or not this position is needed, number one, what their thoughts are on it.

294
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, is this position going to be a bargaining unit position?

295
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this position going to have supervisory authority over the staff in the voter registration office?

296
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:46,853
[SPEAKER_07]: These are some questions that need to be hashed out.

297
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:55,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd offer that we give the administration 45 days to finalize the job description, convene with the registrar of voters, and report back to the council.

298
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:59,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can move forward on the paper that's before us this evening.

299
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,208
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some items on the paper before us this evening that I'm not crazy about, Mr. President.

300
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:03,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be honest with you.

301
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some things in the paper before us this evening that I feel are important.

302
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And the facilities manager and the administrative assessor and the 911 supervisor are three positions that we have job descriptions for that I think are a critical need in this community.

303
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:23,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that there's room for compromise and the ability for us to compromise on this.

304
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

305
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: because we do have three positions that we do need to fund.

306
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:32,202
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also don't want to see the money disappear.

307
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:34,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I rest my case.

308
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:48,246
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that, you know, there has to be some middle ground and some compromise that we can reach here in order for us to move the ball forward on the elections coordinated position, but at the same time address some of the needs that this council has requested and voted for in the past.

309
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I can appreciate where everybody's coming from.

310
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:55,788
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I do have concern about that 911 supervisor's position in particular.

311
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:57,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Night.

312
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:01,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

313
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

314
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:20,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And this paper was on the agenda a week ago, and we sent back last Tuesday a message to the administration, and I believe the chief of staff was on the meeting last week with this council's intent.

315
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:31,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And to come back and say that he has no authority to make any decisions as the chief of staff, I think falls short of the mark, Mr. President.

316
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:36,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Because clearly the council made it known what our intent was last week.

317
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:41,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with Councilor Knight, however, the paper was presented the way it was presented.

318
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:48,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we can go through this and pick and choose what items we'd like to move forward with and what items we'd like to sit on.

319
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:50,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe we can do that.

320
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:53,907
[SPEAKER_09]: If the administration wants to recall this,

321
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:57,751
[SPEAKER_09]: paper and then submit another paper that we can agree upon.

322
00:28:58,272 --> 00:29:06,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally, Mr. President, it would have been nice for the administration maybe to sit down in a committee of the whole at the council and say, hey, look, we have $740,000.

323
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:10,368
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the things we'd like to do in the community.

324
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,529
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your thoughts?

325
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:12,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

326
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,551
[SPEAKER_09]: That didn't happen, and so be it, Mr. President.

327
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:22,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But clearly, I am not going to commit because the administration's unwilling to commit.

328
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:26,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Because from what I'm hearing tonight, there is no commitment.

329
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:28,613
[SPEAKER_09]: You can wait your 45 days.

330
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:31,194
[SPEAKER_09]: They can come out with ten different job descriptions.

331
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:35,955
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still no commitment to fund this position, Mr. President.

332
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:41,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And just because they come out with a job description doesn't make me feel warm and fuzzy that that's a commitment.

333
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:43,798
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not a commitment, Mr. President.

334
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:46,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Been around a long time, and that is not a formal commitment.

335
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we heard that here tonight.

336
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:56,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we stated before, if the council feels this is necessary, Mr. President, we stand up, send the paper back.

337
00:29:56,663 --> 00:30:02,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that's the will of the council, I will follow that, Mr. President.

338
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from the council?

339
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:10,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Beers?

340
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I would move to table this indefinitely.

341
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:13,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

342
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And the motion of Councilor Beers to table this, which is undebatable.

343
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:21,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this have a second?

344
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:22,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

345
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:23,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Councilor Marks.

346
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

347
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:30,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, before you call the roll Councilor Knight.

348
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I was just getting ready to call the roll.

349
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the third one, you know, so I hit my mic.

350
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you wanted to weigh in again.

351
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

352
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

353
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,202

00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:56,871

423
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:57,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

424
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:58,534
[SPEAKER_02]: President Falcone.

425
00:32:58,594 --> 00:32:58,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

426
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:00,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting the affirmative, adjourning the negative, the motion passes.

427
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:06,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hearings.

428
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: 20-600 petition for grant of location, National Grid, gas main locations, Medford, Massachusetts, city clerk's office.

429
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:19,832
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a continuation of a public hearing from last week.

430
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:27,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we have someone on the, let's see, we have Diana Cuddy from National Grid with us, if I'm correct?

431
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:28,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, good evening.

432
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:32,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Diana Cuddy, National Grid, 40 Sylvan Road, Waltham, Massachusetts.

433
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:35,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Diana.

434
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:43,691
[SPEAKER_08]: When we last left off, I believe Councilor Marks had questions, if I'm correct.

435
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:52,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, would you like to- Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the representative from National Grid being on the call again tonight.

436
00:33:53,025 --> 00:34:11,559
[SPEAKER_09]: The question I think which was supported by this council, Mr. President, was to have Diana go back to National Grid regarding putting together some mitigation to address curbing in the area of Riverside Ave that this construction work was going to be done.

437
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the total construction paving and marking, according to the representative from National Grid, was about $400,000.

438
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:24,142
[SPEAKER_09]: We by no means were looking for mitigation to that level.

439
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:35,966
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we were looking to address the lack of the appropriate height of curbing on Riverside Ave, which currently right now is level with the street and very dangerous to pedestrians.

440
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:43,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to just find out what Diana came back with regarding her conversation.

441
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:45,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Diana, if you could please provide us with an update.

442
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:45,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

443
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you very much.

444
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:57,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I spoke to our legal counsel and he sent an email to city solicitor and he did receive a response back today, but it was late afternoon.

445
00:34:57,935 --> 00:35:01,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're still in a dialogue over the best way to

446
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,215
[SPEAKER_06]: work out these details.

447
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:10,357
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been asked to see if we can continue this to the second weekend or second week in December.

448
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:16,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So that they have a chance to discuss all the items that they're going over.

449
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:17,899
[SPEAKER_06]: December 8th.

450
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:18,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

451
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:28,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And the motion of council on night to table this to the second meeting of November, which I believe is December 8th, seconded by vice-president Caviello.

452
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:29,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Please call the roll.

00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:34,024
[SPEAKER_02]: is to table to December 8th.

461
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:41,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

462
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:42,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morrell.

463
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

464
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

465
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:48,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

466
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:54,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes and the matter is tabled until December 8th.

467
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:55,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

468
00:35:56,227 --> 00:36:02,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Before she leaves, she said she was going to provide a number for us, for Verizon, for the double polls.

469
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And I- Yes, I did do that.

470
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent that over to Tim earlier.

471
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:10,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because I had called earlier in the week, last week, and he didn't have it.

472
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:11,855
[SPEAKER_04]: He has it now?

473
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:13,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I sent it over today.

474
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:14,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

475
00:36:14,996 --> 00:36:19,419
[SPEAKER_06]: My notes today, and I noticed that I had written it down, and I forgot to do it.

476
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:20,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

477
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:21,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Diane.

478
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:23,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

479
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, just to make a point about that.

480
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:33,881
[SPEAKER_06]: So we reached an agreement with Verizon that we own the pole going in and then we take our wires, which are the top wires on the pole over.

481
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And as they, their job is to coordinate the other utilities, bringing their wires as they progress down the pole over to the new one.

482
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:43,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they take the old pole out.

483
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:50,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think part of the problem sometimes for them is to get the other utilities or other wires on the pole

484
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,234
[SPEAKER_06]: on the existing poll to go over.

485
00:36:53,294 --> 00:37:00,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had some luck with the gentleman's name that I gave to Tim earlier today, and he's actually dealt with him on some other issues.

486
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:02,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hopeful that that will work out.

487
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:04,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

488
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:05,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you very much.

489
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,520

[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

563
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:48,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

564
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:52,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

565
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone online tonight that is in opposition to the petition that would like to speak?

566
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

567
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:08,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Do any of the councilors have questions?

568
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:11,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

569
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:34,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, if we can, do you know when this project, the only thing that, as we're getting later in the season, I'm just a little concerned about the trench work that's being done and the sinkage that happens during the time of year when the hot top is laid and then with the frost, it sinks.

570
00:44:34,425 --> 00:44:38,946
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a little concerned about, is the city engineer present?

571
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:40,707
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

572
00:44:42,656 --> 00:44:44,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim McGivern, I'm going to unmute you.

573
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:48,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Tim McGivern, City Engineer.

574
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:51,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Honorable Councilors.

575
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:51,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Tim.

576
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:59,614
[SPEAKER_05]: To touch upon that point, through the Chair, so that's a separate process to grant permission for winter work.

577
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:04,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a dual approval by the DPW commissioner and myself.

578
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And the default position is November 15th.

579
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:12,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't allow street open permits in the city without a special exception.

580
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:24,765
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so if it's done in that time, it's safe to say that we're not going to see the significant road sinkage that we see happening sometimes, Tim.

581
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:34,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're in the moratorium now, and I don't believe we've been asked permission for this particular project, but you do touch upon something that is correct.

582
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:47,100
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do work during, especially freezing temperatures in the winter that is associated with soil, then the next season, when the temperatures increase, so the next weeks, you can get consolidation that you wouldn't anticipate in cold weather.

583
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:51,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is one of the reasons why we don't, we try not to allow winter work.

584
00:45:51,464 --> 00:45:54,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this isn't going off now?

585
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:55,867
[SPEAKER_11]: this project.

586
00:45:55,907 --> 00:46:02,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have prepared the TMP and we have the PE stamp drawings ready to go as early as tomorrow.

587
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:07,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, there would be some guarantee on the condition of the patch.

588
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:09,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

589
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:10,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not too... I'm not...

590
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:14,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm asking the city engineer.

591
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,156
[SPEAKER_11]: All due respect, Ms.

592
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:21,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuddy, all due respect, I don't have much faith with the utilities when it comes to our streets.

593
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:26,907
[SPEAKER_11]: There are sink holes all over the community because we didn't do our due diligence.

594
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:32,552
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to make sure that if we do find a way to approve this,

595
00:46:33,453 --> 00:46:39,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And we normally don't have a clerk of the works that follows up on these issues as we move forward.

596
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:45,536
[SPEAKER_11]: What guarantees do we have that the road is going to be in good shape come spring?

597
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:53,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if not, who is National Grid going to come back to fix that and put it to where we feel it's acceptable?

598
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:57,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim.

599
00:46:58,379 --> 00:46:59,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I still being addressed?

600
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

601
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

602
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim, that was to you.

603
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:11,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we do our best to try to hold utilities accountable if we come across a cave-in or if we come across a settlement that creates a hazard.

604
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:13,299
[SPEAKER_05]: We do try to stay on top of that.

605
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:19,522
[SPEAKER_05]: For something like this, if the commissioner were to give permission for winter work, weather dependent of course,

606
00:47:20,982 --> 00:47:30,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we would follow up in the springtime, usually a season later, to confirm any settlement issues or things like that.

607
00:47:30,365 --> 00:47:33,486
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the procedure we try to have.

608
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:38,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So at least a season of settlement for the temporary situation to identify any issues.

609
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We typically go through that procedure.

610
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:49,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, national group being the petitioner today, are they usually forthcoming with making those corrections if that happens?

611
00:47:49,928 --> 00:47:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: The team is typically responsive to our concerns.

612
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:58,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Most recently, we noticed some issues with some curbing in Redford Square.

613
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And we called them up.

614
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And within a couple of days, I believe, they were mobilized to take care of it.

615
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:04,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So that happens on a regular basis.

616
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:13,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But we try to measure and inspect shortly thereafter the work, obviously, if we can.

617
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:14,094
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

618
00:48:14,114 --> 00:48:14,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

619
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:18,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

620
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

621
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:20,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

622
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:24,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very familiar with this portion of the city, this area.

623
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:30,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this gas main going to be connecting to that construction project on Medford Street?

624
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:34,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what 87 Medford Street is, that big building that they just built there on the border?

625
00:48:34,843 --> 00:48:35,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

626
00:48:35,464 --> 00:48:35,684
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

627
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:36,044
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

628
00:48:36,604 --> 00:48:40,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And forgive me if I missed it.

629
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:42,307
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is the construction going to take for this 532 feet?

630
00:48:42,327 --> 00:48:46,189
[SPEAKER_06]: They anticipate it'll take about two weeks.

631
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:46,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Two weeks.

632
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And when is the construction going to be performed during the day, during the night?

633
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:54,045
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up to the conditions on the permit.

634
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:55,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim?

635
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:01,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, we always discuss that with the police and

636
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:04,568
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we take a look at that.

637
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:11,791
[SPEAKER_05]: For this stretch road, I'm not exactly sure what would drive us to say have it done at night, for example.

638
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always take a look at that pretty closely and talk with the police department if we need to look at night work or weekend work or off hour work.

639
00:49:21,014 --> 00:49:25,355
[SPEAKER_05]: But we haven't looked at this particular project in that depth quite yet.

640
00:49:26,315 --> 00:49:31,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it possible we could just have a pre-construction meeting with the abutters on the roadway before the work begins?

641
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:33,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

642
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:34,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

643
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:35,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

644
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:36,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

645
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

646
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:40,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from the council?

647
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:45,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello to approve.

648
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

649
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk, please call the roll.

650
00:49:54,112 --> 00:49:54,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Behrs?

651
00:49:54,932 --> 00:49:55,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

652
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:56,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Caraviello?

653
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:56,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

654
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:57,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight?

655
00:49:57,832 --> 00:49:58,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

656
00:49:58,472 --> 00:49:59,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

657
00:49:59,153 --> 00:49:59,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

658
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:00,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morrell?

659
00:50:00,553 --> 00:50:00,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

660
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:02,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

661
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:02,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

662
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:03,248
[SPEAKER_02]: President Falcone?

663
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:03,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

664
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:05,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

665
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:06,889
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

666
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:09,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

667
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

668
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:25,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Motions, orders and resolutions 20-640 offered by Vice President Caviello and Councilor Knight.

669
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:26,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Be resolved.

670
00:50:28,135 --> 00:50:39,503
[SPEAKER_08]: That the Memphis City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of long time West Medford resident, Leo McHugh, whose presence in our community will be dearly missed.

671
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:40,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caviel.

672
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:42,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

673
00:50:43,145 --> 00:50:48,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I don't think anybody in West Medford who was a Democrat in this city didn't know Leo McHugh.

674
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:53,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo McHugh was doing ward and city politics.

675
00:50:54,213 --> 00:50:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: long before any of us were sitting around this table here.

676
00:50:58,714 --> 00:51:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I met Leo in, I think it was 1968, 69, when he was a student teacher, a substitute teacher at the high school.

677
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:06,976
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I first met him.

678
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:08,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And I became friends with him.

679
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,597
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been friends for a long time.

680
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:13,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, here's a man, BC Golden Eagle graduate.

681
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:15,798
[SPEAKER_04]: with the clerk.

682
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:22,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this man, he bled blue Democratic politics in the city of Medford.

683
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:28,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Democratic party is going to be the sore spot for him to be missed from the party.

684
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:31,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And I send this condolences off to his family.

685
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:33,777
[SPEAKER_04]: As I say, Leo's going to be missed.

686
00:51:34,337 --> 00:51:36,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he was holding the sign, Biden's sign.

687
00:51:37,538 --> 00:51:45,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Just last week, even after the election, I saw him at West Medford and see him all the time, and shocked when I got the call.

688
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:47,708
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's a good man, good Democrat.

689
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:51,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Democratic party in the city, big loss for them.

690
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:53,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Leo.

691
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

692
00:51:58,012 --> 00:51:59,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

693
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:07,221
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to Leo's role in Democratic politics here in the city of Medford, he was also a great family man, a great husband, lived on Jackson Road for a long time.

694
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:12,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can first remember meeting Leo as a young kid, first getting involved in politics, working for Senator Shannon.

695
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:17,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And Leo pulled me aside down at the West Medford Spa and talking to me about

696
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:19,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Various issues going on in the community.

697
00:52:19,572 --> 00:52:21,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So I remember Leo running for office.

698
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:23,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Leo chairing the Wood Six Democratic City Committee.

699
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:33,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But most of all, I remember Leo being someone who genuinely cared for people and went out of his way to give a kind word, to help out people in the neighborhood.

700
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:37,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And just as a young kid, to give me a pat on the back and tell me to keep doing what I was doing.

701
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:38,796
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was very motivating, Mr. President.

702
00:52:38,816 --> 00:52:41,597
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be sorely missed, and I'm sad to see him go.

703
00:52:42,197 --> 00:52:45,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I echo Councilor Caviello's condolences.

704
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:47,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

705
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:48,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Moniz.

706
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on.

707
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,701
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a real big shock, Mr. President.

708
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:57,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Leo was always very spunky.

709
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:02,683
[SPEAKER_09]: He'd be the first to give a good word and also tell you the truth on something, too.

710
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:05,364
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't hold back any punches when you talked to Leo.

711
00:53:05,804 --> 00:53:14,787
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll tell you how it was, and as Councilor Caviello put it so eloquently, he was involved in a lot of different things in the community.

712
00:53:15,187 --> 00:53:21,989
[SPEAKER_09]: But what stands out to me is the involvement, those late night meetings that we used to have with the Democratic Warded City Committee.

713
00:53:22,629 --> 00:53:25,650
[SPEAKER_09]: He would be out on every issue supporting his cause.

714
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:32,812
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a man of, really, of integrity and someone you can count on as a friend.

715
00:53:33,673 --> 00:53:35,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

716
00:53:36,525 --> 00:53:36,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

717
00:53:38,697 --> 00:53:43,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to thank my council colleagues as well for bringing this forward.

718
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Leo was a great guy.

719
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:49,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I met him when I first got involved in running for office.

720
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:57,832
[SPEAKER_08]: He was always very encouraging, always willing to talk about issues, and a big, big part of the Democratic Wood City Committee.

721
00:53:57,852 --> 00:54:02,976
[SPEAKER_08]: He will be sorely missed, and our thoughts and prayers go to his family.

722
00:54:03,316 --> 00:54:07,099
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

777
00:56:49,393 --> 00:56:54,417
[SPEAKER_11]: And as this family would tell you, if you're a politician, you don't win unless the Silvios are pushing for you.

778
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:58,100

780
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:12,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know Mr. Silvio used to be there every day to pick her up and someone that we're going to miss seeing around the city.

781
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So our condolences to the Silvio family.

884
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:16,725
[SPEAKER_09]: This Saturday, Mr. President, I would ask that we get a correspondence from the city administration regarding the reverse 9-1-1 that I believe Councilor Knight requested to notify area residents.

885
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:22,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And also that we get a correspondence of the location and the time.

886
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we established 11 o'clock.

887
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:29,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't mind.

888
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll buy it.

889
01:01:49,279 --> 01:01:51,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

890
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:51,901
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

891
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:54,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a city council committee, the whole meeting.

892
01:01:54,203 --> 01:01:54,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

893
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:57,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was, I was waiting for department heads to get back to me.

894
01:01:58,286 --> 01:02:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So I haven't heard from everyone, but I'll give a final call.

895
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,310
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 11 o'clock.

896
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:03,791
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay.

897
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:34,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I just want to stress, it's extremely important that when we meet as a council to discuss neighborhood concerns, public safety concerns, that we get a buy-in from the city administration.

898
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:38,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's extremely important that all the parties

899
01:02:39,457 --> 01:02:43,218
[SPEAKER_09]: that can make substantial change in this community be present, Mr. President.

900
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:57,603
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would be extremely disappointed if we didn't see the leadership in this committee, this community, show up to this particular Committee of the Whole meeting when we're discussing very important issues up the heights, Mr. President.

901
01:02:57,623 --> 01:02:58,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I would agree with you as well.

902
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:00,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

903
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Night, that we adjourn the meeting.
