58
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:11,321
[SPEAKER_06]: We have good of the order.

59
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody have any items that are good of the order?

60
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:25,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I'm just going to move to the consent agenda we have approval of bills and payrolls approval of capital purchases approval grants.

61
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:31,675
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Cummings Foundation grant of 35,000 for Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

62
01:15:32,496 --> 01:15:35,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve McCarthy, 20,000 in memory of Ray O'Brien.

63
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:48,249
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have approval of field trips, approval of meeting minutes, which are two meetings, one from June 18th, 2025, which is a regular meeting, and August 13th, 2025, which is a special meeting.

64
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor?

65
01:15:49,951 --> 01:15:52,933
[SPEAKER_13]: A motion to sever the CCSR.

66
01:15:54,235 --> 01:15:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to sever CCSR, and is there approval for everything else?

67
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve everything else.

68
01:16:01,402 --> 01:16:02,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

69
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:03,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

70
01:16:04,486 --> 01:16:05,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Member Brandley.

71
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:06,548
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

72
01:16:06,568 --> 01:16:08,970
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

73
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Consent agenda is approved, except for the Cummings Foundation.

74
01:16:12,794 --> 01:16:14,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll turn it over to you, Member Reinfeldt.

75
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:22,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I was just noticing the allowing us to redirect these resources to areas of greatest need.

76
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:27,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm curious what that means in terms of, is that for within the CCSR program?

77
01:16:28,008 --> 01:16:30,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that related programs?

78
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Where does this money go if it's not going to what was written in the grant?

79
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it just deviation from the line items?

80
01:16:41,517 --> 01:16:41,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry?

81
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ntapa.

82
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:46,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, excuse me.

83
01:16:46,472 --> 01:16:53,597
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as I'm concerned, the grants language means that it has to go to the CCSR and that it can't be put into the general rotation fund.

84
01:16:54,117 --> 01:17:02,563
[SPEAKER_11]: So this money remains to the CCSR and is usually spread over a 10 year allowance.

85
01:17:03,364 --> 01:17:06,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, but I'm reading this as communicated in our May 20th email.

86
01:17:06,606 --> 01:17:12,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Foundation is lifting restrictions on the use of grant funds versus to your organization, allowing you to redirect these resources.

87
01:17:13,335 --> 01:17:14,636
[SPEAKER_13]: to the areas of greatest need.

88
01:17:15,657 --> 01:17:17,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just, I don't fully understand.

89
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:21,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the greatest need within CCSR?

90
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:22,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's what.

91
01:17:23,022 --> 01:17:25,964
[SPEAKER_13]: The greatest need within the CCSR program as not to.

92
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may.

93
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:42,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the motion is severed, I can find out some more information about that and report it to this body so that you can vote on it on another date.

94
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:44,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't anticipate this is going to be a problem.

95
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:52,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I just am curious what that means, because this is one of the largest grants we received and one of our largest revolving accounts stipended, et cetera, all of that.

96
01:17:57,064 --> 01:17:57,224
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

97
01:17:58,685 --> 01:17:58,785
Yeah.

98
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so is there a motion to table?

99
01:18:02,896 --> 01:18:03,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

100
01:18:04,276 --> 01:18:15,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, as I'm reading the letter from Cummings, it sort of infers that there's a report that we filed

101
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:20,858
[SPEAKER_09]: an impact report, and they're asking for us to reflect on variances.

102
01:18:20,938 --> 01:18:31,963
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think lifting restrictions is vague, and it probably means something specific that accompanied the letter in some way, or that there's some change in reporting.

103
01:18:32,063 --> 01:18:35,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we just want to be clear on what those changes are.

104
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,468
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion to table until we have an answer.

105
01:18:43,488 --> 01:18:45,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table by Member Reinfeld, seconded by?

106
01:18:46,202 --> 01:18:48,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa, all those in favor?

107
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:48,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

108
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

109
01:18:53,147 --> 01:18:57,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion is tabled until we find out some answers on the letter from the Cummings Foundation.

110
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:00,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

111
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:02,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

112
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:10,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just ask one other quick question about the scholarship?

113
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,781
[SPEAKER_09]: from Steve McCarthy.

114
01:19:14,762 --> 01:19:20,886
[SPEAKER_09]: This letter doesn't say that it's an expectation that it's set up as an endowment.

115
01:19:21,747 --> 01:19:25,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, like being sort of corned off in an interest bearing account.

116
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:29,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that we've had issues with other similar

117
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:43,335
[SPEAKER_09]: awards like this, so I just was hoping that we could just check into and be clear on whether that needs to be established that way from the outset or if it's just a straight

118
01:19:44,615 --> 01:19:49,859
[SPEAKER_09]: amount of money that will be like worked down over the course of the 10 years.

119
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:51,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So 10 times 500.

120
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what it means.

121
01:19:53,542 --> 01:20:02,308
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would just like to be clear because we have some other situations that did not appear to get set up quite as as the grant as the donation intended.

122
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:04,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

123
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:06,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Graham.

124
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:12,317
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have any reports of subcommittee, but we do have two reports of our superintendent.

125
01:20:12,397 --> 01:20:13,960
[SPEAKER_06]: First up is Mustang Moments.

126
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,502
[SPEAKER_06]: We have student presentations.

127
01:20:16,403 --> 01:20:18,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Arts update.

128
01:20:19,662 --> 01:20:23,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Suzanne Fee, Director of Fine Arts, accompanied by our student body.

129
01:20:23,303 --> 01:20:24,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just?

130
01:20:24,323 --> 01:20:25,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Dr. Lucy.

131
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:32,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I invite everyone over, I just want to kind of do a little framing, if that's okay for this body.

132
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:34,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, good evening.

133
01:20:34,165 --> 01:20:43,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, our students and caregivers, and our central leadership team here, welcome back.

134
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And we welcome the school year 25-26.

135
01:20:47,487 --> 01:21:08,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to take a little moment this is a shift in our school committee agenda format so that we're going to be starting our meetings with the Mustang moment so that all meetings will start with the voices of students and I think it's just important for me to explain that quickly before we move on to bringing up Director Fee and the students.

136
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:08,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So

137
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:18,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mustang Moment is going to be a student-led segment that will celebrate accomplishments, shared projects, initiatives, or showcase talents.

138
01:21:19,733 --> 01:21:21,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So students are the why.

139
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:23,855
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the reason for why we do this.

140
01:21:23,955 --> 01:21:25,295
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the reason that we're here.

141
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:32,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want this space to also be one in which we're elevating their voices and we're listening to their perspectives.

142
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:36,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time we gather as adults who are in decision-making,

143
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,301
[SPEAKER_05]: who have the power for making decisions.

144
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:47,163
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mustang moment is just an intentional practice that we're going to have as a way to start the meetings.

145
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:58,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So for this first meeting, we have Director Fee here, who's going to introduce us to some students and talk to us about the Summer Studios work that happened this summer.

146
01:21:59,047 --> 01:21:59,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

147
01:22:06,285 --> 01:22:14,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for inviting us, and I'm going to let the kids explain a little bit about what we had going on in the art world this summer and the music world.

148
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:17,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Cameron Belanger.

149
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in ninth grade.

150
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:23,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Evie O'Shea, and I'm also in ninth grade.

151
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Jack Mastermatteo.

152
01:22:26,813 --> 01:22:27,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in ninth grade.

153
01:22:31,412 --> 01:22:49,904
[SPEAKER_04]: This summer, thanks to support from the CCSR and the Cummings Foundation, we were able to offer three free art workshops, painting portfolio prep and mural making these workshops were open to all students entering grades nine to 12, giving everyone the chance to participate and explore their creativity.

154
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:54,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight we're excited to share and highlight the mural project we participated in.

155
01:22:55,279 --> 01:23:00,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We began by voting on the message we wanted the mural to convey, as well as the overall theme and vibe of the artwork.

156
01:23:01,701 --> 01:23:03,681
[SPEAKER_04]: We also selected the color palette together.

157
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:14,324
[SPEAKER_04]: From the start, we knew we wanted something bold and vibrant, an uplifting design with a positive message that reflects not only the arts, but the spirit of our entire social community.

158
01:23:15,368 --> 01:23:24,073
[SPEAKER_04]: From the start, we knew we wanted something bold and vibrant, an uplifting design with a positive message that reflects not only the arts, but the spirit of our entire school community.

159
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,735
[SPEAKER_04]: As a group, we decided on the phrase, dare to begin.

160
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:34,400
[SPEAKER_04]: We felt it reflected the courage to take risks, try new things, and embrace creativity, whether in art, in learning, or in life at school.

161
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds us that every achievement starts with the first step.

162
01:23:40,836 --> 01:23:45,179
[SPEAKER_15]: From there, we brainstormed ideas and sketched out possible elements for the mural.

163
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:52,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Fee and Mrs. Belandra gathered all of our sketches and combined them into one single design that represented contributions from everyone.

164
01:23:53,906 --> 01:24:01,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Once the final layout was ready, we projected it onto the wall and made sure that the composition worked and the design felt visually balanced.

165
01:24:02,959 --> 01:24:05,762
[SPEAKER_15]: We spent a lot of time thinking about the color placement and scale.

166
01:24:06,503 --> 01:24:10,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Our goal was to create something energetic and vibrant, but not overwhelming.

167
01:24:10,827 --> 01:24:14,231
[SPEAKER_15]: A mural that inspires and uplifts everyone who walks by each day.

168
01:24:15,352 --> 01:24:22,400
[SPEAKER_15]: We're really proud of how it turned out, and it's been so exciting to already hear such positive feedback from students and staff across the school.

169
01:24:23,715 --> 01:24:28,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Through this process, we learned a lot about what it takes to create a mural as a team.

170
01:24:28,817 --> 01:24:30,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Collaboration was key.

171
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:33,480
[SPEAKER_15]: We had to listen to each other's ideas and make decisions together.

172
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:40,243
[SPEAKER_15]: We also learned the importance of slowing down, taking our time, and paying attention to the details instead of rushing.

173
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:44,945
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe most importantly, we discovered how important it is to be flexible.

174
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:52,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes what we planned didn't look the way that we imagined on the wall, so we had to adjust, adapt, and try new approaches.

175
01:24:53,029 --> 01:25:00,837
[SPEAKER_15]: These lessons made the mural stronger and gave us the skills that we need to use, that we can use far beyond this project.

176
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:16,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mural shows what we can do when we work together, when we are proud of it, and we hope that it inspires everyone at our school to dare to begin.

177
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, my name is Gemma, I'm the percussion captain and I'm in 12th grade.

178
01:25:36,103 --> 01:25:40,308
[SPEAKER_14]: So good evening and thank you for giving us the chance to share some exciting updates about the marching band.

179
01:25:40,828 --> 01:25:45,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Our first big event of the season is our home show which will take place right right at Hormel Stadium.

180
01:25:45,733 --> 01:25:48,456
[SPEAKER_14]: The event begins at 4pm with the award ceremony scheduled for 6.15pm.

181
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:55,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Fans from all across Massachusetts will be traveling here to perform, and while we're also proud to host, this will be our very first competition of the season.

182
01:25:56,181 --> 01:26:00,703
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a huge event for us, so we would love to see strong support from the community in the stands.

183
01:26:01,184 --> 01:26:08,748
[SPEAKER_14]: The home show also serves as an important fundraiser to help cover the costs for our staff and other expenses that go into running our program.

184
01:26:12,596 --> 01:26:13,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my name is Ali.

185
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:16,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the captain of the Medford High School Color Guard.

186
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:19,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we step onto the competition field this season,

187
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:32,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent two weeks at our annual band camp this summer where we learned the bulk of our competition show before with both music and marching responsibilities to bring it to life.

188
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:37,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an intense but exciting time filled with long days of practice, teamwork and growth.

189
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:47,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended camp with a special preview of our show on Friday, August 22nd, where family and community members were invited to see our progress.

190
01:26:47,477 --> 01:26:47,898
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition,

191
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:50,760
[SPEAKER_02]: to taking the show to competitions.

192
01:26:51,141 --> 01:27:00,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Selections from it will be presented at our home football games this season, so the entire school community can experience all of our hard work and the energy we've built.

193
01:27:01,056 --> 01:27:01,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

194
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:08,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Jonas Fertz and I'm the drum major of the Medford High School Marching Band.

195
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:12,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, I just wanna share a little bit about the show theme for this year.

196
01:27:13,272 --> 01:27:21,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So our program is a mashup of Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall and Shostakovich's Ballad Suite No.

197
01:27:21,494 --> 01:27:21,474
2.

198
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:30,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So the music and movement work together to send a message about evolving, breaking down barriers, and connecting with your creativity.

199
01:27:31,028 --> 01:27:35,789
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both powerful and inspiring, and we can't wait to share it with our audiences throughout our season.

200
01:27:55,673 --> 01:27:56,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much.

201
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:06,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate listening to what you did all summer long, and we're so excited to see the band competition performance coming up soon.

202
01:28:07,285 --> 01:28:10,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And next time someone's in the high school, you can check out the mural.

203
01:28:10,347 --> 01:28:12,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the art wing right off the main office.

204
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:14,710
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna just have a quick little photo.

205
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:19,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the band show is the 20th.

206
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:20,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That date wasn't thrown out.

207
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:21,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the 20th at four.

208
01:29:21,851 --> 01:29:27,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can also see the band and the color guard at all the home games, I believe, right?

209
01:29:27,453 --> 01:29:27,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Football games?

210
01:29:28,033 --> 01:29:28,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

211
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:31,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a good way to see everybody in action.

212
01:29:32,053 --> 01:29:38,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully our community gets out and checks out the band, the football team, the color guard, and our cheerleaders.

213
01:29:40,182 --> 01:29:44,508
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, next up, we have our superintendent's update.

214
01:29:44,529 --> 01:29:47,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, superintendent.

215
01:29:47,713 --> 01:29:48,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

216
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:53,702
[SPEAKER_05]: What we are about to go through is just an update for the opening of schools for school year 25-26.

217
01:29:55,845 --> 01:30:01,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So first and foremost, we have welcomed many new staff into the Medford Public Schools.

218
01:30:01,826 --> 01:30:07,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Each individual brings unique talents, experiences, and perspectives that enrich our school community.

219
01:30:08,188 --> 01:30:15,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And every role adds incredible value to our schools and helps us create the best experience for our students and our school communities.

220
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:25,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So in total, we welcomed about 40 new teachers, two nurses, 12 paraprofessionals,

221
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:38,336
[SPEAKER_05]: three members of food service, two custodians, seven coaches, athletic coaches, three administrative assistants, and eight administrators district-wide.

222
01:30:39,357 --> 01:30:52,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Those administrators are Dr. Kim Talbot, our new assistant superintendent for academics and instruction, who's here this evening, Mr. Ken Lord, our chief operations officer, who is also here this evening, Chelsea McNiff, our new EL director,

223
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:57,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Robert O'Leary, the new athletic director.

224
01:30:58,288 --> 01:31:02,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan McGowan is a new high school house assistant principal.

225
01:31:03,312 --> 01:31:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Alessandro Cornelio is the new assistant principal at the Brooks Elementary.

226
01:31:08,036 --> 01:31:12,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Zides is our new special education coordinator.

227
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:20,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And Romario Bernacci is the dean of students at Medford High School through the Mustang Academy.

228
01:31:23,274 --> 01:31:38,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that memo went out, but I also do think just to note that we are also actively searching for a new world language director as bittersweet news, Dr. Vilma Bobo has left Metro Public Schools.

229
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:44,154
[SPEAKER_05]: She is now the new director of modern languages for the Boston Latin Academy.

230
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:48,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

231
01:31:49,621 --> 01:31:53,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And then moving forward, Mr. Pippincott, you can go to the next.

232
01:31:53,884 --> 01:32:00,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So last November, some of this is a review, but I just want to cap it and review it on the road here to our opening.

233
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:10,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So last November, I shared with this committee our instructional vision that was the result of collective work with both administrators and teachers.

234
01:32:12,018 --> 01:32:15,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That vision continues to guide our daily work and our decision making.

235
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:26,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So to strengthen its impact, this year we have now branded the instructional vision with corresponding icons, providing a visual anchor for our efforts.

236
01:32:27,425 --> 01:32:37,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So the icons allow educational leaders, they allow administrators and teachers to easily highlight and reference the specific elements of the vision that they're focusing on in their practice.

237
01:32:39,415 --> 01:32:44,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see to the left that the high school team has worked collaboratively to create STRIVE.

238
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:55,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our portrait of a graduate, which creates a shared vision of what skills, mindsets, and qualities Medford Public Schools students should have before they graduate.

239
01:32:56,452 --> 01:33:03,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It focuses on things that are beyond just test scores and grades for broader competencies.

240
01:33:03,859 --> 01:33:17,175
[SPEAKER_05]: like collaboration, adaptability, critical thinking, civic responsibility, which will prepare our students once they graduate from Medford Public Schools in college, career, and life.

241
01:33:18,862 --> 01:33:24,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So our instructional vision has also provided Medford Public Schools with our core values.

242
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:33,807
[SPEAKER_05]: These core values have been shared every time that different elements of staff has gathered throughout the summer that I will highlight on a future slide.

243
01:33:34,367 --> 01:33:43,370
[SPEAKER_05]: But our core values as reflected in both our instructional vision and our equity commitment, if we could go to the next slide, please.

244
01:33:45,108 --> 01:33:57,472
[SPEAKER_05]: is that we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.

245
01:33:58,552 --> 01:34:06,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We believe that all students deserve opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.

246
01:34:07,455 --> 01:34:12,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And we believe that every student's success is our shared responsibility.

247
01:34:16,436 --> 01:34:25,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So our collective charge this year, as you saw reflected in my Friday, a few of the Friday memos, is on belonging.

248
01:34:26,504 --> 01:34:34,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So belonging as a foundation, it's not an add-on, it's the foundation for our instructional vision.

249
01:34:35,412 --> 01:34:43,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Without belonging, access alone is not enough, and expectations can feel out of reach for students and staff.

250
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Instruction cannot fully connect to our students' lives if they do not feel a sense of belonging in the classroom.

251
01:34:52,742 --> 01:35:07,064
[SPEAKER_05]: When students feel seen, heard, and valued, then they're more able to take academic risks, engage more deeply in their learning, and rise to the high expectations because they know we trust them and we're going to be there for them.

252
01:35:08,004 --> 01:35:10,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does that look like in this school year?

253
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:15,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So belonging is the lens for our decision-making this year.

254
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:21,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that looks like is we are making sure that we're building inclusive and affirming spaces.

255
01:35:22,678 --> 01:35:26,980
[SPEAKER_05]: We're ensuring that students see themselves reflected in the classrooms.

256
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:30,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We're maintaining those high expectations.

257
01:35:30,842 --> 01:35:36,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And if students need supports in order to access those high expectations, we are going to make sure that they have them.

258
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:47,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be using data, not just to measure progress, but also to address inequities that that data uncovers.

259
01:35:49,096 --> 01:36:03,521
[SPEAKER_05]: We are making a commitment to extend this sense of belonging to everyone in Metro Public Schools, because we know that when the adults feel a sense of belonging, they are there and more present to support what our students need.

260
01:36:06,306 --> 01:36:12,902
[SPEAKER_05]: By fostering belonging collectively, Medford becomes a place where every student feels that they can thrive here.

261
01:36:15,931 --> 01:36:32,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide, to support these branding efforts and our collective charge, this poster was created by a Medford High School arts student, Grace Anzalone, and the graphic arts department has printed them.

262
01:36:33,116 --> 01:36:44,300
[SPEAKER_05]: These were sent to schools so that every educator and learning spaces have that poster as a reminder of the why for this year and why we're here.

263
01:36:47,423 --> 01:36:57,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So taking this collective charge and moving into all the spaces of work that have led us to the opening of schools, the first was the administrative retreat.

264
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:05,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the first time, we were able to take the administrative retreat off campus.

265
01:37:06,295 --> 01:37:15,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And through the wonderful partnership that we have with the Barr Foundation, they gave us their space in the North End and we were able to coalesce

266
01:37:16,482 --> 01:37:32,309
[SPEAKER_05]: as an administrative unit, as you heard, we have a lot of new administrative staff, but we also have some veteran returning presence that we needed to have a space off campus for us to reset and refocus on our work for the year.

267
01:37:33,069 --> 01:37:44,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So right here, you can just see some pictures of the staff gathered here, but we were able to really set a strong foundation for the year so that when we're welcoming

268
01:37:45,892 --> 01:37:58,160
[SPEAKER_05]: teachers back, when we're welcoming students and families back, we are very aligned in our leadership and what that looks like for our school communities and our greater community.

269
01:38:00,188 --> 01:38:07,390
[SPEAKER_05]: From there, we had the, so the following week was the induction week, where we welcome all of those new teachers.

270
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:21,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had three days with them to not only get them situated to welcome students back on day one, but also for them to understand what Medford Public Schools is all about, what we stand for, what our culture is.

271
01:38:22,435 --> 01:38:28,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So we knew that we wanted them to also feel a sense of belonging as they're coming into this district.

272
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:30,629
[SPEAKER_05]: and get to know.

273
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:34,889
[SPEAKER_05]: the greater Medford community beyond just what their curriculum is.

274
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:44,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see here, they were engaged in activities that were around what they're being taught, around what our expectations are for teachers.

275
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:52,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And also they had a tour of Medford and got to spend a luncheon with, which was sponsored by the teachers union.

276
01:38:52,877 --> 01:38:58,940
[SPEAKER_05]: On the tour that you'll see some highlights here where Medford public library, where they were,

277
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:10,806
[SPEAKER_05]: first dropped off at Colleen's, treated to some ice cream, and then walked up to the library, had a presentation with the librarians here.

278
01:39:11,606 --> 01:39:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: But also part of the tour on the bus was to make sure that they went and visited not only where all of our schools are situated, but some important landmarks in the city of Medford.

279
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I do wanna just also shout out, we had three administrators that had a lot of time and organization in helping get the induction week off and set, Mr. Mike DiClemente, Ms.

280
01:39:39,658 --> 01:39:42,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Catherine Cook, and Dr. Vilma Bobo.

281
01:39:43,959 --> 01:39:45,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ms.

282
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:49,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Cook will continue that work in the mentor program throughout the year.

283
01:39:52,342 --> 01:39:53,523
[SPEAKER_05]: The following week,

284
01:39:54,832 --> 01:39:57,455
[SPEAKER_05]: We welcomed teachers back for the first two days of school.

285
01:39:58,235 --> 01:40:00,337
[SPEAKER_05]: That first day was a professional development day.

286
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:08,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And staff here, you can see the pictures, but they were engaged in professional development at the elementary level.

287
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:14,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The staff were engaged in the Safe Schools presentation through the Department of Education and the Safe Schools

288
01:40:17,085 --> 01:40:32,517
[SPEAKER_05]: coalition, they also received a DIBLS refresher to make sure that they're ready for the progress monitoring and the unpacking of the new schedule to make sure that there was alignment there and they could plan accordingly.

289
01:40:33,257 --> 01:40:36,300
[SPEAKER_05]: At the secondary level, the majority of teachers

290
01:40:37,080 --> 01:41:00,314
[SPEAKER_05]: were engaged in presentations from the Unbound Ed organization that we have partnered with through the Barr Foundation in the continued work on GLEAM planning, which is having teachers make sure that their planning reflects content and associated tasks that are grade-level, engaging, affirming, and meaningful.

291
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:02,155
[SPEAKER_05]: There were other

292
01:41:03,045 --> 01:41:06,808
[SPEAKER_05]: trainings going on at the secondary level through Ms.

293
01:41:06,868 --> 01:41:10,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Cook and Dr. Shulman, and also Ms.

294
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:26,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Fee brought in Erin Zaffini, and she is leading a year-long training called Equity by Design, Strategic and Realistic Strategies to Improve Equity in the Arts Classroom.

295
01:41:28,064 --> 01:41:31,246
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't mind, okay, thank you, that's fine.

296
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:36,109
[SPEAKER_05]: The second day was what we call our launch day.

297
01:41:36,149 --> 01:41:39,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when we welcome all staff collectively back together.

298
01:41:39,411 --> 01:41:43,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also time where they have in their classrooms to prepare for students.

299
01:41:43,813 --> 01:41:51,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's time that they have with their principals and their directors really getting focused and engaging on the school year work ahead.

300
01:41:52,476 --> 01:42:01,420
[SPEAKER_05]: The day started with a convocation in the high school gymnasium where I led a welcome back section.

301
01:42:02,063 --> 01:42:09,109
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also brought in voices of our high school students to help lead us in welcoming back staff.

302
01:42:09,969 --> 01:42:12,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you see a picture of the students.

303
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:19,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Emily Matariz, Matthew Fills, James Klugisch, Guy Martins, and Mia Leal.

304
01:42:19,857 --> 01:42:30,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And they spoke to the staff about what belonging means to them, where they find it at Medford High School, and what teachers can do to help further that

305
01:42:31,867 --> 01:42:39,594
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling and that sense of belonging in not just their classrooms, but in the greater school community.

306
01:42:40,875 --> 01:42:42,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some of those quotes there.

307
01:42:42,896 --> 01:42:58,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the highlights is that students are finding sense of belonging, both in the classroom and outside of the classroom, in sports organizations, including Unified Sports, through teachers and their friends.

308
01:43:01,727 --> 01:43:09,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the first two days of school, Dr. Talbot, Ms.

309
01:43:09,064 --> 01:43:09,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowen, Ms.

310
01:43:09,846 --> 01:43:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: McNiff, and I

311
01:43:12,467 --> 01:43:19,591
[SPEAKER_05]: We were quite proud that we were able to hit every single exterior school on the first day of school.

312
01:43:20,511 --> 01:43:34,119
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably should have had like a Snickers bar because I think by like 132 o'clock, we were feeling it but we were able to get to every single school, welcome in staff welcome in students and really get a

313
01:43:34,919 --> 01:43:45,928
[SPEAKER_05]: a feel for the warmth and the sense of belonging that we could see both visually in classrooms, in hallways, on playgrounds.

314
01:43:46,168 --> 01:43:49,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just a really wonderful way to kick off the year.

315
01:43:50,371 --> 01:43:51,853
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a few pictures here.

316
01:43:53,634 --> 01:44:03,122
[SPEAKER_05]: One to the left is the Misutak where they had an intentional gathering of the school as a way to kick off the year and welcome back the entire school community.

317
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:16,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think it's, there were lots of moments within classrooms and in hallway displays about the sense of belonging that the community is feeling.

318
01:44:19,275 --> 01:44:36,016
[SPEAKER_05]: The next is just a reminder, I know it's probably in principal newsletters, as well as in the, it will be in the Friday memo, but this is also just a snapshot because starting this week, and then continuing to next week is our back to school nights at all of our schools.

319
01:44:36,717 --> 01:44:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's just a really important time to mention that this, if families are able, this is a wonderful opportunity for them to come in and not only meet the teachers but really start to build a relationship with their children's teachers, learn about the curriculum and the expectations, and just some of those common routines.

320
01:44:58,568 --> 01:45:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: around communication, homework, things that might be beneficial for them to know.

321
01:45:03,674 --> 01:45:12,143
[SPEAKER_05]: If families and caregivers are not able to attend, I would recommend that they reach out directly to the teacher.

322
01:45:13,084 --> 01:45:17,529
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't have that information, they can reach out to the principal who can connect them in the right

323
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:25,599
[SPEAKER_05]: fashion so that they're able to get the materials and the information that are presented during that night.

324
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:35,893
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important for us that we're able to make those individual connections and build those relationships for our caregivers.

325
01:45:39,643 --> 01:45:43,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a brief facilities and IT update.

326
01:45:45,245 --> 01:46:00,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So there has been, this also was reflected in a Friday memo and is posted on our website, but for a lot of the community, you've seen scaffolding and lots of work going on around the McGlynn and the Andrews complexes.

327
01:46:01,491 --> 01:46:08,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So phase one is the work that was done over the summer and I believe is just kind of like buttoning up right now.

328
01:46:08,996 --> 01:46:24,225
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a work to the existing HVAC systems in both schools, new filters, modifications, so that we can increase heating and cooling capacity, which will be able to provide a better level of comfort.

329
01:46:25,367 --> 01:46:28,888
[SPEAKER_05]: for staff and students in those buildings.

330
01:46:29,768 --> 01:46:37,070
[SPEAKER_05]: You also may have noticed that some work was done to make sure that we were ADA compliant in both of those places.

331
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:43,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So sidewalks, leveled rising ramps leading to the front door.

332
01:46:44,312 --> 01:46:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, there are still some temporary handrails in place.

333
01:46:48,173 --> 01:46:53,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Those will eventually be replaced with permanent structures.

334
01:46:54,123 --> 01:46:58,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that leads us into phase two, which will be completed next summer.

335
01:46:58,884 --> 01:47:07,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is where you'll see like the structural steel part come in so that it can handle brand new HVAC systems that will be replaced at that time.

336
01:47:09,426 --> 01:47:22,569
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a link, this slide deck will eventually be on the website, but if you go on to the McGlynn or the Andrews, there is this update here from the owner's project manager, Consigli Construction.

337
01:47:24,562 --> 01:47:33,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Also exciting is some IT and security work that has been started over the summer and is still ongoing.

338
01:47:33,409 --> 01:47:42,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's exciting is that this is for keyless door access, which we're just so very excited for, and it's about time.

339
01:47:43,428 --> 01:47:48,809
[SPEAKER_05]: upgrade to cameras and vape detector systems at some of our secondary schools.

340
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:59,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So in total, there are 400 new cameras being added to our existing entourage of cameras, 40 keyless door access systems.

341
01:47:59,632 --> 01:48:02,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of our buildings will now be keyless.

342
01:48:03,573 --> 01:48:10,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So within teachers' ID badges, there will be keyless entry into the schools.

343
01:48:11,215 --> 01:48:19,701
[SPEAKER_05]: which will be, we're working internally on what the access will look like, but that will be much more streamlined and very beneficial for our schools.

344
01:48:20,201 --> 01:48:28,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And there'll be 19 new video intercom systems and 46 vape detectors at the secondary schools.

345
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:38,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so that, oh, I have one more thing, but I don't know, we can come back for questions.

346
01:48:38,434 --> 01:48:39,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm giving a lot right now,

347
01:48:41,077 --> 01:48:44,098
[SPEAKER_05]: The last piece is just a quick City Year update.

348
01:48:44,338 --> 01:48:45,458
[SPEAKER_05]: City Year is back again.

349
01:48:45,718 --> 01:48:58,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We did discuss this as part of the budget, but just so we're aware, there are six core members at the McGlynn Elementary, four at the Missittuck, and seven at the McGlynn Middle School.

350
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:05,243
[SPEAKER_05]: They are assigned by just enrollment and sheer number of sections.

351
01:49:06,183 --> 01:49:18,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And so additionally this year, we're also welcoming some additional support for the Missituck with five members working in the afterschool program to support those efforts at the Missituck Elementary.

352
01:49:20,278 --> 01:49:35,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think it was very humbling and heartfelt, but they did ask me to be their keynote speaker this past Friday at their kickoff for the core members to start the 25, 26 school year.

353
01:49:35,965 --> 01:49:43,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And they definitely kept this a little secret, but surprised me because I remember all the potty, I got a red jacket.

354
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a red, and it's monogrammed.

355
01:49:50,902 --> 01:49:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's monogrammed.

356
01:49:52,222 --> 01:50:00,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see me in that picture presenting to all the core members for Greater Boston and Medford Public Schools.

357
01:50:02,725 --> 01:50:03,746
[SPEAKER_05]: They have asked for my speech.

358
01:50:03,786 --> 01:50:04,686
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see where that goes.

359
01:50:04,726 --> 01:50:05,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep you updated.

360
01:50:06,226 --> 01:50:09,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And this picture on the bottom left is the Medford team.

361
01:50:10,327 --> 01:50:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: We were able to have a nice unity circle and really kick off the year with great spirits.

362
01:50:16,129 --> 01:50:18,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm next to Alyssa David, who is the,

363
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:23,891
[SPEAKER_05]: the project manager for City Year folks just in Medford.

364
01:50:24,531 --> 01:50:28,472
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a wonderful experience last Friday afternoon.

365
01:50:28,492 --> 01:50:33,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really, really excited for them to join us this school year as well.

366
01:50:34,934 --> 01:50:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm happy to answer any questions.

367
01:50:36,894 --> 01:50:38,695
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot of information.

368
01:50:38,735 --> 01:50:40,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate your patience.

369
01:50:41,535 --> 01:50:41,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

370
01:50:41,955 --> 01:50:43,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Guzzi for the presentation.

371
01:50:44,136 --> 01:50:44,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Very informative.

372
01:50:44,936 --> 01:50:46,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the body?

373
01:50:47,177 --> 01:50:48,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none.

374
01:50:51,322 --> 01:50:53,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have any public participation.

375
01:50:54,023 --> 01:50:55,384
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have continued business.

376
01:50:56,465 --> 01:51:01,768
[SPEAKER_06]: First is 2023-25 offered by Member Hayes, Member McLaughlin, and Member McStone.

377
01:51:02,588 --> 01:51:10,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Policy second reading, whereas the Medford School Committee reaffirmed its support for the rights of LGBTQ+, Member Russo.

378
01:51:13,321 --> 01:51:14,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to waive the second reading.

379
01:51:14,781 --> 01:51:19,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I did message these three former members to ask if their ears are ringing.

380
01:51:20,443 --> 01:51:21,323
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the saying, I think.

381
01:51:21,923 --> 01:51:25,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were appreciative of this getting its second reading.

382
01:51:25,284 --> 01:51:28,064
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to make a motion to waive the second reading.

383
01:51:30,425 --> 01:51:34,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham to waive the second reading.

384
01:51:35,226 --> 01:51:36,126
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

385
01:51:36,146 --> 01:51:37,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

386
01:51:37,126 --> 01:51:37,907
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

387
01:51:38,707 --> 01:51:39,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The reading has been waived.

388
01:51:41,822 --> 01:51:43,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

389
01:51:43,904 --> 01:51:48,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Ntapa.

390
01:51:49,147 --> 01:51:49,988
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

391
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

392
01:51:51,169 --> 01:51:51,990
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

393
01:51:54,411 --> 01:51:55,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading is been approved.

394
01:51:57,153 --> 01:51:57,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Rousseau.

395
01:52:00,316 --> 01:52:01,557
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have new business.

396
01:52:03,269 --> 01:52:13,620
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is the recommendation to approve new voting and non-voting members to the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee, M-H-C-S-B-C, offered by Member Graham.

397
01:52:14,201 --> 01:52:17,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Voting member, Kenneth Lord, M-P-S, Chief Operating Officer.

398
01:52:17,744 --> 01:52:24,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And non-voting member, Dr. Kimberly Talbot, M-P-S, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction.

399
01:52:25,552 --> 01:52:25,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

400
01:52:28,816 --> 01:52:29,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

401
01:52:30,196 --> 01:52:44,401
[SPEAKER_09]: These folks will replace Dr. Cushing as a voting member and Dr. Talbot will take Joan Bowen's place who was previously a non-voting member and we elevated her to a voting member when we

402
01:52:45,141 --> 01:52:48,903
[SPEAKER_09]: elevated Dr Galusi and removed Dr Edward Benson from the committee.

403
01:52:48,943 --> 01:52:57,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's one non-voting spot, which we are asking Dr Talbot to take on.

404
01:52:57,546 --> 01:53:03,348
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this committee has to vote, and then we'll send that to the MSBA, and they'll have to accept those changes.

405
01:53:03,448 --> 01:53:06,129
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is usually pretty straightforward.

406
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

407
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:08,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Graham.

408
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:10,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeldt?

409
01:53:11,331 --> 01:53:13,912
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to motion to approve this round of musical chairs.

410
01:53:16,075 --> 01:53:17,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve this resolution.

411

[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Branley.

412

[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

414
01:53:23,822 --> 01:53:24,722
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

416
01:53:27,364 --> 01:53:30,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the team over there.

417
01:53:30,927 --> 01:53:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

418
01:53:33,987 --> 01:53:38,889
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-24 offered by Member Rousseau, resolution in support of the I.A.M.

419
01:53:38,929 --> 01:53:50,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill H.534-S.2491, whereas half the world menstruates and like all other basic bodily functions, menstruation is not a choice.

420
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:57,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to waive the reading by Member Rheinfeld.

421
01:53:59,490 --> 01:54:01,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Member Graham.

422
01:54:01,994 --> 01:54:04,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to at least read the resolved part?

423
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:06,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, if we could just summarize.

424
01:54:06,582 --> 01:54:11,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in favor of waiving that portion of the resolution.

425
01:54:13,399 --> 01:54:14,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Resolution, all those in favor?

426
01:54:15,019 --> 01:54:15,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

427
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:16,680
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

428
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:38,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'll just move right to page seven, which is be it resolved that the Metro School Committee recognizes menstrual products are essential and a long-term cost savings measure, recognizes menstrual products are essential and should be considered public goods, supports the passage of the IAM bill, this legislative session, directs the superintendent to transmit official copies of this resolution to the following,

429
01:54:38,631 --> 01:54:51,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Governor Maura Healey, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Edward Markey, Congresswoman Kathleen Clark, State Senator Patricia Jalen, State Representative Paul Donato, State Representative Sean Garbally, and State Representative Christine Barber.

430
01:54:51,555 --> 01:54:58,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, directs the superintendent to transmit an official copy of this resolution to the Medford City Council in accordance with Medford School Committee Rule 77.

431
01:55:00,617 --> 01:55:07,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And six, directs the superintendent to transmit an official copy of this resolution to myself, Mayor Medford.

432
01:55:07,721 --> 01:55:12,364
[SPEAKER_06]: This is passed by, hopefully, an official vote.

433
01:55:12,784 --> 01:55:18,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Olopade?

434
01:55:18,868 --> 01:55:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

435
01:55:19,708 --> 01:55:20,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

436
01:55:20,649 --> 01:55:21,469
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

437
01:55:21,549 --> 01:55:22,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

438
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:35,502
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-25 offered by Member Russo to enhance the policy hygiene, BGI.

439
01:55:35,682 --> 01:55:40,723
[SPEAKER_06]: To enhance clarity and promoting compliance, the committee aims to make its policies easier to read.

440
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:46,205
[SPEAKER_06]: While detailed language can help explain complex ideas, it often makes policies longer and harder to follow.

441
01:55:46,225 --> 01:55:52,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Brevity improves readability, and when policies are easier to understand, people are more likely to follow them.

442
01:55:53,427 --> 01:56:01,476
[SPEAKER_06]: To support this goal, committee policies will utilize standardized language shortcuts throughout our policies to maintain conciseness without compromising meaning.

443
01:56:02,196 --> 01:56:10,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Exceptions to the shortcuts below should apply when, number one, required by law, number two, policy does not warrant

444
01:56:11,626 --> 01:56:13,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, want to allow for the students meeting?

445
01:56:15,529 --> 01:56:16,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Warrant, right?

446
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:17,591
[SPEAKER_06]: To allow for the shortcuts meeting.

447
01:56:18,171 --> 01:56:23,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning, clarity is required and for the shortcut has more than one meaning in the particular policy.

448
01:56:24,336 --> 01:56:27,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Shortcut superintendent, full meaning, superintendent or designee.

449
01:56:28,039 --> 01:56:31,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Caregiver, parent, guardian, responsible adult, or caregiver.

450
01:56:32,863 --> 01:56:41,487
[SPEAKER_06]: shortcut committee, Medford School Committee, MPS, Medford Public Schools, principal, means principal, or designee.

451
01:56:42,107 --> 01:56:46,749
[SPEAKER_06]: All policies, when adopted, should reference this policy as a related policy.

452
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:49,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau.

453
01:56:51,611 --> 01:56:52,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

454
01:56:53,012 --> 01:57:00,895
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've been doing a lot of policy work, as well as contracts, there has been a question about

455
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:11,193
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or designee is, we've had some contracts where, you'd have one paragraph where it says superintendent or designee, the next one doesn't.

456
01:57:12,174 --> 01:57:20,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question becomes then, does that mean that the superintendent is the only decision maker in that example?

457
01:57:21,157 --> 01:57:28,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that at least in all of the stuff I have read, there has been no examples where that actually makes any sense.

458
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:29,880
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of,

459
01:57:30,871 --> 01:57:37,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cleanliness and writing the words or designee over and over and over thousands of times in our policies.

460
01:57:37,836 --> 01:57:47,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought this made sense to sort of like draw a line in the sand and say, we will stop saying or designee unless we specifically have to.

461
01:57:48,403 --> 01:57:50,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And the

462
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:59,293
[SPEAKER_01]: The related policies part there is sort of a way to keep existing policies as is until they get updated.

463
01:57:59,433 --> 01:58:08,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a policy does not have this as a related policy, then this does not apply to that policy yet.

464
01:58:09,717 --> 01:58:13,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure everybody knows caregiver in Massachusetts is a legal term.

465
01:58:14,779 --> 01:58:26,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's not just like something I made up, and, um, it's certainly a lot easier on forms to say caregiver than parent, guardian, responsible adult or caregiver.

466
01:58:26,605 --> 01:58:29,026
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever tried to create a form and for a signature.

467
01:58:30,447 --> 01:58:33,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's that's what this policy is for.

468
01:58:33,549 --> 01:58:36,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And I motion to approve it.

469
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:41,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by member Rousseau, seconded by

470
01:58:44,989 --> 01:58:46,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Member Rheinfeld, yeah.

471
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

472
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:50,571
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think probably you need to say all policies when adopted or updated.

473
01:58:52,152 --> 01:58:55,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is an amended, updated policy in adoption?

474
01:58:55,993 --> 01:58:58,114
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same language.

475
01:58:59,055 --> 01:59:00,935
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was an ironic comment then that I made.

476
01:59:01,656 --> 01:59:01,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

477
01:59:02,156 --> 01:59:04,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And so if one wanted to make an exception,

478
01:59:06,505 --> 01:59:07,525
[SPEAKER_13]: these make sense.

479
01:59:07,805 --> 01:59:13,927
[SPEAKER_13]: So one would then have to say the superintendent is the sole decider of this.

480
01:59:13,967 --> 01:59:18,129
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be the way to make the exception, is to add that language there.

481
01:59:20,149 --> 01:59:35,174
[SPEAKER_13]: If a policy gets- If a policy required that, say, it be specifically the superintendent, or if it's a principle and it's a, I don't know, a Title IX something, and it has to go to this particular person, they would either need to be named by name or say, as the sole

482
01:59:36,797 --> 01:59:38,157
[SPEAKER_13]: person responsible for this?

483
01:59:38,617 --> 01:59:38,837
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

484
01:59:39,818 --> 01:59:55,521
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this policy is listed as a related policy, and it says superintendent, they would have to say correct, they would have to I said no, but I meant yes, they would have to specify that is only the superintendent.

485
01:59:56,901 --> 02:00:05,063
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so few examples other than the quotes that are coming out of mass general law are probably the biggest example where that

486
02:00:05,581 --> 02:00:07,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that quote isn't gonna be changed.

487
02:00:07,762 --> 02:00:09,002
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the quote from the law.

488
02:00:09,482 --> 02:00:13,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would not apply, of course, but yeah.

489
02:00:13,944 --> 02:00:16,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, and thanks for answering my questions.

490
02:00:16,064 --> 02:00:19,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I can second that, your approval, but I see Member Olopade.

491
02:00:20,886 --> 02:00:21,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olopade.

492
02:00:22,206 --> 02:00:22,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

493
02:00:23,026 --> 02:00:30,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering if we would be able to add in the caregiver designation, parent, guardian, responsible to custodian or caregiver.

494
02:00:31,249 --> 02:00:34,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Just add that as an additional term, custodial parent or custodian.

495
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:42,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor, certainly I've not seen that word once in our policies.

496
02:00:43,352 --> 02:00:50,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So the shortcut is to replace words that are in our policies.

497
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:52,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know that.

498
02:00:53,417 --> 02:00:54,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm fine with that.

499
02:00:54,937 --> 02:01:03,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Do custodian or custodial parent or custodial, like what's the exact thing that we would be replacing?

500
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:18,696
[SPEAKER_10]: In my experience and to your point I think that most of the time it's not being written anywhere in our previous literature I know that that's a term that is being used in other circles and education and just describe other forms of parental guidance in the home or as people custodial parents generally are.

501
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:26,542
[SPEAKER_10]: biologically related to children, while guardians tend to be court-appointed guardians, there is some separation between the two.

502
02:01:26,982 --> 02:01:34,286
[SPEAKER_10]: More often than not, one of them is encompassing of the other one, but there are some separations that I think some parents may benefit from having just as an important designation.

503
02:01:34,346 --> 02:01:41,649
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you, in your previous experience, haven't seen the word custodian or custodial parent in the literature, then we may not need to add it.

504
02:01:41,709 --> 02:01:42,970
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just something that I'm conscious of.

505
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:46,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point, especially around

506
02:01:48,431 --> 02:02:01,041
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that I've seen in my time on the school committee where we even referenced the difference between parents when parents have like a custodial parent and one who, for instance, may have no custodial rights.

507
02:02:02,622 --> 02:02:10,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We make no distinction anywhere, although I think school brains might have something for that to like indicate that a parent has no rights.

508
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:14,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, everything just says parent,

509
02:02:16,433 --> 02:02:34,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we just kind of hope for the best in policy, but it's worth noting that we probably should consider that when writing policy, that when we say parent, we don't just mean parent, we mean the one with the rights, which of course isn't even necessarily parents.

510
02:02:36,025 --> 02:02:42,669
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I'm happy to add a comma and custodial parents

511
02:02:44,728 --> 02:02:48,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we don't have to add it in because this is to clean up previous language.

512
02:02:48,790 --> 02:03:04,859
[SPEAKER_10]: But going forward, maybe there's an important opportunity to kind of consider other guardian, parental, custodial ship in the home or outside and how that impacts families differently and being cognizant of people's personal lived experience in relationship to their children or students.

513
02:03:06,821 --> 02:03:10,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will retract my additive for the time being.

514
02:03:17,062 --> 02:03:17,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, retract.

515
02:03:17,663 --> 02:03:19,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So no, no amendment.

516
02:03:19,885 --> 02:03:20,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

517
02:03:21,466 --> 02:03:28,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor, the two the two amendments I have are to change want to warrant and adopted to adopted or amended.

518
02:03:30,494 --> 02:03:37,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Was the second one sorry, adopted changed to adopted or amended in the all policies when adopted.

519
02:03:38,695 --> 02:03:41,416
[SPEAKER_01]: should reference this policy, the last line.

520
02:03:41,676 --> 02:03:47,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I adopted is an amendment is adopted, but I think it is clear to say or amended.

521
02:03:47,739 --> 02:03:48,259
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not?

522
02:03:52,461 --> 02:03:56,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Some motion for approval as amended.

523
02:03:58,083 --> 02:03:58,803
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

524
02:03:58,823 --> 02:03:59,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

525
02:03:59,664 --> 02:04:00,384
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

526
02:04:02,145 --> 02:04:02,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

527
02:04:05,355 --> 02:04:16,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up offered by member Graham 2025 dash 26, the method school committee resolution requesting city council adoption of chapter 399 school bus stop arm camera enforcement.

528
02:04:17,884 --> 02:04:34,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted chapter 399 of the acts 2024 title and act concerning the safety of school children embarking and disembarking school buses, which authorizes municipalities to install and operate school bus violation detection monitoring systems.

529
02:04:35,237 --> 02:04:54,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas this law also allows cities and towns that formally accepted provisions to use bus mounted cameras to detect and record motor vehicles that illegally pass a stopped school bus displaying flashing red lights and deploy a deployed stop arm pursuant to Mass General Laws chapter 90 section 14 and 14 c.

530
02:04:57,166 --> 02:05:17,494
[SPEAKER_06]: and whereas pilot programs in Peabody and Salem have demonstrated the effectiveness of these systems with thousands of violations recorded in a single school year highlighting the urgent need for enhanced enforcement tools to protect students and whereas the law includes strict privacy protections requiring that non-violation recordings be destroyed within 30

531
02:05:18,915 --> 02:05:33,279
[SPEAKER_06]: days and violation-related recordings within one year of final disposition, whereas the safety of Medford's children is a top priority and the implementation of stop-arm cameras has been shown to deter illegal passing and improve compliance with school bus safety laws.

532
02:05:33,579 --> 02:05:40,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee respectfully requests that Medford City Council formally accept the provisions of Chapter 399

533
02:05:42,962 --> 02:05:50,249
[SPEAKER_06]: of the Acts of 2024, thereby enabling the City of Medford to install and operate school bus violation detection monitoring systems.

534
02:05:51,370 --> 02:06:06,926
[SPEAKER_06]: If further resolved, the Medford School Committee recommends the establishment of a joint committee, including one representative from the School Committee, one representative from the City Council, the Chief of Police, the Superintendent of Schools, and the Mayor or designee, to evaluate and recommend policies regarding the use of revenue-generated citations,

535
02:06:09,703 --> 02:06:26,315
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd further resolve that the school committee respectfully request that the mayor agree to earmark citation revenue for exclusive use as directed by the recommendations of this committee with priority given to student safety initiatives, transportation infrastructure improvements, and public awareness campaigns.

536
02:06:29,312 --> 02:06:50,161
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may from the chair, I know a school committee member or two might have met with the company, maybe just elaborate on how long it takes to implement and the cost of implementation and who pays what, because I do know the companies do pick up certain fees.

537
02:06:50,401 --> 02:06:54,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So if somebody could just maybe elaborate a little before there's a motion on the floor.

538
02:06:56,119 --> 02:06:56,359
[SPEAKER_09]: do that.

539
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:57,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

540
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:57,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

541
02:06:58,961 --> 02:07:10,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, over this summer, I met with some Medford residents and met with the president of the city council and some folks that are from organizations that provide this service.

542
02:07:10,270 --> 02:07:10,471
[SPEAKER_09]: So

543
02:07:12,312 --> 02:07:19,541
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that this whole process works is we have this, the council first has to say yes we're adopting the statute.

544
02:07:20,202 --> 02:07:30,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once the council does that, under the law, then we have to the superintendent can like bring a contract forward we can approve that contract.

545
02:07:31,895 --> 02:07:33,476
[SPEAKER_09]: and then it can be put in place.

546
02:07:34,237 --> 02:07:46,424
[SPEAKER_09]: The law does not require the sum of the steps that I have outlined that I think are important around like collaboration across city government and with the chief of police to think about sort of ticket revenue.

547
02:07:46,464 --> 02:07:58,571
[SPEAKER_09]: But to the question about who pays for this, Medford is a community that's been designated by one vendor in particular, but I assume by many as a,

548
02:07:59,631 --> 02:08:06,460
[SPEAKER_09]: a city where the violators will essentially fund the whole cost of the implementation.

549
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:12,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially, they will put these stop arm cameras on the buses for free.

550
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:17,943
[SPEAKER_09]: they will take a piece of the violation revenue that gets issued.

551
02:08:19,525 --> 02:08:24,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And in an event where there are no violations for a month, they eat that cost.

552
02:08:25,068 --> 02:08:35,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's sort of a numbers game, like that's not happening in very small communities, but the sort of dynamics of Medford, the number of students, the number of buses, the number of roads,

553
02:08:36,716 --> 02:08:46,819
[SPEAKER_09]: the size of the city, all of that makes us a candidate for this violator funded protocol that they are pursuing with many communities like Peabody and Salem and others.

554
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:54,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So over time, what happens, the way the process works is the camera

555
02:08:56,074 --> 02:09:02,156
[SPEAKER_09]: takes a picture of you in the middle of a moving violation three times, like front, middle, back or something like that.

556
02:09:02,196 --> 02:09:04,477
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, it's you, right?

557
02:09:04,497 --> 02:09:07,599
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can tell who the car is and what the light is.

558
02:09:08,119 --> 02:09:15,882
[SPEAKER_09]: This organization will then do like a first level culling of all of the footage.

559
02:09:16,565 --> 02:09:22,051
[SPEAKER_09]: and pull out anything that is like, you know, blurry image, not, you know, whatever it is.

560
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:23,432
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll pull all of those out.

561
02:09:23,892 --> 02:09:28,897
[SPEAKER_09]: All of that's then transmitted to the police department where they will review the footage, they will issue the citation.

562
02:09:28,937 --> 02:09:38,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So the police department, and I know that there have been some meetings with the chief of police as well, the police department will issue the citations just like they would, you know, any moving citation.

563
02:09:39,107 --> 02:09:46,251
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a citation like if you get a ticket, it's a fine and it could down the line prevent you from like renewing your license.

564
02:09:47,052 --> 02:09:51,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is not going to be tagged as a moving violation on your insurance.

565
02:09:52,455 --> 02:09:57,138
[SPEAKER_09]: But that ticket revenue comes back to the city into the general fund.

566
02:09:57,518 --> 02:10:05,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of my ask is that we sort of cordon off that funding so that we are using it to

567
02:10:06,163 --> 02:10:21,457
[SPEAKER_09]: continue to improve safety for our students that are riding buses and walking, frankly, and think about how do we how do we leverage this, this funding to hear from the community, via all of these different players being involved to.

568
02:10:22,878 --> 02:10:26,579
[SPEAKER_09]: do some things that will improve pedestrian and bus rider safety.

569
02:10:27,759 --> 02:10:33,181
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is something that I'm requesting in this but it is like separate from what is required by law.

570
02:10:33,321 --> 02:10:47,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So this ask is just to say to the council that we agree that we want to do this so that they can adopt the statute and then it would it'll come back to us for like execution of the of the contract.

571
02:10:48,264 --> 02:10:51,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a video I can send to all of you after the meeting which I just received

572
02:10:53,045 --> 02:11:00,128
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think overall, like there's a lot of, you know, having a vendor do this, first of all, they're going to maintain the cameras.

573
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:02,889
[SPEAKER_09]: If the cameras stop working, they will replace them.

574
02:11:03,029 --> 02:11:05,450
[SPEAKER_09]: If we get new buses, they will retrofit the buses.

575
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:07,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they'll pull them off one bus, put them on another bus.

576
02:11:08,152 --> 02:11:12,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and then they take a portion of the revenue for that.

577
02:11:12,593 --> 02:11:13,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what the exact numbers are.

578
02:11:14,134 --> 02:11:15,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have them handy.

579
02:11:15,134 --> 02:11:21,177
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is no cost to Medford to do this, but the ticket revenue does come to Medford.

580
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:25,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Graham.

581
02:11:26,052 --> 02:11:31,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember talking to the vendor at a conference I went to, and that was my recollection.

582
02:11:31,977 --> 02:11:34,740
[SPEAKER_06]: They do get paid somehow, but there is no cost to the contract.

583
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:35,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's correct.

584
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:38,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, hopefully help with people passing buses.

585
02:11:39,144 --> 02:11:49,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they did have a lot of good information, which they're more than happy to come join us at the next meeting if the superintendent wants to move forward with them as a vendor.

586
02:11:51,154 --> 02:11:55,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had a lot of information about sort of what happens over time, right?

587
02:11:55,477 --> 02:11:58,539
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of moving violations, and then they do sort of plateau.

588
02:11:58,619 --> 02:12:03,743
[SPEAKER_09]: But he pointed out that we are, you know, minting new drivers every single day.

589
02:12:03,823 --> 02:12:04,804
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughter's in driver's ed.

590
02:12:06,445 --> 02:12:09,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there's new drivers on the road all the time.

591
02:12:09,307 --> 02:12:14,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford, one of the things he talked a lot about was that Medford is a cut-through city for many communities.

592
02:12:14,791 --> 02:12:18,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't get to the highway unless you come through Medford if you live in certain communities.

593
02:12:20,274 --> 02:12:26,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are those roads where it's particularly challenging for students to cross safely.

594
02:12:26,356 --> 02:12:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought all of this, there was just a lot of net positive for us and for students.

595
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:44,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we stop having revenue because there are no more moving violations, that is also a win because that means people aren't passing school buses when they should not be and endangering students.

596
02:12:46,743 --> 02:12:51,027
[SPEAKER_09]: there seems like there's only wins in this, which is exciting to be able to choose.

597
02:12:51,047 --> 02:12:53,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, they're happy to come.

598
02:12:54,329 --> 02:12:55,290
[SPEAKER_09]: They offered to come tonight.

599
02:12:55,310 --> 02:13:04,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, since this is like the first time we're going to talk about this, and then the council will have to do their thing, and then we'll have to come back around, that it might be more appropriate for them to come next time.

600
02:13:04,238 --> 02:13:10,563
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're very excited about Medford and partnering to make our streets safer.

601
02:13:11,283 --> 02:13:11,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

602
02:13:11,584 --> 02:13:12,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

603
02:13:12,364 --> 02:13:13,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa?

604
02:13:15,581 --> 02:13:16,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you.

605
02:13:16,521 --> 02:13:19,442
[SPEAKER_11]: So quick question, because this made me think of it.

606
02:13:19,862 --> 02:13:33,505
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, in particular to you said the cut through city, I know that living in the heights, my part of the heights is a huge cut through and it's always been a battle between Medford and Malden over what do we do?

607
02:13:34,065 --> 02:13:37,286
[SPEAKER_11]: So that stems a question of the buses on the Fells Way.

608
02:13:38,715 --> 02:13:44,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but are the tickets then issued by the state police because that is a state road?

609
02:13:44,218 --> 02:13:46,059
[SPEAKER_11]: So then how does that money get back to us?

610
02:13:46,139 --> 02:13:47,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are they still issued by Medford?

611
02:13:47,339 --> 02:13:48,540
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still issued by Medford.

612
02:13:48,580 --> 02:13:49,380
[SPEAKER_11]: So Medford, okay.

613
02:13:50,681 --> 02:13:51,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for the clarifying point.

614
02:13:51,882 --> 02:13:57,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure exactly how that all worked with state roads.

615
02:13:57,184 --> 02:13:59,345
[SPEAKER_11]: This seems like something that I think it's funny.

616
02:13:59,365 --> 02:14:02,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually talking about this with an old colleague about

617
02:14:03,557 --> 02:14:09,019
[SPEAKER_11]: at my other place of work, because they had actually been looking into this, because Medford tried to pilot this back in 2011.

618
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had tried to do this.

619
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:26,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And in speaking with former member Falco and former member Vanderkloot, it seems like it never kind of, especially when Vanderkloot and I were talking about it, it seems like it never really picked up because, and I don't want to misquote her about how, about like, who owns the cameras?

620
02:14:26,325 --> 02:14:26,946
[SPEAKER_11]: How does it work?

621
02:14:26,986 --> 02:14:27,726
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that all system?

622
02:14:27,746 --> 02:14:29,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really appreciate seeing this.

623
02:14:30,988 --> 02:14:40,692
[SPEAKER_11]: all laid out in terms of that, and I know that member Russo has a microphone on, but if there are no other comments, I'll motion to approve.

624
02:14:43,213 --> 02:14:43,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo?

625
02:14:45,754 --> 02:14:46,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

626
02:14:47,855 --> 02:14:53,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the summer seems to have destroyed my memory of this conversation I know we've had.

627
02:14:53,457 --> 02:14:55,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a memory

628
02:15:01,457 --> 02:15:08,022
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I just remember that they had done some stats and there was a lot of these things happening.

629
02:15:08,082 --> 02:15:10,984
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, because I feel like I don't actually ever see it.

630
02:15:12,425 --> 02:15:14,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of like, how often does this happen?

631
02:15:14,626 --> 02:15:16,167
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a huge number.

632
02:15:17,008 --> 02:15:20,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't get excited about the money.

633
02:15:20,090 --> 02:15:29,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got like really angry about how often people are willing to endanger our kids.

634
02:15:34,251 --> 02:15:35,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I did bring my notebook.

635
02:15:35,991 --> 02:15:54,556
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a three month pilot in Peabody, and there were 977 violations and in Salem there were 942 in a three month pilot so those pilots are very recent because the law just passed sort of paving the way for all of this to happen in a more cohesive way, but they said.

636
02:15:57,336 --> 02:16:02,378
[SPEAKER_09]: that there are 300 cars hit school buses last year in Massachusetts.

637
02:16:03,018 --> 02:16:10,380
[SPEAKER_09]: They also did describe that they are actively working in many other states who already have legislation around this.

638
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:12,421
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are not a new organization.

639
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:17,602
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just new access here in Massachusetts, if that makes sense.

640
02:16:18,542 --> 02:16:22,664
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the cost that they will extract

641
02:16:25,135 --> 02:16:30,358
[SPEAKER_09]: from the total revenue is, I believe it's $250 per bus per month.

642
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:36,642
[SPEAKER_09]: They did also note that they can put cameras on special education vehicles as well.

643
02:16:37,542 --> 02:16:48,468
[SPEAKER_09]: However, if those special education vehicles transporting students leave Medford, the cameras are not able to be used outside of the city limits of Medford.

644
02:16:48,528 --> 02:16:51,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So they would only be capturing

645
02:16:51,870 --> 02:17:13,298
[SPEAKER_09]: things happening yeah in districts in district roads um and um it's a 250 ticket and they find that when you get a ticket you do not usually get a second ticket but if there are some people who do um so it's yeah it's not um an inexpensive

646
02:17:14,078 --> 02:17:24,003
[SPEAKER_09]: ticket, but they do see over time that like in sort of year one, there'll be the most tickets and then it will plateau and sort of level out to be something sort of consistent after that.

647
02:17:26,744 --> 02:17:28,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Member, I'm sorry, Dr. Galussi.

648
02:17:29,445 --> 02:17:39,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only thing I would also just mention for people that are at home listening, I think you may have mentioned this, Member Graham, and I apologize if you did, but just so people are aware, like the camera is

649
02:17:40,737 --> 02:17:52,847
[SPEAKER_05]: fixed on the outside of the bus, but it does not start recording until that arm comes out, which with the stop sign on it, then it will start recording from that moment on.

650
02:17:52,887 --> 02:17:55,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once the arm comes back in, the recording stops.

651
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:56,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

652
02:17:56,190 --> 02:17:58,973
[SPEAKER_09]: The camera does not record anything going on inside the bus.

653
02:17:59,513 --> 02:18:05,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Not inside and not while it's, you know, riding along on the street.

654
02:18:06,459 --> 02:18:07,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Just important to know.

655
02:18:12,493 --> 02:18:12,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

656
02:18:12,773 --> 02:18:13,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeldt.

657
02:18:13,934 --> 02:18:18,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I was just wondering, are there other companies that do this?

658
02:18:18,316 --> 02:18:20,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I assume we have to go through city procurement.

659
02:18:20,216 --> 02:18:24,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we going to be, what's the timeline that we can expect to see this?

660
02:18:24,678 --> 02:18:28,380
[SPEAKER_13]: And is procurement going to be a challenge?

661
02:18:29,707 --> 02:18:33,131
[SPEAKER_09]: They are on an approved vendor list, so that is not a requirement.

662
02:18:33,531 --> 02:18:34,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

663
02:18:34,412 --> 02:18:38,556
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other companies that do portions of this.

664
02:18:39,637 --> 02:18:44,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not sort of looked into them in tons of detail, but my understanding is

665
02:18:46,403 --> 02:19:03,792
[SPEAKER_09]: part of what this organization in particular is offering is the curation right so they're like maintaining the cameras they're previewing the footage they're calling out all the stuff that's junk so that when it gets to the police department here in Medford it's a it's an easier

666
02:19:04,873 --> 02:19:07,915
[SPEAKER_09]: lift for Medford to go ahead and issue those citations.

667
02:19:07,975 --> 02:19:16,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is a level of like services that they're providing in addition to all the camera maintenance, all the installs.

668
02:19:16,541 --> 02:19:22,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can buy cameras with lots of different people, but then you'd have to have the manpower to do the editing and the reviews.

669
02:19:22,486 --> 02:19:26,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So their technology obviously is serving them up what is useful, right?

670
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:34,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if the arm comes out and nothing happens, there's still footage and their technology is like weeding all of that out on our behalf.

671
02:19:34,928 --> 02:19:35,769
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really helpful.

672
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:41,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in regards to the special education vehicles, you said it stops at the Bedford city limits.

673
02:19:41,457 --> 02:19:43,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any effort

674
02:19:44,596 --> 02:19:52,399
[SPEAKER_13]: now that this legislation is in place, kind of for cross-district to do some coordination and have that shared resource.

675
02:19:52,719 --> 02:19:55,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe that's possible just yet.

676
02:19:56,120 --> 02:20:07,003
[SPEAKER_09]: They did talk about, perhaps you could send a warning without an actual citation, and that they were more than willing to explore all of that with us.

677
02:20:09,464 --> 02:20:13,006
[SPEAKER_09]: But every city has its own like piece of this.

678
02:20:14,446 --> 02:20:25,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some cities like ours have sort of the luxury of having being violated or funded our neighboring communities probably do not in for various reasons.

679
02:20:25,971 --> 02:20:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think some of that.

680
02:20:28,276 --> 02:20:33,338
[SPEAKER_09]: will maybe come together over time, but probably not right at the outset.

681
02:20:33,378 --> 02:20:36,639
[SPEAKER_09]: But the implementation, they're eager, and they're ready to go.

682
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:42,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did not ask about the specific timeline, because we weren't sure what it was going to take to get through these steps.

683
02:20:42,822 --> 02:20:46,083
[SPEAKER_09]: But they seemed to feel good about things moving quickly.

684
02:20:46,223 --> 02:20:46,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Terrific.

685
02:20:46,603 --> 02:20:47,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is great.

686
02:20:47,424 --> 02:20:53,026
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really appreciate the earmark request as part of this, as this is really about student safety.

687
02:20:53,246 --> 02:20:56,007
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would love to see those funds go towards that.

688
02:20:56,147 --> 02:20:56,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

689
02:20:57,968 --> 02:20:59,509
