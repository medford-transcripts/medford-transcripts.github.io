[SPEAKER_07]: DiBenedetto.

13
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:31,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so on

14
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:38,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I was showing them writing pictures.

15
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:40,030
Okay.

16
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:45,393
[SPEAKER_06]: On page 10 of 15, Method High School, the amount of $10,034.31.

17
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,416
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems high.

18
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any regulation?

19
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:00,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

20
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:02,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

21
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that same page further down, it says,

22
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:11,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Fillion associates other supplies in the end when you add them together.

23
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:19,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nine thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars and ninety three cents That's the what

24
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's out of a revolving account.

25
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can look up what exactly those would cover.

26
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all together.

27
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just other supplies.

28
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was curious what they were.

29
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,453
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could email us, that would be great.

30
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:36,194
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

31
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:40,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

32
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:49,014
[SPEAKER_06]: On page 12 of 15, Groundmaster Corp, for $390, it was unclassified.

33
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:58,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was wondering, I'm assuming it's some kind of landscaping, but I just was wondering where and why it wasn't classified.

34
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:02,542
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Edgerly Field, so that's just the title of the account.

35
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And then further down on page 13 of 15,

36
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,401
[SPEAKER_06]: The pool service company, it was almost, you know, a little more than $2,600.

37
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:16,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there a problem with the pool?

38
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think the pool was closed once.

39
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:19,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Closed for a couple of days.

40
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:22,064
[SPEAKER_04]: These are for chemicals on a routine basis.

41
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was routine.

42
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and the fill in supplies is the same program.

43
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:30,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just get you a summarized list of what was purchased.

44
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:30,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

45
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for

46
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:34,705

[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you always answering them.

48
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pool was just closed for a few days.

49
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:40,910
[SPEAKER_06]: They just changed the chemicals and reopened.

50
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:41,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

51
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:42,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

52
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:44,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

66
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we table community participation at this time?

67
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:17,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved.

68
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved to table it.

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,680

[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Superintendent.

77
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:42,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

78
00:06:42,895 --> 00:07:00,024
[SPEAKER_12]: This past weekend featured perfect fall weather, and many events were held outside that our students and families could enjoy, including the Harvest Your Energy Festival, the McGlynn Middle School's PTO Yard Sale, and the Brooks PTO Annual Fall Fest.

79
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:04,026
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the weather last Thursday was not so great.

80
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:07,018
[SPEAKER_12]: with the high winds and heavy rains.

81
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:14,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to thank many people who worked on behalf of keeping our schools smooth functioning.

82
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:30,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to recognize John McLaughlin and the Building and Grounds Department, the Medford Police and Fire Departments, the City's Department of Public Works, and Eastern Bus Company, who working together made it possible for the schools to safely remain in session that day.

83
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:39,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Despite the weather on Thursday, Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School held the eighth grade open house.

84
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,581
[SPEAKER_12]: The Karen Theater was filled with students and parents and guardians, and there was standing room only space.

85
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:59,068
[SPEAKER_12]: High school student ambassadors led tours all over the campus, including the science labs, the fine arts department, the library media center, the vocational technical programs, and the athletic wing.

86
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,032
[SPEAKER_12]: where all the sports teams were present.

87
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:09,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad that so many of our rising 8th graders and their families were able to attend this important informational session.

88
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:23,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also pleased to announce that two of our Medford High School students, Lang and Qing Cheng, twin sisters, each received $500 from the Pace family and the FAA USA.

89
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:32,574
[SPEAKER_12]: the Federazzini Associazioni Abruzzi to celebrate Italian Heritage Month.

90
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:41,317
[SPEAKER_12]: To be considered for the scholarship, the students had to write an essay describing their experiences with Italian culture and language.

91
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:48,739
[SPEAKER_12]: The students plan to continue to study the Italian language in college and hope to travel to Italy someday.

92
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations to the both of them.

93
00:08:52,952 --> 00:09:09,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also pleased to announce that due to the efforts of Molly Layden, our Director of Technology, Library and Media, who applied for a Makerspace grant through the Verizon Foundation, the Medford Public Schools was selected and we will be awarded $10,000.

94
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:14,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So it came in after the announcement, so we'll

95
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,652
[SPEAKER_12]: presented formally at our next meeting.

96
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:34,276
[SPEAKER_12]: This grant will enable Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School to create a shared STEAM makerspace to be used by core academic subjects and CTE programs that will enable academic and career preparation connections.

97
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:39,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Students and teachers in multiple programs and courses will use the makerspace

98
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:51,413
[SPEAKER_12]: to plan, design, create, and synthesize projects using interdisciplinary project-based learning to solve and engage in STEAM activities.

99
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:56,636
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a long-time goal of this department and the Medford Public School District.

100
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:02,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Molly will be in attendance, as I said, at our next meeting to explain the full process in more detail.

101
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:08,622
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, we thank Verizon for choosing us and commend Molly for applying for the grant.

102
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:21,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, recently, Casset, Inc., in collaboration with the Sons of Italy, welcomed students in honor of Italian American Heritage Month, which is the month of October.

103
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:32,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Students were invited to create a booklet on the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci, which celebrated his life and his works.

104
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,636
[SPEAKER_12]: The winners of the essay contest were hosted at this event.

105
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:37,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Casset Inc.

00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:45,606
[SPEAKER_12]: is a non-profit educational and professional organization that promotes Italian language and culture in public and private schools throughout New England.

107
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:50,450
[SPEAKER_12]: As you are aware, Medford is one of the schools who partner with them.

108
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:54,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford took home second and third place awards.

109
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:58,588
[SPEAKER_12]: First place went to Our Lady's Academy, fourth grade in Waltham.

110
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:01,069
[SPEAKER_12]: The students were awarded $250.

111
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:07,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Our second place students were from the Brooks Elementary School, the fifth grade class.

112
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,194
[SPEAKER_12]: They were awarded $200.

113
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:18,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd like to say a special thanks to the teachers, Jennifer Conte, Laura Odegardi, and Principal Suzanne Galussi.

114
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:23,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Our third place winners were at the McGlynn Elementary School, fifth grade classroom.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Madam Superintendent.

124
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Could I have a motion on the floor to resume community participation?

125
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Moved by Ms.

126
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Krebs, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

127
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:18,485
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

128
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

129
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:19,786
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

130
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Community participation.

131
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Your name and address, please.

132
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:31,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

133
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:35,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came to, I wanted to speak about the bus two at the middle schools.

134
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,871
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter is a sixth grader at the McGlynn, and we've had a few issues with that bus.

135
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:53,783
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the issues is the bus is at the Andrews, so the McGlynn students walk over, and last Friday in the wind and the rain, by the time they walked over, the bus was full, and the kids had to sit three and four across.

136
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,905
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be a regular Friday occurrence.

137
00:12:56,946 --> 00:13:10,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the bus is slightly full during the week because the cross-country team, which has 40 members right now, they're not riding the bus on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but I anticipate that that will become an issue at the end of the month when that season ends.

138
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:14,667
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of times she's been denied access to the bus.

139
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:32,066
[SPEAKER_01]: One time she was diverted to a different bus and taken on a ride to Winthrop Street to Goldilocks Bagels, at which point she was on the phone with me telling me she didn't know where she was and I could hear about six or seven other children in the background screaming, don't leave us here, we don't know where we are, don't leave us here.

140
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,789
[SPEAKER_01]: They were returned to the school.

141
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I called, I didn't know at the time that it was not going to the McGlynn, it was going to the Andrews.

142
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:51,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I called the McGlynn and spoke to the secretary who was going to try to page Mr. Tucci, but by the time they got him, the children had been deposited at the Andrews and told that they were on their own and to walk home.

143
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:59,576
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point they walked across Riverside by themselves, across Salem Street by themselves to get home.

144
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:09,382
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a handful of kids, luckily one of them was an 8th grader, the rest of them were 6th graders who were shocked in the second week of school to find themselves walking home alone.

145
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:29,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've already moved one stop off of this bus to another bus because of overcrowding But it's continuing to be an issue that we've called Several times asked them to to track and monitor, but they don't ask the children to sign up which bus they're going on so It's kind of a guesstimate how many kids will be on the bus?

146
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:38,054
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when winter comes it's going to be more of an issue a couple of kids said that they're sitting on other kids laps Because they're told they can't stand, but there's nowhere for them to sit

147
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:40,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a real crowding issue.

148
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:51,234
[SPEAKER_12]: I can definitely I can definitely look this is the first time I'm hearing it so it was not Brought to my attention and you said it was bus number two.

149
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:52,395
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bus number two.

150
00:14:52,515 --> 00:15:05,106
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on downtown Street I've reported it to the principal a few times and I was really upset when they the couple of times that they had to walk home So, okay, so I will definitely be able to follow up with the bus company tomorrow.

151
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:05,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

152
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:06,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

153
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:06,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

154
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:08,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate very much Thank you

155
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:15,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Item number two, recommendation to approve grant for head starting turtle project.

156
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Jody Driscoll and Ivy Carnival Chiefs.

157
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

158
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:28,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Mayor Burke, Superintendent and School Committee.

159
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:31,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Jody Driscoll could not make it tonight, so it's just me.

160
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:37,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to read what you all have, because that's what I got.

161
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:47,907
[SPEAKER_02]: The Morton and Spopari Family Foundation has provided funding for the Medford High School to support the Blanding's Turtle Headstarting Program.

162
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:54,292
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first year the Morton and Spopari Family Foundation has selected to fund this project for us.

163
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:55,973
[SPEAKER_02]: The total funding for the grant is $2,205.72.

164
00:15:56,073 --> 00:16:00,136
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2015 to 2016 school year, participation in the Blanding's Turtle Headstarting Program began at Medford High School.

165
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:19,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Participation provides high school students and community members an opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the maintenance of viable populations of at-risk and endangered native species in the Northeast Massachusetts.

166
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,957
[SPEAKER_02]: The turtle head starting success rate is that

167
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Turtles have about a 40 times greater chance for reaching their 14th birthday.

168
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's some random numbers for you, compared to those born in the wild.

169
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:36,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to recommend that the school committee accept the grant funding.

170
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:37,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

171
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:39,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a motion to approve by Ms.

172
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostone, seconded by Ms.

173
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:41,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Kretz.

174
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please.

175
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:43,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

176
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:45,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

177
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:46,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

178
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

179
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

180
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

181
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:54,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

182
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:54,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

183
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Item three, report on first annual Medford Vocational Technical High School fundraiser.

185
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Fallon and company.

186
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:08,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

187
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:08,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

188
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:10,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for having me.

189
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:15,343
[SPEAKER_14]: So really what you have in front of you is a proposal for time to celebrate.

190
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:23,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Going into year three of the Bistro being open now and we decided we want to do some kind of fundraiser to add to our programs.

191
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:29,408
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I've done in the past at my previous schools and it proved to be very successful was to have a fundraising dinner.

192
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:30,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically what happens is

193
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,710
[SPEAKER_14]: The Culinary Arts Department will provide the meal.

194
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:35,512
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get a one-day liquor license.

195
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:42,017
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll also have other programs help us to design a theme, some props, set up for the event.

196
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:45,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a few teachers who are in different bands or they play different instruments.

197
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,181
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to be part of it as well for the entertainment.

198
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:52,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, we're looking for approval for a spring date sometime in May.

199
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,967
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be an evening event open to the community.

200
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Tickets would be somewhere from $100 to $125 each, and it would all be a fundraising opportunity.

201
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So May 2020, correct?

202
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:08,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

203
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:08,913
2020.

204
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,293
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion to approve by Ms.

205
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:10,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Mastone.

206
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second by Mr. Ruggiero?

207
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:14,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

208
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:15,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms. DiBenedetto?

209
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:29,858
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great initiative, and I think it's a way to highlight the new bistro and to show other community members that they could utilize this space and rent it and do other things with it.

210
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:40,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we have them in the door, we can tell them about all the other great programs like getting their hair done and their oil changed and a dent pulled from their car.

211
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So like even if we have people there that night to just highlight some of those other things, it would be a great idea.

212
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:48,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, now it's fully lit up at night.

213
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,557
[SPEAKER_14]: We have ample parking, so we feel like the time is right now.

214
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:52,438
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

215
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we can even use the deck.

216
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,551
[SPEAKER_06]: open it up there, too.

217
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:59,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's a way that we can bring on some heat lamps, too, with that extra space.

218
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:00,052
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, we did think about that.

219
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:00,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

220
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:01,833
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do it later in May.

221
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:02,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Great idea.

222
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:03,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Great thinking outside the box.

223
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:04,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

224
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,196
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval of the fundraising effort, all those in favor?

225
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:08,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

226
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:09,397
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

227
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

228
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:10,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

229
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:11,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

230
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:11,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

231
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:12,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

232
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:19,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Recommendation to approve creation of new revolving account, MVTHS Fundraising.

233
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:19,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

234
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Patterson.

235
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:35,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is on the heels of the newly approved fundraising event, so in order to facilitate that through the fiscal component, I do need to request and have your approval to have a new fund established, a revolving fund for that purpose.

236
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:36,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

237
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:39,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor from Ms.

238
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,528
[SPEAKER_07]: DiBenedetto, seconded by Ms.

239
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:40,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Kretz?

240
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please.

241
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

242
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

243
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:51,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

244
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Report on new hires, retirements, and personnel.

245
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:55,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

246
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:55,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Patterson.

247
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:12,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did provide the most updated listing with information and transactions that have occurred through today to show the level of movement within the district.

248
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:17,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So we provided two listings, hire listing by program type so you could see

249
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:26,414
[SPEAKER_04]: how many either after school program folks that have been hired, how many paras, how many teachers.

250
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is a moving list with activity that occurs on a daily basis with regard to either resignations and or people that are out on leave.

251
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have

252
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:55,940
[SPEAKER_04]: The subsequent list that identifies the retirements and resignations as of this new fiscal year, so anybody from July forward that we have been given information on is the list that was provided to you as well.

253
00:20:56,601 --> 00:21:04,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do have a significant amount of movement that I think it's relevant to share and identify that as

254
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:11,205
[SPEAKER_04]: a seemingly small organization, there is a lot of transition with a very small office that handles all of this.

255
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:21,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have been working very hard over the summer and over the start of the school year to try to ensure that we have all the key positions filled.

256
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:24,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still an ongoing issue.

257
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,781
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a number of people that

258
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,283
[SPEAKER_04]: are out on maternity leaves and or other types of unpaid leaves.

259
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:37,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So we continue to try to fill those as we possibly can.

260
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:48,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting further into the school year, it is more difficult to hire, as most folks within a school have already been hired by a school department, if that's the case.

261
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:53,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do continue to hire for ongoing food service,

262
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:02,946
[SPEAKER_04]: for different daily substitutes and things of that nature that are a constant rolling retention and rehiring.

263
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

264
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

265
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Ruggiero.

266
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for the report.

267
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,394
[SPEAKER_13]: So going through the list of resignations here, I noticed that our nutritionist retired.

268
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:19,737
[SPEAKER_13]: So who's current, do we have any backup nutritionist, or is Rhetta the only one?

269
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:24,281
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was just a single position that she resigned.

270
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,522
[SPEAKER_04]: She did not retire.

271
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:28,464
[SPEAKER_13]: So are we anticipating on hiring someone new?

272
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And if so, when are we going to post the position?

273
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not at this point in time.

274
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: We are still doing the pilot program and that's been the focus at the moment.

275
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:44,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just hired a new kitchen manager and a new utility driver.

276
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So there have been a number of positions within food service that we are trying to fill at this point.

277
00:22:51,906 --> 00:23:02,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, my concern is that not having a nutritionist on staff for the entire district I think is not a great idea as we're piloting a new program like you're saying.

278
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:09,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So I seriously would like to suggest that we start looking to fill that position as soon as possible or find some sort of solution.

279
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, just I suppose a little greedy for me, I mean, who's gonna be taking care of the blueberries in the middle of the high school?

280
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we know what's going on with the outdoor,

281
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:27,730
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be something that either student facilitated and or additional volunteer for that.

282
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,731
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now we don't.

283
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:29,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

284
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:31,292
[SPEAKER_04]: That was not a part of her role.

285
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:32,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

286
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,433
[SPEAKER_13]: She was just taking it on.

287
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:37,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I know she did a lot of work, including making hummus for the kids.

288
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:44,858
[SPEAKER_13]: This is concerning to me, especially with some other information that we have.

289
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:49,840
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just would like to be updated when we find out more about it and when we're going to be filling out the role.

290
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:52,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

291
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:52,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

292
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

293
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:58,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Van der Kloot.

294
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:58,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

295
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:02,730
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed that quite a number of people have been brought on after the start of school.

296
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:08,754
[SPEAKER_16]: So, for example, let's just use the paraprofessionals that have been brought on, say, in October.

297
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:10,375
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one October 8th, one October 15th.

298
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:12,737
[SPEAKER_16]: The second one, et cetera.

299
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:19,186
[SPEAKER_16]: So at the beginning of the school, we have many new employee induction programs.

300
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:25,380
[SPEAKER_16]: people are hired and have a later arrival.

301
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:34,589
[SPEAKER_16]: How are we making sure that they are up to date on all of the information they need to or would have gotten had they been hired in an earlier time?

302
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:44,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So any information in terms of the start of school would be reliant upon their department heads and their building principals in terms of any

303
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:50,897
[SPEAKER_04]: additional training or mandatory items that they would have received as a new hire.

304
00:24:51,358 --> 00:25:06,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The para group does not go through the rigorous process that teachers do, but they do get information and notification on that, and that would be up to the building-based principals and the department heads.

305
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:12,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have some sort of check-off list to make sure, for example, that everybody is aware of our emergency plans?

306
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:16,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So the emergency plans, again, would be building-based.

307
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:20,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not a process in HR that we facilitate.

308
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I think we need to follow that through at some point, so thank you for that information.

309
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:46,316
[SPEAKER_16]: The second question is, I noticed cheerfully that we have hired quite a few people in the after-school program, and I would like to ask for a update on the after-school program at a meeting in the near future.

310
00:25:50,016 --> 00:26:01,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Thirdly, one last, I understand we have a teacher out, a science teacher out and at, oh I think it's the Andrews 8th grade.

311
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:07,473
[SPEAKER_16]: and parents were concerned about who was going to replace the teacher.

312
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:17,839
[SPEAKER_16]: And Dr. Maurice, you and I corresponded about this, saying that right now it was a certified teacher, but not certified in science.

313
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,762
[SPEAKER_16]: So the question is, is are we seeking a certified

314
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:32,845
[SPEAKER_16]: science teacher to replace that, because I think that there is concern, especially given that the students had a teacher, the same group of students had a teacher out last year.

315
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:47,169
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's two years in a row that they would be having a non, or I don't know who took the place last year, but I do know right now that we have a person in there who may be terrific, I don't know, but is not certified in science.

316
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:57,975
[SPEAKER_12]: The current teacher is a certified teacher, but not certified in science, has had a lot of exposure, has worked with science and science programming.

317
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:01,317
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was given that information.

318
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:13,182
[SPEAKER_12]: His current role, he was operating as the building, he was building based, the ISS at the Andrews.

319
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:15,563
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this point in time, because

320
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,711
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have, we didn't have the complete information in terms of the length of the leave.

321
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:26,712
[SPEAKER_12]: So the normal practice would be to put a substitute in place.

322
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's who was there for the time being.

323
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:32,213
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll be able to revisit that.

324
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:33,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

325
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you provide us with an update on that?

326
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:42,395
[SPEAKER_16]: And also again, because of the concern, I would like to ask that, you know, the

327
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:52,730
[SPEAKER_16]: the new teacher be monitored carefully just to make sure that he or she is doing whatever they're supposed to be doing.

328
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

329
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:54,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

330
00:27:58,692 --> 00:27:59,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

331
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:00,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

332
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:03,993
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I want to say thank you for the report.

333
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:08,194
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of work that your department's done to onboard

334
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:12,948
[SPEAKER_06]: and to do exit interviews for people who have retired and left.

335
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:14,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you doing it so quickly.

336
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:17,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some more questions, though.

337
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:26,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to know how many open positions do we currently have throughout the district and what those positions are, like if we do need

338
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:37,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Substitutes for specific teachers or categories, how many people are on leaves and what kind of job titles we're looking for.

339
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:40,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can help because I work in education.

340
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:47,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I might hear of people available throughout the community if the community knows that we're in a situation where we do have openings.

341
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone may have a few months.

342
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:55,361
[SPEAKER_06]: that have a licensed teacher or retired teachers might see that and see the need and step up for us.

343
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So I asked for it for that reason.

344
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:00,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And it can be ongoing.

345
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:02,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be in the next few weeks, whenever you can get it.

346
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:09,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can express that all the open positions are posted actively on our website.

347
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And it leads you to the direct hiring platform.

348
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:16,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the long-term positions that we needed to fill

349
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:17,629
[SPEAKER_04]: have been filled.

350
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:25,353
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an ongoing list, as I indicated, for food service, for daily subs, things of that sort that we leave open.

351
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But the majority of the actual position types that were needed for classroom coverage we have addressed, again, sometimes not in the exact capacity, but with a licensed teacher.

352
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So that has been identified.

353
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would encourage everybody to visit our

354
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:59,328
[SPEAKER_04]: site that is on, it's attached directly to the Medford Public Schools website and it brings you directly to our platform that has all positions that are open and we encourage folks to apply at any given point and we continue that onboarding process.

355
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:05,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And that includes like open temporary positions for short-term and long-term leaves.

356
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:06,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

357
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:06,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

358
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good to know.

359
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with my colleague about substitutes.

360
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:20,023
[SPEAKER_06]: A parent had asked me if substitutes or paras or other professionals within the building are trained

361
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:27,478
[SPEAKER_06]: with our emergency plans for the building that they're serving in and their lockdown procedures.

362
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:44,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So my hope is through the administration, there could be some type of procedure or policy in place for each building for onboarding of temporary and new staff that gets hired after the initial orientation week, just so we check all the boxes.

363
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:52,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Another question that's come up is, are all people within our schools, even volunteers, are quarried?

364
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:53,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.

365
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:54,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, OK.

366
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:57,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Just putting every question that I've received out there.

367
00:30:58,353 --> 00:31:09,517
[SPEAKER_06]: My other concern is, as my colleague noted about this specific science teacher, part of the reason there was concern is because eighth grade is a year that we test for MCAS.

368
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:13,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they've had substitute last year and they're again

369
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:38,754
[SPEAKER_06]: But I trust your judgment and if you're telling me that Substitute is a certified teacher and you're supporting them with the new programming and that our director of science is gonna be checking in and really helping them along the way, that I would feel comfortable telling parents that as they approach us and ask us and bring forward their concerns, which I'm really grateful for.

370
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:41,515
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a lot of emails and a lot of reach out

371
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:51,279
[SPEAKER_06]: people on my porch around town, I'll text you different things that people are asking to just clarify, because I don't know them all.

372
00:31:51,679 --> 00:32:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I did notice today when I was on the website that I think we're not having a meeting on November 4th, so our meeting dates have to be updated there, because that hasn't been updated, just to reflect that.

373
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:09,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So people are aware that I don't know exactly which dates.

374
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to fill out my, if we're rescheduling the next Monday is a holiday, Veterans Day.

375
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't, yeah, yeah.

376
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:24,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know if we were going to try it next week or after that, but it's just, just so we're all aware and on the page with that.

377
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:26,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I do try to check different things.

378
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:27,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

379
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:37,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sad to see that our nutritionists left, especially in the middle of a program, because we were really hoping for success with this new breakfast program.

380
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:44,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I also was wondering, at the last meeting, we talked a little bit about the middle school bus just getting there right on time for class.

381
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:54,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And has any movement happened with that so that children are there early enough to ensure they have time to grab a breakfast or eat their breakfast before going in?

382
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm putting you on the spot with that.

383
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:56,797
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

384
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:05,661
[SPEAKER_04]: inform the buses that they could release the students for the purpose of having breakfast in the morning.

385
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:10,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as I'm aware of, that has been taking place at all the outside buildings.

386
00:33:10,543 --> 00:33:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the Columbus is a little bit different because they've always had the mandated breakfast after the bell.

387
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:22,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is, but even at the Columbus, they do have the release of the students on the bus in an effort.

388
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the older age group is eating sometimes beforehand because again, our,

389
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:32,709
[SPEAKER_04]: for the participation and success of this program was to serve hot breakfast.

390
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is being done.

391
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,774
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual menu for the breakfast is being updated now.

392
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:48,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say that the position of a nutritionist is not necessarily something that is within every food service department.

393
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:52,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a nicety and it was very beneficial.

394
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will certainly be reviewed and looked at.

395
00:33:55,956 --> 00:34:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: But in terms of the requirements of the food service program, we are in compliance without that position.

396
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:08,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to assure everybody that we are working very diligently to make this breakfast program a success.

397
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:15,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We continue to have the increased notification at all the school buildings.

398
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:22,858
[SPEAKER_04]: We are trying to encourage our high school students to come in as soon as they arrive on campus

399
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: that the cafeteria too has hot breakfast and from our new kitchen manager who's serving scratch breakfast.

400
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:44,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about scrambled eggs, fresh sausage, there's pancakes, there's French toast sticks, there's all different options that we are really encouraging this participation and we have made every effort to make it successful.

401
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:45,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

402
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:53,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a great effort here to provide breakfast for our community, and I think it's a good start, a really good, strong start.

403
00:34:54,206 --> 00:35:04,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also just, my only concern was a parent in the Hillside area expressed concern that the bus doesn't get there early enough for their child to get.

404
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:09,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that they're not releasing them, it's that the bus is pulling up right on time for class, so their child doesn't

405
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:18,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't affect this particular child, but it could affect other children from that area that might need time to eat.

406
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:20,587
[SPEAKER_06]: because it is before the bell.

407
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:36,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a concern when we're talking to the bus company to get them there early enough so that they can participate in all of the program, because without the participation, we're not gonna be able to continue this program.

408
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:44,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very important for everybody listening to make sure their children or grandchildren go to school early and have a nice breakfast, and it sounds delicious.

409
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:47,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that I was there to participate.

410
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:48,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

411
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:50,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the report.

412
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:06,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever we have a teacher that is not certified in the particular discipline, that's reported to DESE, correct?

413
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:08,763
[SPEAKER_10]: That shows up on the report card and all that stuff?

414
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:11,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it depends on the length of time.

415
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:17,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, if we're talking just a short-term leave of absence, if it's under 30 days, it's not

416
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:22,346
[SPEAKER_04]: categorically catastrophic according to DESE in that regard.

417
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:28,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is the ability to teach outside of your core subject area from licensure perspective.

418
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:45,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So where we may not have somebody in their particular field, again, science and math are very difficult fields to get somebody, especially once the school year has started, to have a content teacher that is licensed in any of the disciplines is a benefit.

419
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:46,625
[SPEAKER_10]: course.

420
00:36:46,945 --> 00:36:47,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

421
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:56,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this is, you know, this is really down into the weeds, but, um, apparently at the McGlynn today there was no French toast sticks available.

422
00:36:56,152 --> 00:37:00,194
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they were served at all the other schools and they were ran out or whatever.

423
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:03,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and that's not really why I wanted to talk about.

424
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:05,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but, um,

425
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:17,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard from a couple of parents whose kids are allergic to dairy and they went to school today and they were very excited because it's French toast sticks day and they could eat the lunch.

426
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:21,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they got there and they were replaced with mozzarella sticks because they were out.

427
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:25,842
[SPEAKER_10]: And none of that actually particularly bothers me.

428
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:34,964
[SPEAKER_10]: What bothers me is that are we really not providing everyday alternatives to fairly common allergies at lunch?

429
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:39,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can say that they do address the allergy.

430
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:47,086
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was, I know the French toast sticks were on the menu at most locations today, so it could have possibly been that they ran out.

431
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean that that was the only option?

432
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,810
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably could have had others, and we will certainly look into that.

433
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:58,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But usually, if they run out, that was a popular menu item.

434
00:37:59,953 --> 00:38:02,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that that's great participation, so.

435
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:04,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I would completely agree.

436
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:06,096
[SPEAKER_10]: My question was really around like.

437
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:08,677
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's lunch time, right?

438
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:09,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That's lunch.

439
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,218
[SPEAKER_10]: This is lunch.

440
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:16,561
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess my question is like, if you are allergic to dairy, does that mean only certain days of the week you can eat lunch?

441
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:18,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Or can you eat lunch every day?

442
00:38:18,822 --> 00:38:18,862
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

443
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:21,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know, because I'm not allergic to dairy.

444
00:38:21,784 --> 00:38:23,165
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have other options.

445
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:25,846
[SPEAKER_04]: The main item might not have been to their liking.

446
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would have been.

447
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't with the kids, so obviously I don't know that.

448
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:31,697
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

449
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:32,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

450
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

451
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:36,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file?

452
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved by Ms.

453
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Aguirre.

454
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,062
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

455
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:40,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

456
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:41,843
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

457
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:42,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion granted.

458
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:46,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Item six, report on dyslexia screening tools update.

459
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:47,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Associate Superintendent, Ms.

460
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:48,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Caldwell.

461
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, everyone.

462
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

463
00:38:55,524 --> 00:39:05,466
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to start this evening by letting you know how grateful and thankful I am that I'm working with a dream team.

464
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,787
[SPEAKER_17]: So first I'd like to thank my dream team.

465
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,087
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Katie Champoli.

466
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,007
[SPEAKER_17]: She's our coordinator of special education.

467
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:16,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Susanna Campbell, our director of speech and language.

468
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:20,489
[SPEAKER_17]: And Dr. Nicole Chiesa, who is our director of humanities.

469
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:25,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Since we've begun this project back in August, they've been relentless.

470
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:36,018
[SPEAKER_17]: in their efforts to make sure that we have our professional development, that we have implementation of our screeners, and that we're moving forward.

471
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:42,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd also like to thank our superintendent, who is always very supportive of any new initiatives we have.

472
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:48,886
[SPEAKER_17]: The principals, the assistant principals, the educators, so just

473
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so you know, the educators are very busy learning a new program.

474
00:39:54,483 --> 00:40:04,068
[SPEAKER_17]: So they've been participating in professional development as well as learning to work with the students in their implementation of the screener.

475
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:10,838
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to thank the tech staff, because it took a lot of downloading of some of the names with School Brains.

476
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:23,422
[SPEAKER_17]: And most importantly, right now for me, and for the girls who probably agree with me, my executive assistant, Michelle Bissell, has been also relentless in her energy to make sure we get the grant.

477
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:25,843
[SPEAKER_17]: And she gets amendments for us.

478
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:31,865
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think in the past week, we have laminated I don't know how many RAN assessments.

479
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:34,626
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're very lucky to have Michelle on board, too.

480
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:39,844
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to start with a little bit of history about these screeners.

481
00:40:39,924 --> 00:41:02,258
[SPEAKER_17]: So just about a year ago, on October 19, 2018, Governor Baker signed into law a bill requiring the State Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, otherwise known as DESE, to issue guidelines to assist school districts to develop screening for dyslexia, screening procedures for dyslexia.

482
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:28,889
[SPEAKER_17]: DESE offered competitive grants this past summer and selected districts to pilot grants that were valid and reliable, scientifically based, brief, administered three times a year, and had an inclusion of code and meeting based and or rapid... Automatized, thank you, naming assessments, which is the RAND.

483
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:35,376
[SPEAKER_17]: The department approved the following screeners that met the aforementioned criteria.

484
00:41:36,157 --> 00:41:46,785
[SPEAKER_17]: They approved the ISIP early reading assessment, Lexia rapid assessment, MAP growth reading, and STAR early literacy and STAR reading assessments.

485
00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:55,878
[SPEAKER_17]: The Columbus School was awarded the MAP grant in late August, and the McGlynn was awarded the Alexia Rapid grant in September.

486
00:41:56,798 --> 00:42:03,041
[SPEAKER_17]: So you'll notice that in my previous report, I said that the Brooks and the Roberts schools were going to pilot the Dibbles 8.

487
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:06,182
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were excited to have Dibble's Aid.

488
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:19,067
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a program that you can use all the way through eighth grade, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, though it's not similar to the Lexia or the MAP programs because it was not an online program.

489
00:42:19,627 --> 00:42:26,990
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would be similar to doing a DRA, which is a one-on-one with each student, which takes 30 to possibly 45 minutes to do.

490
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:40,602
[SPEAKER_17]: However, on October 1st, Lexley Rapid offered to provide the Brooks and the Roberts schools professional development and the use of their online screening tool.

491
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:42,223
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the best part.

492
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, maybe not, but it's free of charge.

493
00:42:45,871 --> 00:43:05,803
[SPEAKER_17]: So our screening team reviewed Dibble's 8 and Lexia Rapid and decided that in consideration of consistency, assessment time, and time on learning, and of course meeting DESE criteria, we would accept Lexia's offers to pilot at the Brooks and the Roberts elementary schools.

494
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,031
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a great opportunity for Medford Public Schools.

495
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:13,372
[SPEAKER_17]: The professional development required is less intensive.

496
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:17,013
[SPEAKER_17]: The tool itself is mainly online like MAP.

497
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:19,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Student assessments take less time.

498
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:24,874
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the four screeners, it is one of the four screeners Jesse is recommending for our schools.

499
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:30,755
[SPEAKER_17]: So the superintendent and the screening committee agree that this is a win for Medford Public Schools.

500
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:36,336
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition, Lexia is offering core five

501
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:38,246
[SPEAKER_17]: to our K-2 staff.

502
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:42,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Lexia Rapid is a screening tool that we will be using.

503
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:47,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Lexia Core 5 is a computer-based intervention tool.

504
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,609
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is the first time that students use it.

505
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:55,590
[SPEAKER_17]: They will log in, and there's a placement exercise for them to do.

506
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:05,692
[SPEAKER_17]: And then based on those results, student profiles are created that target intervention to support and grow in the areas of need.

507
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:10,073
[SPEAKER_17]: So this would be for the Alexia and also for our MAP students as well.

508
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:20,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So as Medford Public Schools conducts this pilot of Core 5, we will offer district-wide optional professional development for K-2 educators.

509
00:44:21,274 --> 00:44:27,017
[SPEAKER_17]: This is separate from the DESE-funded grant and was generously offered by Lexia free of charge.

510
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:44,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Educators who choose to take this training, and we hope that most of our educators take the training, they will be provided professional development after school hours and additional professional development points, PDPs, that can go towards relicensure.

511
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:48,187
[SPEAKER_17]: So at this time I'm going to ask

512
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:54,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Katie Champoli to talk a little bit about our MAPS program at the Columbus Elementary School.

513
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:00,728
[SPEAKER_15]: So Susanna, you just have this?

514
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:01,608
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

515
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:02,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

516
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:15,391
[SPEAKER_15]: So in August, over the summer, we were informed that the Columbus was granted the MAP assessment grant from the state, which is created by a company called NWEA.

517
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:19,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And the assessment is MAP Growth Assessment K2.

518
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,633
[SPEAKER_15]: So we got that information over the summer, and at that time,

519
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:25,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

520
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:29,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Caldwell, myself, Dr. Chiesa, and Ms.

521
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:39,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Campbell, and Kathy Kay, Dr. Kay from the Columbus School, we met with Martha Coakley, who was a representative from NWEA, about MAP over the summer.

522
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:45,093
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that time, around that time, around the beginning of the school year, Ms.

523
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:51,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Kay informed her staff about the award of the grant, and she identified a point person from each grade.

524
00:45:52,728 --> 00:46:00,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Those point people then participated in a webinar with Dr. K and NWEA to learn a little bit about the assessment.

525
00:46:01,835 --> 00:46:08,300
[SPEAKER_15]: There were also some online training modules that the teachers watched before the screener was implemented.

526
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Screening then began on September 16th.

527
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:12,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

528
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:21,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Coakley, who was our representative at the time, was present at the Columbus that day and helped meet with some of the teachers at that time.

529
00:46:23,144 --> 00:46:31,087
[SPEAKER_15]: On October 9th, Dr. K had one of her staff meetings, and at that time, she talked to them about review of test results.

530
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:38,270
[SPEAKER_15]: In between the testing and the staff meeting, Dr. K had had a number of conversations with Ms.

531
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:43,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Coakley about the screener and about how to view the results.

532
00:46:46,024 --> 00:46:46,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

533
00:46:46,244 --> 00:46:57,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Kaye, Dr. Kaye has also had individual meetings with different teachers or small group meetings that have not been mandatory, that have been just based on individual teacher need.

534
00:46:59,495 --> 00:47:00,776
[SPEAKER_15]: and Ms.

535
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:04,897
[SPEAKER_15]: K has relayed any information that the teachers need that she's been able to get from NWEA.

536
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:09,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Then on October 16th, we had a more in-depth training.

537
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:28,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Two representatives from NWEA came out and met with administrators in the morning and then with staff in the afternoon and really went into detail about how to review these assessment results and how to make meaning of them with respect to their own students and how to kind of

538
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,186
[SPEAKER_15]: try to inform their instruction based on these results.

539
00:47:32,786 --> 00:47:35,248
[SPEAKER_15]: So, oops, sorry.

540
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:48,136
[SPEAKER_15]: For participating in this grant, the teachers at the Columbus will get 20 PDPs that can be applied towards their relicensure.

541
00:47:52,554 --> 00:48:05,541
[SPEAKER_15]: The assessment was given between September 16th and September 27th, and that doesn't mean that they were assessed every day between that window, simply that it stayed open in order to account for every student who might have been absent when their classroom did the assessment.

542
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:15,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Students spent approximately 20 to 25 minutes on the assessment, then they were able to take a break, and then most students were done within a total of 45 minutes that was including the break.

543
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:35,231
[SPEAKER_15]: So as far as what's next, after the assessment was given and the window closed, that's when MAP analyzed this data and generated reports for each of the teachers based on their individual students' performance.

544
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:48,299
[SPEAKER_15]: And as part of that report, each student is given what's called a RIT score, which MAP has created and which they have defined as ready for intervention today.

545
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:53,157
[SPEAKER_15]: So the students are given an overall RIT score for their reading.

546
00:48:53,798 --> 00:49:04,007
[SPEAKER_15]: They're also given RIT scores in the areas of foundational skills, language and writing, literature and informational, and vocabulary use and functions.

547
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,911
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are aligned with the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

548
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Every student also got what's called a Lexile range.

549
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:13,156
[SPEAKER_15]: And that correlates.

550
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:28,726
[SPEAKER_15]: MAP doesn't necessarily put a stamp of approval on the Lexile as far as it compares, if you can take Lexile and compare it with another program for reading.

551
00:49:28,806 --> 00:49:38,812
[SPEAKER_15]: So teachers can take the Lexile score, go to the internet and see how does that relate with another program as far as picking text for my students in my classroom.

552
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:40,713
[SPEAKER_15]: So because MAP

553
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:44,377
[SPEAKER_15]: or NWEA didn't create these conversion charts.

554
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:45,717
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't give a stamp of approval.

555
00:49:45,737 --> 00:49:48,878
[SPEAKER_15]: They just say this is the Lexile range for this particular student.

556
00:49:50,518 --> 00:50:00,901
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as what's next, also, so teachers can take the RIT score and then go to MAPS Learning Continuum, which is a resource that takes that three-digit number

557
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:06,767
[SPEAKER_15]: and tells the teachers where their students are ready to learn based on that particular score.

558
00:50:07,288 --> 00:50:19,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are also aligned with the mass curriculum frameworks so that when teachers are introducing a new topic, they can go to the learning continuum to see where students should begin based on their instructional levels.

559
00:50:20,805 --> 00:50:31,378
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that we didn't really get to go into in depth with NWEA at the training last week, but they are happy to talk to us more.

560
00:50:31,418 --> 00:50:35,082
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been very responsive to emails and requests for additional information.

561
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:39,581
[SPEAKER_15]: As Ms.

562
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:44,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Caldwell discussed, there will also be optional PD on Lexia Core 5 after school hours.

563
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:59,009
[SPEAKER_15]: So even though Columbus is not doing Lexia Rapid, the staff from Columbus still has the option to participate in Lexia Core 5 training, which is their intervention piece, so separate from the assessment.

564
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:03,631
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not related to MAP, but it still can be helpful to all of the teachers.

565
00:51:08,553 --> 00:51:12,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Because MAP doesn't have its own system of intervention.

566
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:16,159
[SPEAKER_15]: They were clear with us that they are an assessment company for K-2.

567
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:18,261
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not an intervention company.

568
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:22,024
[SPEAKER_15]: So their product is focused on assessment.

569
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:26,187
[SPEAKER_15]: But they do have what they call instructional connection providers.

570
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:29,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Certain companies that they have identified

571
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:34,032
[SPEAKER_15]: that you can take your RIT score to and give it meaning within that program.

572
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:42,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And among the instructional connection providers that MAP has is Learning A to Z, and that's something that the Medford Public Schools does have access to.

573
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:50,380
[SPEAKER_15]: That's something, again, we really didn't get to go into depth with them about last week, but they're willing to give us more information about that.

574
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:54,882
[SPEAKER_15]: And then

575
00:51:57,421 --> 00:52:00,323
[SPEAKER_15]: The results, I'm going to skip that second bullet because we already talked about it.

576
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:02,704
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll be talking about it more afterwards.

577
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:15,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And then one other screener that the staff at the Columbus will be giving is the RAN assessment, because the MAP growth K2 does not include a rapid automatized naming assessment.

578
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:22,596
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a supplement that will be given to the students at the Columbus to assess in that area, which can

579
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:35,170
[SPEAKER_15]: These results will be calculated by the teachers, and difficulty on this task could potentially indicate risk for future difficulty with reading fluency.

580
00:52:35,591 --> 00:52:37,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why we wanted to make sure that we did give that supplement.

581
00:52:39,512 --> 00:52:49,336
[SPEAKER_15]: And then from there, if they do indicate that this could be a potential area of weakness, then the staff can give intervention focused on automaticity and fluency.

582
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:58,550
[SPEAKER_15]: I can give you a little, we put a link here to just show you a little bit about what the assessment looks like.

583
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:13,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I should mention also that there is also a follow-up webinar that we are trying to schedule within contractual teacher's hours to show the staff more about the skills checklists that go along with the MAP growth assessment.

584
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,002
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in a packet that we provided to you, I think, at your last meeting.

585
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:22,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So as part of MAP growth K2, if you think about it,

586
00:53:22,518 --> 00:53:28,080
[SPEAKER_15]: as an umbrella, that's the name of this suite of products.

587
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,241
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the math growth assessment, which is what the kids at the Columbus have already done.

588
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:37,902
[SPEAKER_15]: They have skills checklists, which can hone in further on particular skills.

589
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:42,623
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what they're going to provide a little bit more detail about in this next webinar.

590
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:48,625
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it also has a screener that they said was generally intended for incoming kindergartners.

591
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:57,100
[SPEAKER_15]: So right here, this link will just show us a little bit about what the students saw when they took the assessment.

592
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Not exactly.

593
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:19,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if we should go through the rest of the PowerPoint and then we'll do all the demos at the end.

594
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:23,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that okay with everybody, just so that we can finish up the PowerPoint first?

595
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:40,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, Mr. Benedetto.

596
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I have to.

597
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:07,148
th th th th

598
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:17,784
[SPEAKER_15]: The RAN assessment?

599
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:21,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we haven't identified a deadline for that just yet.

600
00:55:21,906 --> 00:55:23,927
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't really want to overwhelm the staff.

601
00:55:24,107 --> 00:55:25,748
[SPEAKER_15]: They were given so much information.

602
00:55:26,248 --> 00:55:34,533
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're really doing such a good job of taking this all in and processing all this information that this is giving them about their students.

603
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:42,918
[SPEAKER_15]: So we didn't want to overwhelm them by saying, oh, you need to have this done by November 1, especially where the training just happened last week with

604
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:43,778
[SPEAKER_15]: with MAP.

605
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,641
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have the assessment, but we haven't told them we want you to have it done by this date.

606
00:55:52,742 --> 00:55:55,883
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually it's given individually.

607
00:56:10,888 --> 00:56:15,872
[SPEAKER_17]: These particular tools for this pilot, yeah, I've done three times a year.

608
00:56:28,448 --> 00:56:29,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes.

609
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:29,988
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope so.

610
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:59,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who needs any type of intervention, hey, we know that your child is struggling a little bit in this area, and this is what we as a district are planning to do.

611
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:04,188
[SPEAKER_05]: We're putting in this special reading block, which I hope you're familiar with.

612
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:06,408
How are we doing that?

613
00:57:06,428 --> 00:57:09,149
First, I'd like to follow up on that.

614
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:15,452
And then, I would like to follow up on specifically as children come on,

615
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:22,676
[SPEAKER_17]: So letters will go home to parents informing them of the different test assessments that we're giving.

616
00:57:22,696 --> 00:57:34,567
[SPEAKER_17]: It is my understanding that the map went out already to the Columbus School parents and that Lexi has probably already gone out to our Brooks, Roberts and McGlynn parents.

617
00:57:35,508 --> 00:57:41,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Normally when we do DRA assessments, we don't usually inform parents, but we

618
00:57:42,182 --> 00:57:48,948
[SPEAKER_17]: can look at that and just let parents know how their children are doing and what the intervention might be for each student.

619
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:26,794
[SPEAKER_05]: expectations that we'll have to stop that notification at this point, but anyone who falls in the area that we feel any interventions is necessary, I think that that should be followed up either with a formal email letter or just saying, hey, we saw this team, this is the district team, this is what that looks like, you know, we just wanted to partner with you to improve all that we are at

620
00:58:28,664 --> 00:58:47,261
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know if this is still on, but I will say that report cards go out for students the first week in December, and normally during that time when the teachers have conferences, they'll be able to share any scores of the assessments that are given to the children.

621
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:58,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want people to realize how proactive they're being with their child's reading.

622
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:14,883
Thank you.

623
00:59:45,785 --> 00:59:47,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add one thing to that, too?

624
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:54,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So MAP, and MAP has a very extensive report that they provide families.

625
00:59:54,168 --> 01:00:04,611
[SPEAKER_00]: They've condensed it now to be called Family Report, so it's a little more user-friendly for the parents, but it essentially gives all of the information of how the child performed.

626
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:13,674
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks at the growth, so when parents sit down with the teacher, they can look at, you know, he started here, he's grown this much,

627
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also tells you the readiness skills.

628
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:22,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So he or she is ready for blending, or he or she is ready for this.

629
01:00:22,776 --> 01:00:29,861
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually outlines that very, very clearly, not just for the teacher, but within that family report as well.

630
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:33,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lexia has a somewhat similar report.

631
01:00:33,123 --> 01:00:39,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So the companies themselves will have a nice way of communicating it, which will be helpful to all the educators.

632
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:42,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually love that MAP report.

633
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very informational.

634
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:45,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

635
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we are having a little technical difficulty, but I can continue.

636
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

637
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:51,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Stone.

638
01:00:53,565 --> 01:00:57,626
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to ask, so usually when something's too good to be true, it is.

639
01:00:57,646 --> 01:01:05,209
[SPEAKER_20]: So with Lexia letting us use it for free, does that mean in June we have to budget for $500,000 for this program?

640
01:01:05,409 --> 01:01:10,191
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, to buy Lexia, it costs a little over $7 for the screener tool.

641
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:14,085
[SPEAKER_08]: per year, per student.

642
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:15,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, per student.

643
01:01:16,466 --> 01:01:23,591
[SPEAKER_17]: However, their Core 5 tool is a little bit more than that, or a lot more than that, depending on what you think.

644
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:24,171
[SPEAKER_17]: It's $40.

645
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:26,513
[SPEAKER_17]: For which one was that?

646
01:01:27,193 --> 01:01:28,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Lexia Core 5.

647
01:01:29,074 --> 01:01:30,535
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the intervention tool.

648
01:01:30,695 --> 01:01:31,015
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

649
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:41,262
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, I think what Lexia wants to do is prove to the state that Medford is doing outstanding using our product, see the results,

650
01:01:41,977 --> 01:01:46,991
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the state adopts Lexia, so therefore Medford would have to.

651
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:49,096
[SPEAKER_20]: And then what's dibbles per student?

652
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,371
[SPEAKER_17]: »» I don't know what DIBL is pursuing.

653
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:52,011
[SPEAKER_09]: »» Significantly less.

654
01:01:52,632 --> 01:01:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the number.

655
01:01:53,652 --> 01:01:59,296
[SPEAKER_09]: »» We have to remember too that DIBLs, there's three separate things that we're talking about there though.

656
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's RAPID, which is the screener.

657
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be in comparison to DIBLs.

658
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:04,499
[SPEAKER_20]: »» Okay.

659
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,560
[SPEAKER_20]: So they are screeners.

660
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,581
[SPEAKER_09]: »» 4 or 5 is an intervention.

661
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:08,702
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not a screener.

662
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:13,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're comparing the screeners, we would be looking at MAP, RAPID and DIBLs.

663
01:02:13,746 --> 01:02:14,886
[SPEAKER_09]: We would not be talking about 4 or 5.

664
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,222
[SPEAKER_20]: So are we looking at them together then, or are we looking at them separately?

665
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:24,525
[SPEAKER_00]: CORE 5, we're looking at separately as an intervention tool.

666
01:02:24,605 --> 01:02:26,386
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that Lexia offered.

667
01:02:26,806 --> 01:02:31,189
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't feel that that was something we should take away from people for this year with intervention.

668
01:02:31,509 --> 01:02:34,011
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are looking at it completely separately.

669
01:02:34,131 --> 01:02:37,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also optional for our K to 2 teachers.

670
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:39,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So not every teacher will take advantage of the Lex.

671
01:02:39,734 --> 01:02:40,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we hope they do.

672
01:02:41,155 --> 01:02:43,216
[SPEAKER_00]: But they may not all take advantage of CORE 5.

673
01:02:43,256 --> 01:02:44,377
[SPEAKER_20]: So does DIBL and MAP?

674
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:49,528
[SPEAKER_20]: and Rapid sell an intervention program like Lexia does?

675
01:02:50,488 --> 01:02:53,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt does not, and Dibbles does not, that I'm aware of with Dibbles.

676
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Matt doesn't.

677
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:01,913
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just wondering, are we choosing it because it's free, or are we choosing it because it's the best option for the screeners?

678
01:03:02,753 --> 01:03:06,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Lexia Core 5 is a very strong intervention program.

679
01:03:06,555 --> 01:03:10,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wonderful opportunity that we were not expecting Lexia to offer us.

680
01:03:10,697 --> 01:03:14,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We were expecting just the screener, the Lexia Rapid, to come our way.

681
01:03:15,078 --> 01:03:21,402
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just an add-on that is used in many different districts and is very well received.

682
01:03:21,542 --> 01:03:27,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought it was a nice opportunity for the children and the educators.

683
01:03:28,026 --> 01:03:44,115
[SPEAKER_20]: So I guess if the trial is for the year, and hopefully we learn which kids need the intervention, and then we will be looking then to use their intervention, the core five, then we do have to budget for $40 a student per year.

684
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,371
[SPEAKER_20]: for this program if this is what we use?

685
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:50,074
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we need to wait for Dessie to weigh in on this.

686
01:03:50,555 --> 01:04:03,765
[SPEAKER_17]: So the Department of Education, after the whole year of doing all of these assessments with various districts, are then going to take a look at all this information and then choose a screening tool for us.

687
01:04:03,805 --> 01:04:09,250
[SPEAKER_17]: So it may be that they say Lexia is the tool, or they might choose one of the others.

688
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:19,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, and I guess, I'm sorry I'm being cynical, and I owe that to Paul, because he says there's big money in education, and he's right, because he made me read a book about it.

689
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:33,051
[SPEAKER_20]: So I guess I'm just doubtful that, what is, is Lexia, is this really the best option out there, or do they market themselves so well, and give it to people for a year for free, that we end up thinking it's the best and we use it?

690
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:40,941
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you're talking about how we selected the screeners to use, these were screeners that DESE put on their list that they wanted piloted.

691
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:48,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was their decision that we already had on there, that NWEA, MAP, and Lexia Rapid.

692
01:04:48,226 --> 01:04:52,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were both assessments that were put out by DESE.

693
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:55,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to remember that what's happening at the McGlynn is a DESE grant.

694
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,893
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are doing this for DESE.

695
01:04:57,933 --> 01:05:00,995
[SPEAKER_09]: They're looking at it as a potential that they might recommend to the state.

696
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:04,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So that isn't that we were just listening to marketing.

697
01:05:04,493 --> 01:05:06,454
[SPEAKER_09]: That was something that DESE provided.

698
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:08,675
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm not even being cynical just with the state of Medford.

699
01:05:08,695 --> 01:05:11,356
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm being cynical with the Department of Ed of Massachusetts.

700
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:16,459
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't know what the Department of Ed is going to do yet.

701
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:24,504
[SPEAKER_00]: They are tasked with the challenge of outlining the guidelines that will be needed for a dyslexia screener.

702
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:30,827
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were meeting with the MAP people the other day, they gave us examples of other states that had certain

703
01:05:31,743 --> 01:05:35,886
[SPEAKER_00]: components that the state had required for the screener.

704
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:41,850
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure yet, and I don't think Dessie's sure yet, of exactly which components they're going to outline.

705
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,732
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very good understanding of it, but not a definite.

706
01:05:45,032 --> 01:05:54,258
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what they're doing with the screeners, because they're trying out the different ones to see which one's going to hit where they feel like the most essential components are.

707
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:56,660
[SPEAKER_20]: And then with the core five for the intervention,

708
01:05:57,273 --> 01:06:03,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that, would that bring on more staff, or you are saying the classroom teacher would be the interventionist using the core five?

709
01:06:03,196 --> 01:06:03,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

710
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:08,919
[SPEAKER_09]: And or title one, and or EL, because they are also being trained.

711
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:09,680
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

712
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,261
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, thank you.

713
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:12,581
[SPEAKER_09]: All set?

714
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a bunch in the queue right now.

715
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:15,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

716
01:06:16,826 --> 01:06:19,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are having some technical issues, as you can tell.

717
01:06:19,547 --> 01:06:23,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think what would be best is if we present the rest of our presentation just orally.

718
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:26,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if I can get on, I will show the demos at the end.

719
01:06:26,311 --> 01:06:28,052
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not having any luck with the PowerPoint.

720
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:31,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think maybe I can stop blinding you for a moment.

721
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:31,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

722
01:06:34,015 --> 01:06:35,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a bunch in the queue right now.

723
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:35,515
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

724
01:06:35,636 --> 01:06:38,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you asking to hold questions until you complete?

725
01:06:39,177 --> 01:06:40,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to finish the presentation.

726
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:42,419
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could all be patient and let them finish.

727
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:42,479
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

728
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

729
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:57,917
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go without the presentation up front, but Susanna and I are going to present to you a little more information about Lexia Rapid.

730
01:06:58,377 --> 01:07:04,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So as our associate superintendent mentioned, Medford Public Schools was awarded the grant for Lexia Rapid.

731
01:07:04,699 --> 01:07:10,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want us to think very separately, put Core 5 out of our brains right now, we're on Lexia Rapid, the screener.

732
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:12,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So the McGlynn was awarded that.

733
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:17,956
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we were also offered free of charge to the Brooks and the Roberts Elementary School.

734
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:26,340
[SPEAKER_00]: To prepare for this adequately, we have two different professional development dates so far.

735
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,322
[SPEAKER_00]: The first date was most recently October 16th.

736
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:37,585
[SPEAKER_00]: The McGlynn had their own professional development because they are doing this through the state, and the Brooks and the Roberts came together

737
01:07:38,312 --> 01:07:44,975
[SPEAKER_00]: had a live person to do their training, which is called the rapid rollout, which was mentioned in the report.

738
01:07:46,215 --> 01:07:56,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were trained in how to implement the assessment and learned more about Lexia overall for those that were not as familiar with it.

739
01:07:58,059 --> 01:08:07,343
[SPEAKER_00]: On November 20th, the teachers, this is K-2 teachers, this is Title I teachers, special education teachers, ELs, EL teachers,

740
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:14,514
[SPEAKER_00]: who work with our K-2, they will again participate in another training which we call the Data Dive.

741
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:25,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where once they have the data, they will work with the consultants from Lexia to really understand that data more clearly.

742
01:08:26,017 --> 01:08:27,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are our two dates for PD.

743
01:08:27,877 --> 01:08:29,978
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the 16th and November 20th.

744
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:37,320
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be other Data Dives once the assessment given in the winter and the spring occur.

745
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:40,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already mentioned to you who's involved.

746
01:08:40,864 --> 01:08:44,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have classroom teachers K through two and the other people who I mentioned.

747
01:08:46,226 --> 01:08:50,647
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the PD, there is something called Lexia Academy.

748
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:58,250
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a variety of online modules for the teacher to become a little bit more acclimated.

749
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:06,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of those people who hears the information at a professional development or a conference and I wanna go back and play around with it and listen to additional modules.

750
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,244
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what this allows.

751
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:15,169
[SPEAKER_00]: So the teachers have a lot of resources to refer back to as they continue to learn about Lexia.

752
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:27,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to MAP, teachers who are participating will be awarded 20 PDPs that can be applied for DESE relicensure.

753
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:35,324
[SPEAKER_00]: For Lexia Rapid, the screening window opened on October 17th,

754
01:09:36,716 --> 01:09:42,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will continue to be open until November 19th, right before the data die.

755
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:46,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to MAP, they are certainly not tested every day.

756
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:49,819
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Lexia rapid assessment.

757
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:53,879
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to assess as efficiently and as effectively as possible.

758
01:09:54,240 --> 01:10:01,461
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that this is the window that's open for the teachers as they figure out the schedule that works best for their classroom.

759
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:06,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a three week window in which Lexia Rapid can be given.

760
01:10:06,922 --> 01:10:10,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is the same for McGlynn, Brooks, and Roberts.

761
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:14,003
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to be as consistent as possible amongst the three schools.

762
01:10:15,023 --> 01:10:26,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will also administer the rapid naming assessment, which has gone around to everybody, or is making its way around to everybody.

763
01:10:26,825 --> 01:10:30,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because Lexia Rapid, just like MAP, does not have

764
01:10:31,024 --> 01:10:33,085
[SPEAKER_00]: a test that checks for that.

765
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:37,546
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was mine, right?

766
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:45,588
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, when we do the Lexia data dive, that will be on-site professional development.

767
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:49,510
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers will analyze the student data on various levels.

768
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:50,930
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look at it individually.

769
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:52,851
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look at it whole class.

770
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:54,331
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll look at it whole grade.

771
01:10:55,352 --> 01:10:59,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be additional PD sessions for the other data dives.

772
01:11:01,647 --> 01:11:13,014
[SPEAKER_00]: As has already been mentioned, we will then have the Lexia Core 5 offered as a what's next intervention piece for those teachers that want to participate in it.

773
01:11:13,294 --> 01:11:15,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And teachers are very excited about it, I will say.

774
01:11:16,636 --> 01:11:20,979
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was at the PD, they were asking me all about the Lexia Core 5 as well.

775
01:11:20,999 --> 01:11:25,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we will have active participation for this intervention tool.

776
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:31,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I think I'm going to give it to Susanna to finish the presentation.

777
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to answer any questions after.

778
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:35,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Nicole.

779
01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:42,044
[SPEAKER_09]: So as has been mentioned already, the Alexia Rapid results

780
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:47,811
[SPEAKER_09]: will result in suggestions for intervention, and these are available to the teachers immediately.

781
01:11:47,951 --> 01:11:57,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So once a student has completed the screener, they are given a score, and the teacher can see what are the areas of strength, what are the areas of weakness that I need to address.

782
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Lexia Rapid has what's called Connections.

783
01:12:00,842 --> 01:12:02,804
[SPEAKER_09]: This is available in just the screener.

784
01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:06,586
[SPEAKER_09]: So Lexia Rapid has Connections, as does Core 5.

785
01:12:07,047 --> 01:12:08,988
[SPEAKER_09]: But even just with the screener, they have Connections.

786
01:12:09,048 --> 01:12:23,579
[SPEAKER_09]: So what that means is that if you identify that a student has difficulty in a specific area, you can look at the Connections, you can select the grade level, and it will give the teacher specific things they could work on within the context of the classroom, sent home as ideas for parents.

787
01:12:24,847 --> 01:12:28,168
[SPEAKER_09]: a direct connection with intervention strategies they could use right away.

788
01:12:29,668 --> 01:12:33,129
[SPEAKER_09]: It also gives information about how to group children into intervention groups.

789
01:12:33,489 --> 01:12:40,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It will identify that there are three children in your class who are struggling with a particular skill, so it will identify what they might need to work on.

790
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:43,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It also looks at opportunities for enrichment.

791
01:12:43,211 --> 01:12:48,391
[SPEAKER_09]: If you see students who are above grade level in certain areas, it will also give you ideas of what to do with those students.

792
01:12:48,752 --> 01:12:50,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So it provides a wide variety of intervention.

793
01:12:52,452 --> 01:13:01,034
[SPEAKER_09]: We already discussed how the results of the rapid naming screening will be addressed through interventions around automaticity and fluency.

794
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:04,355
[SPEAKER_09]: We can answer more questions about that afterwards if you would like.

795
01:13:04,955 --> 01:13:14,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last piece I want to mention before we take questions and give you some demonstrations are the screening scores that come from Lexia.

796
01:13:15,178 --> 01:13:18,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So similar to what you saw Katie present regarding MAP,

797
01:13:19,633 --> 01:13:22,955
[SPEAKER_09]: There are also three scores that come from Alexia Rapid.

798
01:13:23,496 --> 01:13:26,498
[SPEAKER_09]: You are given the reading success probability score.

799
01:13:27,559 --> 01:13:35,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That score gives teachers an idea of how likely the student is to be at grade level by the end of the school year.

800
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:40,868
[SPEAKER_09]: The next score is a percentile rank and that is for each area that's assessed.

801
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:46,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So they would use the bell curve to determine where is the student in all of those areas that we have mentioned.

802
01:13:47,608 --> 01:13:49,629
[SPEAKER_09]: The last score is the performance score.

803
01:13:49,649 --> 01:13:54,351
[SPEAKER_09]: And this measures the skill development over time for each screening task.

804
01:13:54,792 --> 01:14:00,595
[SPEAKER_09]: So how is the student doing in comparison to what they had on the previous screening to show growth over time.

805
01:14:01,735 --> 01:14:03,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And one last thing is the Lexile measure.

806
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:04,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So similar to what

807
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:14,290
[SPEAKER_09]: We had mentioned regarding MAP, where they give a Lexile score, which can be converted into other scores that teachers are familiar with, such as Fountas and Bunnell scores or DRA scores.

808
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:23,333
[SPEAKER_09]: They are correlated so that you can determine what grade level that student is at for instructional text and also for independent reading text.

809
01:14:24,554 --> 01:14:28,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I can get the technology to work, I would like to show you some demonstrations.

810
01:14:28,455 --> 01:14:31,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to do questions before or after the demos?

811
01:14:32,017 --> 01:14:32,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Before?

812
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:33,177
OK.

813
01:14:34,358 --> 01:14:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

814
01:14:35,874 --> 01:14:36,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Aguero.

815
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:37,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

816
01:14:37,835 --> 01:14:40,556
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you very much for all the hard work on this issue.

817
01:14:40,596 --> 01:14:43,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this is not just important to me, but our entire community.

818
01:14:44,778 --> 01:14:49,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a couple of questions really quick about the initial observations of the report.

819
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:54,663
[SPEAKER_13]: So September 16th, you said, that we did the initial map testing.

820
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:55,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

821
01:14:56,224 --> 01:15:02,187
[SPEAKER_13]: So can you give us a sense of, it was the REI score, was that one?

822
01:15:02,347 --> 01:15:03,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it RET?

823
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:03,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

824
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:05,769
[SPEAKER_15]: The RIT score, R-I-T.

825
01:15:06,009 --> 01:15:06,429
[SPEAKER_13]: R-I-T.

826
01:15:06,929 --> 01:15:13,432
[SPEAKER_13]: So on that score, is dyslexia viewed as sort of a place on the spectrum?

827
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:18,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is dyslexia, how is dyslexia exactly tested?

828
01:15:18,034 --> 01:15:27,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's sort of an either or type of prognostic measure versus sort of like a value on a bell curve.

829
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:30,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take it.

830
01:15:32,805 --> 01:15:38,248
[SPEAKER_15]: So the MAP growth assessment isn't going to give a diagnosis of dyslexia.

831
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:56,478
[SPEAKER_15]: What the representatives from NWEA said to us is that their skills checklists are what would be most helpful in predicting red flags.

832
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:03,567
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're not going to diagnose dyslexia either, but they would say, oh, there's a weakness in this particular area.

833
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:12,536
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they went on to talk about how, for example, the state of Indiana has used three or four of their skills checklists as part of their dyslexia screener.

834
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:28,230
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're looking at here is sort of a battery of different skills, and so if a kid sort of, for lack of a better word, bombs a bunch of regions or domains on those skills, then they're forwarded to someone, or how would that work?

835
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:35,876
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we would be looking at is there's critical skills that are predictors that a student is at risk for reading difficulty.

836
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:39,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that we want to be careful that we're not just looking for dyslexia.

837
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:45,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking for kids who are at risk for reading difficulty as a larger umbrella.

838
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:45,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

839
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:49,989
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we would need to look at to determine those risk factors are different areas.

840
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:51,290
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them is phonological.

841
01:16:51,970 --> 01:17:03,741
[SPEAKER_09]: awareness, another is sound symbol recognition, so understanding how the letters and sounds go together, alphabet knowledge, decoding skills, rapid naming, and encoding.

842
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:10,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be, encoding is spelling, so that's more for our second graders, that wouldn't be for the kindergartners or first graders who are just really learning.

843
01:17:11,311 --> 01:17:19,356
[SPEAKER_09]: how to decode, but the reason that we added in the rapid naming is because that was the one area that is not covered by these assessments.

844
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:23,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So we wanted to be sure that we were looking at all of those potential red flags.

845
01:17:23,659 --> 01:17:30,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if a student shows that they have a weakness in these areas, the first step is that we try interventions in general education.

846
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:35,727
[SPEAKER_09]: The first step would not be that you jump right ahead and try to see if the child has a diagnosis of dyslexia.

847
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:40,250
[SPEAKER_09]: What you want to do is you want to try to intervene right away because as we learned from Dr. Gob,

848
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:46,381
[SPEAKER_09]: last spring, if we intervene early, we can help children before they get to that point.

849
01:17:46,861 --> 01:17:50,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So the idea is we find who's at risk and we provide interventions right away.

850
01:17:51,003 --> 01:17:58,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we see how the children do over time while monitoring their progress with the interventions they're receiving.

851
01:17:59,498 --> 01:18:14,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess my concern with the issue, and I have no doubt on the abilities of the staff to handle these issues, but being able to address dyslexia is a serious concern that people devote an entire medical career to, basically.

852
01:18:14,135 --> 01:18:18,460
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have someone who knows how to handle these kids versus sort of a generalist.

853
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,303
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, environment that you would have from the teachers address these issues.

854
01:18:22,784 --> 01:18:27,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, I mean, there's certainly a difference between reading difficulty and dyslexia.

855
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:34,635
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess that's what I'm trying to suss out here on these metrics you're bringing ahead.

856
01:18:34,736 --> 01:18:36,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, if you see, like, five red flags,

857
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:59,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you say, OK, so we'll give this kid a couple of months to try to, we'll really focus, we'll bring in some coaches or whatever it takes to get this kid moving, or do we start moving that information ahead with the parents, say, look, this child might need help outside of school in addition to the work that we're doing inside of school, and we've got to figure out a partnership.

858
01:18:59,176 --> 01:19:00,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you understand the question I'm trying to say?

859
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:01,618
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what you're saying.

860
01:19:01,758 --> 01:19:05,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that there are a lot of components that go into why a child

861
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:09,509
[SPEAKER_00]: is successful or is not successful on a screener.

862
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:11,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the first step.

863
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:19,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm a kindergarten student and I come in and I don't know my letter IDs, is that because I wasn't exposed to it?

864
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:26,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there something more deeper going on that requires additional intervention?

865
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:27,233
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.

866
01:19:27,273 --> 01:19:30,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to start with that tier one general education

867
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:40,413
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our wind block set up where we can intervene if there's a weakness in phonological awareness, we can intervene during that, but more at a tier one level.

868
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:45,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, you know, we see is there that growth, right?

869
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:50,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there effective progress being made with the intervention that's being given to you?

870
01:19:51,139 --> 01:19:55,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's growth, that tells us that the child is responding.

871
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:57,403
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when that is that lack of growth,

872
01:19:57,864 --> 01:20:04,392
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not making movement, we're not moving that needle for that youngster, that it can become a deeper concern.

873
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:16,507
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like sometimes when we say dyslexia screener, it's almost a misnomer in that it's really a literacy weakness or challenge, but certainly

874
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:21,868
[SPEAKER_00]: these screeners won't be able to say, to give that diagnosis.

875
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:23,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense a little bit?

876
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:30,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important that we recognize this as a committee, that we're not screening for dyslexia, we're screening for reading ability.

877
01:20:31,395 --> 01:20:40,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the question I have would be, let's say, for example, you give a student this test and they don't do very well for whatever reason.

878
01:20:41,422 --> 01:20:43,264
[SPEAKER_13]: So intervention is applied.

879
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,965
[SPEAKER_13]: When is the next test happen?

880
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next test for the screener would be in the winter.

881
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:52,582
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do fall, winter, spring.

882
01:20:52,942 --> 01:21:08,187
[SPEAKER_00]: But in between that time, we're also giving other quick assessments, because we certainly wouldn't want to say, oh, in September, you did poorly, and come winter, you're still doing poorly.

883
01:21:08,227 --> 01:21:12,508
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so many months of not knowing that our intervention worked.

884
01:21:12,904 --> 01:21:15,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot with progress monitoring.

885
01:21:15,846 --> 01:21:22,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot with other pieces that we have to see if the child's making effective progress beyond that.

886
01:21:22,572 --> 01:21:26,715
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly we will give that same screener again.

887
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:39,946
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that moment, if I'm giving it in the fall and then giving it in the winter, if I'm doing the progress monitoring and other pieces within the general ed curriculum, I should know, really,

888
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:43,433
[SPEAKER_00]: is how this child's going to do.

889
01:21:43,574 --> 01:21:46,695
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we give it, then we don't go back to it and assess.

890
01:21:46,996 --> 01:21:47,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that help?

891
01:21:47,876 --> 01:21:58,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly do not doubt the ability and the hard work of our teachers, but I think the reason why we're having this conversation now is the recognition that some kids slip through the cracks.

892
01:21:58,823 --> 01:22:05,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean that some children who had dyslexia weren't identified in maybe the quickest way possible.

893
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:10,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Or maybe we could do a better job of identifying earlier to make sure that these kids.

894
01:22:10,631 --> 01:22:15,634
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm trying to get a hold of is what is the educational roadmap.

895
01:22:16,234 --> 01:22:21,538
[SPEAKER_13]: So I understand a kid, let's say a kid doesn't do great in fall, he doesn't do great in winter.

896
01:22:22,098 --> 01:22:23,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's say he doesn't do great in spring either.

897
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,481
[SPEAKER_13]: When do we begin to start huddling up and say,

898
01:22:28,422 --> 01:22:31,843
[SPEAKER_13]: well, maybe this child is dyslexic and that's fine.

899
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:34,263
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's not, it's just a different way of thinking.

900
01:22:34,323 --> 01:22:38,965
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so we need to address something outside of school or some other technique.

901
01:22:39,145 --> 01:22:39,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

902
01:22:40,345 --> 01:22:43,165
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly it's going to be based on the individual, right?

903
01:22:43,226 --> 01:22:45,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be personalized child to child.

904
01:22:45,906 --> 01:22:53,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I'm not making progress come fall, if a screener is given to me in September and before the next one's given,

905
01:22:54,286 --> 01:22:58,727
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to know, is this child making effective progress even before that screener is given?

906
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:04,649
[SPEAKER_00]: So it truly does depend on the child and how they're responding.

907
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you guys want to add more to that.

908
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:12,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just wanted to add to that that another piece of this is having the family be a part of this conversation, as you have brought in.

909
01:23:12,931 --> 01:23:20,133
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of what we would talk about with the parents during a parent-teacher conference would be to find out,

910
01:23:20,586 --> 01:23:27,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there also a family history of reading challenges in the family that would be something that would play into what the next steps are?

911
01:23:27,834 --> 01:23:29,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, we're looking at progress.

912
01:23:29,536 --> 01:23:32,999
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to see, does the child respond to the interventions?

913
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:35,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that is how you determine where you go next.

914
01:23:35,562 --> 01:23:36,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That's across the board.

915
01:23:37,064 --> 01:23:40,227
[SPEAKER_09]: We take data, we see what we're doing, and then we make the next steps.

916
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:45,331
[SPEAKER_09]: If we feel that the child needs to be assessed through special education, absolutely that will happen.

917
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:59,038
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that we have to look at this overall screener as a universal screener that we're using to get some idea of where our students are starting so that then we can provide interventions and see how they respond.

918
01:23:59,518 --> 01:24:01,379
[SPEAKER_09]: If those interventions are not working,

919
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:08,085
[SPEAKER_09]: then absolutely, we recognize that they might need specialized instruction, they might need an IEP, but that's not always the first step.

920
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:14,490
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be situations where we would jump right to doing an evaluation like that, but we have to take every case individually.

921
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:16,832
[SPEAKER_13]: No, and I completely understand what you're saying.

922
01:24:16,872 --> 01:24:19,334
[SPEAKER_13]: So my son is sick, for example, let's say he has a cough.

923
01:24:19,614 --> 01:24:20,655
[SPEAKER_13]: We take him to the doctor.

924
01:24:21,095 --> 01:24:25,619
[SPEAKER_13]: The doctor runs a battery of screens and maybe prescribes him an antibiotic.

925
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:29,202
[SPEAKER_13]: But if he's still sick in a number of other weeks, then we do other things.

926
01:24:29,622 --> 01:24:32,324
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no doubt what you're all trying to do.

927
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:37,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess one of the things that's not clear to me is the course by which it goes.

928
01:24:37,969 --> 01:24:39,250
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand it's certainly

929
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,232
[SPEAKER_13]: somewhat you play it by the kid, so each kid's a little different.

930
01:24:43,372 --> 01:24:44,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that.

931
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:50,076
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's important for me to understand that after, let's say, eight or nine months of intervention, we're not going anywhere.

932
01:24:50,476 --> 01:24:58,741
[SPEAKER_13]: There's sort of a stopgap or a necessitated next move that we have to make sure, because I mean... So we don't let it go that long.

933
01:24:59,081 --> 01:24:59,901
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you wouldn't.

934
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:01,222
[SPEAKER_17]: We look at each child as the

935
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:03,183
[SPEAKER_17]: women have said, individually.

936
01:25:03,863 --> 01:25:05,604
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we change our interventions.

937
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:11,768
[SPEAKER_17]: So we may work on a specific skill for about three weeks, and then we reassess.

938
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,029
[SPEAKER_17]: We do formative assessments all the time on our children.

939
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,370
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we change the intervention.

940
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:19,132
[SPEAKER_17]: These are professional people who know what they're doing.

941
01:25:19,732 --> 01:25:23,855
[SPEAKER_17]: So if this child needs an IEP, then we move in that direction.

942
01:25:24,555 --> 01:25:31,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess so as I'm talking to different people, there is the perception or belief or parents have this experience.

943
01:25:32,038 --> 01:25:38,521
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm trying to make sure that we don't have the experience where someone had to pay for their own assessment.

944
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:43,583
[SPEAKER_13]: They told the kids just a little has a little trouble with reading or will never be a novelist or something.

945
01:25:44,244 --> 01:25:47,285
[SPEAKER_13]: These are words the parents will tell me that was was told to their child.

946
01:25:47,765 --> 01:25:56,093
[SPEAKER_13]: They paid for an intervention, and now they're actually working with an outside consultant to make sure that that child has the help they need, and they're catching it in the sixth grade.

947
01:25:56,673 --> 01:25:57,514
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no doubt.

948
01:25:57,594 --> 01:25:58,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm a teacher myself.

949
01:25:59,095 --> 01:26:11,546
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand when you have a classroom of students, sometimes maybe their dyslexic kids can often be very bright and very good at hiding and shielding their certain inabilities.

950
01:26:13,088 --> 01:26:18,934
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I just want to make sure when I talk to this parent, I can say to them, well, these things won't happen anymore.

951
01:26:19,334 --> 01:26:27,062
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a new screening program and we have a new roadmap to making sure that kids get the process and the help that they need.

952
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:28,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make sense?

953
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:29,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So it makes sense to me.

954
01:26:29,545 --> 01:26:30,106
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that

955
01:26:30,945 --> 01:26:32,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Never say never, first of all.

956
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,187
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't go there.

957
01:26:33,608 --> 01:26:35,450
[SPEAKER_17]: But we are making tremendous progress.

958
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:35,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

959
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:37,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

960
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:38,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to make sure.

961
01:26:38,954 --> 01:26:40,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Madam Superintendent.

962
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:45,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I just wanted to weigh in to say that, again, this is new.

963
01:26:46,942 --> 01:26:52,889
[SPEAKER_12]: We are working cooperatively with the state, and this didn't exist before.

964
01:26:53,209 --> 01:27:01,218
[SPEAKER_12]: The screening mechanisms, I mean, they were there, but they weren't available to us in the capacity that they're available right now.

965
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:20,123
[SPEAKER_12]: If a teacher, a highly qualified teacher has a student that is displaying difficulty or there's a red flag that is alerted, after monitoring that student, we would definitely not allow that student to struggle for eight or nine months.

966
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:22,144
[SPEAKER_12]: We would definitely take the appropriate steps.

967
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:26,125
[SPEAKER_12]: However, at the same time, we have to be very careful

968
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:34,997
[SPEAKER_12]: because we don't want to automatically say a student has to go on an IEP or a student mislabel students.

969
01:27:35,457 --> 01:27:40,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we're trying to do the least restrictive, you try the least restrictive

970
01:27:42,668 --> 01:27:45,991
[SPEAKER_12]: efforts possible, I would say, at the beginning.

971
01:27:46,172 --> 01:27:51,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as you see a child needs additional support, we will definitely give the children support.

972
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:54,720
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that we are front-loading, we're partnering.

973
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:57,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Alexia wanted to partner with us.

974
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:26,916
[SPEAKER_12]: We are being proactive in getting the professional development done early, having these resources at our fingertips, so that when DESE makes the decision next year at the end of 20, school year 20, in the fall of 2020, that we will be in a very strong position to be able to say whether DESE says we're going with maps or we're going with Lexia or some other screener,

975
01:28:27,529 --> 01:28:39,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford Public Schools teachers in K-2 will have had solid training over the course of this entire year to be able to identify and work with those students.

976
01:28:39,874 --> 01:28:48,518
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do want to assure the school committee and our listening audience that we are taking this very seriously.

977
01:28:49,238 --> 01:28:51,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to acknowledge and really applaud

978
01:28:52,259 --> 01:28:58,043
[SPEAKER_12]: the work that's been happening with Associate Superintendent Caldwell, Dr. Chiesa, and Ms.

979
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Campbell, and Ms.

980
01:28:59,604 --> 01:29:08,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Champoli, the work that they've been doing, meeting for hours, really looking at the data, looking at what the best products are out there.

981
01:29:09,551 --> 01:29:16,616
[SPEAKER_12]: In response to a comment that Member McStone made earlier, asking why Lexia, are we just, you know,

982
01:29:17,276 --> 01:29:19,277
[SPEAKER_12]: where we just kind of recruited.

983
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:21,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Lexia is one of the top programs.

984
01:29:21,798 --> 01:29:31,543
[SPEAKER_12]: It is very expensive, if you remember me making an analogy a few months back about what version of the plan that we would want to go with.

985
01:29:32,363 --> 01:29:36,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Lexia is one of the costly brands, but it's also a good one.

986
01:29:36,925 --> 01:29:38,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what we can do is wait and see.

987
01:29:38,786 --> 01:29:44,449
[SPEAKER_12]: But we also have to wait on what the state tells us and take our final marching orders from the state.

988
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:46,950
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the meantime, we are being trained.

989
01:29:47,531 --> 01:29:58,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Our teachers are being trained and we are now looking at these early literacy assessments to be able to determine whether or not we have students that are showing

990
01:29:59,909 --> 01:30:00,770
[SPEAKER_12]: those tendencies.

991
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,190
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what the state wants.

992
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:09,353
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do want to say we're doing what the state wants us to do, and we're in a good position because we're doing it early.

993
01:30:10,193 --> 01:30:13,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And so next year, again, we will be in a much stronger position.

994
01:30:13,715 --> 01:30:18,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to really restate that, that we're not taking it lightly.

995
01:30:18,116 --> 01:30:19,357
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not sleeping at the wheel.

996
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:22,378
[SPEAKER_12]: We are very alert, very attentive to this.

997
01:30:23,058 --> 01:30:24,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is important.

998
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,744
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important for our students and we want to get it right.

999
01:30:27,225 --> 01:30:28,847
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is our time to learn.

1000
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,631
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our time to figure it out and get it right.

1001
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:33,835
[SPEAKER_12]: So a year from now, we will be

1002
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:35,800
[SPEAKER_12]: close to smooth sailing.

1003
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:36,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1004
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:41,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important to recognize I'm not other members that would like to ask.

1005
01:30:41,123 --> 01:30:43,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Well let me ask a few more questions member.

1006
01:30:44,165 --> 01:30:47,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to get a sense of the early assessments that have been taken.

1007
01:30:47,366 --> 01:30:56,472
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean can you give us a sense of what percentage of children have been identified with needs or certain deficits and reading skills.

1008
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:12,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we really can't, we haven't been able to go take a huge dive into the data because we just got that, we just got that PD from MAP last week about how to really interpret the scores.

1009
01:31:12,495 --> 01:31:15,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so yeah, it would be really great to hear an update.

1010
01:31:15,278 --> 01:31:16,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for all the hard work.

1011
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:18,681
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do appreciate it.

1012
01:31:18,701 --> 01:31:20,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's great that we're doing the screening now.

1013
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:21,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1014
01:31:21,826 --> 01:31:22,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1015
01:31:22,026 --> 01:31:22,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloot.

1016
01:31:22,366 --> 01:31:24,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1017
01:31:24,488 --> 01:31:25,168
[SPEAKER_16]: A couple of things.

1018
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:37,056
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, just as a comment, I think that my initial reading of this was I was almost a little disappointed, and people have touched on this, that we weren't doing the DIBLS 8 at one of our schools.

1019
01:31:37,176 --> 01:31:48,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Because just from a kind of common sense place of where we're sitting is, oh, that means that we're testing different assessment tools.

1020
01:31:48,911 --> 01:31:50,292
[SPEAKER_16]: and getting an idea of how they work.

1021
01:31:50,612 --> 01:32:01,479
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I did read carefully your sentence that you put in here about saying that you guys have truly looked at both of them and saw them to be comparable.

1022
01:32:01,579 --> 01:32:08,103
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but that's, you know, it's kind of almost a common sense that my initial reaction was saying, oh wait, they're not doing DIBLS-8?

1023
01:32:08,363 --> 01:32:10,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I thought we should be because we should be looking at all of them.

1024
01:32:11,785 --> 01:32:15,068
[SPEAKER_16]: The next thing is we were passing around the colored

1025
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:17,349
[SPEAKER_16]: places, pieces.

1026
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:21,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I wanted to know what you do for a child who's colorblind.

1027
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:24,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you first assess whether they're colorblind?

1028
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:32,028
[SPEAKER_09]: You would assess if the student is colorblind, and if you needed to do an alternate assessment, you can use object pictures rather than color pictures.

1029
01:32:32,148 --> 01:32:39,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, and with those, the students, the idea is how fast the students can read those?

1030
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:51,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct, so what you're testing there is you are looking to see how quickly a student can pull information out of their long-term memory, because if they're able to quickly access information in their long-term memory, it puts them at an advantage when it comes to fluency.

1031
01:32:52,472 --> 01:32:58,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they have difficulty with that, you know that it's harder for them to automatically pull things out of their long-term memory.

1032
01:32:58,935 --> 01:33:00,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a risk factor that you're looking for.

1033
01:33:00,736 --> 01:33:01,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1034
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,618
[SPEAKER_16]: And a student who's coming in who has been speaking a different language?

1035
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,959
[SPEAKER_09]: So I spoke with the EL staff about this.

1036
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,860
[SPEAKER_09]: They are able to take that test in their first language.

1037
01:33:10,721 --> 01:33:10,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1038
01:33:10,921 --> 01:33:13,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter what you're really labeling.

1039
01:33:13,562 --> 01:33:20,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a matter of just having something that you know is solid in the student's memory, and you're looking to see if they can access that quickly.

1040
01:33:20,506 --> 01:33:22,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not about the colors or the numbers.

1041
01:33:22,938 --> 01:33:25,259
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't know the colors, you wouldn't use them.

1042
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:27,260
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to pass that first page first.

1043
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:27,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1044
01:33:28,021 --> 01:33:28,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

1045
01:33:28,581 --> 01:33:45,570
[SPEAKER_16]: And my last comment really is, and this really comes from speaking to my own daughter recently, recently, and the whole question of dyslexic, and she is dyslexic and was not identified until really till older in high school.

1046
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:51,313
[SPEAKER_16]: But she said to me, well, mom, of course we should have known because I was always in the low reading group.

1047
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:59,040
[SPEAKER_16]: and made clear the pain of being stigmatized in the low reading group.

1048
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:13,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And here we're talking a lot about taking students and determining what they know can do and not, but it also opens up and raises the concern of saying that those kids then are grouped together as the poor readers.

1049
01:34:13,913 --> 01:34:18,617
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just, I don't know how we're doing that today, but Nicole.

1050
01:34:19,309 --> 01:34:20,990
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple different things with that.

1051
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:27,454
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we do have reading groups sometimes, but it's part of the literacy block.

1052
01:34:27,574 --> 01:34:43,624
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this particular piece, when we look at our intervention, every child is in a group, whether they're working on phonological awareness or CBCs, and they're all working with different teachers.

1053
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:46,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Lexia Core 5, the nice thing about that is

1054
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:54,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be on Lexia Core 5, and that's a computerized instruction, so I'm with a computer and it's playing fun games with me.

1055
01:34:54,857 --> 01:35:06,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be on Core 5 because I am a gifted reader and need some additional challenges, or I can be on Core 5 with my computer because I am struggling.

1056
01:35:07,765 --> 01:35:16,450
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to discern why you can't see what exactly, as another student can't see what the other child's working on.

1057
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:21,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very, very sensitive to that for a variety of reasons.

1058
01:35:21,605 --> 01:35:26,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually what you bring up is very important to me because I also know confidence.

1059
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:30,634
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we certainly don't want to put somebody who's already struggling with

1060
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,751
[SPEAKER_00]: additional confidence issues.

1061
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:36,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really, really careful with that.

1062
01:35:36,754 --> 01:35:37,435
[SPEAKER_00]: If that helps to.

1063
01:35:38,076 --> 01:35:39,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Just one last, because you brought it up.

1064
01:35:39,937 --> 01:35:45,902
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of the interesting things about my daughter, she can read on a computer screen much, much easier than she can read on a page.

1065
01:35:46,322 --> 01:35:52,627
[SPEAKER_16]: So how do we differentiate when we're giving a computer test for those kids for her who might struggle with the written page?

1066
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:58,111
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very glad you asked that, actually, because I was going to mention that earlier to one of the questions.

1067
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:03,619
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another reason why maybe somebody did poorly on Lexi Rapid.

1068
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:05,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it because of the computer?

1069
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:09,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it because of what you had, what you came in with when you're a kindergartner?

1070
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:25,923
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have other progress monitors and other assessments that we, quick ones that we can provide to make sure that this, let's say the Lexi Rapid, make sure it's not an inappropriate red flag to really weed out the kids that performed well.

1071
01:36:26,741 --> 01:36:27,542
[SPEAKER_00]: or struggle.

1072
01:36:27,602 --> 01:36:30,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I struggle because I'm just not good with the computer?

1073
01:36:30,345 --> 01:36:33,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another assessment I am quickly given just to make sure.

1074
01:36:34,329 --> 01:36:37,212
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as formative assessments and teacher observations as well.

1075
01:36:37,232 --> 01:36:39,775
[SPEAKER_00]: It all kind of plays into this bigger picture.

1076
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a piece of the puzzle.

1077
01:36:41,597 --> 01:36:42,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1078
01:36:44,264 --> 01:36:44,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1079
01:36:44,584 --> 01:36:44,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Kreatz.

1080
01:36:45,445 --> 01:36:45,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi.

1081
01:36:46,365 --> 01:36:47,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for your report.

1082
01:36:48,087 --> 01:36:52,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have one question, and I think Paulette maybe touched on some of it.

1083
01:36:52,269 --> 01:37:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just wanted to know, so can the LexiaCore be used for the upper grades if somebody's struggling or develops dyslexia in middle school or high school?

1084
01:37:03,077 --> 01:37:05,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And will they get the intervention that they need?

1085
01:37:06,099 --> 01:37:06,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Just checking on that.

1086
01:37:06,899 --> 01:37:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So LexiaCore 5 does go beyond second grade.

1087
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:10,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes.

1088
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:11,262
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

1089
01:37:11,322 --> 01:37:14,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that a parent, I received a message who mentioned

1090
01:37:14,605 --> 01:37:21,169
[SPEAKER_03]: we think that the Dibles 8 did cover the upper grades, Lexia Core will cover those students as well?

1091
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:36,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Lexia Core 5 covers the upper grades, whether or not, you know, who it's going to be available to, I don't think we've made a final decision, but it's certainly an option for upper grades.

1092
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, we're sure that Lexia is offering Core 5 to grades K to 2.

1093
01:37:41,843 --> 01:37:42,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I cannot say

1094
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:46,608
[SPEAKER_17]: with, you know, make a decision whether it would be for the upper grades.

1095
01:37:47,468 --> 01:37:47,888
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available.

1096
01:37:48,588 --> 01:37:49,089
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available.

1097
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:49,529
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available.

1098
01:37:49,549 --> 01:37:51,350
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know what company it's going to be.

1099
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:51,610
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1100
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:51,930
[SPEAKER_07]: All set.

1101
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:53,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1102
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:54,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1103
01:37:55,111 --> 01:37:55,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1104
01:37:56,192 --> 01:37:57,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to be brief.

1105
01:37:57,452 --> 01:38:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, when I saw this and I saw that we were only piloting two items, I was very happy because the less money we spend on assessment means more money that we might possibly have for intervention.

1106
01:38:11,438 --> 01:38:12,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, yay.

1107
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:18,525
[SPEAKER_06]: save a dime now so we can spend it later on actually making progress with students.

1108
01:38:19,105 --> 01:38:20,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a little different take than that.

1109
01:38:21,307 --> 01:38:36,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd also, at this point, like to make a motion that the district establish a consistent document that all parents receive after each testing just to be informed that their children, where they lied after, sorry.

1110
01:38:37,055 --> 01:38:39,498
[SPEAKER_06]: where they fell after each assessment.

1111
01:38:39,798 --> 01:38:50,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, the Columbus School, the wording is the same as the McGlynn School and at the Roberts School and every K through second, it's not teacher specific.

1112
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:53,534
[SPEAKER_06]: This teacher does it during report cards.

1113
01:38:53,874 --> 01:38:55,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like it sent out a form

1114
01:38:56,557 --> 01:39:07,042
[SPEAKER_06]: district-wide, consistency, everybody gets the same, and I request that in a motion form, and I'm looking for one of my colleagues to second that.

1115
01:39:07,062 --> 01:39:08,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we respond to that first?

1116
01:39:09,484 --> 01:39:19,429
[SPEAKER_09]: The reports at this point would be very different, and the scores that are produced by the two different screeners are very different, so at this time, that doesn't seem to be feasible.

1117
01:39:19,469 --> 01:39:23,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly something that after we make a decision following Dessy's recommendation,

1118
01:39:24,226 --> 01:39:27,491
[SPEAKER_09]: we could make sure that things are systematically the same across the district.

1119
01:39:27,531 --> 01:39:31,416
[SPEAKER_09]: But at this point, we have two different screeners that give us different information.

1120
01:39:31,777 --> 01:39:38,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the cover letter that goes with the results could be the same language and set up in the same format.

1121
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:46,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way understanding is, I just want that communication piece to be given to every parent after each screening.

1122
01:39:47,299 --> 01:39:50,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way we're consistent and we're consistent.

1123
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:53,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always been about consistency through the schools.

1124
01:39:54,647 --> 01:39:58,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that every parent receives it.

1125
01:39:59,344 --> 01:40:10,587
[SPEAKER_06]: after every screening and any progress or any red flags are identified there in a way that we use the same language for each school.

1126
01:40:11,087 --> 01:40:28,071
[SPEAKER_00]: May I just add, I think one of the things we do have to think about is, I think what can be done is at the Columbus, for example, every K through two child, the format of the report, what it's showing can be very consistent.

1127
01:40:29,218 --> 01:40:41,141
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an adaptive assessment, so you may get information on your second grader on comprehension that someone may not get as much on because the assessment adapts to the child's ability.

1128
01:40:41,721 --> 01:40:49,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it's gonna be very difficult to keep them consistent because they are two very different tests, if that makes sense.

1129
01:40:49,283 --> 01:40:52,844
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly the Columbus, the reports that the

1130
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,001
[SPEAKER_00]: The map report is fabulous, as I said, and it's very consistent in the information it provides.

1131
01:40:59,061 --> 01:41:01,323
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the child.

1132
01:41:02,143 --> 01:41:03,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not saying every.

1133
01:41:05,143 --> 01:41:06,484
[SPEAKER_06]: letter is gonna look the same.

1134
01:41:07,405 --> 01:41:13,248
[SPEAKER_06]: All the content is the same and the wording and the language that we're using as a district is the same.

1135
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: The district has provided three different opportunities to assess your children in reading, that type of a form thing.

1136
01:41:22,455 --> 01:41:25,156
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the results that we've received so far.

1137
01:41:25,236 --> 01:41:32,201
[SPEAKER_06]: We will update you again in the winter and in the spring and after each assessment

1138
01:41:32,563 --> 01:41:33,903
[SPEAKER_06]: a follow-up letter goes.

1139
01:41:33,983 --> 01:41:37,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So that type of generalization wording, not the specific thing.

1140
01:41:37,644 --> 01:41:39,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can do that.

1141
01:41:39,025 --> 01:41:44,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a motion on the floor to make sure that that happens for every school building in the elementary schools.

1142
01:41:44,566 --> 01:41:45,847
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a second by Mr. Ruggiero.

1143
01:41:46,107 --> 01:41:46,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1144
01:41:47,887 --> 01:41:48,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

1145
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:51,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

1146
01:41:51,348 --> 01:41:53,249
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a while.

1147
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:58,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Do any of these assessments have specific computer technology requirements?

1148
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:00,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1149
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:06,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And are those technology requirements consistent with what we already have, or?

1150
01:42:06,763 --> 01:42:06,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1151
01:42:07,563 --> 01:42:10,144
[SPEAKER_10]: So nobody's going to demand that we have 5,000 new iPads.

1152
01:42:10,164 --> 01:42:10,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

1153
01:42:11,645 --> 01:42:14,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've accounted in scheduling the assessment that it's mine.

1154
01:42:15,086 --> 01:42:15,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

1155
01:42:15,506 --> 01:42:15,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1156
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:18,427
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have headphones for all the kids, too.

1157
01:42:18,887 --> 01:42:20,708
[SPEAKER_17]: We ordered some additional headphones, but yes.

1158
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:21,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1159
01:42:21,872 --> 01:42:22,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1160
01:42:22,573 --> 01:42:23,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1161
01:42:23,594 --> 01:42:26,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to follow up on Paul's point.

1162
01:42:26,757 --> 01:42:36,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Is data collected about our students unbeknownst to them or is there any personalized information that Lexia will then harvest on our students?

1163
01:42:36,768 --> 01:42:37,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I assume they won't.

1164
01:42:37,649 --> 01:42:38,269
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope they won't.

1165
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:41,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's HIPAA compliant.

1166
01:42:41,473 --> 01:42:43,835
[SPEAKER_09]: The program is secure and HIPAA compliant.

1167
01:42:44,376 --> 01:42:44,476
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1168
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:57,058
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of, I just wanted to get one second because as we were talking about this letter that goes out to all parents, are the different areas of testing necessarily aligned between the maps and Lexia?

1169
01:42:57,098 --> 01:43:02,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I imagine like phonemes are in there somewhere and sentence comprehension is in there somewhere.

1170
01:43:02,762 --> 01:43:03,143
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's

1171
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:13,371
[SPEAKER_13]: broad areas that could be used when you send this report to parents and saying, we're concerned about sentence comprehension, but we're on it and we're focused on these particular materials.

1172
01:43:13,471 --> 01:43:14,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Could something like that be done?

1173
01:43:15,232 --> 01:43:21,717
[SPEAKER_00]: The report will very clearly spell out where the concerns lie and where the strengths lie.

1174
01:43:22,217 --> 01:43:23,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be done.

1175
01:43:23,078 --> 01:43:25,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is certainly overlap between the two.

1176
01:43:26,361 --> 01:43:32,145
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's differences, which is, I think, why DESE chose these as two of the choices for the grant.

1177
01:43:34,807 --> 01:43:35,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1178
01:43:36,188 --> 01:43:44,892
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motion on the floor for a standardized letter be sent home advising all the parents, family members that this testing is being conducted.

1179
01:43:45,733 --> 01:43:46,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Ms.

1180
01:43:46,393 --> 01:43:46,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Ruggiero.

1181
01:43:47,133 --> 01:43:48,514
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, all those in favor?

1182
01:43:49,715 --> 01:43:50,415
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1183
01:43:51,176 --> 01:43:51,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion's granted.

1184
01:43:52,016 --> 01:43:52,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1185
01:43:52,776 --> 01:43:57,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo?

1186
01:43:57,279 --> 01:43:57,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Ms.

1187
01:43:57,859 --> 01:43:58,319
[SPEAKER_07]: VanDekloot.

1188
01:43:58,339 --> 01:43:59,120
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1189
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,380
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1190
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:01,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1191
01:44:02,389 --> 01:44:06,871
[SPEAKER_07]: New business, vote on cleaning company contract, RFP summary and recommendation, Ms.

1192
01:44:06,911 --> 01:44:07,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Patterson.

1193
01:44:15,035 --> 01:44:24,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, so this is the cleaning company that services the high school and the McGlynn buildings in addition to our custodial staff.

1194
01:44:24,999 --> 01:44:28,221
[SPEAKER_04]: The current contract expires this year, November of 2019.

1195
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:43,460
[SPEAKER_04]: We did advertise through the city's procurement office under the request for proposal process, which incorporates not only the lowest cost, but it identifies the level of service.

1196
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:56,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It does a full review of the documents that are provided and reviews all of their references and experience levels so that it's not just a bottom line price that is under review.

1197
01:44:57,233 --> 01:45:03,479
[SPEAKER_04]: There were four addendums based on a site visit that the vendors had the opportunity to see both locations.

1198
01:45:04,339 --> 01:45:09,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did have the separate price and non-price proposals that were evaluated.

1199
01:45:09,104 --> 01:45:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 vendors submitted proposals.

1200
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:19,172
[SPEAKER_04]: John McLaughlin, Building and Grounds Director, and myself evaluated the non-price proposals separately.

1201
01:45:19,573 --> 01:45:24,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had our individual evaluations of the non-price proposals.

1202
01:45:24,761 --> 01:45:32,482
[SPEAKER_04]: and our own ranking identified two Holley advantageous vendors, which is Compass Cleaning and Complete Cleaning Company.

1203
01:45:33,483 --> 01:45:43,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The price proposals were opened at City Hall with the Procurement Office representatives Shahab Khan and Fiona Maxwell, and the pricing scheduled was attached to which identified year one, two, and three.

1204
01:45:43,805 --> 01:45:47,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, we are going with a base contract year that is for three subsequent years.

1205
01:45:49,165 --> 01:45:51,746
[SPEAKER_04]: They also provided a special cleaning category

1206
01:45:52,691 --> 01:46:00,933
[SPEAKER_04]: for large-scale cleaning if we requested that, and that's at the district's respective request on an annual basis.

1207
01:46:01,673 --> 01:46:04,774
[SPEAKER_04]: The lowest-priced proposal was provided by Empire Cleaning.

1208
01:46:04,854 --> 01:46:16,276
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it was noted that their overall cost was such an outlier, it was really not considered as relevant selection because their non-priced proposal was poorly ranked.

1209
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:23,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So John McLaughlin and myself made phone calls to the highest ranked vendors for recommendations and or concerns.

1210
01:46:23,152 --> 01:46:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: We did speak with multiple other districts and or municipalities that use both of the providers.

1211
01:46:32,615 --> 01:46:39,917
[SPEAKER_04]: The feedback was also provided by our building principals who have the current contractor, which is Compass, in relation to the

1212
01:46:40,484 --> 01:46:44,208
[SPEAKER_04]: level of service and response times for any concerns they might have.

1213
01:46:44,888 --> 01:46:59,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So with all of the information, the price components and the non-price proposal evaluation, it was our recommendation that the incumbent vendor, Compass Facility Services, be awarded the three-year base contract totaling $1,342,356 for the three-year cleaning contract.

1214
01:47:05,734 --> 01:47:08,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could ask just a quick question from the chair, if you'd all.

1215
01:47:09,176 --> 01:47:13,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Empire was not deemed highly advantageous before you opened the bids.

1216
01:47:13,278 --> 01:47:13,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1217
01:47:13,979 --> 01:47:17,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Based upon the information that they furnished.

1218
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:17,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1219
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:19,222
[SPEAKER_04]: On the non-price proposals.

1220
01:47:19,422 --> 01:47:27,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we had any issues with Compass over the course of the last year or two having to do with wages, wage theft, anything like that.

1221
01:47:27,106 --> 01:47:27,146
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1222
01:47:27,327 --> 01:47:28,567
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a clean record with that.

1223
01:47:28,627 --> 01:47:28,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1224
01:47:29,428 --> 01:47:29,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1225
01:47:30,488 --> 01:47:31,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

1226
01:47:31,149 --> 01:47:34,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1227
01:47:37,097 --> 01:47:38,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how to ask this delicately.

1228
01:47:41,539 --> 01:47:50,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Do the employees of Compass receive wages and benefits even remotely similar to our custodial staff?

1229
01:47:51,894 --> 01:47:54,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are through a separate contractor.

1230
01:47:54,976 --> 01:47:56,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not dictate those wages.

1231
01:47:58,038 --> 01:48:07,663
[SPEAKER_04]: They are CORI checked for anybody that will be working under our contract, but we don't dictate what those wages are.

1232
01:48:07,843 --> 01:48:13,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, it's facilitated by each company, and that's why we have separate evaluations for price and non-price.

1233
01:48:13,646 --> 01:48:15,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So in our RFP,

1234
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:21,033
[SPEAKER_10]: We have nothing in there that says they should make minimum wage.

1235
01:48:21,113 --> 01:48:22,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously, they make minimum wage.

1236
01:48:22,514 --> 01:48:27,058
[SPEAKER_10]: But they can have no health care benefits and make minimum wage.

1237
01:48:27,378 --> 01:48:29,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's perfectly allowed in the RFP.

1238
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can certainly share the RFP.

1239
01:48:31,841 --> 01:48:36,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can say that that's not the intent of the carriers or the vendors.

1240
01:48:36,645 --> 01:48:44,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, it's the opposite, because they are working very hard for retention and consistency with their staffing as well.

1241
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:54,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So much of what the proposals incorporated was their commitment to their staff, commitment to their employees on an ongoing basis.

1242
01:48:54,502 --> 01:48:56,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one of the criteria that was measured.

1243
01:48:57,184 --> 01:48:58,004
[SPEAKER_10]: It was measured.

1244
01:48:58,865 --> 01:48:59,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1245
01:48:59,626 --> 01:48:59,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1246
01:49:01,087 --> 01:49:01,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1247
01:49:01,387 --> 01:49:01,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostone.

1248
01:49:03,809 --> 01:49:05,330
[SPEAKER_20]: My question was similar to Paul's.

1249
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:11,134
[SPEAKER_20]: So we just take their word from their RFP that they pay their employees a living wage?

1250
01:49:11,946 --> 01:49:12,806
[SPEAKER_20]: A fair living wage?

1251
01:49:13,086 --> 01:49:15,247
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't say we pay our employees minimum wage?

1252
01:49:16,087 --> 01:49:19,167
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we do not request their timesheets in that capacity.

1253
01:49:19,227 --> 01:49:21,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a different type of a contract.

1254
01:49:23,228 --> 01:49:25,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a construction contract where we would request that.

1255
01:49:26,349 --> 01:49:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, if there was an issue, we would certainly want to be notified in that regard.

1256
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:35,311
[SPEAKER_07]: There are outside unions, though, that do watch this very closely.

1257
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:41,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had looked at it three years ago when we awarded the contract to them.

1258
01:49:43,629 --> 01:49:45,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Could they look at it again to make sure?

1259
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:45,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

1260
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:45,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, definitely.

1261
01:49:45,851 --> 01:49:52,356
[SPEAKER_07]: We received a three-page letter from, I believe it was SEIU, on this, on the bid and on the RFP.

1262
01:49:52,396 --> 01:50:02,323
[SPEAKER_20]: So when future RFPs for cleaning, can we put in the language that they use for contractor RFPs that we make sure that there is a living wage included in the RFP?

1263
01:50:02,343 --> 01:50:03,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a prevailing wage.

1264
01:50:04,305 --> 01:50:04,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1265
01:50:05,025 --> 01:50:05,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1266
01:50:06,046 --> 01:50:10,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, again, that's, we don't want to cost ourselves out of a service.

1267
01:50:10,649 --> 01:50:12,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That is part of what their proposal

1268
01:50:13,257 --> 01:50:19,861
[SPEAKER_04]: is based on, that they are looking at their wages, they are looking at the hours that they would need to be billable.

1269
01:50:20,521 --> 01:50:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So where their employees are not necessarily a full-time, the wages or the hours are comparable in that regard.

1270
01:50:28,645 --> 01:50:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So do I know exactly what an individual is earning, per se?

1271
01:50:33,027 --> 01:50:33,528
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

1272
01:50:34,068 --> 01:50:34,268
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1273
01:50:34,368 --> 01:50:37,710
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know you didn't ask, so you wouldn't have the answer, but moving forward,

1274
01:50:39,218 --> 01:50:43,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that could be cost prohibitive in terms of what we are.

1275
01:50:43,944 --> 01:50:51,174
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is for this shared role in terms of if we were going to utilize our own

1276
01:50:51,638 --> 01:50:56,600
[SPEAKER_04]: contracted rate, that would be a different context.

1277
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,082
[SPEAKER_07]: She's talking about a living wage as opposed to a contracted.

1278
01:51:01,482 --> 01:51:04,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all support living wage.

1279
01:51:06,744 --> 01:51:08,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll share the RFP with everybody.

1280
01:51:08,504 --> 01:51:10,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you can have a good analysis of what.

1281
01:51:11,065 --> 01:51:13,666
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, but it sounds like we didn't ask that question in the current RFP.

1282
01:51:13,686 --> 01:51:14,447
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what I'm saying.

1283
01:51:14,527 --> 01:51:20,869
[SPEAKER_20]: Moving forward, can we put in the RFP that you provide whether it's a minimum wage or a living wage

1284
01:51:21,724 --> 01:51:27,989
[SPEAKER_20]: But I mean, on a daily basis, we hear about how the cost of living in the city of Medford, no one can afford it.

1285
01:51:28,149 --> 01:51:33,473
[SPEAKER_20]: So it seems like we should be doing our part to have people who are working in our schools be able to have a living wage.

1286
01:51:34,934 --> 01:51:35,774
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll get off my soapbox.

1287
01:51:35,874 --> 01:51:36,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1288
01:51:36,215 --> 01:51:37,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfectly said.

1289
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:38,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1290
01:51:38,596 --> 01:51:39,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloot.

1291
01:51:40,078 --> 01:51:40,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1292
01:51:41,759 --> 01:51:49,044
[SPEAKER_16]: The increase, say, between the last year and this new year one, do you know what that is approximately?

1293
01:51:49,104 --> 01:51:49,404
[SPEAKER_16]: It's roughly 4%.

1294
01:51:50,646 --> 01:52:04,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's roughly 4%, and I assume that you budgeted when we approved the budget in the... I budgeted 3.5%, and this is a mid-year change, so I think we'll be right in line with that estimate.

1295
01:52:04,717 --> 01:52:04,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1296
01:52:05,638 --> 01:52:05,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1297
01:52:06,418 --> 01:52:06,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1298
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:09,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

1299
01:52:09,961 --> 01:52:12,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to beat this dead horse too much, sorry.

1300
01:52:13,684 --> 01:52:14,625
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, why not?

1301
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:18,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of what Ms.

1302
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:36,607
[SPEAKER_10]: McStone is saying also is like, you know, I mean, I don't know this company, and I have no reason to think they're anything but the most trustworthy company, but in a $1.4 million contract, what I'm trying to make sure is that it's not a million dollars for the owner, and then everybody else is like at the food pantry, and we don't.

1303
01:52:36,627 --> 01:52:46,530
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the structure of their bid is based on they have site supervisors, and they identify the number of employees that would be at each location.

1304
01:52:47,065 --> 01:52:52,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a very in-depth RFP provided, and I'm happy to share that with everyone.

1305
01:52:52,249 --> 01:52:52,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1306
01:52:52,629 --> 01:52:53,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

1307
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:53,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1308
01:52:54,651 --> 01:52:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1309
01:52:56,152 --> 01:52:56,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1310
01:52:56,772 --> 01:52:59,294
[SPEAKER_13]: We get the RFP in hand?

1311
01:52:59,895 --> 01:53:01,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I would advise that we do make a motion.

1312
01:53:01,956 --> 01:53:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I can send that out promptly, but we do need to take action on this because the contract is expiring.

1313
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,262
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motion on the floor at a table, which is undebatable.

1314
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:10,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second?

1315
01:53:12,384 --> 01:53:14,545
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a second on the floor by Mr. Benedetto.

1316
01:53:14,585 --> 01:53:16,547
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to table, roll call vote, please.

1317
01:53:23,017 --> 01:53:37,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes No to in the affirmative five in the negative the motion feels So we're going to be voting on a motion with a contract that we don't have in hand I

1318
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:51,631
[SPEAKER_04]: The information 1.5 million dollar contract was a thorough Summary of everything that transpired that was overseen by the city's procurement officer when when does this contract need to be approved?

1319
01:53:52,312 --> 01:54:02,062
[SPEAKER_04]: As I indicated it ends in November so we did everything as timely as possible to get this in line And we have gone through the extension process so given that we don't have as many

1320
01:54:03,331 --> 01:54:08,075
[SPEAKER_04]: committee meetings, we are hopeful that we can get this approved and line them up for a current contract.

1321
01:54:08,135 --> 01:54:13,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I would much rather have another committee meeting than before approving a $1.3 million contract.

1322
01:54:14,499 --> 01:54:17,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just voicing my opposition.

1323
01:54:18,662 --> 01:54:19,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1324
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:19,803
[SPEAKER_07]: DiBenedetto.

1325
01:54:21,664 --> 01:54:32,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just wondering when was the last time we did a cost analysis as to moving this in-house and hiring people from our community to take on

1326
01:54:32,731 --> 01:54:35,394
[SPEAKER_06]: some of these tasks as opposed to outsourcing?

1327
01:54:36,155 --> 01:54:39,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we have custodial staff.

1328
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:46,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we done any looking at the cost savings by outsourcing this?

1329
01:54:46,766 --> 01:54:49,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And could we get that kind of information?

1330
01:54:50,929 --> 01:55:04,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought if we can give MedFed people or surrounding towns people jobs with benefits and we can get this work done through hiring people within our community, it's a great opportunity here.

1331
01:55:06,695 --> 01:55:08,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And year after year, it goes up and up.

1332
01:55:08,696 --> 01:55:11,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And when was the last time we stepped back and say, what do we actually need?

1333
01:55:12,057 --> 01:55:18,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And can we hire people either part-time or full-time and provide benefits and expand our workforce?

1334
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just look at it as a possible win for the community.

1335
01:55:22,361 --> 01:55:31,570
[SPEAKER_06]: by providing jobs, so I don't know, I haven't seen that data since I've been here for eight years, so I just thought it was appropriate time to ask for that.

1336
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:42,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And even if not for this contract, I'd like to see that and make a motion for that to happen, even if we have to move forward with this contract, so that way the committee looks at this

1337
01:55:43,169 --> 01:55:47,092
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe we do a one-year contract while we look into this, I don't know.

1338
01:55:47,432 --> 01:56:02,883
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just, if we have an opportunity to give someone a job that lives in Medford, in our schools, that takes pride in our buildings and in our students, and it's cost-effective or close to it, I would love to see that happen.

1339
01:56:03,023 --> 01:56:03,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1340
01:56:03,603 --> 01:56:03,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1341
01:56:03,803 --> 01:56:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson?

1342
01:56:04,824 --> 01:56:10,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can identify that we have increased our custodial staff to the extent

1343
01:56:11,018 --> 01:56:17,881
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been something in place that has been agreed upon with our Teamster group, the union.

1344
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:28,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have been in partnership with that, and based on what an initial projection is, that this would be a cost savings over a three-year period.

1345
01:56:28,606 --> 01:56:32,428
[SPEAKER_06]: When was that last reviewed is my question, and can we review it again?

1346
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:39,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think at this juncture, we've already been, as I indicated in the budget process last season,

1347
01:56:40,353 --> 01:56:43,034
[SPEAKER_04]: that this was due coming up this fall.

1348
01:56:43,074 --> 01:56:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've been in that timeframe and looking at that as the goal, not a cost comparison.

1349
01:56:49,437 --> 01:56:54,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in a bit of a time crunch in terms of having some service at all.

1350
01:56:55,039 --> 01:57:03,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, failure to act on this at this point could leave us without cleaning at the two buildings.

1351
01:57:03,846 --> 01:57:10,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally agree, and it is last minute, and as I was sitting here, that's what came to mind, and that's why I'm bringing it forward.

1352
01:57:10,995 --> 01:57:12,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm requesting is

1353
01:57:13,444 --> 01:57:37,424
[SPEAKER_06]: by December, we get a cost analysis, and maybe we move forward now, but in the future, we have that data, and more recent, and then I won't be on this committee at that point, but the committee will have data and information as to whether they wanna keep going with outsourcing, or if we wanna provide good jobs for good people who live in MedFed, and that's what I would hope that this committee does.

1354
01:57:37,445 --> 01:57:39,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information?

1355
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:55,577
[SPEAKER_16]: To my colleague, it would make more sense for you to make the motion that prior to the next implementation or prior to the next time contract that we do a study.

1356
01:57:55,957 --> 01:58:01,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Because to do it in December, well now, then another two and three quarter years are going to pass.

1357
01:58:02,601 --> 01:58:18,295
[SPEAKER_16]: So the information will be current, but if you make the motion that prior to the next time we go out to renew the contract, we do that cost analysis between in-house and out-house or outside, that would make much more sense.

1358
01:58:18,355 --> 01:58:19,757
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I could ask you to reword it.

1359
01:58:19,777 --> 01:58:22,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to make a motion at this time.

1360
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:23,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1361
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Mayor.

1362
01:58:25,442 --> 01:58:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1363
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:40,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to make a motion that we approve this contract for our annual contract instead of a three-year, and that cost estimate be done prior to the end of our negotiations at the end of that.

1364
01:58:40,026 --> 01:58:44,428
[SPEAKER_07]: If we don't accept the three-year contract, then this will, if we just take one year, then it won't.

1365
01:58:45,149 --> 01:58:46,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It nullifies the process.

1366
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:48,631
[SPEAKER_07]: We requested a three-year contract.

1367
01:58:50,273 --> 01:58:50,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1368
01:58:50,493 --> 01:58:50,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Kloot.

1369
01:58:51,913 --> 01:59:04,436
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing I just want to remind my colleague is that, while I understand that it sounds great to say, well, we want to give Medford people jobs, this company may be employing Medford people.

1370
01:59:05,176 --> 01:59:06,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know who the employees are.

1371
01:59:07,177 --> 01:59:12,918
[SPEAKER_16]: I do know that there were multiple employees who have already worked for the company.

1372
01:59:13,098 --> 01:59:16,239
[SPEAKER_16]: And so to just, you know,

1373
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:36,094
[SPEAKER_16]: While it may sound great, that statement may sound great, I think it's superficial because the fact of the matter is that there are probably people, I know that we have gotten good feedback on the employees, and I'd hate to just put them out of work because we had some other thought of, oh, Medford people.

1374
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:37,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, maybe they are Medford people.

1375
01:59:39,076 --> 01:59:40,356
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little more complex than that.

1376
01:59:40,376 --> 01:59:42,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval of the three-year contract?

1377
01:59:43,037 --> 01:59:44,157
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a motion for approval.

1378
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:45,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Ms.

1379
01:59:45,078 --> 01:59:46,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanderkloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1380
01:59:46,538 --> 01:59:46,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1381
01:59:46,618 --> 01:59:47,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanderkloot.

1382
01:59:47,058 --> 01:59:58,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to make an amendment to that motion and add that a study be done prior to the next three-year, the end of this contract.

1383
01:59:59,056 --> 02:00:03,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do it as a B paper, because the contract should stand on its own, and then we can move your motion.

1384
02:00:03,379 --> 02:00:03,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

1385
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,202
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a second, which Ms.

1386
02:00:06,222 --> 02:00:06,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Vandekloot did.

1387
02:00:07,383 --> 02:00:10,525
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, on the main motion, roll call vote, please, Madam Secretary.

1388
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1389
02:00:21,019 --> 02:00:21,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1390
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:22,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1391
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:28,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes and on the B paper by Ms DiBenedetto, seconded by Miss Van de Kloot.

1392
02:00:28,986 --> 02:00:29,707
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

1393
02:00:30,568 --> 02:00:31,228
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed.

1394
02:00:31,408 --> 02:00:32,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1395
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:33,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1396
02:00:34,721 --> 02:00:39,022
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a motion to go into executive session by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloet to discuss negotiations and legal matters, in particular, the top and first union ratification of the collective bargaining agreement and the food service negotiation update.

1398
02:00:50,285 --> 02:00:51,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

1399
02:00:52,025 --> 02:00:52,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Secretary.

1400
02:00:54,386 --> 02:00:54,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1401
02:01:02,797 --> 02:01:09,179
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be leaving from executive session opening up in 207 and then leaving from there.

1402
02:01:09,219 --> 02:01:10,180
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not return here.

1403
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:11,060
