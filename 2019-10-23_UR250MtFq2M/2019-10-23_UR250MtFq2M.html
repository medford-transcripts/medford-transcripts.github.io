    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=209.302s">Okay,</a>  so on <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=217.648s">I</a>  was showing them writing pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=221.311s">On</a>  page 10 of 15, Method High School, the amount of $10,034.31. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=225.433s">It</a>  just seems high. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=229.496s">Is</a>  there any regulation? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=239.703s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=241.464s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=242.765s">And</a>  on that same page further down, it says, <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=246.121s">Fillion</a>  associates other supplies in the end when you add them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=251.328s">It's</a>  nine thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars and ninety three cents That's the what</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=261.667s">That's</a>  out of a revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=264.368s">So</a>  I can look up what exactly those would cover.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=266.709s">It's</a>  just all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=268.71s">It's</a>  just other supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=270.091s">I</a>  just was curious what they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=272.732s">If</a>  you could email us, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=275.653s">And</a>  then... <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=280.649s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=282.03s">On</a>  page 12 of 15, Groundmaster Corp, for $390, it was unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=289.954s">I</a>  just was wondering, I'm assuming it's some kind of landscaping, but I just was wondering where and why it wasn't classified. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=298.579s">It's</a>  the Edgerly Field, so that's just the title of the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=302.702s">And</a>  then further down on page 13 of 15, <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=307.979s">The</a>  pool service company, it was almost, you know, a little more than $2,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=312.501s">Was</a>  there a problem with the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=316.722s">Because</a>  I think the pool was closed once. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=318.383s">Closed</a>  for a couple of days.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=319.663s">These</a>  are for chemicals on a routine basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=322.284s">Oh,</a>  that was routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=323.165s">So,</a>  and the fill in supplies is the same program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=325.826s">I</a>  can just get you a summarized list of what was purchased.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=330.527s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=331.247s">And</a>  thank you for <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=333.564s">Thank</a>  you for all the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=334.765s">I</a>  appreciate you always answering them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=336.747s">And</a>  the pool was just closed for a few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=338.948s">They</a>  just changed the chemicals and reopened. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=341.55s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=342.231s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=343.632s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=401.955s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=402.895s">This</a>  past weekend featured perfect fall weather, and many events were held outside that our students and families could enjoy, including the Harvest Your Energy Festival, the McGlynn Middle School's PTO Yard Sale, and the Brooks PTO Annual Fall Fest. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=421.044s">However,</a>  the weather last Thursday was not so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=425.236s">with</a>  the high winds and heavy rains. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=428.058s">I'd</a>  like to thank many people who worked on behalf of keeping our schools smooth functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=434.744s">I'd</a>  like to recognize John McLaughlin and the Building and Grounds Department, the Medford Police and Fire Departments, the City's Department of Public Works, and Eastern Bus Company, who working together made it possible for the schools to safely remain in session that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=452.315s">Despite</a>  the weather on Thursday, Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School held the eighth grade open house. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=460.039s">The</a>  Karen Theater was filled with students and parents and guardians, and there was standing room only space. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=466.122s">High</a>  school student ambassadors led tours all over the campus, including the science labs, the fine arts department, the library media center, the vocational technical programs, and the athletic wing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=480.151s">where</a>  all the sports teams were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=482.693s">I'm</a>  glad that so many of our rising 8th graders and their families were able to attend this important informational session. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=491.078s">I'm</a>  also pleased to announce that two of our Medford High School students, Lang and Qing Cheng, twin sisters, each received $500 from the Pace family and the FAA USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=504.312s">the</a>  Federazzini Associazioni Abruzzi to celebrate Italian Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=513.795s">To</a>  be considered for the scholarship, the students had to write an essay describing their experiences with Italian culture and language. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=521.917s">The</a>  students plan to continue to study the Italian language in college and hope to travel to Italy someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=529.239s">Congratulations</a>  to the both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=532.952s">I'm</a>  also pleased to announce that due to the efforts of Molly Layden, our Director of Technology, Library and Media, who applied for a Makerspace grant through the Verizon Foundation, the Medford Public Schools was selected and we will be awarded $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=549.967s">So</a>  it came in after the announcement, so we'll <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=554.871s">presented</a>  formally at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=557.312s">This</a>  grant will enable Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School to create a shared STEAM makerspace to be used by core academic subjects and CTE programs that will enable academic and career preparation connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=575.316s">Students</a>  and teachers in multiple programs and courses will use the makerspace <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=580.307s">to</a>  plan, design, create, and synthesize projects using interdisciplinary project-based learning to solve and engage in STEAM activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=592.233s">This</a>  is a long-time goal of this department and the Medford Public School District. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=597.416s">Molly</a>  will be in attendance, as I said, at our next meeting to explain the full process in more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=603.059s">In</a>  the meantime, we thank Verizon for choosing us and commend Molly for applying for the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=610.842s">Also,</a>  recently, Casset, Inc., in collaboration with the Sons of Italy, welcomed students in honor of Italian American Heritage Month, which is the month of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=622.809s">Students</a>  were invited to create a booklet on the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci, which celebrated his life and his works. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=632.774s">The</a>  winners of the essay contest were hosted at this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=636.618s">Casset</a>  Inc. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=637.379s">is</a>  a non-profit educational and professional organization that promotes Italian language and culture in public and private schools throughout New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=646.567s">As</a>  you are aware, Medford is one of the schools who partner with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=651.211s">Medford</a>  took home second and third place awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=654.986s">First</a>  place went to Our Lady's Academy, fourth grade in Waltham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=659.088s">The</a>  students were awarded $250. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=661.53s">Our</a>  second place students were from the Brooks Elementary School, the fifth grade class. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=668.333s">They</a>  were awarded $200. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=669.654s">And</a>  I'd like to say a special thanks to the teachers, Jennifer Conte, Laura Odegardi, and Principal Suzanne Galussi. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=679.938s">Our</a>  third place winners were at the McGlynn Elementary School, fifth grade classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=684.562s">And</a>  I'd also, they were, the students were awarded $150. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=687.404s">And</a>  special thanks to the teacher, Debbie Notaro, and principal, Diane Garino. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=694.769s">Just</a>  a reminder to everyone that this Wednesday, October 23rd, Medford High School will be hosting both the planning for college information session <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=704.605s">for</a>  students with IEPs and on 504s and their parents or

href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=725.663s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=726.744s">Thank</a>  you very much, Madam Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=731.82s">Could</a>  I have a motion on the floor to resume community participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=734.742s">Moved</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=736.243s">Krebs,</a>  seconded by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=737.745s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=738.505s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=739.066s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=740.286s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=744.59s">Your</a>  name and address, please.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=747.321s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=751.044s">I</a>  just came to, I wanted to speak about the bus two at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=755.888s">My</a>  daughter is a sixth grader at the McGlynn, and we've had a few issues with that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=761.433s">One</a>  of the issues is the bus is at the Andrews, so the McGlynn students walk over, and last Friday in the wind and the rain, by the time they walked over, the bus was full, and the kids had to sit three and four across. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=773.823s">That</a>  seems to be a regular Friday occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=776.946s">Right</a>  now, the bus is slightly full during the week because the cross-country team, which has 40 members right now, they're not riding the bus on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but I anticipate that that will become an issue at the end of the month when that season ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=791.864s">A</a>  couple of times she's been denied access to the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=795.267s">One</a>  time she was diverted to a different bus and taken on a ride to Winthrop Street to Goldilocks Bagels, at which point she was on the phone with me telling me she didn't know where she was and I could hear about six or seven other children in the background screaming, don't leave us here, we don't know where we are, don't leave us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=813.207s">They</a>  were returned to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=815.53s">I</a>  called, I didn't know at the time that it was not going to the McGlynn, it was going to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=820.275s">I</a>  called the McGlynn and spoke to the secretary who was going to try to page Mr. Tucci, but by the time they got him, the children had been deposited at the Andrews and told that they were on their own and to walk home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=833.332s">At</a>  that point they walked across Riverside by themselves, across Salem Street by themselves to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=839.636s">There</a>  was a handful of kids, luckily one of them was an 8th grader, the rest of them were 6th graders who were shocked in the second week of school to find themselves walking home alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=850.002s">So</a>  they've already moved one stop off of this bus to another bus because of overcrowding But it's continuing to be an issue that we've called Several times asked them to to track and monitor, but they don't ask the children to sign up which bus they're going on so It's kind of a guesstimate how many kids will be on the bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=869.63s">But</a>  I think when winter comes it's going to be more of an issue a couple of kids said that they're sitting on other kids laps Because they're told they can't stand, but there's nowhere for them to sit <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=878.689s">So</a>  it's a real crowding issue.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=882.526s">I</a>  can definitely I can definitely look this is the first time I'm hearing it so it was not Brought to my attention and you said it was bus number two.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=891.434s">It's</a>  bus number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=892.515s">It</a>  goes on downtown Street I've reported it to the principal a few times and I was really upset when they the couple of times that they had to walk home So, okay, so I will definitely be able to follow up with the bus company tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=905.667s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.167s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.408s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=906.748s">I</a>  appreciate very much Thank you</p>

    <p>[Carnival]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=924.511s">Hello,</a>  Mayor Burke, Superintendent and School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=928.732s">Jody</a>  Driscoll could not make it tonight, so it's just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=932.732s">I'm</a>  actually going to read what you all have, because that's what I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=940.922s">The</a>  Morton and Spopari Family Foundation has provided funding for the Medford High School to support the Blanding's Turtle Headstarting Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=948.527s">This</a>  is the first year the Morton and Spopari Family Foundation has selected to fund this project for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=954.672s">The</a>  total funding for the grant is $2,205.72. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=956.073s">In</a>  2015 to 2016 school year, participation in the Blanding's Turtle Headstarting Program began at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=968.069s">Participation</a>  provides high school students and community members an opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the maintenance of viable populations of at-risk and endangered native species in the Northeast Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=980.355s">The</a>  turtle head starting success rate is that <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=983.447s">Turtles</a>  have about a 40 times greater chance for reaching their 14th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=988.77s">I</a>  know it's some random numbers for you, compared to those born in the wild. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=993.972s">I</a>  would like to recommend that the school committee accept the grant funding.</p>
