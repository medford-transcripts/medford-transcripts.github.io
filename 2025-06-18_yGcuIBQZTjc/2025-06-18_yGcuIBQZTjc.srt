75
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:08,608

00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:13,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

115
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:21,137
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's no further questions, I'll just go on to number two.

116
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:23,899
[SPEAKER_17]: It's our CCSR annual report.

117
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,681
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to turn it over to Rich Trotta and our student representatives.

118
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,364
[SPEAKER_15]: May I just make one comment before that happens?

119
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:37,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So I do want to just say this is a long agenda for this evening.

120
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,849
[SPEAKER_15]: So I do want to just say for Dr. Talbot and Ms.

121
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:41,309
[SPEAKER_15]: McNiff,

122
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:47,184
[SPEAKER_15]: It's up to you, but don't feel you need to remain on the call.

123
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:53,067
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that you have things that you're finishing up in your districts before you transition to us here in the summer.

124
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,790
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Trotto is on the line and he will be giving an overview this evening.

125
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:07,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do wanna say moving forward, there has been a lot as we all know, as we're trying to finish up ending this school year.

126
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,435
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot has gone into the meetings for

127
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,512
[SPEAKER_15]: for the last few school committee meetings.

128
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:24,958
[SPEAKER_15]: It is our intention that the CCSR report has student representatives with them, little difficult to do that virtually and on the last day of school.

129
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:34,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Trotta will talk through the overview of the work that's happened this year, as well as a video of students.

130
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:40,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year, we'll make sure that these reports have our student representatives in person.

131
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:53,478
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, Mr. Trotta, is he able to unmute?

132
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:56,839
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, good.

133
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, first of all, thank you for allowing me to present the work of the students.

134
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,103
[SPEAKER_21]: This is basically about students.

135
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:09,925
[SPEAKER_21]: The program does more than that, but the focus primarily is about

136
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:15,040
[SPEAKER_21]: what students have done with their advisors to make the world a better place.

137
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:22,886
[SPEAKER_21]: So I have passed on through Dr. Galusi the reports.

138
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:26,008
[SPEAKER_21]: They're pretty comprehensive, so I'm not going to go through those.

139
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:30,031
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just going to do some highlights, and then we can watch a couple of presentations.

140
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:34,515
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, I want to thank Dr. Galusi and the central office staff for their support.

141
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:40,253
[SPEAKER_21]: It's nice to have that kind of support when you're running a district-wide program.

142
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:50,519
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank the building principals for their help, school committee members, thank you for supporting us, faculty and staff, the advisors that we have.

143
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,904
[SPEAKER_21]: In particular, I want to thank Janelle, Golan, Mackenzie for doing such a great work in coordinating some of the projects and supporting all the other advisors.

144
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:03,847
[SPEAKER_21]: So the students,

145
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:19,717
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the things that we'll see in the pamphlet or the report that I just gave you is some testimonials, particularly by Jonah Siegel, who was the president of the CCR at Medford High School.

146
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,560
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to thank the major benefactors.

147
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,484
[SPEAKER_21]: The Cummings Foundation, which is over the period of since 2014, has provided us with $406,000

148
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:35,158
[SPEAKER_21]: grant money.

149
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now we're on a 10-year grant, which will carry us through 2030.

150
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:45,063
[SPEAKER_21]: The grant is worth $350,000.

151
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:56,429
[SPEAKER_21]: The Crystal Campbell Betterment Project has donated over the years approximately $150,000, and the Bloomberg Philanthropies donated $50,000.

152
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,550
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are the major benefactors.

153
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,391
[SPEAKER_21]: There's others in the booklet, the report that you can look at.

154
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:04,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Next page.

155
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:18,773
[SPEAKER_21]: So since 2013, approximately 3,000 students have participated in CCSR with over 700 projects over a 12-year period.

156
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:27,936
[SPEAKER_21]: This year, some of the highlights are the Summer Art Studio that Susan Fee ran last summer and is going to be running it this summer.

157
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,978
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's funded through Cummings Foundation, a special grant of $10,000.

158
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:41,154
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a poetry contest and two students won the contest, Kalia Diligent and Haley Celestin.

159
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:46,135
[SPEAKER_21]: So those two high school students were the winners and got a small award for that.

160
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:51,517
[SPEAKER_21]: We've developed a professional library for faculty and staff that's located at the high school.

161
00:12:52,937 --> 00:13:00,619
[SPEAKER_21]: We also had a donation for Crystal Campbell, a donation, a dedication to Crystal Campbell Memorial Gardens that was spearheaded

162
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:08,352
[SPEAKER_21]: by Marta Cabral, the principal, and along with Rebecca McKenzie, who does all the maintenance and care for the center.

163
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:16,658
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's a very brief highlight in addition to the reports that you have.

164
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:24,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I just want to go right to the project portfolio, which is really perhaps the most important thing.

165
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,185
[SPEAKER_21]: In fact, it is the most important thing.

166
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,788
[SPEAKER_21]: And to give you a quick overview, we've provided a short video

167
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:34,757
[SPEAKER_21]: And that'll be followed by another short video of student testimonials.

168
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Together, the two of them run approximately eight minutes or so.

169
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,103
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we'll take some questions.

170
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:44,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, if there's background music maybe we need to press the the allow volume that's maybe the problem.

171
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:49,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm not sure there is.

172
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:55,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think there's supposed to be audio, but otherwise we can just look at the pictures, that's fine too.

173
00:15:55,457 --> 00:16:01,722
[SPEAKER_17]: I just saw Dr. Galusi put in the chat that there's supposed to be audio music, but either way is fine.

174
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:04,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't want people to think that there was narrative.

175
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:11,071
[SPEAKER_15]: We just wanna make sure we have the audio for the next video, which is from the students.

176
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't want people to think they were missing audio.

177
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:20,228
[SPEAKER_19]: You probably need to reshare it to get the audio and there's a box to check when you share.

178
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Say that again, Erica, sorry.

179
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:30,779
[SPEAKER_19]: You probably need to re-share and then in the share window, there's usually a box to check.

180
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:36,264
[SPEAKER_19]: No, not, sorry, not sharing from Google, sharing on Zoom.

181
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

182
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Nicely done.

183
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,369

[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Nathan Quinn and I'm a member of the CCSR club.

188
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:23,886
[SPEAKER_07]: My role within the CCSR is the president which means that I organize meetings and I help facilitate projects and I run the social media and the website and I mentor other students.

189
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:32,770
[SPEAKER_13]: My role in the club is vice president and that means I help Jonah who's the president with like setting up the meetings and

190
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,571
[SPEAKER_13]: organizing everyone's project.

00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm treasurer of the CCSR.

192
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:44,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I help like the flow of like meetings and like basically I help like organize or like help other students like with their projects.

193
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,759
[SPEAKER_13]: The CCSR is the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

194
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:59,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It's across all schools in this district but for Medford High it's an after-school program that encourages students to lead their own projects for community betterment.

195
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:04,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically just a club that helps like beautify the community through acts of like community service.

196
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:09,983
[SPEAKER_01]: A club where you get to do projects with your friends and help make a difference in your community.

197
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:13,588
[SPEAKER_12]: DCSR, it's just a place where people come together to help people.

198
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:21,659
[SPEAKER_12]: We make amazing projects that either focus on feeding the homeless, clothing the homeless, or spending time with elders.

199
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,721
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a really great community and club.

200
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:26,705
[SPEAKER_13]: The club's mission is to make the community a better place.

201
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:39,253
[SPEAKER_07]: The CTSR's mission is to make a positive difference on the community around us and to teach students that they can make a positive difference too, regardless of their age or their interests or anything else.

202
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,875
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have something that they think they can change in the world, they can do it.

203
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:46,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The club's mission is just all about community service.

204
00:19:46,617 --> 00:20:02,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I've led the Medford Mystic River and Parks cleanup, where we organize volunteers to clean up trash around the Mystic River and our city's parks to prevent pollution and keep the city safe for us and the animals in it.

205
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:12,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of co-led a project with Kira Tramble and Jonah, Kathleen, and Magdello.

206
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:19,462
[SPEAKER_11]: We went to a nursing home and we basically did like arts and crafts with the elderly there.

207
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,583
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been in two projects this year.

208
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:26,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been in a hygiene drive with Nathan Quinn and Julia San Antonio.

209
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:30,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Another project I've been involved in is the winter clothing drive.

210
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:36,872
[SPEAKER_12]: We collected clothes like hats, mittens, and we also collected some toiletries there as well.

211
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:41,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We collected health supplies and toiletries for families in need.

212
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:53,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I really like it's a great community everyone's so nice and fun and it's always a good time every meeting and Jonah really makes it a fun time especially like with the Instagram there's a lot of fun Instagram reels.

213
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:08,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that it's like a very like welcoming group of people like I always feel like very comfortable with people in the club and it's just like something I can go to and like I just like want to talk to my friends and like you can do good and also like have fun.

214
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:12,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I just love how everyone comes together to help people.

215
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:18,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I really think that's a beautiful mission and it really just shows how everyone cares about everyone.

216
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:24,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that in CCSR I get to hang out with friends but also make a change in the community.

217
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:30,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that the CCSR really promotes the mindset that we can be the change we wish to see in the world.

218
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I would definitely say join the club.

219
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:43,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, I'm kind of late in the game because I'm just joining my junior year, but I really wish that I had joined earlier because it's a really fun place where you can just hang out with your friends and do things to help the community.

220
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:48,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone should join the CCSR and also join the National Art Honor Society because it's so much fun.

221
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:50,063
[SPEAKER_13]: You can make murals around the school.

222
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:52,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I would definitely say join the club.

223
00:21:52,846 --> 00:22:00,832
[SPEAKER_12]: It's made me a ton of friends and it was a great way to get involved with high school and also just be so much more appreciative of what I have.

224
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:07,618
[SPEAKER_07]: You should join the club because it's satisfying to make a difference in the community around you and you all need community service hours to graduate.

225
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing CCSR since elementary school and I really enjoy it.

226
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,322
[SPEAKER_01]: You should join the club.

227
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:13,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Join the club.

228
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:14,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Join the club.

229
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:16,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Join the club.

230
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:17,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, join the CCSR.

231
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:18,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay, yay.

232
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:19,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Join.

233
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:40,581
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, I just want to thank Janelle, Golan, Mackenzie for putting together the slide video, and then the vocational film and video class put together that short video.

234
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:47,903
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I want to thank you again for allowing me to present the work of the students, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

235
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:52,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Trotter.

236
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:54,948
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate the presentation and the slideshow.

237
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:56,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham, I see your hand up.

238
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm just not finding the raise hand feature.

239
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

240
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll relocate myself before the meeting's over here.

241
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:11,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we had talked, it may have been like a year or two ago now, about the declining enrollment in CCSR.

242
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:19,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wondered if you could talk to us about the number of students participating this year versus years past.

243
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, it's pretty much the same.

244
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:28,081
[SPEAKER_21]: The place where we lost the biggest population was the high school.

245
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:34,326
[SPEAKER_21]: The K-8 program was a typical year.

246
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:43,214
[SPEAKER_21]: One school had, I think, the McGlynn Middle had some like 80 or 90 students.

247
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:46,857
[SPEAKER_21]: So the population is steady and stable.

248
00:23:48,748 --> 00:24:01,320
[SPEAKER_21]: What happened was we had a big drop off at the high school after an advisor left a few years ago, Michael Skorka, because he was a super advisor and drove in a lot of students, up to 100 students.

249
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,581
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was the biggest difference.

250
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:14,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what's the plan to not just say it's because we lost an advisor, but to replenish the numbers of the students participating?

251
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:17,085
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's not to say that.

252
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:18,386
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very disappointing.

253
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:21,148
[SPEAKER_21]: The key is we have to get an advisor.

254
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:27,632
[SPEAKER_21]: And I worked with the principal, Marta, and we haven't had, haven't fallen yet.

255
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:30,814
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year we had an advisor, but she was new.

256
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:34,076
[SPEAKER_21]: And actually Joe and his team did the bulk of the work.

257
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:41,401
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to make it more popular and have more students, but it's a voluntary thing.

258
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:45,144
[SPEAKER_21]: So we try to make it attractive and we hope to get an advisor.

259
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So the advisors are all unpaid?

260
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:50,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you're saying?

261
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:52,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just trying to understand.

262
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:52,999
[SPEAKER_21]: They get a stipend.

263
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:54,139
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what the grant pays for.

264
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:59,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Each advisor gets over $2,000 for being an advisor for the year.

265
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:07,803
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've, over the years, increased it to $2,500 for working with the students for one year.

266
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:10,343
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's about as high as we could go.

267
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:15,185
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a limited budget, so I can't offer too much more.

268
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:17,588
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the best we can do.

269
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:21,691
[SPEAKER_21]: And like I said, case away, we have pretty much set for the next year as well.

270
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,733
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're really hoping to get something from the high school.

271
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:28,777
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't have an advisor for the high school yet next year.

272
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:29,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?

273
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:30,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Not yet.

274
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:31,619
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

275
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,900
[SPEAKER_21]: The people mostly come back.

276
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,421
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

277
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:34,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

278
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

279
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa.

280
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:45,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

281
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just wanted to, I think the, um.

282
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:59,005
[SPEAKER_02]: The voluntary aspect to clear up for anyone who might have heard that is at least from my perspective of advising students and seeing, you know, at least the college level students is.

283
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,608
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for the last 2 years, students have been faced with the.

284
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:10,003
[SPEAKER_02]: split decision of do I go to sports or do I work?

285
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:16,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for them to do volunteer work, you know, it can become a little tricky, especially if, you know, they're helping work with their family.

286
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:23,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to give, you know, commendation to Mr. Trotta and the whole team for doing this work.

287
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:25,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, project based learning is huge.

288
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:29,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've seen such amazing things for the district come out of this.

289
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just happy to see that the great work is continuing and

290
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just wanted to give my thanks to Trott and the team.

291
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:39,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

292
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:45,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, member Dunbar.

293
00:26:47,802 --> 00:27:00,075
[SPEAKER_17]: And no questions, I'll just, if I may speak from the chair, I too really hope that we get an advisor if we have to shift around funding in any way to be able to pay a teacher that may be interested.

294
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:01,816
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's vitally important.

295
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:08,103
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we had over 200 students in CCSR only a couple years ago, and I think

296
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:13,265
[SPEAKER_17]: the program is just so amazing and our high school students in a way need it the most.

297
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:26,051
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just advocate for really trying to get that position filled, providing a support system for the officers that we just saw on the video or those to come next year that may be replacing those officers.

298
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

299
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:28,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, one more point.

300
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,794
[SPEAKER_21]: We have 371 students this year.

301
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:34,195
[SPEAKER_21]: The max we had was maybe

302
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,750
[SPEAKER_21]: 100, maybe less, at the highest amount in 12 years.

303
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,452
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not dramatically down.

304
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:47,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said before, we need some from the high school, and I would appreciate anyone's help in doing that.

305
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:52,180
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been trying to get somebody, but it can't.

306
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody has to volunteer for it, and there is a stipend that goes with it.

307
00:27:58,085 --> 00:27:58,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

308
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:14,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just like digging through the recently done teacher's contract and this is one of the stipends that I believe sits outside of the teacher's contract because it is paid via a grant.

309
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct, Dr. Glucy?

310
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:18,467
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

311
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:26,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess maybe a programming note for CCSR is that we have dramatically shifted

312
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:35,223
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for the better the stipends that we are offering both for athletics and for extracurriculars and.

313
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:50,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps the CCSR team may want to look at what we did as a model for what we believe is needed for the kind of support and dedication that we expect of advisors, because it is a lot of work, particularly for this program.

314
00:28:51,732 --> 00:29:00,358
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things we did in the contract, which is available on our website, is we introduced a tier structure to the academic

315
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:08,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and extracurricular stipends that sort of talk about, like, the intensiveness of the activity so that there's some.

316
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:15,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'll say tearing for lack of a better word of the kinds of clubs and activities and what they require.

317
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:32,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So that may be a good place to look to say where does this fit and is the current set of stipends enough or is there somewhere else in the CCSR budget that we could pull from to make those positions more appealing, especially as we have shifted the rest.

318
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:34,509
[SPEAKER_10]: So that number may.

319
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:41,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I think used to probably be well in excess of what we were offering for many of our extracurriculars.

320
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:43,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just may no longer be that.

321
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:49,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So we may need to take a look at that and figure out grant-wise where funding can come from to do that.

322
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:51,233
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

323
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:54,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Just on that point, we have a budget.

324
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:58,154
[SPEAKER_21]: And the money that we get every year pretty much covers everything.

325
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:02,755
[SPEAKER_21]: And the vast majority, most of it, like 90% of it, 80% of it goes to stipend.

326
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:06,113
[SPEAKER_21]: pretty much maxed out there.

327
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:09,735
[SPEAKER_21]: But if someone could add more money, I'd be happy to use it.

328
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:14,998
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do have a budget that we have to keep to.

329
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:17,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

330
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:26,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would welcome a funding proposal or a recommendation or a request that we feel like would address this.

331
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:28,143
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe we can take that up in the fall.

332
00:30:28,283 --> 00:30:42,550
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think this is where, as the person who is the main stipend holder and knows the most about the grant and the funding available, we would welcome your recommendation about what is needed.

333
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,171
[SPEAKER_10]: and perhaps there are other people in the community who might be willing to fund something like that.

334
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:51,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think a recommendation from you would be very impactful.

335
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's great.

336
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:53,853
[SPEAKER_21]: I would be happy to do that.

337
00:30:54,494 --> 00:30:54,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

338
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:01,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Trotta.

339
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,297
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate the presentation and the slideshow.

340
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:06,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you again.

341
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:07,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

342
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:22,030
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to go to number three, yellow bus transportation and electrification timeline recommendation to approve five-year contract comprised of three years and to one year.

343
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:31,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to turn it over to Noelle Velez, director of finance and Brenda Pike, planning development sustainability planner from the city.

344
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:33,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

345
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:35,936
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you everyone for joining us today.

346
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:46,424
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so here we have today is the RFP that we sent out back in March regarding our school bus and our transportation.

347
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:57,632
[SPEAKER_23]: When we sent it out, we had sent out a very detailed report regarding what the needs of the school district was currently and what we felt the needs might be in the next upcoming years.

348
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:02,916
[SPEAKER_23]: And we got back one bid currently, Eastern Bus.

349
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:22,037
[SPEAKER_23]: They offered some prices to us regarding both late pickup, daily charter buses for sports, athletics, and also including our day-to-day operations of morning pickup and after school drop off.

350
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:32,641
[SPEAKER_23]: Also here we have Brenda Pike from the city side to talk a little bit about electrical buses and a place we'd like to go to in the future and kind of

351
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:40,083
[SPEAKER_23]: how we as a school district and the city can work together to really manifest this vision and idea.

352
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so just a quick update.

353
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:53,586
[SPEAKER_05]: We were awarded a grant for free technical assistance from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to create a school bus electrification plan.

354
00:32:54,746 --> 00:33:01,087
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been working with VEIC and Energetics for a few months now, and they've assessed our current conditions and needs.

355
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:06,004
[SPEAKER_05]: The full analysis will be available this fall, but they have some initial recommendations.

356
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:26,413
[SPEAKER_05]: They're recommending a phased approach with four electric buses replacing diesel buses in the next five years to be housed at Eastern Bus's Malden location, and then replacing the rest of the school fleet in two more phases over the next 10 years and housing them at the high school, incorporating chargers for them into the new high school design.

357
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:40,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are multiple possible ownership models for this, including third party owning and operating the buses, Medford owning the buses and a third party operating them, or Medford owning and operating our own buses.

358
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:52,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Initial financial analysis shows that the electric buses cost almost twice as much as comparable diesel buses, but with existing grants and incentives available to the city,

359
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:58,146
[SPEAKER_05]: the 10-year capital operations and maintenance costs can be less than diesel buses.

360
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:04,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But we just wanted to let you know today that this report is being developed, and we'll have more information for you this fall.

361
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:08,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Brenda.

362
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

363
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:10,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Brenda.

364
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a quick question.

365
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:16,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So I realize it's a cart before the horse a bit in some of my questions.

366
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, could we own buses that are housed at Eastern Bus?

367
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:24,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an actual option?

368
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:30,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a possibility.

369
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:35,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's something that's been included in this current RFP.

370
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:41,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have to be an amendment if that was something that we, if we got a grant and decided to do that in the future.

371
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:56,279
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, because even adding four, we have had a lot of conversations, I think, for at least six years now about adding some electrification at our schools.

372
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,501
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to do a carport with solar.

373
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:01,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do that.

374
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:03,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought all kinds of.

375
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: When we upgraded all of our equipment for our kitchens, we bought all this electric stuff because the school committee has decided we don't want to buy carbon-based equipment.

376
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:26,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we had to ship it all back because the building doesn't support that much power use and neither did the utilities at the street.

377
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,342
[SPEAKER_04]: While we could certainly probably afford the utilities inside the building,

378
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Us having to pay for National Grid to upgrade their grid, frankly, is a wildly expensive endeavor, if I remember correctly.

379
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:47,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So will your plans include the fact that National Grid isn't ready wherever we want to put it?

380
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:49,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we wanted to put more electric chargers

381
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to put them in different places in the schools.

382
00:35:53,139 --> 00:36:09,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have one or two in, we have one in most schools, but there are other areas we just couldn't put one, because there's not, the electrical systems that are not meant for public schools, electric systems, are not ready for the amount of power required.

383
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:16,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I use, I have two EVs myself,

384
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:19,168
[SPEAKER_04]: My electric bill is startling.

385
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:24,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm all for that, because I also don't have any carbon output.

386
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:31,880
[SPEAKER_04]: But the costs to run them and to install the equipment is one thing.

387
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,082
[SPEAKER_04]: But National Grid doesn't seem ready.

388
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So will your reports or analysis include if they're going to have to pay for it?

389
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:42,690
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to pay for it, which I think is ridiculous.

390
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:59,713
[SPEAKER_05]: We're already in talks with National Grid about the capacity at the high school location, and they've indicated that they don't see any capacity issues, at least in this initial assessment that they did, and they can do a more in-depth one as we move forward.

391
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:06,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly when we build a new high school, I expect there would be lots of utilities work to support a new building.

392
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point, sure.

393
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But anything before there's a new high school, I think, is where I'm concerned about.

394
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we going to charge these?

395
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:22,133
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those costs are being factored into that financial analysis that we'll see this fall.

396
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:23,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

397
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:27,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, members.

398
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:27,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

399
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:29,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

400
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally found the raise hand feature.

401
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:45,397
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do recall at a school committee conference at 1 point in time that there were electrification programs out there that did require school districts to take ownership of the buses.

402
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was, like, a lease out of the buses.

403
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't necessarily like.

404
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:59,076
[SPEAKER_10]: A contract issue, particularly, but it was like, we would own the buses and essentially lease them out to whoever is driving the buses.

405
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:05,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's any number of ways that the electrification piece of this could happen and.

406
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:09,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, there's a lot of costs associated with the electrification of buses.

407
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:23,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sort of inclined to ask us to send this to subcommittee now so that when you're ready for that media discussion, like there's a place for that discussion to happen that can be dedicated to this, because obviously there's a lot of planning involved.

408
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:30,608
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sort of thinking about that, and I'm happy to make a motion to do that if my colleagues don't have other questions.

409
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,029
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also...

410
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:39,153
[SPEAKER_10]: In reading this report, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the bid.

411
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:50,397
[SPEAKER_10]: So the bid, we would be entering into a three-year contract, and there would be options to extend that contract for one-year terms for a total of five years possible.

412
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,578
[SPEAKER_10]: But those are at our option at a later date.

413
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:53,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

414
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,019
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, that is correct.

415
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also only got one bid.

416
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:00,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

417
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, that is correct as well.

418
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:11,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think I'm not really expecting that we have a big, huge audience here tonight on the last day of school.

419
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:25,246
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that's important to say out loud as much as we can, particularly on the heels of the year where we had to ask Eastern Bus to come visit us at school committee because they did not have enough drivers.

420
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:28,748
[SPEAKER_10]: So our options are extraordinarily limited.

421
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,928
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just a problem here in Medford.

422
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:40,451
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a problem across the state that the Mass Association of School Committees has asked the legislature to take up in terms of increasing competition.

423
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:46,752
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot going on in that space that does sort of limit our choices.

424
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:58,635
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am happy to see that we were really thoughtful in how we put this bid out so that we have options, including things like late buses, including things like add alternates for

425
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:01,418
[SPEAKER_10]: electrification, et cetera.

426
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:09,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we have a lot of options to leverage this contract in the bid that will serve us well for the coming years.

427
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:20,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm also happy and I will make a motion now to accept the recommendation to approve the contract as described.

428
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to approve the contract as described by Member Graham.

429
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:31,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

430
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:37,774
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that you might have moved your lips, Member Ruseau, but you're muted.

431
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:39,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I did move my lips.

432
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:41,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for noticing.

433
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:44,195
[SPEAKER_17]: I did second that, yes.

434
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:48,096
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

[SPEAKER_04]: Remember her rifle?

450
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:05,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

451
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,038

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mayor Lingo.

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes 70 affirmative zero in the negative paper passes.

455
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:16,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Um are.

456
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there other questions?

457
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:21,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Or should I make my motion about moving the

458
00:41:30,192 --> 00:41:40,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to make a motion to refer the electrification of school buses and the report being prepared for the fall to the strategic and capital planning subcommittee.

459
00:41:41,158 --> 00:41:41,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

460
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,760

[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

468
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember all the potty?

469
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:56,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

470
00:41:57,063 --> 00:41:57,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Member right help?

471
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:58,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

472
00:41:58,904 --> 00:41:59,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Member.

473
00:41:59,264 --> 00:41:59,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, Maryland.

474
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:00,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

475
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:01,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

476
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,627
[SPEAKER_17]: 70 affirmative zero negative.

477
00:42:04,307 --> 00:42:05,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Paper has been moved to subcommittee.

478
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:17,596
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Lucy interim superintendent to go over the rate card early pickup track for after school programming.

479
00:42:18,897 --> 00:42:19,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

480
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:31,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and I do know that we have Director Megan Fidler-Carey on the call, and she, I'll just give a brief overview, and then if we have questions, I know she's here as well.

481
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,152
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we've come before the body before.

482
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:42,398
[SPEAKER_15]: We, you approved the rate card for the tuition for the afterschool program.

483
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:48,003
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that we did discuss when we came to talk about the,

484
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,902
[SPEAKER_15]: enhancement of the afterschool program in our

485
00:42:53,308 --> 00:43:02,131
[SPEAKER_15]: work to increase capacity, one of the ways in which we're hoping that that can be done is with this early pickup time.

486
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:15,215
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we presented to this body before, on the April 14th meeting, we are here to talk about what the rate would be for that early pickup time.

487
00:43:15,335 --> 00:43:19,616
[SPEAKER_15]: So through survey results from families, it was

488
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:27,201
[SPEAKER_15]: The survey data showed that people would be more open to the early pickup time of 4 p.m.

489
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:33,444
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be about 75 minutes after the new dismissal time for elementary schools.

490
00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:35,245
[SPEAKER_15]: So there'd be a 4 p.m.

491
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:36,966
[SPEAKER_15]: pickup time and then a 6 p.m.

492
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:37,606
[SPEAKER_15]: pickup time.

493
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:44,630
[SPEAKER_15]: You have, excuse me, approved the rates for the 6 p.m., so it's the yearly rate of 500, 5,000, no,

494
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, $533 for a monthly rate, daily rate of $29.64.

495
00:43:51,557 --> 00:43:53,738
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just the prorated option for that, 4 p.m.

496
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:57,500
[SPEAKER_15]: pickup time would be $205.20 for a monthly rate, and that's $11.40 for a daily rate.

497
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,201
[SPEAKER_15]: So they just took the

498
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:16,102
[SPEAKER_15]: 6 p.m.

499
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:18,103
[SPEAKER_15]: time and prorated it to the 4 p.m.

500
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:18,424
[SPEAKER_15]: time.

501
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:25,210
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're looking for approval for that, but if you have any questions prior to approval, please let us know.

502
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:31,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld and Member Ruseau.

503
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:33,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau was first.

504
00:44:35,243 --> 00:44:38,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, you were first on my screen, so I was just trying to remember.

505
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember Rousseau, then remember Reinfeld.

506
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:42,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Zim will get this right someday.

507
00:44:43,926 --> 00:44:50,788
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, what if everybody opts for, financially, what happens to the program if the vast majority of people choose the 4 p.m.

508
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:51,148
[SPEAKER_04]: slot?

509
00:44:53,789 --> 00:45:00,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't want to just have a careless answer to say that I don't think that that will be happening, but the way that

510
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:18,817
[SPEAKER_15]: director Fiddler Carey went about this was she surveyed the current enrolled families she surveyed the families that are on the waiting list and so she's going to take that tiered approach to rolling this out with families as well so

511
00:45:19,757 --> 00:45:22,778
[SPEAKER_15]: the first option will be families that are currently enrolled.

512
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And that will, she'll give a window of time for that.

513
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:35,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And then she'll move to families that are on the wait list before we kind of open it up broadly to newer families.

514
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:38,842
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't, yeah, I don't know if that answers my question.

515
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:39,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

516
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:39,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

517
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:42,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And my other question was $9 an hour is

518
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think kind of outrageously low.

519
00:45:55,961 --> 00:46:08,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can't get anything for $9 an hour unless you, I mean, you'd have to travel thousands of miles to find anything for $9 an hour, thousands of miles.

520
00:46:08,544 --> 00:46:10,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what I think about this.

521
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we have done comparisons to other places, but

522
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:20,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm just really stuck on $9 an hour.

523
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:23,612
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just, I can't get past it.

524
00:46:23,632 --> 00:46:25,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll let other people speak, sorry.

525
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:29,296
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Reinfeld and Member Grant.

526
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:30,897
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

527
00:46:31,117 --> 00:46:34,580
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to ask how this maps to our staffing.

528
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:41,445
[SPEAKER_19]: I know part of the motivation for this model was that we thought that we could have more flexible staffing opportunities.

529
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:45,849
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I just wanted to make sure that was proportional here and that

530
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:56,062
[SPEAKER_19]: the people who are on the clip shift till 4pm working, they're still being paid at the same rate as the people in 6pm.

531
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:56,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

532
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:11,526
[SPEAKER_19]: And so this proportionally maps to what we need to pay our staff to run this program, presumably with more people in the early shift and fewer people overlapping in the later shift.

533
00:47:12,946 --> 00:47:13,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

534
00:47:14,387 --> 00:47:14,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

535
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:18,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

536
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:19,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

537
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:24,578
[SPEAKER_10]: This survey that you did, how did it, what were the results?

538
00:47:24,618 --> 00:47:35,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Like how many people said, what percentage of respondents said, I would do this version if it was available versus people who said I would not do this version if it was available.

539
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,084
[SPEAKER_10]: What were the results?

540
00:47:38,764 --> 00:47:42,546
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to defer to Director Fidler-Carey.

541
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:46,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, thank you, school committee.

542
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:50,556
[SPEAKER_22]: So we gave it out, and we gave a couple of different times.

543
00:47:50,856 --> 00:48:00,864
[SPEAKER_22]: And for the earlier pickup time, about 30 people responded that they would be interested in the earlier pickup time from the respondents.

544
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:08,450
[SPEAKER_22]: What was interesting, though, was how many people followed up afterwards with an email.

545
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:14,635
[SPEAKER_22]: After filling out the survey, they emailed saying all of the different options that they would be willing to consider, which I thought was very interesting.

546
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:25,822
[SPEAKER_22]: And just really liking the idea of the earlier time, because a lot of them, you know, especially a couple of our teachers are saying, like, they just need that little extra bit of time.

547
00:48:25,922 --> 00:48:28,204
[SPEAKER_22]: So they did explain that directly.

548
00:48:28,524 --> 00:48:31,106
[SPEAKER_22]: But it was about 30% of the respondents.

549
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:31,106
30%?

550
00:48:32,587 --> 00:48:33,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

551
00:48:33,568 --> 00:48:35,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, got it.

552
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:36,891
[SPEAKER_10]: That's helpful.

553
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:44,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do know that lots of people had feedback about that survey in terms of the nature of the questions.

554
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:57,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hopeful that the Afterschool Task Force can help us just get a little bit more precise on some of those communications before they go out in the future so that we're not causing agita.

555
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:00,319
[SPEAKER_10]: We were intending to ask a very simple question, and people got

556
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,469
[SPEAKER_10]: pretty wrapped up around like, if I answer this the wrong way, am I going to lose my spot?

557
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Which was not our intention at all.

558
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that for sure.

559
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's important.

560
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:18,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think I agree with Member Ruseau about the very, very low price.

561
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:29,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think one of the things we have to consider is that when we're offering this shorter version, there is stuff that is still just as much.

562
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:34,283
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just as much management.

563
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:35,744
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just as much payroll.

564
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we have people who will be late.

565
00:49:40,923 --> 00:49:48,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Necessarily like easy so easy to say it's 1 3rd of the work because there is still like, there's like.

566
00:49:49,368 --> 00:49:55,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of the fixed aspect of what this is going to look like to be able to support this program, which is like.

567
00:49:56,653 --> 00:50:01,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Adding a layer of complication, I still think it's like a really good idea.

568
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:11,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would like to see the price go up to be like, instead of just an even 3rd, like, I would, I would personally like to see it be about half of what full option is.

569
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:22,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think there's a tremendous amount of work that is going to have to be done to manage this separate strand.

570
00:50:23,078 --> 00:50:26,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to be completely seamless.

571
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we just need to account for that in terms of what our infrastructure is going to require to do that.

572
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:38,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Graham.

573
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:43,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody want to respond, or I'm going to go to?

574
00:50:44,368 --> 00:50:44,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

575
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:45,729
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know if you were going to.

576
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:55,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that that is fair, and I think that's a pretty accurate summary of what we have been having internal conversations about as well.

577
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:59,721
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'm hearing is to raise it to $15.

578
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:07,988
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be very comfortable with that, but I'll let my colleagues chime in.

579
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:11,280
[SPEAKER_17]: And when we say $15, Dr. Guzzi, you mean $15 an hour?

580
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:11,880
[SPEAKER_15]: For a daily rate.

581
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,100
[SPEAKER_15]: No, for a daily rate.

582
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,880
[SPEAKER_15]: A daily rate of $15.

583
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it, okay.

584
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:22,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if, okay, so member Ryan fell, member Intoppa, then member Ruseau.

585
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:35,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I was going to agree and note that the financial aid is still available for families who need that, which seems reasonable as a,

586
00:51:36,882 --> 00:51:39,763
[SPEAKER_19]: reminder that that's happening as well.

587
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:45,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you remember I felt member and tapa.

588
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:48,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

589
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:56,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I understand why we want to pardon me,

590
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:05,773
[SPEAKER_02]: If part of me feels that the administration says they can do it with 11 or whatever, I'm sorry, the number's right here, 1140.

591
00:52:06,214 --> 00:52:14,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how, I mean, I understand it's, I don't want to say just 15, but I'm curious to see how that works.

592
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the administration says 1140, we could support off 1140.

593
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:26,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why, I mean, I understand why we want to raise it to 15, but I would be more in support of the 1140 number as opposed to the 15, just because I know that,

594
00:52:27,255 --> 00:52:39,397
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge pain point for our families, and this may help bring some new folks in, and I understand there's financial assistance, but I don't know.

595
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,658
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of my two cents on it.

596
00:52:41,978 --> 00:52:42,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

597
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:52,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau and Member Graham.

598
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:58,616
[SPEAKER_17]: just send yourself members so thank you.

599
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:00,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm new to the zoom thing.

600
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:12,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about, you know, I know we have team leads, and I forget if that's the title that that director for the carry has for her staff, but we will have.

601
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:18,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, inherently, there will be more staff that is part of this equation.

602
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be more physical bodies that are employed by Medford Public Schools.

603
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:29,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And there will be people who will say, I can work that 245 to 4, but I can't work till 6.

604
00:53:30,137 --> 00:53:30,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's great.

605
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:31,958
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have those people.

606
00:53:31,998 --> 00:53:33,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to increase capacity.

607
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But are you going to also have to have more team leads, or whatever it is that you call them?

608
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:42,003
[SPEAKER_04]: They get paid more than?

609
00:53:42,743 --> 00:53:44,103
[SPEAKER_04]: those folks who are not team leads.

610
00:53:45,144 --> 00:54:03,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is the intention to, I mean, I know it's early days, so I know some of this is a bit hard to nail down right now, but is the intention to put more on the existing set of team leads, or is it to add additional team leads where needed?

611
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And how much, how has that cost been considered?

612
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:12,882
[SPEAKER_22]: Megan, do you want to, yeah.

613
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:15,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'll take this one.

614
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:31,566
[SPEAKER_22]: The way that we are envisioning this for the space is that this early shift will be, it will be more of a kind of concentrated big program where the students assemble, they get their healthy snack, they get some homework done, and then they go play.

615
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,526
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's not as much movement.

616
00:54:34,126 --> 00:54:39,488
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not the sort of the enrichment model that we have for the rest of afterschool.

617
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:41,388
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the full three hours and 15 minutes.

618
00:54:42,108 --> 00:54:48,176
[SPEAKER_22]: This is more the one hour and 15 minutes condensed version so they'll be all be really in one place so we'll only have one lead.

619
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:59,050
[SPEAKER_22]: We call them group leaders, so we'll have one group leader for that whole early shift, and then supports for as many students again we like to keep that one to 10 ratio.

620
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:12,077
[SPEAKER_22]: So as many as we end up being able to fit with the space provided and the need, and then that group leader would stay on and go support the later shift group afterwards.

621
00:55:13,118 --> 00:55:13,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

622
00:55:13,558 --> 00:55:16,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to ask my second question rather than going all the way around again.

623
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:21,065
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the threshold for financial assistance?

624
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:34,924
[SPEAKER_22]: So we, I mean we offer financial assistance based on the determinations of the city that they use for their community development block grant to determine low income, and so families can get 30 or 50 or 70% off.

625
00:55:38,443 --> 00:55:42,565
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and we do get funding from the community development block grant.

626
00:55:42,685 --> 00:55:47,868
[SPEAKER_22]: We're getting nearly $10,000 this year, um, that once it's finalized, we'll present to you.

627
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:55,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, we have also applied for some funding for McKinney-Vento families, and that would allow some students to come at no cost to them, obviously.

628
00:55:56,313 --> 00:56:03,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but then otherwise, it's just a sort of a dent, and we gave, uh, about $45,000 in financial assistance this year.

629
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:05,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

630
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:06,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

631
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:24,197
[SPEAKER_10]: How many more students do we anticipate being able to admit under with this additional strand?

632
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, we're starting them all out to have it be one kind of group.

633
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:40,090
[SPEAKER_22]: And remember, we keep our groups to the 26 mark, which is what the EEC uses the 1 to 13 ratio, 1 to 10 ratio.

634
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,013
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we had two adults with that, so we're starting with that.

635
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:53,842
[SPEAKER_22]: But if we find that there's a flood at the Brooks and Roberts, which I imagine we will get, those are our two biggest programs, then we'll look at the space and see if we can double that.

636
00:56:55,031 --> 00:57:02,434
[SPEAKER_22]: and get that to, if there's a need, if there's an ask for 50 kids for the four o'clock pickup, I think we can make that work with the space.

637
00:57:02,454 --> 00:57:10,998
[SPEAKER_22]: We've already started conversations with the principals to let them know that this was an idea that we're thinking about and for them to think about how that will work in their afternoons.

638
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:15,701
[SPEAKER_22]: And certainly our site coordinators, for them to think about how that'll work in the afternoons.

639
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:20,583
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think if we have the cafeterias, we can do that.

640
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:27,783
[SPEAKER_10]: So are you saying it's like an extra 26 kids per building?

641
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:29,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you're saying?

642
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:30,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

643
00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:36,590
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mean, I'm not sure how much bigger than the 26 we'd get until we have staff fully confirmed.

644
00:57:37,611 --> 00:57:41,835
[SPEAKER_22]: I think then we could sort of, we always will keep positions posted.

645
00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:46,158
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we can get another staff, then we can let in the more kids that go with the staff member.

646
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:46,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

647
00:57:46,498 --> 00:57:47,759
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think the difference,

648
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:58,552
[SPEAKER_10]: But this program will allow us to make a pretty big jump of 25-ish kids.

649
00:58:00,354 --> 00:58:03,117
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we're hoping so, because I know that some kids

650
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:08,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Some families, they've said that they just need that extra little push.

651
00:58:09,055 --> 00:58:19,243
[SPEAKER_22]: And we've had staff that have said, you know, staff that work during the school day that have said, like, I can't stay all the way till six, but I could give an extra hour at the end of the day.

652
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:26,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think my other question is, this is a five-day option.

653
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:34,817
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not splitting that hair further to say there's two-day options and three-day options and four-day options, but this is just a five-day option.

654
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:36,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

655
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,361
[SPEAKER_22]: We thought we would.

656
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:38,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, looking to

657
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:43,465
[SPEAKER_22]: best practices in other districts where we learned about this option.

658
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:48,047
[SPEAKER_22]: They do offer a two day and a three day option, but it's fixed.

659
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:56,350
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not like we do in the after school where you can pick like a Tuesday, Wednesday, and then that means we have to find somebody who wants to do the Monday, Thursday, Friday.

660
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:02,512
[SPEAKER_22]: We said we could do a three day option that's Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or a two day option that's Tuesday, Thursday.

661
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:05,614
[SPEAKER_22]: Just trying to think about what's best for more families.

662
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:12,279
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's how we're envisioning it.

663
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:16,080
[SPEAKER_22]: We're also very mindful that we wanna kind of take this thoughtfully.

664
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,561
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't wanna jump right in and bite off more than we can chew.

665
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:25,343
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we wanted to say like, let's just start with the five-day option, that would certainly logistically be easier.

666
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:33,825
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think that if we had fixed days, a fixed Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and a fixed Tuesday, Thursday schedule in addition to the five-day, I think that that would be manageable.

667
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:42,068
[SPEAKER_22]: And it would open up a couple more seats because we could, again, if we're going by seats instead of by students, that would be more so.

668
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:50,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm comfortable with that as long as it's not like the complete Wild West times two, right?

669
00:59:50,615 --> 00:59:53,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's something that we're not ready for.

670
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:57,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that feels perfectly fine to me.

671
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,223
[SPEAKER_10]: I think just circling back to the cost,

672
01:00:02,836 --> 01:00:13,226
[SPEAKER_10]: If you all remember, the other thing we have really committed to is rapidly expanding our program after years of not making much progress.

673
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:18,851
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think what we will need administratively to make that happen is very unknown.

674
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:23,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to layer on top of that this new strand.

675
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:38,306
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should be conservative in terms of what it takes to make sure we do this well, rather than come up short, where we then have criticism that the program would have, could have, should have done something different.

676
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:47,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we find that all of that comes together very seamlessly, I think then we have the option next year to say, we're not going to increase that rate.

677
01:00:48,173 --> 01:00:53,738
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think if we come in too low, we will own this.

678
01:00:54,679 --> 01:01:00,024
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of the criticism that comes with short-changing the operational need, potentially.

679
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:06,190
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to make a motion that the daily rate be $15 for this till 4 PM option.

680
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:06,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah.

681
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:20,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

682
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:20,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

683
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:22,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember Graham members.

684
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:31,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing some calculations.

685
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:36,637
[SPEAKER_04]: AMI is $118,000 in Medford this year for a family of four.

686
01:01:38,218 --> 01:01:42,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be what you'd have to make to receive no financial assistance.

687
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm very comfortable with that $15 a day because

688
01:01:53,108 --> 01:02:07,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not going to comment on people's finances, but if your household brings in $118,000 a year and $15 a day is going to break you, then that's a different conversation, really.

689
01:02:07,734 --> 01:02:09,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not for me to comment on that.

690
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,955
[SPEAKER_04]: But we provide assistance, 70%

691
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:21,081
[SPEAKER_04]: what was it, 50% and 30% of that $15.

692
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:25,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm quite comfortable with these rates.

693
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I would like to know next year when we're having this conversation, what would it look like if these rates were significantly higher?

694
01:02:35,366 --> 01:02:36,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean 6%.

695
01:02:36,246 --> 01:02:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the $29.64 a day was $45 a day.

696
01:02:38,227 --> 01:02:39,207
[SPEAKER_04]: The $15 a day was $25 a day.

697
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what would that do to the program?

698
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:53,936
[SPEAKER_04]: What would that do to our ability to offer more assistance to families that were in need?

699
01:02:53,956 --> 01:03:01,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, these are the rates for people who do not meet any financial assistance requirements.

700
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:06,866
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not the rates for folks that have those income levels.

701
01:03:07,446 --> 01:03:09,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens if we go there?

702
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:15,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we end up with a much greater retention of staff?

703
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:18,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have the ability to offer retention bonuses?

704
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:22,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that actually change how many staff we retain from year to year?

705
01:03:23,754 --> 01:03:33,296
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the biggest challenges I am concerned about with this is that more staff means more time spent recruiting because that's more turnover.

706
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:34,557
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way around it, right?

707
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:42,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Megan, I don't know if she's doing it all herself still, but spends an enormous amount of time finding staff.

708
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:53,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's more staff that are employed to fill up the program and that retention is the same as it has been, then there's going to be more hiring required.

709
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,351
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more of her time or somebody else's time.

710
01:03:59,264 --> 01:04:07,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking like a substantial change to this cost, what would it look like next year to our ability to retain people.

711
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:13,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, aside from the training costs retaining people has.

712
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:19,692
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a lot of value in program consistency and all the other stuff that I don't need to go through.

713
01:04:20,492 --> 01:04:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to second this motion to go to $15 a day for the clipped shift option.

714
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am going to ask that by next year, we have a substantially, that we have an analysis of what we can do as a program if we went to $45 and $25 for those two options.

715
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:43,019
[SPEAKER_04]: keep it in mind.

716
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Financial assistance, none of that changes.

717
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, I'll second that.

718
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:52,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

719
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:55,642
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

720
01:04:55,662 --> 01:05:00,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to thank everybody for your work on this.

721
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:03,684
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very creative and the survey helped us get there as well.

722
01:05:03,784 --> 01:05:04,644
[SPEAKER_17]: So great job.

723
01:05:05,144 --> 01:05:08,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Great job for something we've been asking for and hoping for for a

724
01:05:09,384 --> 01:05:11,926
[SPEAKER_17]: that we've been doing for a few years now, especially so member Ruseau.

725
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:13,086
[SPEAKER_17]: If you could please call the role.

726
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:16,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Unmuted still good.

727
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:18,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Um member Branley.

728
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

729
01:05:19,831 --> 01:05:20,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Graham?

730
01:05:20,811 --> 01:05:21,011
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

731
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:22,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember and Tapa.

732
01:05:26,175 --> 01:05:27,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a new member.

733
01:05:27,576 --> 01:05:28,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's

734
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:40,864
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Reinfeld also says yes.

735
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, I'm sorry, yes.

736
01:05:42,446 --> 01:05:44,147
[SPEAKER_17]: And you, and you Member Ruseau, right?

737
01:05:44,328 --> 01:05:46,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I said yes too, boy, I got it.

738
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:50,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper passes.

739
01:05:54,677 --> 01:05:58,120
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we are gonna go to number five, water filling stations.

740
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:02,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Retta Smith, our Director of Food Services, I'll turn it over to you.

741
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:10,912
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not seeing her.

742
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:12,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I know she was on earlier.

743
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:15,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, she was.

744
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:18,834
[SPEAKER_17]: She hopped on a couple of times, so I'm not sure if she's having connection issues.

745
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:20,415
[SPEAKER_17]: She is, and I'm not seeing her now.

746
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is Jen Silva.

747
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:26,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Radha is actually on a plane, so I think she's been trying to get on and off as she has Wi-Fi.

748
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,038
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought she said she had sent a video.

749
01:06:30,078 --> 01:06:30,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Did she?

750
01:06:31,198 --> 01:06:32,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who she sent it to.

751
01:06:34,419 --> 01:06:34,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, she does.

752
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like me to play it?

753
01:06:36,533 --> 01:06:37,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

754
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:41,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not know that she was going for if she couldn't talk.

755
01:06:41,737 --> 01:06:44,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Director Smith and Dr. Cushing prepared a video.

756
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,241
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's hope I can get the audio to work again this time.

757
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:48,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Click the button.

758
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:59,853
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

759
01:07:00,757 --> 01:07:15,336
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for taking the opportunity this evening to review this quick video presentation as both Rhetta Smith, Director of Food Services, and myself are unable to attend this final meeting of the Medford School Committee this year due to family commitments.

760
01:07:16,277 --> 01:07:23,959
[SPEAKER_24]: We're here tonight in spirit to present to you Flow Water and request a five-year lease approval.

761
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:30,520
[SPEAKER_24]: This is part of, I would say, a pilot, but not really because a five-year lease is not a pilot.

762
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:45,684
[SPEAKER_24]: But this would give the Food Service Department the opportunity to continue using the two Flow Water devices that have been installed while further understanding the costs and implications of leasing versus purchasing for other locations in the district.

763
01:07:46,244 --> 01:07:50,285
[SPEAKER_24]: The plan is to deploy these to all of the cafeterias.

764
01:07:51,045 --> 01:08:09,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully, we have to do some further work looking at the spaces, but we wanted to bring this to you this evening to get a five-year lease approved by this body this evening, and then Director Smith will attend the City Council for final approval in the coming months.

765
01:08:10,228 --> 01:08:13,829
[SPEAKER_24]: With that, I'd like to turn it over to Director Smith at this time.

766
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:18,529
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

767
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:21,174
[SPEAKER_20]: My apologies for not being able to be present tonight.

768
01:08:23,272 --> 01:08:27,636
[SPEAKER_20]: Flow water is, I think, a better system for us.

769
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:37,844
[SPEAKER_20]: So under USDA regulations, the cafeterias are obligated to provide drinking water to the students, which we are happy to do.

770
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:50,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Previously, we'd been using, at the high school, five-gallon refillable dispensers that we had filled with water in the kitchen and then transport out into the cafeteria space for the students.

771
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:59,398
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to do something that was better for the students in terms of meeting their needs for drinking water.

772
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:06,085
[SPEAKER_20]: They had expressed that it didn't taste very good, so I came across flow water.

773
01:09:06,766 --> 01:09:13,073
[SPEAKER_20]: And flow water definitely has a more premium feel to it than the LK water bottle filling stations that we have.

774
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:16,754
[SPEAKER_20]: It has a seven-step filtration process.

775
01:09:17,135 --> 01:09:19,476
[SPEAKER_20]: The water is very cold when it comes out.

776
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:30,941
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a five-gallon reservoir that holds the water, and so it's very cold when it comes through the tap, and the students have commented on that and appreciate it a lot.

777
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:35,583
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have two units in the high school currently that we are piloting.

778
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:43,952
[SPEAKER_20]: And the student feedback that we've received, staff feedback that we've received has been really, really positive.

779
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:51,058
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a unit that is installed outside of my office.

780
01:09:51,518 --> 01:09:58,445
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I'm there, students and staff members come throughout the day to fill their water bottle station or water bottles.

781
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:00,807
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's been really, really nice to see.

782
01:10:04,771 --> 01:10:07,933
[SPEAKER_20]: This is some documentation provided from Flow Water.

783
01:10:08,434 --> 01:10:20,241
[SPEAKER_20]: So their systems were used on water from Flint, Michigan, which, as I'm sure everyone knows, had extremely high levels of lead in the drinking water.

784
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:23,804
[SPEAKER_20]: And using Flow Water, they were able to

785
01:10:24,624 --> 01:10:30,746
[SPEAKER_20]: get that lead level down to undetectable levels, which is pretty amazing.

786
01:10:31,046 --> 01:10:38,088
[SPEAKER_20]: And the pictures you can see on the right, the difference with and without using flow water.

787
01:10:38,148 --> 01:10:41,209
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's visibly different as well.

788
01:10:46,880 --> 01:11:02,589
[SPEAKER_20]: The cost difference in leasing versus purchasing the flow water system over five years, it's actually cheaper to lease the machine than it is to purchase it over five years.

789
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:11,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Additional benefits are that the units are under warranty for the entire duration of the lease.

790
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:16,077
[SPEAKER_20]: If you purchase the machine, it's only under warranty for

791
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:26,584
[SPEAKER_20]: One year, considering that the high school is a very busy place and many outside renters are in the building on the weekends.

792
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:33,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel more comfortable with going with the lease option, knowing that the

793
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I know read it too well to think she ended it in the middle of a sentence.

794
01:11:58,457 --> 01:12:02,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see that X there in the middle of the screen?

795
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:06,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

796
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:08,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you have to click that.

797
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that is.

798
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:15,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it was working when I was testing it earlier, I apologize.

799
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:18,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Always works when you test it.

800
01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:28,166
[SPEAKER_14]: One second.

801
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd refresh the page if it's a webpage.

802
01:13:03,438 --> 01:13:09,821
[SPEAKER_20]: is a very busy place and many outside renters are in the building on the weekends.

803
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:23,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel more comfortable with going with the lease option knowing that the units would be covered under warranty for the duration of that time period.

804
01:13:24,327 --> 01:13:25,728
[SPEAKER_20]: After the five-year lease,

805
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,009
[SPEAKER_20]: It is extended on a month-to-month basis.

806
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:42,299
[SPEAKER_20]: If the machine is not really functioning as well as we want it to at that point, we could also trade it in essentially to get a new unit and extend a lease.

807
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:48,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Or if we were happy with it over the five years, then we could opt to purchase units at that time.

808
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:55,196
[SPEAKER_24]: So at this time, that's the end of the presentation.

809
01:13:55,676 --> 01:14:03,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Some questions you might have relate to the overall water quality in our schools that was of topic in September and October this past year.

810
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:13,081
[SPEAKER_24]: The district has submitted our request for SWIG and will be receiving financial compensation this summer to replace

811
01:14:14,862 --> 01:14:20,724
[SPEAKER_24]: Many of the water fountains that tested negatively, those will be in the neighborhood of $3,000 a piece.

812
01:14:21,184 --> 01:14:25,446
[SPEAKER_24]: So, more than likely, those will be the LK replacements.

813
01:14:25,986 --> 01:14:29,148
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, while this is definitely, as director Smith said, a.

814
01:14:30,388 --> 01:14:31,650
[SPEAKER_24]: premium option.

815
01:14:32,671 --> 01:14:36,095
[SPEAKER_24]: This would probably be best suited in our cafeteria spaces.

816
01:14:37,076 --> 01:14:47,369
[SPEAKER_24]: The machines are very sleek, very inviting, and offer the opportunity for, as you can see in this picture here, both staff and students, the opportunity to fill up.

817
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,932
[SPEAKER_24]: I encourage, and if this were an in-person meeting,

818
01:14:50,372 --> 01:15:02,097
[SPEAKER_24]: Director Smith had actually planned to have chilled water there from the stations for you, but we invite you to come to the schools at any point to really taste it for yourself.

819
01:15:02,937 --> 01:15:18,364
[SPEAKER_24]: The reality is though is that to deploy these across the district in all spaces would be cost prohibitive in comparison to the LKs that will be supported by SWIG.

820
01:15:19,276 --> 01:15:28,323
[SPEAKER_24]: So while I had initially hoped to do that after crunching the numbers and doing the math, it just doesn't really work out.

821
01:15:28,623 --> 01:15:46,376
[SPEAKER_24]: But in order to provide this as an opportunity for students and staff to fill their own vessels, or perhaps the district would like to provide a branded flask for our students and staff at some point, that might be a great alternative as well.

822
01:15:48,733 --> 01:15:57,061
[SPEAKER_24]: would like to just close out by saying really appreciate Rhetta's enthusiasm in pursuing this and really working hard.

823
01:15:57,201 --> 01:16:08,031
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll notice that in this picture, in the two cafeterias, we've actually utilized long, dormant, old water fountains that were covered over.

824
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:11,635
[SPEAKER_24]: You can see it there in the white contrast versus the paneling behind.

825
01:16:12,596 --> 01:16:26,447
[SPEAKER_24]: And our maintenance staff and the flow water staff were able to clear out the drains, clear out the piping, and really put in a far superior option for our students.

826
01:16:27,108 --> 01:16:34,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Once again, the long-term plan or short-term plan over the next year is to deploy these to the elementary and middle school cafeterias.

827
01:16:34,935 --> 01:16:38,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Those pose a little bit of a deployment challenge in plumbing for some,

828
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:42,192
[SPEAKER_24]: But Director Smith is working on those issues.

829
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:49,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Rutter, is there anything you'd like to add before we close out our video presentation this evening?

830
01:16:49,337 --> 01:17:02,906
[SPEAKER_20]: I will be on a plane when this meeting is happening, but I will try to be on Zoom and could answer questions via chat as long as Wi-Fi participates.

831
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:14,320
[SPEAKER_24]: And I unfortunately will be entirely unavailable, but this is why we hire great people to lead departments and Director Smith can answer all the questions you may have.

832
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:24,951
[SPEAKER_24]: In closing, I request recommendation to approve a five-year lease with Flow Water and forward on to the Medford City Council for approval under Mass General Laws.

833
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,213
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you and all my best.

834
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:40,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you could leave the screen up, maybe, because it just showed the total cost of $10,500, I think I just saw.

835
01:17:40,753 --> 01:17:49,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Total five-year investment.

836
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:56,579
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe, Noel, for me, if you could just outline that, and then I'll go to anybody that has questions.

837
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:02,812
[SPEAKER_23]: You're talking about outlining the lease towards the purchase?

838
01:18:02,832 --> 01:18:05,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Just the total cost for the five years, is that correct?

839
01:18:05,955 --> 01:18:07,075
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 10,500?

840
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:13,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

841
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,702
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that's the per unit.

842
01:18:15,722 --> 01:18:19,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, we all said it at the same time.

843
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:21,666
[SPEAKER_19]: That's per unit, right?

844
01:18:22,747 --> 01:18:23,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Per station?

845
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:27,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and I believe that that is the purchase price.

846
01:18:27,982 --> 01:18:29,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Their request is for the lease.

847
01:18:30,987 --> 01:18:32,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I also saying that?

848
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:36,096
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, they are requesting, they prefer the lease option just because of

849
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,840
[SPEAKER_23]: the maintenance applied to it.

850
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,923
[SPEAKER_23]: And as when you already purchase it, the warranty is only for one year.

851
01:18:43,943 --> 01:19:02,235
[SPEAKER_23]: So anything after one year, you're held responsible to either bring in your own plumbers and or bring in your own custodial facilities to work on the machines, replace the filters and keep up any, and clean any lines that might get dirty from usage over time.

852
01:19:06,884 --> 01:19:07,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

853
01:19:08,145 --> 01:19:09,787
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll turn it over to member Graham.

854
01:19:09,807 --> 01:19:12,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

855
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:19,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like the lease option, particularly because it also includes maintenance.

856
01:19:20,032 --> 01:19:25,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know that we haven't always done such a great job when it comes to maintenance.

857
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:31,319
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think those fillable water stations are a really good example of us not doing maintenance.

858
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,801
[SPEAKER_10]: The filters are clogged.

859
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:36,623
[SPEAKER_10]: My kids come home all the time and say those don't work anymore.

860
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:39,405
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a sign over them that says don't use.

861
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:46,108
[SPEAKER_10]: All of that goes away with this model, which I think is super intriguing.

862
01:19:47,589 --> 01:19:55,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Noel, I did have one other question, which was, is this being funded out of the food service budget, or is this being funded out of the operating budget?

863
01:19:56,594 --> 01:20:11,483
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, as long as they're kept in the cafeteria and they're being used regarding cafeteria usage, i.e., breakfast, breakfast after the bell, lunchtime, and or if we're serving any snacks during summer programs, these are 100% eligible

864
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,401
[SPEAKER_23]: to be spent through the lunch program.

865
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:22,203
[SPEAKER_23]: If any other principals wanted to get these outside of that, they would have to do it through their own budget and maintenance.

866
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:26,964
[SPEAKER_23]: Or we, the district, could review this in our budgets later.

867
01:20:27,064 --> 01:20:34,026
[SPEAKER_23]: But regarding they have to stay in the cafeteria and be used specifically during cafeteria hours to qualify, yes.

868
01:20:34,506 --> 01:20:38,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the plan for these pieces, correct?

869
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:42,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the budget can handle this expense, is my understanding.

870
01:20:42,675 --> 01:20:43,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?

871
01:20:43,815 --> 01:20:47,417
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, our current food service funding, yes, can cover this.

872
01:20:48,818 --> 01:20:49,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

873
01:20:49,858 --> 01:20:54,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I will make a motion to approve the five-year lease and defer to my colleagues.

874
01:20:56,461 --> 01:20:59,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Before motions for approval, I see Member Olapade, you have your hand up.

875
01:21:00,895 --> 01:21:01,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

876
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:03,197
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just a quick question so I understand.

877
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:09,763
[SPEAKER_25]: So if we were to do the leasing option, I understand that the maintenance would be, I'm assuming, covered by flow water.

878
01:21:09,883 --> 01:21:15,188
[SPEAKER_25]: If we did the purchase, would that be a different expectation about what the annual maintenance cost is?

879
01:21:15,248 --> 01:21:16,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Would we cover that as individuals?

880
01:21:16,709 --> 01:21:21,153
[SPEAKER_25]: Would they teach or kind of instruct our staff on what the maintenance looks like?

881
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:24,657
[SPEAKER_25]: Or would we still be able to contract out to them for that kind of upkeep?

882
01:21:24,757 --> 01:21:27,179
[SPEAKER_25]: You may not know that off the top of your head, but I just thought I'd ask really quick.

883
01:21:28,145 --> 01:21:31,327
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know that I could definitely reach out to Rita when she comes back.

884
01:21:31,347 --> 01:21:35,028
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a meeting with her on the 26th and we can definitely reach out to you regarding.

885
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:43,452
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, what I do know is from the pamphlet I read and from the meetings I had, I know that for the first year, everything is covered.

886
01:21:44,773 --> 01:21:51,556
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether they would train us on how to keep maintaining them, I'm sure that's something we can definitely ask the representative.

887
01:21:53,077 --> 01:21:53,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that'd be great.

888
01:21:53,737 --> 01:21:54,258
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you so much.

889
01:21:54,278 --> 01:21:55,078
[SPEAKER_23]: You're welcome.

890
01:21:58,934 --> 01:21:59,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Reinfeld.

891
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:01,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

892
01:22:01,778 --> 01:22:10,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wanted to say, I know Director Smith is not on the call, but I appreciate both that this is proactive, but also really responsive to something that students requested.

893
01:22:10,088 --> 01:22:11,330
[SPEAKER_19]: So I really appreciate that.

894
01:22:11,711 --> 01:22:14,574
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just wanted to ask Director Velez if

895
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:18,575
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this at risk?

896
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I know the revolving budget at the moment, the revolving fund can handle it.

897
01:22:22,376 --> 01:22:32,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Does this come under risk if things happen with our federal grant and the support for free lunches, the free breakfast and lunches?

898
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,521
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for that question.

899
01:22:34,941 --> 01:22:42,084
[SPEAKER_23]: What I can tell you is while we were in Maslow, a lot of the director of finances had very similar questions.

900
01:22:42,364 --> 01:22:46,386
[SPEAKER_23]: We met with Patrick Tutwiler and we met with a few other people from the state

901
01:22:47,295 --> 01:23:09,840
[SPEAKER_23]: and what they had informed us was if for whatever reason the federal lunch program was to dissolve based on whatever decisions the current administration wanted to make, the governor and the state and a lot of state representatives had decided they would use first emergency slush funds and they would work it into the budget as they have done

902
01:23:10,722 --> 01:23:19,446
[SPEAKER_23]: with meeting a lot of school districts needs that they would then cover the rest of whatever the federal government was not covering from meal reimbursement.

903
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:28,451
[SPEAKER_23]: That was my understanding as of May of 2025 when we last spoke with certain district leaders, with certain state leaders.

904
01:23:29,191 --> 01:23:29,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Terrific.

905
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:29,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

906
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:33,413
[SPEAKER_19]: In that case, I'm happy to second the motion to approve the lease.

907
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:40,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

908
01:23:40,151 --> 01:23:40,872
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

909
01:23:42,212 --> 01:23:42,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call, please.

910
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:43,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, we're on Zoom.

911
01:23:45,614 --> 01:23:46,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Bramley?

912
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:46,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

913
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

914
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:48,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

915
01:23:49,236 --> 01:23:49,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Intoppa?

916
01:23:50,237 --> 01:23:50,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

917
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:51,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade?

918
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:52,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

919
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:53,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

920
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:54,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

921
01:23:54,919 --> 01:23:55,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rossell?

922
01:23:55,459 --> 01:23:55,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

923
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:56,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

924
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

925
01:24:00,482 --> 01:24:01,402
[SPEAKER_17]: The paper passes.

926
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:03,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

927
01:24:04,584 --> 01:24:05,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Retta and Peter.

928
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:06,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, wait, you're not on.

929
01:24:09,321 --> 01:24:10,422
[SPEAKER_17]: We should send them a video.

930
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:12,583
[SPEAKER_17]: A thank you video.

931
01:24:14,124 --> 01:24:14,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, golly.

932
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:18,587
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, let me just switch back to the agenda.

933
01:24:18,627 --> 01:24:20,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We do actually have one on YouTube.

934
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:24,411
[SPEAKER_04]: We should send it to them.

935
01:24:25,431 --> 01:24:33,857
[SPEAKER_17]: We do not have any public presentations, but we do have one item under continued business from June 3, 2025 special meeting.

936
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:36,038
[SPEAKER_17]: The following recommendations to approve

937
01:24:37,063 --> 01:24:44,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Contracts for Teamsters Local 25 Administrators, contract for MPS Budget Analyst, increases for non-unit personnel.

938
01:24:50,046 --> 01:24:55,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, I can give a brief summary of the administrator's contract, if that's helpful.

939
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:57,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be great, thank you.

940
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:11,115
[SPEAKER_10]: We met in executive session and did take a vote to ratify the contract, but in just going through the notes, we didn't report that out.

941
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:19,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do need to take a vote here on the floor according to our attorney and just by way of what that contract is.

942
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,522
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a 3-year contract.

943
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:24,203
[SPEAKER_10]: In FY25, the increase is 3%.

944
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:26,224
[SPEAKER_10]: In FY26, it's 2.5% plus a 0.75% wage adjustment.

945
01:25:26,545 --> 01:25:28,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same in FY27, 2.5% plus a 0.75% wage adjustment.

946
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:29,426
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is because

947
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:54,147
[SPEAKER_10]: With the sort of big and big changes to the teacher salaries, we were at risk of our administrative positions no longer being very attractive.

948
01:25:54,928 --> 01:25:56,610
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had to make some adjustments there.

949
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:58,793
[SPEAKER_10]: This contract also.

950
01:26:00,195 --> 01:26:15,294
[SPEAKER_10]: made some changes, did not make any changes to their longevity, but did make some changes to the wage schedules around their advanced degrees, which they have in their contract really in lieu of steps.

951
01:26:16,275 --> 01:26:16,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And

952
01:26:18,698 --> 01:26:22,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Although longevity did change by $100 per contract year, which was very modest.

953
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:37,011
[SPEAKER_10]: And there were a couple of big things that came out of this, one of which was that their work year will be increased by two days in FY25.

954
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:41,074
[SPEAKER_10]: So part of their increase is because they will be working more.

955
01:26:42,475 --> 01:26:44,336
[SPEAKER_10]: And our stipends,

956
01:26:46,217 --> 01:26:55,441
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some short term stipends to support some of the schedule work as well as some continuing stipends that will continue to be part of the contract.

957
01:26:56,102 --> 01:27:03,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the, the final piece was that the director of English language.

958
01:27:04,309 --> 01:27:16,953
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, learners, um, what would no longer be part of the unit, given the changing nature of that role and the alignment of that role more to our director of pupil services than to the work that's being done in that unit.

959
01:27:18,413 --> 01:27:31,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so that's like a quick recap and, um, attorney Greenspan suggested that we, um, take a vote in public to, um, acknowledge, um, that and, uh, be able to execute the full conflict.

960
01:27:33,658 --> 01:27:33,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

961
01:27:40,832 --> 01:27:42,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I just ask a question?

962
01:27:42,113 --> 01:27:49,277
[SPEAKER_17]: The two extra days, is that being compensated through the COLAs and the adjustments?

963
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:56,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is there also a per day increase to each position?

964
01:27:57,042 --> 01:28:03,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like we did in the teacher's contract, there is a per day adjustment, which is in addition to the COLAs.

965
01:28:27,517 --> 01:28:48,301
[SPEAKER_17]: No offense to any administrators, I just, this is far more rich than we've been working through on the city side, so I'm just not gonna be able to support it, because I know the budget would not be able to sustain these type of increases across the board, which I think is somewhat of a fair way to do it.

966
01:28:49,101 --> 01:28:51,362
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll ask you to call the roll, Member Ruseau.

967
01:28:54,142 --> 01:28:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Bradley.

968
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:55,523
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

969
01:28:56,303 --> 01:28:56,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

970
01:28:57,428 --> 01:28:57,648
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

971
01:28:59,129 --> 01:28:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Agapa.

972
01:29:00,971 --> 01:29:01,191
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

973
01:29:02,352 --> 01:29:03,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade.

974
01:29:03,853 --> 01:29:04,154
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

975
01:29:04,834 --> 01:29:05,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

976
01:29:05,895 --> 01:29:06,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

977
01:29:06,796 --> 01:29:07,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau, yes.

978
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:08,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

979
01:29:09,138 --> 01:29:13,001
[SPEAKER_17]: No, 16 affirmative, one in the negative motion passes.

980
01:29:15,923 --> 01:29:21,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Next up we have new business first reading of the allergy policy offered by member Ruseau.

981
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:29,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, can I just clarify, did we, that vote was just about the administrator's contract or it was about all three?

982
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the administrators, I'm seeing.

983
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that might've been just the administrators.

984
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:34,282
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, there's, let me go back up.

985
01:29:34,822 --> 01:29:35,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

986
01:29:36,763 --> 01:29:40,544
[SPEAKER_17]: So contract for MPS budget analyst is next, sorry.

987
01:29:47,307 --> 01:29:48,487
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe that's our,

988
01:29:49,831 --> 01:29:51,713
[SPEAKER_17]: That is Jerry's contract.

989
01:29:51,813 --> 01:29:55,976
[SPEAKER_17]: So if anybody wants to just give us an overview and then we can take a vote.

990
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:56,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

991
01:29:56,797 --> 01:30:05,343
[SPEAKER_15]: That is for Mr. McHugh, who has been working with us for the past two years, helping in the finance department.

992
01:30:05,424 --> 01:30:14,591
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's been well documented on many of these meetings, the exorbitant amount of work that we have had to do in the finance office to get

993
01:30:17,299 --> 01:30:29,392
[SPEAKER_15]: out from underneath loads and loads of water and working on systems and structures so that we are compliant and that we are operating in a way in which we should be as a public school district.

994
01:30:29,532 --> 01:30:38,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So he has definitely taken charge on a lot of the budget build with Noel's partnership and assistance.

995
01:30:38,741 --> 01:30:39,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year we have him

996
01:30:40,623 --> 01:30:51,990
[SPEAKER_15]: working on a lot of other projects, doing some auditing of our revolving accounts, and again working with Noel who will be taking lead in the budget build for the next school year.

997
01:30:53,111 --> 01:31:06,480
[SPEAKER_15]: In the subcommittee meeting that or the other school committee meeting we had, we discussed his daily rate of $75 an hour or a day, excuse me, for doing this work with us.

998
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,160
[SPEAKER_15]: and that is the approval for this evening.

999
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:20,542
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's additional pieces that school committee members in attendance would like to, or Director Velez would like to add on, please feel free.

1000
01:31:21,803 --> 01:31:24,363
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm assuming you mean $75 an hour.

1001
01:31:24,663 --> 01:31:24,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1002
01:31:24,963 --> 01:31:33,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you just tell me, that's similar to the rate that was given through this past budget for fiscal year 26, is that correct?

1003
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:35,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe so.

1004
01:31:35,887 --> 01:31:36,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that 60?

1005
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:38,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Noel can confirm that.

1006
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:40,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, it's the same rate.

1007
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:43,971
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the same rate he's had for two years now.

1008
01:31:45,352 --> 01:31:46,032
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, thank you.

1009
01:31:46,233 --> 01:31:46,853
[SPEAKER_23]: Member Reinfeld?

1010
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:52,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, I just wanted to say I think this is well worth investing in for the revolving accounts.

1011
01:31:52,558 --> 01:32:04,146
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that was one of the things that we saw when we got these budget presentations that there was some unevenness and some questions around what was coming in and what was going out and how it was being distributed.

1012
01:32:04,266 --> 01:32:10,691
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think this is well worth the cost and a bargain, honestly, for financial budget consulting.

1013
01:32:11,872 --> 01:32:12,892
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll motion to approve.

1014
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:16,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval by Member Reinfeld, seconded by?

1015
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:18,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

1016
01:32:19,071 --> 01:32:20,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade, roll call please.

1017
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:26,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Bramley.

01:32:26,977 --> 01:32:27,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1019
01:32:28,098 --> 01:32:28,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

1020
01:32:29,218 --> 01:32:29,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1021
01:32:29,999 --> 01:32:30,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Intoppa.

1022
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:31,460
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1023
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:32,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade.

1024
01:32:33,021 --> 01:32:33,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1025
01:32:33,742 --> 01:32:34,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1026
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:34,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1027
01:32:35,503 --> 01:32:36,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rossell.

1028
01:32:36,044 --> 01:32:36,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1029
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:36,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo.

1030
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:37,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1031
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:40,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

1032
01:32:41,628 --> 01:32:45,671
[SPEAKER_17]: And last but not least in that agenda item, increases for non-unit personnel.

1033
01:32:50,448 --> 01:32:53,689
[SPEAKER_15]: This was the other piece that was discussed at the previous meeting.

1034
01:32:54,009 --> 01:33:04,832
[SPEAKER_15]: The attached document there lists the non-unit positions that we discussed having an increase in a range of like 2% to 3%.

1035
01:33:04,872 --> 01:33:05,292
[SPEAKER_15]: There are two

1036
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:17,179
[SPEAKER_15]: There are two non-unit positions that have a note in terms of a salary adjustment due to an assignment of new duties.

1037
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:26,690
[SPEAKER_15]: One of those positions is our communications director, Mr. Pippicelli, and the other one is new duties for the

1038
01:33:28,091 --> 01:33:42,478
[SPEAKER_15]: current registration specialist position, the one full-time position that is in the Parent Information Center, moving that to a senior registration specialist position, and Ms.

1039
01:33:42,518 --> 01:33:44,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Gabby DaCosta taking on

1040
01:33:44,819 --> 01:34:03,808
[SPEAKER_15]: more management responsibilities for the overall functioning of the registration office and some additional responsibilities with reporting through the Department of Education around registration-related activities and compliance.

1041
01:34:05,309 --> 01:34:06,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy to answer any questions.

1042
01:34:10,972 --> 01:34:11,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve?

1043
01:34:15,235 --> 01:34:19,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval by member Graham for the roles called.

1044
01:34:19,118 --> 01:34:21,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you just tell us what the actual increases were?

1045
01:34:23,661 --> 01:34:25,202
[SPEAKER_15]: To those two positions?

1046
01:34:25,823 --> 01:34:26,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, please.

1047
01:34:26,343 --> 01:34:29,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on one second.

1048
01:34:39,447 --> 01:34:43,650
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could give me a moment, I'm really sorry, I'm gonna have to pull that up because I don't have it at the ready.

1049
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:47,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll pull it up for you right now, Superintendent.

1050
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:47,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1051
01:34:47,953 --> 01:35:07,806
[SPEAKER_23]: The two employees we're talking about are William and Gabby, is that correct?

1052
01:35:08,127 --> 01:35:08,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1053
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:18,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, for... And while Mr. Velez is looking for that, I did talk about the increased responsibilities for Ms.

1054
01:35:18,934 --> 01:35:19,515
[SPEAKER_15]: DaCosta.

1055
01:35:20,596 --> 01:35:25,399
[SPEAKER_15]: In this meeting, I did not talk about the increased responsibilities for Mr. Pipiselli.

1056
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:36,348
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's important to note with, as you see tonight, with Mr. Cushing, Dr. Cushing leaving, there are a lot of responsibilities around the MPS,

1057
01:35:40,133 --> 01:35:48,941
[SPEAKER_15]: pieces for this meeting around Zoom, increased responsibilities around our Google suite.

1058
01:35:49,021 --> 01:35:58,809
[SPEAKER_15]: There are confidentially, I'm sorry, I'm stumbling on my words, but there are pieces of

1059
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:17,518
[SPEAKER_15]: management district-wide for our Google suite of applications, for our Zoom applications, and those are going to be transferred from Dr. Cushing to Mr. Pipiselli, as well as some other responsibilities in increasing his day-to-day tasks.

1060
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:23,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Director Velez.

1061
01:36:26,444 --> 01:36:27,264
[SPEAKER_23]: I have those numbers.

1062
01:36:27,284 --> 01:36:28,725
[SPEAKER_23]: So for William,

1063
01:36:29,913 --> 01:36:38,638
[SPEAKER_23]: The pay increase regarding the adjustment to his work and new assignments as the superintendent has spoken about would be a pay increase of $7,998.

1064
01:36:39,038 --> 01:36:44,741
[SPEAKER_23]: That is for William.

1065
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:55,627
[SPEAKER_23]: And regarding Gabby DaCosta, the pay increase regarding her new assignment from her old job

1066
01:36:57,086 --> 01:36:57,646
[SPEAKER_23]: would be $19,750.

1067
01:36:58,407 --> 01:36:58,928
[SPEAKER_23]: Second.

1068
01:36:59,008 --> 01:36:59,508
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry, $18,000.

1069
01:36:59,548 --> 01:37:01,290
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize.

1070
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:12,499
[SPEAKER_23]: For the rolls called, so with an almost $20,000 increase, was that position reposted, posted, and then filled?

1071
01:37:12,519 --> 01:37:13,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Or that's just a,

1072
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:29,412
[SPEAKER_17]: $19,000 increase too.

1073
01:37:30,232 --> 01:37:36,256
[SPEAKER_15]: So Gabby, so just a few things with the functioning of that office.

1074
01:37:36,316 --> 01:37:40,098
[SPEAKER_15]: So the second position is a part-time position.

1075
01:37:40,638 --> 01:37:43,640
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a position where, so Gabby has been, Ms.

1076
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:46,582
[SPEAKER_15]: DaCosta has been the central person of that department.

1077
01:37:47,322 --> 01:37:52,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Within her stay there, she has created a manual.

1078
01:37:52,826 --> 01:37:56,349
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if we talk about the functioning of that department prior to Ms.

1079
01:37:56,369 --> 01:38:05,116
[SPEAKER_15]: DaCosta coming in, there were significant errors made in the registration and the onboarding of our students.

1080
01:38:06,377 --> 01:38:10,480
[SPEAKER_15]: There wasn't a lot of communication necessarily between the schools.

1081
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:15,362
[SPEAKER_15]: And so she has come in and she has put in systems and structures for that.

1082
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:17,803
[SPEAKER_15]: She has streamlined that, created manuals.

1083
01:38:18,563 --> 01:38:20,704
[SPEAKER_15]: She also is fluent in four languages.

1084
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:28,687
[SPEAKER_15]: She is very welcoming to our families that we are bringing into our system.

1085
01:38:30,828 --> 01:38:35,850
[SPEAKER_15]: But we also see that she has, through her work, been able to take on more.

1086
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,571
[SPEAKER_15]: And with our

1087
01:38:40,127 --> 01:38:43,129
[SPEAKER_15]: our data analyst position also switching over.

1088
01:38:43,869 --> 01:38:58,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Gabby has worked in partnership with that new person and has taken on some new responsibilities for the Department of Education in the way that we are doing our assignments of our SASIDS, the way we're doing some data reporting.

1089
01:38:59,858 --> 01:39:05,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also have found with that part-time position that has turned over now twice.

1090
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:16,472
[SPEAKER_15]: That position has required just some oversight in compliance in the way that we are working within that office.

1091
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:29,226
[SPEAKER_15]: So though she will not be necessarily managing that person, she will be the one responsible and the central liaison for the principals and the overall functioning of that department.

1092
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:36,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm going to ask member Ruseau to call the roll.

1093
01:39:36,653 --> 01:39:38,154
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make one point.

1094
01:39:39,315 --> 01:39:47,541
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to trust that you're putting the team in place that you need with the job duties that are needed under each person.

1095
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:52,805
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to suggest that in the future when you're talking raises,

1096
01:39:53,945 --> 01:39:57,931
[SPEAKER_17]: like this out of fairness and transparency that they be posted.

1097
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:07,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, even if it's somebody that, you know, has special skills, it's just always good and we do it on the city side it's just, I think it's the

1098
01:40:08,023 --> 01:40:17,455
[SPEAKER_17]: best practice to post for positions, even if you know that somebody is very strong, a strong candidate, just so it's as transparent as possible.

1099
01:40:17,675 --> 01:40:25,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I never, never have been a fan of just these large raises without jobs, especially being posted.

1100
01:40:25,064 --> 01:40:26,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's just wanted to give my

1101
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:36,093
[SPEAKER_17]: take on it and I hope that maybe that can be thought through in the future for next budget cycle when we're thinking about raises for people or large increases.

1102
01:40:36,593 --> 01:40:38,673
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm gonna ask that the role be called.

1103
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to give my two cents.

1104
01:40:42,234 --> 01:40:47,036
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I appreciate the feedback and I'm always happy to take feedback.

1105
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,477
[SPEAKER_15]: The only other thing I would say is that,

1106
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,057
[SPEAKER_15]: she was also making very little.

1107
01:40:55,938 --> 01:41:01,462
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the the pay was also to bring her.

1108
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:03,363
[SPEAKER_15]: She's still much lower.

1109
01:41:03,804 --> 01:41:16,653
[SPEAKER_15]: If you if you look at other districts, even with a significant raise, she is also making lower than what our neighboring districts are currently paying people.

1110
01:41:17,832 --> 01:41:23,698
[SPEAKER_15]: in her position, but I do hear the feedback and take it.

1111
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:24,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1112
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham, before the roll call.

1113
01:41:33,428 --> 01:41:34,468
[SPEAKER_10]: My house is not on fire.

1114
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:39,050
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a pie that might have been on fire, but it's all set.

1115
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:43,211
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're all good here.

1116
01:41:43,271 --> 01:41:55,915
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did want to say that I think threading the needle between valuing the employees that you have and rewarding people for doing hard work and stepping up and

1117
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:02,814
[SPEAKER_10]: What looks like transparency by posting positions is a needle to be threaded.

1118
01:42:02,854 --> 01:42:04,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's one answer to it.

1119
01:42:05,775 --> 01:42:12,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I think when you get in the habit of posting positions, when you know who's right for the job, it diminishes the work.

1120
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:21,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And it leads to what we see in Medford Public Schools, where everyone is just convinced that the job is posted as a cover to give somebody's family member

1121
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:22,923
[SPEAKER_10]: a job.

1122
01:42:23,283 --> 01:42:28,925
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's not, to me, it's a very gray area in terms of hiring and leading.

1123
01:42:29,425 --> 01:42:43,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to offer that every time I talk to somebody about how positions are posted, they're like, the feedback that I hear is, well, that's just done so that there's cover to give somebody a job that they don't deserve.

1124
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:47,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we've worked really hard to change that perspective.

1125
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:51,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate that it's not perfect all the time.

1126
01:42:51,692 --> 01:42:52,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

1127
01:42:55,448 --> 01:42:55,668
[SPEAKER_17]: call?

1128
01:42:55,828 --> 01:42:57,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Eric, can I just ask a quick question?

1129
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:58,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1130
01:42:59,351 --> 01:42:59,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1131
01:43:00,972 --> 01:43:13,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't looked in a number of years, but I do remember probably four or five years ago looking and seeing that the Parent Information Center in Malden, for instance, had I think six staff members and we had one.

1132
01:43:13,422 --> 01:43:15,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also

1133
01:43:20,414 --> 01:43:41,899
[SPEAKER_04]: feel really uncomfortable with the fact I mean I don't know that they need six or whatever they have maybe they don't need that many but it's hard to imagine that one or two is the right number for a district that's not we're not like a tenth of their size or a sixth of their size so I do think that just like with the finance department staffing up requires

1134
01:43:43,643 --> 01:43:44,163
[SPEAKER_04]: investment.

1135
01:43:45,444 --> 01:43:48,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, of course, is different than an investment.

1136
01:43:49,006 --> 01:43:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that even with this raise, we're paying her less than she could make next door.

1137
01:43:56,330 --> 01:44:04,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to have a conversation around that the next budget about what do we need in a parent information center and what's the right size for that budget.

1138
01:44:04,774 --> 01:44:05,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of like the city.

1139
01:44:05,755 --> 01:44:09,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some Councilors want to have a needs analysis.

1140
01:44:11,177 --> 01:44:12,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that

1141
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:18,244
[SPEAKER_04]: The needs analysis never returns you with a result that says things are good.

1142
01:44:18,264 --> 01:44:21,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The only result of a needs analysis is you need a gazillion dollars.

1143
01:44:21,847 --> 01:44:24,109
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only outcome.

1144
01:44:24,269 --> 01:44:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would be nice to know this department is almost the right size and this department is operating on one fifth the number of employees or one fifth the budget that it should have.

1145
01:44:34,797 --> 01:44:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's too many,

1146
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:46,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be nice if he could get to that and then maybe next year when we're doing this budget because I do agree, Mayor that like.

1147
01:44:54,822 --> 01:45:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, maybe there's phenomenal candidates that would have jumped into for this job.

1148
01:45:01,066 --> 01:45:09,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, knowing that the look at the other districts to say, even with this raise, this is an underpaid position, I think that that seems unlikely.

1149
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:16,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I know with our union personnel, administrators, like we post.

1150
01:45:16,154 --> 01:45:16,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to post.

1151
01:45:16,895 --> 01:45:17,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in their contract.

1152
01:45:19,756 --> 01:45:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And same for teachers and all these other things.

1153
01:45:22,697 --> 01:45:41,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think for non-unit personnel, we might want to also consider, is there some kind of a process to land on that we could reuse but not create that same sense of foregone conclusion that Member Graham brings up.

1154
01:45:41,221 --> 01:45:48,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was a hiring manager and when I applied for jobs, the first question was, is there already somebody who's going to get this job?

1155
01:45:50,049 --> 01:45:55,112
[SPEAKER_04]: As a candidate, we've got lives, we've got things to do.

1156
01:45:55,733 --> 01:46:02,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Applying for jobs for which we already know who the candidate is, is incredibly disrespectful in my job, my mind.

1157
01:46:02,977 --> 01:46:08,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes we're mandated, like the law does require in some cases that you post, doesn't matter.

1158
01:46:11,352 --> 01:46:21,101
[SPEAKER_04]: If we already know who we're going to give the job to, I think it's not respectful of the other candidates to make them go through all that rigmarole.

1159
01:46:21,342 --> 01:46:22,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll stop so we can get a roll done.

1160
01:46:22,983 --> 01:46:24,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Member Intoppa's hand up.

1161
01:46:26,066 --> 01:46:26,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa?

1162
01:46:27,367 --> 01:46:30,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was kind of elaborating on that, Member Ruseau.

1163
01:46:30,691 --> 01:46:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, I don't

1164
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:35,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think, um, you know, I concur with the mayor's point.

1165
01:46:35,151 --> 01:46:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that.

1166
01:46:35,971 --> 01:46:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I know speaking, so this might be a point of personal privilege.

1167
01:46:39,412 --> 01:46:41,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I know being hired through the state system.

1168
01:46:42,393 --> 01:46:48,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hired to sub in on a contract basis and it had to be posted and I, you bring up the point of contract.

1169
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:53,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if the APA was the reason why we had to post it or for his mass state law.

1170
01:46:53,216 --> 01:46:54,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think we should go.

1171
01:46:54,957 --> 01:47:00,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should look back into what the law mandates in terms of job postings, because we had to do that for that reason.

1172
01:47:00,642 --> 01:47:05,986
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew the candidate, and that was me, but it had to be posted for it for that exact reason.

1173
01:47:06,267 --> 01:47:10,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to figure out why that is moving forward, obviously.

1174
01:47:11,011 --> 01:47:15,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, defer to not keep this held up.

1175
01:47:19,138 --> 01:47:19,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1176
01:47:19,578 --> 01:47:21,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Tapa, roll call?

1177
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:22,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Bradley.

1178
01:47:24,653 --> 01:47:24,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1179
01:47:26,014 --> 01:47:26,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

1180
01:47:27,754 --> 01:47:27,974
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1181
01:47:28,754 --> 01:47:29,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ataba.

1182
01:47:29,755 --> 01:47:29,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1183
01:47:30,595 --> 01:47:31,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade.

1184
01:47:31,896 --> 01:47:32,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1185
01:47:32,796 --> 01:47:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rideville.

1186
01:47:33,696 --> 01:47:33,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1187
01:47:34,577 --> 01:47:35,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1188
01:47:35,097 --> 01:47:35,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1189
01:47:35,337 --> 01:47:35,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1190
01:47:36,757 --> 01:47:36,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1191
01:47:37,017 --> 01:47:39,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1192
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:40,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Paper passes.

1193
01:47:46,221 --> 01:47:49,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Now on to first reading of the allergy policy offered by Member Ruseau.

1194
01:47:51,543 --> 01:47:52,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to waive the reading.

1195
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,801
[SPEAKER_17]: motion to waive the reading by member Graham, seconded by?

1196
01:47:55,821 --> 01:47:56,622
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

1197
01:47:57,542 --> 01:47:59,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade, roll call, please.

1198
01:48:04,766 --> 01:48:05,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Branley.

1199
01:48:06,066 --> 01:48:06,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1200
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:07,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

1201
01:48:07,707 --> 01:48:08,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I ask a question first?

1202
01:48:11,009 --> 01:48:12,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, oh, sorry, to waive the reading.

1203
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:13,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, go ahead.

1204
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:14,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Waive, yeah, just waive the reading.

1205
01:48:15,011 --> 01:48:16,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like, wait, that's not what I meant.

1206
01:48:17,232 --> 01:48:17,912
[SPEAKER_04]: He made the motion.

1207
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:19,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

1208
01:48:20,093 --> 01:48:20,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1209
01:48:21,394 --> 01:48:22,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Antafa.

1210
01:48:22,703 --> 01:48:23,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1211
01:48:23,764 --> 01:48:25,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1212
01:48:26,206 --> 01:48:26,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1213
01:48:27,127 --> 01:48:28,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1214
01:48:28,328 --> 01:48:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1215
01:48:29,189 --> 01:48:29,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1216
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:29,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1217
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:30,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lengelker.

1218
01:48:31,291 --> 01:48:31,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1219
01:48:35,716 --> 01:48:37,658
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in motion passes.

1220
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:42,402
[SPEAKER_17]: So Member Ruseau, would you like me to summarize or do you want to give a summary?

1221
01:48:43,723 --> 01:48:44,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither.

1222
01:48:44,064 --> 01:48:47,247
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to just move on to the members who want to speak on it.

1223
01:48:53,962 --> 01:48:57,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, does anybody want to speak on it specifically?

1224
01:48:57,345 --> 01:48:58,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa?

1225
01:48:58,066 --> 01:49:04,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll defer to Member Graham, because Member Graham had the question pop up while we were voting on the first reading.

1226
01:49:04,191 --> 01:49:06,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll defer to Member Graham first, if that's okay.

1227
01:49:06,392 --> 01:49:10,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Member Graham, then Member Intoppa.

1228
01:49:10,436 --> 01:49:13,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just hoping somebody could give us some background on this policy.

1229
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:15,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, did it exist before?

1230
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:17,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it changing in some way?

1231
01:49:17,442 --> 01:49:20,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what is the, like, backstory of it?

1232
01:49:23,079 --> 01:49:35,285
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think on the call, we have the Director of Nursing, Jennifer Silva, and I do know that we have Shanine Peliquin, I see on the call, and she was also instrumental in this policy.

1233
01:49:35,345 --> 01:49:42,428
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this time, I think it would be great to hear from Director Silva to just provide a little bit of an overview.

1234
01:49:42,448 --> 01:49:43,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that okay?

1235
01:49:43,849 --> 01:49:44,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information.

1236
01:49:44,609 --> 01:49:47,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information.

1237
01:49:48,231 --> 01:49:49,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Member Russell.

1238
01:49:50,096 --> 01:49:52,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is in fact a new policy.

1239
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:54,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get that answer done.

1240
01:49:54,604 --> 01:49:54,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1241
01:49:54,964 --> 01:49:59,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you everyone.

1242
01:49:59,111 --> 01:50:01,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been alone for 2 hours and now all my kids are back.

1243
01:50:01,956 --> 01:50:03,859
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just wondering if that's loud.

1244
01:50:04,638 --> 01:50:16,121
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all here, so we had some protocols in place previously, but they were very basic and didn't really address everything that we felt needed to be addressed in a life threatening allergy policy.

1245
01:50:17,241 --> 01:50:23,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Really looking at this and again, I apologize that this is such a long policy, but I'll explain a little bit about how it got to this place.

1246
01:50:24,543 --> 01:50:31,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we were looking at this, we really wanted to emphasize that there's this shared responsibility among all stakeholders to really keep students safe.

1247
01:50:31,726 --> 01:50:48,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we can't guarantee an allergen-free environment, but really we can make it our goal for everyone to minimize exposure for students, to really educate everyone from all members of the school community, students, families, all of our staff about food allergies and all allergies.

1248
01:50:49,191 --> 01:51:00,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, how do we respond effectively to these issues and how do we provide equitable access to all students and really mitigate the social emotional impact of students who are managing life-threatening allergies?

1249
01:51:00,877 --> 01:51:09,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the policy does is it looks very repetitive because it basically breaks down each person's role within the school community.

1250
01:51:10,182 --> 01:51:14,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way when there's like, oh, I am a para, what am I responsible for?

1251
01:51:14,684 --> 01:51:18,126
[SPEAKER_08]: We can just hand you the page that talks about para's responsibilities.

1252
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:26,173
[SPEAKER_08]: When the PTO is coming and asking a question about what they can provide, we can just hand them the page that talks about PTO and what the policy is for PTOs.

1253
01:51:26,653 --> 01:51:33,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a 24-page policy because it goes through each and every person who is involved in that shared responsibility.

1254
01:51:35,801 --> 01:51:37,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that clarification.

1255
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:52,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my other question, so I have another question, which is, who provided input to this policy as it's currently drafted?

1256
01:51:54,515 --> 01:51:56,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So it began with Avery Hines before she left.

1257
01:51:57,075 --> 01:52:01,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself, Greta Smith, Shanine Peloquin, Karen Roberto.

1258
01:52:03,337 --> 01:52:04,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Shanine, am I forgetting anybody?

1259
01:52:10,052 --> 01:52:12,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we did ask the at the.

1260
01:52:15,963 --> 01:52:21,653
[SPEAKER_18]: 1st, support group, if there was anything in particular that families wanted to have and it also is input from.

1261
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:38,380
[SPEAKER_18]: families that I've spoken to but is mostly modeled on the Food Allergy Research and Education, which is a national model, on their best practices that they have gathered from all of the other leading allergy organizations for policies in schools.

1262
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:48,765
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was actually what the CDC, it's consistent with the CDC recommendations and the state of Massachusetts, and so it's a pretty robust program and well-researched.

1263
01:52:51,738 --> 01:52:52,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.

1264
01:52:52,478 --> 01:53:04,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I agree that it is very thoughtful in terms of laying out best practice, but I think there are some policy questions that need to be answered that we're not going to answer tonight.

1265
01:53:06,287 --> 01:53:10,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the things on my mind are that we are imposing.

1266
01:53:12,582 --> 01:53:28,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Requirements on people that are not really required to follow our policy, like, and I think everyone in good spirit wants to obviously work collaboratively together, but to write a policy where we can't really govern enforcement is challenging.

1267
01:53:30,148 --> 01:53:35,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also be very interested to hear from some of our athletic coaches, because they have.

1268
01:53:37,267 --> 01:53:54,777
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a very unique perspective on this and the other thing that is on my mind is when we talk about the responsibilities of various people in this process, like, there are, we have labor bargaining agreements and job descriptions for all of these roles.

1269
01:53:54,837 --> 01:54:00,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I do think we need to take some time to say whether what we have outlined here sort of.

1270
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:07,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Is in conflict in some way, because there may be some bargaining issues that come out of this that we need to.

1271
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:21,458
[SPEAKER_10]: To do, and I, I appreciate the best practice guide, but I am, I felt like the policy part of it got a little bit lost in the sauce because this is so long.

1272
01:54:22,018 --> 01:54:28,324
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I am wondering if there is sort of a. A different way to put this forward.

1273
01:54:30,105 --> 01:54:43,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are I'll defer to my colleagues, but as somebody with a life threatening allergy, I appreciate the thoughtfulness here, but I would personally like to see the policy guidance be.

1274
01:54:44,831 --> 01:54:47,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe more precise and potentially.

1275
01:54:49,353 --> 01:55:01,355
[SPEAKER_10]: more targeted at different educational levels, because I think what happens and what we would expect in an elementary school and what happens and what we would expect in a high school could be different.

1276
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:03,015
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just would want to have that conversation.

1277
01:55:03,115 --> 01:55:18,138
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do have some questions about how can we make this more clear and concise from a policy perspective, and how do we let that work in tandem with the best practices that are here and not run afoul of our union contracts and all of those other things.

1278
01:55:25,023 --> 01:55:26,844
[SPEAKER_02]: John, you're up awesome.

1279
01:55:27,064 --> 01:55:27,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1280
01:55:27,585 --> 01:55:30,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thank you for putting this together.

1281
01:55:30,867 --> 01:55:32,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very nice read.

1282
01:55:32,107 --> 01:55:37,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also nice to read that from my experience and from talking with.

1283
01:55:38,351 --> 01:55:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of our, um.

1284
01:55:41,693 --> 01:55:49,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Lunchroom workers for lunch appreciation day that a lot of these protocols already being followed and a lot of these are already kind of.

1285
01:55:50,529 --> 01:55:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: being done.

1286
01:55:51,230 --> 01:56:02,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, correct me if I'm wrong, Director Silva, when it comes to coaching staff and allergies, the majority is already being implemented, especially with epinephrine in training.

1287
01:56:02,318 --> 01:56:05,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't they supposed to be going through all this training already?

1288
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

1289
01:56:07,522 --> 01:56:11,905
[SPEAKER_08]: They do the allergy training and they get training on how to give the epinephrine.

1290
01:56:12,853 --> 01:56:13,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1291
01:56:13,534 --> 01:56:20,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, so if I may, because, you know, member Graham brings up the question of policy, how much of this is already.

1292
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:25,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Practice that is being done and how much of it is.

1293
01:56:26,245 --> 01:56:29,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Newer in terms of what we'd like to see the district move forward with.

1294
01:56:29,988 --> 01:56:33,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if that's a loaded question.

1295
01:56:33,371 --> 01:56:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that's a larger answer than what we can do tonight, but I'm just I'm just curious.

1296
01:56:38,245 --> 01:56:41,890
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd probably say at least 75% of this is already being done.

1297
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:46,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we're looking at is involving more staff and being trained.

1298
01:56:46,575 --> 01:56:58,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So what, you know, School Health at the end of every year does a survey on who gives epinephrine during the school day when there's an allergic reaction, and it is 98% of the time given by a school nurse.

1299
01:56:59,189 --> 01:57:20,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we really want to look at is we want more people to be trained, and that is one of the biggest recurring pieces through this, is that it needs to be a more shared responsibility, and the more people that are trained and that can give it might prevent, you know, death, really, when it comes to it, because we know that anaphylaxis can result in death very quickly, and so we want to make sure that people feel comfortable being able to give that rescue medication.

1300
01:57:21,401 --> 01:57:22,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

1301
01:57:22,463 --> 01:57:30,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of the things that came up for me that seem newer I'm assuming the PTO guidelines are of that other 25%, right.

1302
01:57:30,795 --> 01:57:34,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I think, for me in terms of bake sales.

1303
01:57:37,872 --> 01:57:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that some of those policies in place and, uh, you know, for the sake of this, I mean, I lost it already because acrobat went all the way to the top.

1304
01:57:46,095 --> 01:57:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1305
01:57:46,875 --> 01:57:56,998
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in terms of what happens within the buildings with allergen awareness, I think we have that jurisdiction to say, look, like, you need to put this post as you need to put this signage, because that is something that, um.

1306
01:57:57,798 --> 01:58:02,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe overlooked in terms of, like, we can't guarantee anything and sometimes that feels like.

1307
01:58:04,627 --> 01:58:13,990
[SPEAKER_02]: As anyone who has an allergy feels like a scapegoat like they're just doing this to cover their butt, and that you know it's probably fine but now you've put this fear into me that it's not, but we really do for liabilities that we need to say this.

1308
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:25,573
[SPEAKER_02]: But also because you know gluten is airborne, which some people may not know is that a gluten free kitchen, the airborne so you can clean all your pots all you want but it's airborne it's airborne.

1309
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:31,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was it in terms of questions for now.

1310
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:43,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only thing I also had was an amendment to the policy statement where it says it's literally the first sentence for some of our students.

1311
01:58:43,179 --> 01:58:47,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also include staff because staff are going to be caught in the crossfire with some of this stuff.

1312
01:58:47,702 --> 01:58:54,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So in declaring that we acknowledge that allergies are a problem for our students, also acknowledging that it's a problem for our faculty and staff.

1313
01:58:55,668 --> 01:59:16,155
[SPEAKER_02]: because if a student improperly washes their hands or a student improperly does something, and then they interact with the educator who has an allergy, I don't know how many cases we've had of that happen within the district, none that I've heard of, but I would like to see that be seen just in the, that's the only amendment I really have currently is to just add and staff to the first sentence.

1314
01:59:17,996 --> 01:59:18,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for doing the work.

1315
01:59:19,336 --> 01:59:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I think the mayor's back, but I'll say defer to Eric, member Rentfeld.

1316
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:26,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Member Reinfeld, thank you.

1317
01:59:27,331 --> 01:59:27,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1318
01:59:27,792 --> 01:59:31,455
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to repeat what colleagues have said.

1319
01:59:31,775 --> 01:59:35,679
[SPEAKER_19]: When I saw this just a couple of days ago, I know it's been in the works.

1320
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:39,883
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate the background on where it came from.

1321
01:59:40,023 --> 01:59:47,911
[SPEAKER_19]: And I had some similar concerns around what here is policy and what is protocol and what is education.

1322
01:59:47,991 --> 01:59:49,892
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we have a robust

1323
01:59:51,327 --> 01:59:57,889
[SPEAKER_19]: health services page that has information about various medical conditions.

1324
01:59:57,949 --> 02:00:15,113
[SPEAKER_19]: I think everything in here is incredibly important, incredibly valuable, but I would like to make a motion to move this to the rules and policies subcommittee to kind of sort out what is education, what are the protocols, and I think these protocol sheets

1325
02:00:15,833 --> 02:00:31,054
[SPEAKER_19]: should be absolutely distributed and I don't think moving this to subcommittee would prevent it from going from being implement those protocols to be implemented in the upcoming school year because I imagine we really do want to have this in place for that but

1326
02:00:33,698 --> 02:00:41,406
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be really helpful because if I want this information, I'm probably not going to the school committee policy page to find it.

1327
02:00:41,766 --> 02:00:47,571
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to a handbook to resources with other resources within the district.

1328
02:00:47,652 --> 02:00:50,374
[SPEAKER_19]: So my motion is to send this

1329
02:00:51,395 --> 02:01:13,985
[SPEAKER_19]: to the policy subcommittee, and that I think would also open it up to get some of the input that other people have mentioned from staff, from levels, and from athletics, and potentially the PTOs as well, which I think is really important, particularly having an event where we had someone come in and basically didn't follow this policy.

1330
02:01:14,586 --> 02:01:15,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Cheney knows what I'm talking about.

1331
02:01:17,067 --> 02:01:18,247
[SPEAKER_19]: She was at that event as well.

1332
02:01:18,607 --> 02:01:19,968
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's my motion.

1333
02:01:22,255 --> 02:01:23,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

1334
02:01:23,455 --> 02:01:26,296
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to pass it off to Member Topper and then Member Ruseau.

1335
02:01:26,316 --> 02:01:30,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was Member Ruseau first, if that's all right.

1336
02:01:31,919 --> 02:01:34,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Your hand's in front of Member Ruseau's on the participant list.

1337
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying.

1338
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:37,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1339
02:01:38,221 --> 02:01:39,181
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not your fault.

1340
02:01:39,261 --> 02:01:40,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously the platform.

1341
02:01:43,443 --> 02:01:43,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, John.

1342
02:01:44,616 --> 02:01:47,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just going to say I did notice in the policy.

1343
02:01:48,138 --> 02:01:52,301
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I forgot to mention, I sort of mentioned this of, like, some of the new things we saw during lunch here today.

1344
02:01:52,421 --> 02:02:02,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do appreciate, by the way, the section that is sort of tidbits of what children may say if they're experiencing an allergic reaction for the first time in terms of what

1345
02:02:02,668 --> 02:02:13,898
[SPEAKER_02]: How they feel because they may not be able to articulate that and the fact that that is if I'm not mistaken posted on the like refrigerators and ovens at the at the elementary schools.

1346
02:02:13,958 --> 02:02:26,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way it is of ease of access for our lunch servers to sort of in prep workers and chefs to see that So I did want to make that note as someone who was behind that wall for the first time ever.

1347
02:02:27,387 --> 02:02:33,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That seeing all that information readily available, which is being put into this as well is super cool.

1348
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:34,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a small note of appreciation.

1349
02:02:34,736 --> 02:02:35,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1350
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:40,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, next up is me, I take it and.

1351
02:02:45,381 --> 02:02:46,022
[SPEAKER_04]: What was my question?

1352
02:02:46,102 --> 02:02:46,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1353
02:02:46,902 --> 02:02:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a new policy.

1354
02:02:48,303 --> 02:02:50,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So just sort of some background.

1355
02:02:50,865 --> 02:02:56,650
[SPEAKER_04]: If the school committee has no policy, the superintendent is the policymaker until we have made a policy.

1356
02:02:56,750 --> 02:03:03,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's nothing that prevents this from, frankly, being the policy until we approve a policy.

1357
02:03:05,257 --> 02:03:06,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that

1358
02:03:08,685 --> 02:03:11,468
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no urgency for us to have this done tonight.

1359
02:03:11,968 --> 02:03:22,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be if the superintendent agrees that this is what it should be until we have said otherwise or approved this one, then there is no policy of the school committee.

1360
02:03:22,579 --> 02:03:25,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think there's any reason to be concerned about.

1361
02:03:26,783 --> 02:03:28,023
[SPEAKER_04]: sending this to subcommittee.

1362
02:03:28,564 --> 02:03:32,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want anybody to think we're going to be without a policy until then.

1363
02:03:33,725 --> 02:03:41,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll second that motion to send the management of life-threatening allergies policy to the rules and policy subcommittee.

1364
02:03:46,849 --> 02:03:49,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, motion on the floor by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1365
02:03:50,997 --> 02:03:51,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call, please.

1366
02:03:52,538 --> 02:03:54,039
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a public comment.

1367
02:03:54,099 --> 02:03:54,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that?

1368
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:55,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1369
02:03:56,581 --> 02:03:58,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Shanine, name and address for the record, please.

1370
02:03:59,463 --> 02:04:01,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Shanine Pelequin, 108 Bell Ave.

1371
02:04:03,466 --> 02:04:10,952
[SPEAKER_18]: I think one of the intents in this was, one, to make sure that we address

1372
02:04:11,827 --> 02:04:24,296
[SPEAKER_18]: The issues that we know that we have, and I will let Director Silva address any of those that she would like to share, because as a district, there have been incidents that are really unsafe.

1373
02:04:25,016 --> 02:04:28,158
[SPEAKER_18]: And so clarifying everyone's roles is really important there.

1374
02:04:28,699 --> 02:04:40,947
[SPEAKER_18]: But also one of the things that I hear a lot is that staff have mixed levels of comfort in giving an EpiPen, which means that depending on who my kid is in a room with, his epinephrine could be delayed.

1375
02:04:41,608 --> 02:04:51,094
[SPEAKER_18]: which could result in him dying because somebody didn't feel like they had permission or sufficient training or it's a custodian instead of a teacher or it's a para or whatever.

1376
02:04:51,815 --> 02:04:56,798
[SPEAKER_18]: And the more minutes epinephrine is delayed, the more bad outcomes.

1377
02:04:57,499 --> 02:05:06,645
[SPEAKER_18]: So even at the state level, we're having conversations about bills that would enable police officers to carry epinephrine and stores to have it and to train people.

1378
02:05:06,685 --> 02:05:10,888
[SPEAKER_18]: So the movement is towards broad training and, um,

1379
02:05:11,677 --> 02:05:38,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Comfort in giving an EpiPen because there's not a bad outcome if you give it and it wasn't needed But there is if you delay it and so I really want to make sure that we Think about how we're going to empower everyone in the district to feel more comfortable and have that training as part of this as well as as a parent we just are my I'm watching my kid get excluded and

1380
02:05:39,123 --> 02:05:43,206
[SPEAKER_18]: over and over and over again because people don't think about it.

1381
02:05:44,186 --> 02:05:46,688
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, there's the psychosocial impact of this as well.

1382
02:05:48,049 --> 02:06:00,677
[SPEAKER_18]: And just as a note, and I think that it would be great to clarify with the legal team as well, but from an ADA perspective, food allergies are a disability under the ADA.

1383
02:06:01,618 --> 02:06:02,999
[SPEAKER_18]: And without

1384
02:06:04,077 --> 02:06:07,820
[SPEAKER_18]: its relationship with the school district, none of the PTOs would exist.

1385
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:09,501
[SPEAKER_18]: They receive substantial support.

1386
02:06:09,921 --> 02:06:23,591
[SPEAKER_18]: So for the same reason that we added that inclusion statement a few years ago, this is inclusion for kids with food allergies, and the PTO is subject to the ADA due to its relationship with substantial support from the school system.

1387
02:06:24,212 --> 02:06:30,736
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't think we can say, oh, we don't get any say over the PTOs because we have some, and I would love that clarified.

1388
02:06:31,577 --> 02:06:31,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1389
02:06:35,036 --> 02:06:48,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say for a note for the motion there was also a motion made by myself that to amend sentence one to add and staff next to students.

1390
02:06:55,424 --> 02:06:56,124
[SPEAKER_17]: member Roselle.

1391
02:06:56,745 --> 02:06:57,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1392
02:06:57,545 --> 02:07:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I do have some concerns about the and staff expecting five year olds to take care of the adults is what we're talking about here.

1393
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm not.

1394
02:07:12,934 --> 02:07:13,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not real.

1395
02:07:13,794 --> 02:07:20,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really thought much about how our students have to, um

1396
02:07:21,577 --> 02:07:26,202
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have adults in the school who work there who have life-threatening allergies.

1397
02:07:28,664 --> 02:07:39,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But whether five-year-olds are properly washing their hands or not, and whether that staff member's life is at risk, I assume that they're at risk.

1398
02:07:40,443 --> 02:07:47,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Frankly, and I assume that as an adult, they are doing what they need to do to limit that risk.

1399
02:07:47,811 --> 02:07:58,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think having kindergartners bear any responsibility or have any policy that suggests that they have any responsibility to keeping their teachers

1400
02:08:00,537 --> 02:08:00,877
[SPEAKER_04]: safe.

1401
02:08:01,798 --> 02:08:04,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't know developmentally how that works.

1402
02:08:04,839 --> 02:08:07,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a policy must be enforceable.

1403
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:10,121
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the basic tenet of policy.

1404
02:08:11,042 --> 02:08:21,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my mind, and I do think we need to talk about the PTO thing, because what does enforcement look like if a PTO refuses to comply?

1405
02:08:22,833 --> 02:08:31,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to say one school will have no PTO or that certain members of the PTO cannot be a part of the PTO?

1406
02:08:31,056 --> 02:08:35,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Because membership in PTOs is not something we have ever had anything to say about.

1407
02:08:35,697 --> 02:08:38,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the definition of a PTO is all parents.

1408
02:08:39,617 --> 02:08:41,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Our members period.

1409
02:08:41,778 --> 02:08:55,886
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think, implement that I'm just really think it's important that whatever we end up with her policy language, it is implement double and enforceable and so the, the inclusion of and staff.

1410
02:08:56,546 --> 02:09:08,053
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as that, and when I was reviewing this with Director Silva, the PTO was one of the first things I had to comment on was, well, how do we enforce this?

1411
02:09:08,093 --> 02:09:09,314
[SPEAKER_04]: These people don't work for us.

1412
02:09:09,354 --> 02:09:11,135
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't take their keys away.

1413
02:09:11,215 --> 02:09:13,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't write them up.

1414
02:09:15,738 --> 02:09:17,199
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't make them come to training.

1415
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:24,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not saying we don't put systems in place to try and have less of a possible negative outcome.

1416
02:09:27,597 --> 02:09:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: what that looks like should be spelled out, because policy should be enforceable, or it's just us trying to feel good.

1417
02:09:35,983 --> 02:09:36,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my opinion.

1418
02:09:37,184 --> 02:09:37,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1419
02:09:46,471 --> 02:09:46,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1420
02:09:46,691 --> 02:09:47,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Silva?

1421
02:09:48,332 --> 02:09:50,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ntaba, did you want to speak again?

1422
02:09:50,734 --> 02:09:51,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1423
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:59,392
[SPEAKER_02]: The intent is not to infer that five-year-olds are gonna be responsible for a 43-year-old staff member to go into anaphylactic shock.

1424
02:09:59,532 --> 02:10:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is saying is that staff will take care of staff, but also the way I interpret the reading, it's not saying, it's just a background is what it seems like.

1425
02:10:09,835 --> 02:10:12,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's merely stating that we're keeping everyone safe.

1426
02:10:13,036 --> 02:10:13,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the gist of it.

1427
02:10:13,896 --> 02:10:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I included and staff.

1428
02:10:15,736 --> 02:10:20,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't intend to think that a kindergartner will be held liable

1429
02:10:21,532 --> 02:10:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: because their teacher goes into anaphylactic shock because, yes, they pose that risk.

1430
02:10:24,894 --> 02:10:27,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They know it's the same thing as getting sick with cold season.

1431
02:10:27,175 --> 02:10:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: There is that thing.

1432
02:10:27,975 --> 02:10:30,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a policy statement.

1433
02:10:30,476 --> 02:10:37,139
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of the policy that it's just a mere statement saying that we're trying to keep people safe, which is why I asked for that.

1434
02:10:37,219 --> 02:10:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the committee is not comfortable because it'll be somehow legally binding to include and staff, that's fine.

1435
02:10:44,397 --> 02:10:45,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a feel good.

1436
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:48,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a I don't want to try to sue first graders.

1437
02:10:48,659 --> 02:10:53,101
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that's the mere fact is it's a statement that we're trying to keep everyone safe.

1438
02:10:53,561 --> 02:10:56,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just students to staff or staff to students.

1439
02:10:56,763 --> 02:10:58,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also staff to staff and students to students.

1440
02:10:58,904 --> 02:11:00,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

1441
02:11:00,845 --> 02:11:02,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is really.

1442
02:11:02,365 --> 02:11:02,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1443
02:11:07,448 --> 02:11:07,788
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over.

1444
02:11:09,461 --> 02:11:11,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I just wanted to echo that as well.

1445
02:11:11,203 --> 02:11:16,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that when we're making this statement as a workplace, we also have a responsibility to keep staff safe.

1446
02:11:16,507 --> 02:11:19,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I feel like that's the intention there of including staff as well.

1447
02:11:19,649 --> 02:11:21,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I thank you for that.

1448
02:11:22,872 --> 02:11:23,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I also just wanted to.

1449
02:11:24,713 --> 02:11:30,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say 2 things that I think that we need to move on from here because it's getting late, but I think that, um.

1450
02:11:30,958 --> 02:11:41,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to include that there is a new medication that is intranasal epinephrine, and so I'm hoping that that will make a lot of our staff members more comfortable when they're being trained to give it versus an injection.

1451
02:11:41,807 --> 02:11:50,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the concern about PTOs is, I think, really around things that they're doing during school hours when other parents are not present.

1452
02:11:51,295 --> 02:12:01,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So they sometimes will do pizza parties for kids or they will do different celebrations or offer like candy rewards for certain things that are happening during the school day.

1453
02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:06,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think in that regard, we can govern what they do within our building during the school day.

1454
02:12:06,181 --> 02:12:15,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think a lot of this is sort of looking at that sort of activity, not necessarily what PTOs are doing after hours when parents are present or there's sort of other things going on.

1455
02:12:18,146 --> 02:12:18,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ms.

1456
02:12:18,587 --> 02:12:18,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Silva.

1457
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:28,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, and I think when we talk about this in subcommittee, I would want to make sure that we're inviting people in because.

1458
02:12:28,235 --> 02:12:39,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I watched this happen in real time where Avery threw down the hammer about allergies and the reaction from the PTO was like.

1459
02:12:41,584 --> 02:12:45,627
[SPEAKER_10]: What we're just trying to do a good thing here and now you're you have, like.

1460
02:12:46,417 --> 02:12:51,706
[SPEAKER_10]: at the very last minute you have ruined this plan and we have no alternative and there's no help for us.

1461
02:12:52,227 --> 02:12:59,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just don't want this policy to become a reason for PTOs to feel

1462
02:12:59,857 --> 02:13:02,858
[SPEAKER_10]: like they should disengage because I don't think we want that at all.

1463
02:13:02,878 --> 02:13:05,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think that's the spirit or the intent.

1464
02:13:06,038 --> 02:13:18,620
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do want the Rules and Policy Committee to invite coaches and PTOs in particular to talk through, like, what are the things that, like, what are the rules of engagement?

1465
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:22,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if we're talking about just the school day, then a bake sale is probably not a problem.

1466
02:13:22,501 --> 02:13:27,302
[SPEAKER_10]: But this, as written, talks about how bake sales should happen

1467
02:13:27,822 --> 02:13:29,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And that generally is outside of the school day.

1468
02:13:29,923 --> 02:13:43,530
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want their heads at the table so that we can collaborate on something that doesn't feel like we're imposing something that is insurmountable on them because I don't think this is insurmountable.

1469
02:13:44,490 --> 02:13:48,232
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think if you were handed a 20 something page policy like

1470
02:13:49,125 --> 02:13:52,448
[SPEAKER_10]: it would be real easy to sort of feel overwhelmed by that.

1471
02:13:52,468 --> 02:13:53,709
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just don't want that to be the case.

1472
02:13:53,749 --> 02:14:03,897
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we can have some thoughtful discussion in subcommittee to make sure that this policy doesn't become a scapegoat on its own, because that's nobody's intention.

1473
02:14:03,957 --> 02:14:09,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think they will have real problems of practice to bring to the table.

1474
02:14:09,922 --> 02:14:12,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of, I think, good can come of that conversation.

1475
02:14:18,842 --> 02:14:19,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1476
02:14:19,942 --> 02:14:26,745
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think the motion on the floor stands, and it was seconded to move this into subcommittee.

1477
02:14:26,765 --> 02:14:29,326
[SPEAKER_17]: May I read the motion?

1478
02:14:29,947 --> 02:14:30,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that would be great.

1479
02:14:30,667 --> 02:14:30,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1480
02:14:31,607 --> 02:14:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion is to move the management of life-threatening allergies policy to the rules and policy subcommittee as amended to include staff in the policy statement.

1481
02:14:39,571 --> 02:14:42,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Invitations will be sent to coaches, PTOs, and other stakeholders.

1482
02:14:44,713 --> 02:14:45,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Branley.

1483
02:14:48,829 --> 02:14:49,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1484
02:14:50,131 --> 02:14:50,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1485
02:14:50,331 --> 02:14:50,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1486
02:14:50,491 --> 02:14:50,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1487
02:14:51,132 --> 02:14:51,352
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1488
02:14:52,073 --> 02:14:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1489
02:15:05,573 --> 02:15:07,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for all who contributed.

1490
02:15:07,214 --> 02:15:16,117
[SPEAKER_19]: And just to be clear, this still means that these guidelines can go out to the relevant parties as the current practice.

1491
02:15:16,477 --> 02:15:18,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I love the one-pagers.

1492
02:15:18,738 --> 02:15:20,299
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a great approach.

1493
02:15:21,519 --> 02:15:38,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just ask that we make sure we're not running afoul of our union contracts and changes in working condition and particularly tread lightly with our PTOs so that we don't create a problem for the subcommittee to have to unwind.

1494
02:15:43,437 --> 02:15:43,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1495
02:15:45,999 --> 02:15:50,643
[SPEAKER_17]: So paper passes with those thoughts in mind and we're going to go to

1496
02:15:50,963 --> 02:15:59,627
[SPEAKER_17]: page 25 of our agenda for our next item, which is the first reading of the field trip policy JJH offered by member Rousseau.

1497
02:16:00,747 --> 02:16:02,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to waive the reading?

1498
02:16:02,568 --> 02:16:03,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like me to read it?

1499
02:16:03,389 --> 02:16:06,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to waive the reading.

1500
02:16:07,010 --> 02:16:07,750
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember Graham.

1501
02:16:09,691 --> 02:16:10,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember Branley.

1502
02:16:10,772 --> 02:16:11,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody wants to hear my voice?

1503
02:16:13,153 --> 02:16:15,854
[SPEAKER_17]: You will have one by the time you finish that.

1504
02:16:15,994 --> 02:16:16,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1505
02:16:17,295 --> 02:16:17,955
[SPEAKER_17]: I meant thank you.

1506
02:16:18,563 --> 02:16:20,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, roll call, please.

1507
02:16:21,145 --> 02:16:21,945
[SPEAKER_17]: To waive the reading.

1508
02:16:22,485 --> 02:16:23,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And who first and consecutive?

1509
02:16:25,287 --> 02:16:27,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham and Member Branley jumped right on that.

1510
02:16:27,869 --> 02:16:28,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1511
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:30,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Branley.

1512
02:16:31,251 --> 02:16:31,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1513
02:16:32,051 --> 02:16:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

1514
02:16:32,932 --> 02:16:33,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1515
02:16:33,692 --> 02:16:34,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Intoppa.

1516
02:16:34,793 --> 02:16:34,993
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1517
02:16:35,533 --> 02:16:36,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade.

1518
02:16:36,534 --> 02:16:36,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1519
02:16:37,414 --> 02:16:38,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1520
02:16:38,535 --> 02:16:38,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1521
02:16:39,296 --> 02:16:41,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1522
02:16:41,357 --> 02:16:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1523
02:16:41,677 --> 02:16:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Langenkern.

1524
02:16:43,158 --> 02:16:43,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1525
02:16:43,498 --> 02:16:44,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1526
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:48,001
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to waive the reading has been approved.

1527
02:16:52,181 --> 02:16:53,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau, I know this is your motion.

1528
02:16:53,442 --> 02:16:53,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to start?

1529
02:16:53,962 --> 02:16:54,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want the same thing?

1530
02:16:54,963 --> 02:16:56,484
[SPEAKER_17]: You want people to ask questions?

1531
02:16:57,104 --> 02:17:00,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that because it's long.

1532
02:17:01,107 --> 02:17:02,228
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a field trip policy.

1533
02:17:08,914 --> 02:17:09,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa.

1534
02:17:11,576 --> 02:17:12,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

1535
02:17:12,136 --> 02:17:15,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, is this just the policy that you were talking about?

1536
02:17:16,495 --> 02:17:23,137
[SPEAKER_02]: A few weeks ago where it's like we had one and then we've been going by it, but it wasn't in the policy bank and now this is the reupload of it.

1537
02:17:23,217 --> 02:17:25,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that is that what this one is with the field trips?

1538
02:17:26,198 --> 02:17:27,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that a different one?

1539
02:17:28,358 --> 02:17:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, there are so many for which that scenario describes that I don't recall.

1540
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:34,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be.

1541
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:42,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was a nursing approval of field trips form policy thing as well, which I don't think isn't clear.

1542
02:17:42,755 --> 02:17:50,839
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's the one, because I remember something about field trips, and I saw Director Sullivan nod her head, and I see the superintendent has her hand raised, so I'll be quick.

1543
02:17:52,299 --> 02:17:58,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was just a clarifying question, because I remember you said one of them were coming down the pipeline, and I wasn't sure if it was this one or not.

1544
02:18:00,543 --> 02:18:06,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have any questions, and I'll defer to the superintendent.

1545
02:18:06,906 --> 02:18:08,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Galusi, do you still have a comment?

1546
02:18:11,608 --> 02:18:12,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that okay, Mayor?

1547
02:18:13,327 --> 02:18:13,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, please.

1548
02:18:14,028 --> 02:18:15,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1549
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:18,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, yes, Director Silva probably knows more about this.

1550
02:18:18,832 --> 02:18:24,217
[SPEAKER_15]: To my knowledge, this is an update from our existing field trip policy.

1551
02:18:24,397 --> 02:18:33,726
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that Dr. Cushing worked extensively with Director Silva and Director Smith on this field trip policy.

1552
02:18:33,846 --> 02:18:35,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Were there other people involved, Jen?

1553
02:18:36,909 --> 02:18:37,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1554
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:40,272
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to make that a point of clarification.

1555
02:18:45,113 --> 02:18:45,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1556
02:18:46,654 --> 02:18:49,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau.

1557
02:18:49,616 --> 02:19:00,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to point out that the policy that's in the manual is from who knows when, which is not what people have been doing.

1558
02:19:00,983 --> 02:19:07,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is one of those scenarios where folks have been operating under a policy we approved but never made it into the manual.

1559
02:19:07,988 --> 02:19:13,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So the difference looks massive if you look at our current policy manual, but it is

1560
02:19:15,186 --> 02:19:17,230
[SPEAKER_04]: not operationally a huge change.

1561
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:22,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you member Ruseau.

1562
02:19:22,682 --> 02:19:23,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

1563
02:19:24,265 --> 02:19:24,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1564
02:19:26,047 --> 02:19:28,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have, I had a couple of questions.

1565
02:19:29,509 --> 02:19:38,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we can really answer them tonight, but there were a number of things listed in here around costs and fundraising associated with field trips.

1566
02:19:39,195 --> 02:19:55,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that we have a pending item in the rules and policy subcommittee that is related around district reimbursement of, let's call it like,

1567
02:19:56,419 --> 02:20:00,740
[SPEAKER_10]: next level events like championship events or like finals kinds of things.

1568
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:03,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I made the playoffs kinds of activities.

1569
02:20:05,021 --> 02:20:13,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, I know the rules and policy subcommittee meeting had to postpone that meeting in part because of my schedule.

1570
02:20:13,263 --> 02:20:24,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So my apologies, but I feel like it would be wise for us to review this and the fundraising aspects of this policy, like at the same time, as we're talking about,

1571
02:20:25,599 --> 02:20:30,580
[SPEAKER_10]: funding and fundraising for field trips, essentially, is what they boil down to, right?

1572
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,781
[SPEAKER_10]: And just a couple of things that flagged, again, were around PTOs.

1573
02:20:36,081 --> 02:20:41,722
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, for example, it says, under no circumstances should private cash transfer applications be utilized.

1574
02:20:42,142 --> 02:20:49,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, our PTOs have, like, legitimate setups in, like, Venmo and other places.

1575
02:20:49,304 --> 02:20:50,984
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're saying they can't do that,

1576
02:20:52,242 --> 02:20:53,803
[SPEAKER_10]: then that's like a consideration.

1577
02:20:53,843 --> 02:20:55,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we just need to play out a little bit.

1578
02:20:56,004 --> 02:21:03,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I do think there are some like fundraising, um, components of this policy that I want to spend a little bit more time on.

1579
02:21:03,667 --> 02:21:11,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to make a motion that this also go to the rules and policy subcommittee for, um, review before it comes back.

1580
02:21:14,512 --> 02:21:18,073
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor to send this to the rules and policy subcommittee.

1581
02:21:18,133 --> 02:21:18,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

1582
02:21:19,374 --> 02:21:20,094
[SPEAKER_19]: I can second that.

1583
02:21:21,365 --> 02:21:23,767
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember Reinfeld roll call.

1584
02:21:27,469 --> 02:21:28,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Branley?

1585
02:21:28,489 --> 02:21:28,730
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1586
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:30,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

1587
02:21:30,691 --> 02:21:30,911
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1588
02:21:31,651 --> 02:21:32,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Intoppa?

1589
02:21:35,394 --> 02:21:36,535
[SPEAKER_04]: You switched the wrong way, John.

1590
02:21:39,616 --> 02:21:40,077
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a yes?

1591
02:21:40,717 --> 02:21:41,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1592
02:21:41,558 --> 02:21:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why this is so sensitive.

1593
02:21:44,199 --> 02:21:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade?

1594
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:45,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1595
02:21:46,661 --> 02:21:47,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

1596
02:21:47,641 --> 02:21:47,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1597
02:21:48,462 --> 02:21:48,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rossell?

1598
02:21:48,962 --> 02:21:49,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1599
02:21:50,773 --> 02:21:52,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

1600
02:21:53,675 --> 02:21:56,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Paper goes into the rules and policy subcommittee.

1601
02:21:56,276 --> 02:22:05,741
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna go to the next item on page 35, which is policy IKFC-MCAS offered by member Intoppa.

1602
02:22:06,862 --> 02:22:07,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to waive the reading.

1603
02:22:08,503 --> 02:22:11,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to waive the reading by member Graham, seconded by.

1604
02:22:13,026 --> 02:22:13,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1605
02:22:14,266 --> 02:22:15,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfelds.

1606
02:22:16,427 --> 02:22:17,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call, please.

1607
02:22:24,606 --> 02:22:25,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Branley.

1608
02:22:25,647 --> 02:22:25,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1609
02:22:28,349 --> 02:22:28,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

1610
02:22:29,730 --> 02:22:29,910
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1611
02:22:30,651 --> 02:22:31,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Atapa.

1612
02:22:31,992 --> 02:22:32,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1613
02:22:32,813 --> 02:22:33,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade.

1614
02:22:33,914 --> 02:22:34,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1615
02:22:34,794 --> 02:22:35,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1616
02:22:35,755 --> 02:22:35,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1617
02:22:36,576 --> 02:22:37,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1618
02:22:37,296 --> 02:22:37,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1619
02:22:37,597 --> 02:22:38,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lincoln.

1620
02:22:39,278 --> 02:22:39,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1621
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:42,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1622
02:22:43,702 --> 02:22:45,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to waive the reading has been approved.

1623
02:22:50,141 --> 02:22:54,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Member and top of did you have any comments or you want to just start discussion?

1624
02:22:54,685 --> 02:22:56,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can start discussion.

1625
02:22:56,988 --> 02:23:06,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, what this is, is, as I was looking through our policy bank for another policy in terms of just informing the community on what's been kind of going on.

1626
02:23:06,777 --> 02:23:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I found this policy in our wrong tab in our policy bank, which basically still says that.

1627
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:16,881
[SPEAKER_02]: MCAS is still a requirement.

1628
02:23:16,941 --> 02:23:18,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a policy around the MCAS as a whole.

1629
02:23:19,003 --> 02:23:20,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very outdated policy.

1630
02:23:20,485 --> 02:23:29,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea was bring it to the committee so we can either strike it down here or refer it to some committee because there are other elements in this policy.

1631
02:23:29,873 --> 02:23:32,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not just MCAS.

1632
02:23:32,295 --> 02:23:38,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it seems like there's some like attendance and AP exams and credit for award of certificate of mastery and stuff like that.

1633
02:23:40,027 --> 02:23:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't to, for anyone reading this, it's not to implement this policy.

1634
02:23:44,169 --> 02:23:50,752
[SPEAKER_02]: It is that this policy is in our policy bank and we don't want it to conflict with our IKF graduation requirements.

1635
02:23:50,772 --> 02:23:54,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's to strike it or amend it so that way it no longer says this.

1636
02:23:55,494 --> 02:23:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, sure.

1637
02:23:57,835 --> 02:23:58,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau.

1638
02:23:59,356 --> 02:24:01,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, thank you.

1639
02:24:01,457 --> 02:24:08,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the motion to send this to the Policy and Rules Subcommittee to modify this policy or is there specific language to strike?

1640
02:24:11,198 --> 02:24:23,881
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely need to strike the language around MCAS, but I guess I wasn't sure what the best what the committee feels is the best procedure for this is to either just strike down the policy as a whole and rebuild it, or if it's to.

1641
02:24:25,642 --> 02:24:28,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Refer to subcommittee to then edit and then bring back.

1642
02:24:29,603 --> 02:24:30,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it anyway.

1643
02:24:32,824 --> 02:24:33,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor.

1644
02:24:35,508 --> 02:24:40,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I think we have member, Grand Member Reinfeld, and I also see Dr. Galussi has her hands up.

1645
02:24:40,154 --> 02:24:43,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know who you want to go first.

1646
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:46,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld's actually shown up on participants.

1647
02:24:49,406 --> 02:24:53,767
[SPEAKER_19]: I suspect what I was going to say was related to what Dr. Galussi might say about.

1648
02:24:54,468 --> 02:25:04,651
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to motion that we strike this policy and integrate the relevant language into IKF, everyone's favorite policy for the spring.

1649
02:25:07,492 --> 02:25:08,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham, then Dr. Galussi?

1650
02:25:09,773 --> 02:25:16,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as I read this, I don't think any of this applies or is relevant anymore.

1651
02:25:18,215 --> 02:25:20,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the whole thing could be rescinded in total.

1652
02:25:21,198 --> 02:25:25,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just make a motion to rescind this policy and be done with it.

1653
02:25:25,723 --> 02:25:27,586
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done so much work to IKF.

1654
02:25:27,686 --> 02:25:36,235
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing here that needs to be integrated in any way that I can see, because I think we've more than covered it.

1655
02:25:36,595 --> 02:25:39,459
[SPEAKER_10]: And frankly, we haven't been using this policy in probably forever anyway.

1656
02:25:40,405 --> 02:26:02,475
[SPEAKER_19]: My only reason for the integration, and then I promise I'll let Dr. Galussi speak, was that when we talked about the impact of ballot question two and removing MCAS as a graduation requirement, she was very clear in her presentation that there are reasons with the MCAS being offered and the benefits to students in terms of scholarships and

1657
02:26:03,375 --> 02:26:27,305
[SPEAKER_19]: that was a point that seemed important to the district and therefore I thought there could be a little section at the end over of of IKF for the describing that MCAS is administered and here are some of the things that the impact of that but I will let Dr. Galussi actually say what she was going to say.

1658
02:26:30,193 --> 02:26:30,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1659
02:26:30,593 --> 02:26:37,938
[SPEAKER_15]: I was actually going to say that I do feel that a lot of this is outdated, I think, and I don't feel we do need this policy.

1660
02:26:38,538 --> 02:26:50,685
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say, though, to your point, Member Reinfeld, I mean, even the language in this is a little outdated to some of those awards that students can't and scholarships that students can receive.

1661
02:26:52,026 --> 02:26:54,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Through MCAS, I'm happy to maybe

1662
02:26:56,056 --> 02:26:58,938
[SPEAKER_15]: update that policy again with more explanation.

1663
02:26:59,038 --> 02:27:09,383
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, five times the charm, but I do think that a lot of this language is not what's happening.

1664
02:27:10,263 --> 02:27:14,706
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very outdated, and I think it might just be more confusing.

1665
02:27:16,927 --> 02:27:19,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, then I second the motion to rescind.

1666
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:24,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Member Intoppa, are you good with that?

1667
02:27:25,370 --> 02:27:26,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to rescind.

1668
02:27:26,271 --> 02:27:26,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to rescind.

1669
02:27:27,411 --> 02:27:28,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, okay.

1670
02:27:28,111 --> 02:27:29,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for bringing it to our attention.

1671
02:27:29,811 --> 02:27:30,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call, please.

1672
02:27:31,332 --> 02:27:31,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Bradley.

1673
02:27:37,253 --> 02:27:37,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1674
02:27:37,433 --> 02:27:38,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Bradley for now.

1675
02:27:38,453 --> 02:27:39,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna get meatball.

1676
02:27:39,834 --> 02:27:40,734
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, I'm starving.

1677
02:27:41,034 --> 02:27:41,834
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare you?

1678
02:27:42,634 --> 02:27:45,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be honest.

1679
02:27:45,855 --> 02:27:47,075
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I go off camera.

1680
02:27:47,155 --> 02:27:48,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Member Graham.

1681
02:27:48,636 --> 02:27:48,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1682
02:27:49,536 --> 02:27:50,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Intoppa.

1683
02:27:53,199 --> 02:27:53,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1684
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:54,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1685
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:55,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade.

1686
02:27:55,821 --> 02:27:56,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1687
02:27:57,101 --> 02:27:57,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1688
02:27:58,262 --> 02:27:58,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1689
02:27:59,443 --> 02:28:00,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1690
02:28:00,043 --> 02:28:00,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1691
02:28:00,323 --> 02:28:01,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1692
02:28:01,584 --> 02:28:01,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1693
02:28:01,804 --> 02:28:03,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative motion.

1694
02:28:03,946 --> 02:28:06,267
[SPEAKER_17]: The papers, the policies rescinded.

1695
02:28:06,287 --> 02:28:16,013
[SPEAKER_17]: The next step we have required quarterly update of the shore collaborative, educational collaborative offered by Member Ruseau.

1696
02:28:17,822 --> 02:28:18,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.

1697
02:28:18,902 --> 02:28:42,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So there has been a long-standing requirement, which Medford has probably never once, like most districts, actually complied with, that collaboratives for which we are a member must, the school committee representative, for which I am that person, must provide a quarterly update on the goings-on at the collaborative.

1698
02:28:43,308 --> 02:28:43,748
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a

1699
02:28:46,558 --> 02:28:48,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this monthly or quarterly?

1700
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:54,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't actually remember how often the newsletter, I think it's a monthly newsletter, but anyways.

1701
02:28:54,584 --> 02:29:02,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So this newsletter is serving that purpose and I have nothing other than the requirement that it shows up in our minutes.

1702
02:29:03,309 --> 02:29:06,231
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the regulatory requirement is that it's in our minutes.

1703
02:29:06,311 --> 02:29:11,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there is a motion to, I will make the motion to acknowledge

1704
02:29:12,235 --> 02:29:12,515
[SPEAKER_04]: receive it.

1705
02:29:12,535 --> 02:29:15,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Receipt of the sore collaborative.

1706
02:29:17,578 --> 02:29:19,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Orderly update.

1707
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:26,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes I can motion by member or so that we've received it seconded by member Reinfeld broke all,

1708
02:29:40,991 --> 02:29:41,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1709
02:29:43,012 --> 02:29:44,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, John.

1710
02:29:45,092 --> 02:29:46,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade?

1711
02:29:47,153 --> 02:29:47,473
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1712
02:29:48,313 --> 02:29:49,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

1713
02:29:49,494 --> 02:29:49,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1714
02:29:50,514 --> 02:29:51,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1715
02:29:51,194 --> 02:29:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1716
02:29:51,474 --> 02:29:52,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lengelkern?

1717
02:29:53,195 --> 02:29:53,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1718
02:29:53,875 --> 02:29:55,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1719
02:29:55,756 --> 02:29:56,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1720
02:30:00,957 --> 02:30:12,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Building accessibility needs and concerns offered by member and topper be it resolved that the members school public schools will assess and evaluate building entry points over the summer specifically for accessibility concerns.

1721
02:30:13,105 --> 02:30:20,770
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration will report back with found issues and proposed solutions by the beginning of the start of the next academic school year first day of classes.

1722
02:30:23,792 --> 02:30:25,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Tapper, do you want to move approval?

1723
02:30:25,593 --> 02:30:26,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to comment?

1724
02:30:26,794 --> 02:30:41,183
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do know that from the chair, Director Waje from our DEI office did submit an application to do a transition report, which will, I think, do just this.

1725
02:30:41,283 --> 02:30:42,964
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'll turn it over to you.

1726
02:30:43,965 --> 02:30:44,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1727
02:30:44,265 --> 02:30:44,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1728
02:30:45,506 --> 02:30:47,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this sort of came up.

1729
02:30:48,688 --> 02:30:59,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, actually speaking of director at the disability, the disability fair, um, at the McGlynn complex, it was brought up by several members in attendance.

1730
02:31:00,193 --> 02:31:00,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1731
02:31:01,213 --> 02:31:14,618
[SPEAKER_02]: To, uh, the, the, the, those of us that were there, um, about the accessibility needs specifically, because we were in that building of the McGlynn complex and how the front door wasn't ADA accessible because of the lip, um, and that, um.

1732
02:31:16,161 --> 02:31:21,664
[SPEAKER_02]: who was there actually had a ramp in the back of her vehicle and laid it out.

1733
02:31:21,684 --> 02:31:37,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, those who were in wheelchairs or other mobility accessibility, you know, devices were able to get into the building as opposed to going around the back and, you know, to wherever that more accessible entrance is, which is a huge pain point for the members of the community who have to access that.

1734
02:31:37,982 --> 02:31:50,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to note that it was also brought to attention that it isn't just for those who need mobility aids, it was also for, you know, if EMS comes in and brings in a stretcher, it's easier to get them all with a lip, but then when they leave, if there's someone on the stretcher, it's not so easy.

1735
02:31:51,274 --> 02:31:57,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also just needs to be looked at anyways, because I myself will say from a personal point of privilege, I nearly

1736
02:31:57,790 --> 02:32:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: fell out of the door, leaving the NJHS ceremony because my foot got caught on it, was almost fully horizontal to the pavement.

1737
02:32:06,674 --> 02:32:11,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have a physical disability and I nearly fell.

1738
02:32:11,496 --> 02:32:16,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't even imagine what the members of our community that have to use that entryway go through.

1739
02:32:17,239 --> 02:32:27,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is sort of to look at not just the McGlynn complex, but also to look at the other entry points of our buildings to assess if there are

1740
02:32:28,099 --> 02:32:30,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Ways that we can address these I'm sure some of them may be addressed.

1741
02:32:31,042 --> 02:32:31,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

1742
02:32:33,484 --> 02:32:37,367
[SPEAKER_02]: As we do work to the buildings that may get triggered by NDA.

1743
02:32:37,628 --> 02:32:39,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh, the ADA.

1744
02:32:41,671 --> 02:32:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these things might already be set into motion for the McGlynn complex and the Andrews.

1745
02:32:46,565 --> 02:32:51,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the thought was to take a look at, so that is fully acknowledge that this may be happening.

1746
02:32:51,826 --> 02:32:56,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that, you know, miss a tuck and Brooks, like, looking at to see whether or not something as simple as.

1747
02:32:57,467 --> 02:33:01,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowering a door lip or things like that can be addressed.

1748
02:33:01,228 --> 02:33:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand that this is right at the heels of the school year and that the ask is to be right at the beginning.

1749
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so please, if the, if the timeline needs to be adjusted, please feel free to make any suggestions administration, but.

1750
02:33:15,312 --> 02:33:21,122
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is to just sort of look at what the needs are across the district in terms of this, so thank you.

1751
02:33:24,047 --> 02:33:25,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Tupper.

1752
02:33:25,550 --> 02:33:27,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld, then Member Ruseau.

1753
02:33:29,126 --> 02:33:29,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1754
02:33:29,427 --> 02:33:31,768
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to ask if this was for all buildings, which is great.

1755
02:33:32,629 --> 02:33:37,113
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to roll into this, the continuation of resolution 2024 25.

1756
02:33:37,293 --> 02:33:38,234
[SPEAKER_19]: We had, which was from obviously 2024.

1757
02:33:46,241 --> 02:33:55,068
[SPEAKER_19]: from the building and ground subcommittee to meet with the universal safety committee to review a set of recommendations that we were sent in February of 2024.

1758
02:33:55,108 --> 02:33:57,770
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this dovetails nicely.

1759
02:33:57,830 --> 02:34:02,894
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that subcommittee ever met, but if they did, maybe this report could be part of that.

1760
02:34:03,455 --> 02:34:08,158
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we haven't approved that, but it was looking kind of more broadly at accessibility.

1761
02:34:09,159 --> 02:34:18,330
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would like to see those things happen, particularly since there was a list of known issues and proposed solutions potentially for grant funding.

1762
02:34:22,992 --> 02:34:24,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

1763
02:34:24,393 --> 02:34:41,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the grant we applied for will assess all of our buildings, and then once we get the transition plan in place, which was also part of the grant application, then we can start applying for additional, I believe it's MOD grants, to do some of this work.

1764
02:34:42,627 --> 02:34:43,067
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1765
02:34:43,087 --> 02:34:46,309
[SPEAKER_19]: But I know there was an assessment that was supposed that we were that was going to happen.

1766
02:34:46,389 --> 02:34:50,230
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it got eclipsed by our our budget season in 2024.

1767
02:34:50,910 --> 02:34:53,431
[SPEAKER_19]: But concerns are still there.

1768
02:34:53,632 --> 02:34:55,752
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would love to see those move forward.

1769
02:34:55,933 --> 02:34:57,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, solutions move forward.

1770
02:34:57,893 --> 02:35:00,414
[SPEAKER_19]: And an assessment is, of course, the first step for that.

1771
02:35:01,115 --> 02:35:01,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, great.

1772
02:35:02,735 --> 02:35:03,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds like we're doing it.

1773
02:35:03,596 --> 02:35:05,216
[SPEAKER_17]: So member Ruseau, then member Graham.

1774
02:35:06,397 --> 02:35:08,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I think some of this stuff is in fact already in

1775
02:35:10,297 --> 02:35:11,720
[SPEAKER_04]: wheels are rolling on this already.

1776
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:14,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think there's also something really important to note that

1777
02:35:15,603 --> 02:35:21,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like an excuse, but the ramp at the high school, we looked at that, I think, three or four years ago.

1778
02:35:21,905 --> 02:35:27,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not safe for any human being, that drop off without a railing.

1779
02:35:28,528 --> 02:35:40,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Adding a railing, it turns out that when you do some work for ADA, you kind of open the floodgates where you can't just, we can't add a railing there.

1780
02:35:40,572 --> 02:35:41,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot.

1781
02:35:42,091 --> 02:35:45,372
[SPEAKER_04]: we must fully remediate the ADA issues.

1782
02:35:46,232 --> 02:35:51,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And that goes from being, I don't know, $10,000 for a railing to many millions of dollars.

1783
02:35:52,393 --> 02:36:06,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, I don't want anybody to think we don't care, but also spending millions of dollars to remediate the high school when we're gonna, fingers crossed, knock it down would be both bizarre and also we don't have that money.

1784
02:36:07,757 --> 02:36:10,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, these,

1785
02:36:12,884 --> 02:36:20,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, if I had a mobility disability or issue, I might not be quite as comfortable with, well, we'll just have to wait.

1786
02:36:27,272 --> 02:36:29,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish I could say we could find that money.

1787
02:36:29,332 --> 02:36:31,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not a million dollars.

1788
02:36:32,593 --> 02:36:36,714
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is the high school would be many millions of dollars if we decide to open that.

1789
02:36:37,334 --> 02:36:45,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And that report we did already get, I feel like was I in a different, was it a subcommittee or something, or did I just read the report?

1790
02:36:45,775 --> 02:36:54,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we just got it a couple of meetings ago, but the width of doors, the height of

1791
02:36:56,662 --> 02:37:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Bathroom fixtures, they're not the same as they were in 2000 when those buildings were built.

1792
02:37:04,429 --> 02:37:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But to spend, frankly, a huge amount of money to lower sinks an inch, to make doors an inch wider,

1793
02:37:18,913 --> 02:37:21,015
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like something you do when you build a building.

1794
02:37:21,235 --> 02:37:29,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something you do unless you have unlimited resources to make all of those doors an inch wider.

1795
02:37:29,622 --> 02:37:31,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's concrete block.

1796
02:37:31,423 --> 02:37:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't even fathom what it would cost.

1797
02:37:35,486 --> 02:37:39,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And cost, of course, can't be the only consideration.

1798
02:37:42,712 --> 02:37:56,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can't talk about living wages for some staff and then talk about spending countless millions to add an inch to the width of a door or an inch to lower existing fixtures in bathrooms.

1799
02:37:59,885 --> 02:38:03,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very comfortable with these things need to be in place.

1800
02:38:03,888 --> 02:38:06,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's opportunity costs for everything we do.

1801
02:38:06,930 --> 02:38:13,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think this one, unfortunately, it's just such a huge opportunity cost.

1802
02:38:13,674 --> 02:38:18,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather give all of our kids actual free public education before I would rather add an inch to the width of doors.

1803
02:38:20,944 --> 02:38:22,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I can say that quite comfortably.

1804
02:38:24,146 --> 02:38:25,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

1805
02:38:25,887 --> 02:38:27,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this all kind of sucks.

1806
02:38:27,268 --> 02:38:35,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse my, pardon my French, because it's, I mean, we built the buildings at the time complying with ADA.

1807
02:38:37,243 --> 02:38:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: and then it changed.

1808
02:38:39,745 --> 02:38:44,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't come with a check from the federal government when they decided that wasn't the current acceptable standards.

1809
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:51,456
[SPEAKER_04]: They just, another unfunded mandate, and supposed to just somehow find the money.

1810
02:38:51,476 --> 02:38:52,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.

1811
02:38:52,777 --> 02:38:53,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'll stop talking.

1812
02:38:56,921 --> 02:38:57,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

1813
02:38:57,922 --> 02:39:00,964
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I think Dr. Galussi also, and then Member Intoppa.

1814
02:39:02,426 --> 02:39:02,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1815
02:39:04,732 --> 02:39:18,356
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple things, I think 1 of the things that members I was talking about is we got an update on the H back projects at the McGlynn and the Andrews and related to those 2 projects upgrades have to be made.

1816
02:39:19,456 --> 02:39:26,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the settling of the Plaza in the front are upgrades that will be made in tandem with those projects.

1817
02:39:28,098 --> 02:39:33,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're slated, I believe, for this summer, so we should be able to take care of that immediate issue that you were citing.

1818
02:39:34,921 --> 02:39:42,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But the other thing that came up in the course of that conversation was that there was a much bigger list of ADA issues outlined and.

1819
02:39:43,085 --> 02:39:52,132
[SPEAKER_10]: there were certain things like moving sinks an inch that the team that is working on the HVAC project was going to apply for variances for.

1820
02:39:52,873 --> 02:40:01,200
[SPEAKER_10]: So certainly I think we could ask to get a copy of what that recommendation was or what those variances were so that we understand what's happening in those two buildings.

1821
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:09,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the report, Mayor, that you're talking about, was that the one that was like wildly complicated to submit

1822
02:40:10,842 --> 02:40:12,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, okay, good.

1823
02:40:12,583 --> 02:40:14,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad we got it in this time.

1824
02:40:14,083 --> 02:40:15,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we got it in.

1825
02:40:15,984 --> 02:40:16,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

1826
02:40:18,165 --> 02:40:24,308
[SPEAKER_10]: But that certainly will help and sort of open the door for work in some of our other buildings.

1827
02:40:25,528 --> 02:40:38,014
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that we talked about when we were talking about the list of variances for McGlynn and Andrews is when we decide what those variances are, we need to catalog those things in our

1828
02:40:39,834 --> 02:40:51,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Our ticketing system so that if for some reason we have to replace a sink, that we replace it in the new compliant way versus the way we've always done it.

1829
02:40:52,118 --> 02:41:04,542
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there is a maintenance buildings and grounds ongoing tail that can hopefully, and in a much lower cost way, remediate those things as we are doing other maintenance related items to those

1830
02:41:04,942 --> 02:41:06,542
[SPEAKER_10]: wherever those variances might sit.

1831
02:41:06,602 --> 02:41:09,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if you have to put in a new door, can you make it an inch wider?

1832
02:41:10,563 --> 02:41:20,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of question that I think we need our teams to be asking themselves when they're handling things that seem routine, given the state of how things have changed with the ADA.

1833
02:41:22,366 --> 02:41:27,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's an important question and an ask for our buildings and grounds and our facilities team.

1834
02:41:29,222 --> 02:41:33,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last thing I'll say is that we have been doing some facilities assessment.

1835
02:41:33,246 --> 02:41:35,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the other thing that we have been talking about.

1836
02:41:36,869 --> 02:41:47,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe those reports are coming back and there probably are any number of things already cataloged in that assessment that would outline this, but we can check on that as well.

1837
02:41:47,959 --> 02:41:50,982
[SPEAKER_10]: So we may not have to do something new to get those answers.

1838
02:41:52,884 --> 02:41:57,667
[SPEAKER_10]: what we may need to do is like prioritize those things into our capital plan.

1839
02:41:58,428 --> 02:42:05,893
[SPEAKER_10]: But we can check, I can check, Jerry was just mentioning it to me today about what, about that those reports were starting to come back.

1840
02:42:06,013 --> 02:42:10,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So we may just want to think about that as another place where some of this data may already exist.

1841
02:42:10,936 --> 02:42:14,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1842
02:42:15,639 --> 02:42:20,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Member, I'm sorry, Dr. Galusi, then Member Ntaba, then Member Reinfeld, if I have it correctly.

1843
02:42:21,465 --> 02:42:22,305
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have much to say.

1844
02:42:22,345 --> 02:42:29,787
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a lot of what I was going to say, member Ruseau, member Graham covered because there has been ongoing work.

1845
02:42:30,487 --> 02:42:47,311
[SPEAKER_15]: So my only two cents was going to be that we can provide what we currently know in a timeline, but that the first day of class would probably be a little bit too tight of a timeline because a lot of this is already ongoing work.

1846
02:42:48,682 --> 02:42:51,343
[SPEAKER_15]: but I can get you the update of what's been going on so far.

1847
02:42:53,504 --> 02:42:53,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1848
02:42:54,304 --> 02:42:55,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa, then Member Reinfeld.

1849
02:42:57,326 --> 02:42:58,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Dr. Glucy.

1850
02:42:59,246 --> 02:43:06,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the first day of classes with the thought that it would be amended because picking a random date like October 3rd would just, wow.

1851
02:43:07,010 --> 02:43:10,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just because that was a point where we could put it.

1852
02:43:11,732 --> 02:43:14,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, so yes, speaking on

1853
02:43:16,285 --> 02:43:25,078
[SPEAKER_02]: mentions this and my colleagues have said, yes, the report that we got, I do remember, but that was only for McGlynn and Andrews, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of all the accessibility needs.

1854
02:43:25,098 --> 02:43:32,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why this motion covers all of the buildings, because that report lives of McGlynn and Andrews, but we don't know

1855
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:42,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the point of the motion is more to see, are there easy fixes, like just switching out how thick that door lip is?

1856
02:43:42,126 --> 02:43:44,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, I'm not talking about how wide the doors are.

1857
02:43:44,407 --> 02:43:50,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about specifically that lip, because that's the issue that people are having, are getting over that.

1858
02:43:50,111 --> 02:43:52,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fitting width-wise.

1859
02:43:52,713 --> 02:43:58,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the actual lip of getting through the door that is the issue specific to the McGlynn complex.

1860
02:44:01,091 --> 02:44:07,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yes, I completely agree that when we start to replace fixtures like sinks, we should start doing it the new way and be proactive with that.

1861
02:44:07,293 --> 02:44:08,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way we save it.

1862
02:44:08,513 --> 02:44:10,214
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as you mentioned member Graham.

1863
02:44:11,074 --> 02:44:18,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the only thing I wanted to mention other than the fact that completely acknowledge that we did get that report.

1864
02:44:18,137 --> 02:44:18,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to read it.

1865
02:44:19,057 --> 02:44:21,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we received it because I acknowledge the receipt of it.

1866
02:44:22,611 --> 02:44:27,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is to go sort of get like a high level timeline of like, all right, what fixes are feasible?

1867
02:44:27,514 --> 02:44:28,515
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it going to cost?

1868
02:44:28,675 --> 02:44:31,577
[SPEAKER_02]: What are things that we acknowledge are issues?

1869
02:44:31,697 --> 02:44:43,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Because until that meeting, or until that event, there hadn't seemed like there had been an acknowledgement that there was a major accessibility issue at the front door of the McGlynn, from my perspective, at least.

1870
02:44:44,575 --> 02:44:52,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take the amendment of, I don't think we have a set timeline in terms of when it is due, just that we are requesting the report.

1871
02:44:53,097 --> 02:44:58,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Galusi, if that is the amendment I'm assuming you'd like to be made to the motion.

1872
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:05,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I think there are ongoing projects.

1873
02:45:06,597 --> 02:45:15,460
[SPEAKER_15]: right now around the facilities of our buildings as well as like the space utilization that's happening also this summer.

1874
02:45:16,001 --> 02:45:31,627
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just think like giving us a little bit of time to see the ongoing like consultancy work that's already happening and then being able to synthesize all of that and provide you with

1875
02:45:32,947 --> 02:45:36,308
[SPEAKER_15]: a report early fall is just a little bit.

1876
02:45:36,609 --> 02:45:49,454
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make sure that the assessments that are ongoing right now, we have enough time to like read the reports, figure out what we're going to do about the recommendations and the findings, and then be able to report.

1877
02:45:49,874 --> 02:45:57,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think I would be able to do all of that by the end of August, September.

1878
02:45:57,697 --> 02:45:59,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely understandable.

1879
02:46:00,078 --> 02:46:00,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the input.

1880
02:46:02,390 --> 02:46:02,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1881
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:04,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reintel?

1882
02:46:05,191 --> 02:46:15,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I just had a question for Dr. Galussi about the best way to involve our new COO and the facility staff that we're hiring because this is directly relevant.

1883
02:46:15,435 --> 02:46:22,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think framing it, thinking about it in terms of when they're coming on board, because I'm not sure these positions are hired yet.

1884
02:46:22,858 --> 02:46:26,680
[SPEAKER_19]: And we would want them to be a part of this conversation from the beginning.

1885
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:28,801
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it might make sense to

1886
02:46:29,921 --> 02:46:58,296
[SPEAKER_19]: have either a building and grounds committee or a strategic planning depending on the scale of these things with those new folks on board to get an update and have them be able to hear directly from the committees or maybe it's a maybe it's a committee of the whole since i've named two different committees but i i want this conversation to be part of the new staff because they need to be a part of this conversation and it will also be their responsibility to act on it so

1887
02:46:59,197 --> 02:47:01,668
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure what the motion is though if it is.

1888
02:47:03,166 --> 02:47:17,214
[SPEAKER_19]: to schedule a meeting for the fall to address the questions around entry points in this, as well as that 24, 25, I know we're already gonna be hearing about the space utilization report.

1889
02:47:17,234 --> 02:47:30,962
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess my question is for Dr. Galussi, what is the best way to do this efficiently so that everyone has had time to collect the data they need and not have a million and one conversations with individuals on this body?

1890
02:47:31,722 --> 02:47:35,506
[SPEAKER_19]: but to really focus and present it in context.

1891
02:47:36,487 --> 02:47:37,308
[SPEAKER_19]: What's most helpful?

1892
02:47:38,369 --> 02:47:39,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that question.

1893
02:47:39,770 --> 02:47:40,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1894
02:47:41,552 --> 02:47:45,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not to minimize this work because it is very important.

1895
02:47:45,896 --> 02:47:52,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to highlight too, I mean, with my broken ankle, I was scooting on in this morning and

1896
02:47:54,144 --> 02:48:05,510
[SPEAKER_15]: It was not easy through the potholes of Medford High School and the ramp that Member Ruseau spoke about, as well as the entry with the doorway.

1897
02:48:05,610 --> 02:48:06,951
[SPEAKER_15]: So I relate to it.

1898
02:48:07,151 --> 02:48:15,255
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't want anyone listening to think it's a lack of prioritization or importance, because it's not.

1899
02:48:15,335 --> 02:48:23,220
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also bandwidth, and to the point that Member Reinfeld just mentioned, bringing on new staff to be a part of the work.

1900
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:28,343
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are actively in the middle of the hiring process for the chief operation officer.

1901
02:48:28,363 --> 02:48:39,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, round one is just concluding, and then finalists will move on to a round two, but we're just actively in the middle of that.

1902
02:48:40,713 --> 02:48:52,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Best case scenario, that person would be starting probably in around three weeks, but that's not knowing the specific situation, so having someone

1903
02:48:52,985 --> 02:49:02,270
[SPEAKER_15]: be able to come on board this summer, get caught up to speed before throwing some of this.

1904
02:49:03,151 --> 02:49:18,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I would probably say, because we have the two already ongoing, I would probably realistically say end of October.

1905
02:49:26,482 --> 02:49:27,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Dr. Galusi.

1906
02:49:35,108 --> 02:49:48,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ntabar, will you amend to have this proposed solutions by the end of the fall?

1907
02:49:48,057 --> 02:49:48,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1908
02:49:49,898 --> 02:49:53,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, motion for approval by Member Ntabar as amended, seconded by?

1909
02:50:01,015 --> 02:50:01,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Brandly.

1910
02:50:05,659 --> 02:50:06,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call, please.

1911
02:50:12,406 --> 02:50:12,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

1912
02:50:14,047 --> 02:50:14,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Brandly?

1913
02:50:14,968 --> 02:50:15,208
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1914
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:17,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

1915
02:50:18,151 --> 02:50:18,391
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1916
02:50:18,952 --> 02:50:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Intoppa?

1917
02:50:20,113 --> 02:50:20,333
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1918
02:50:20,994 --> 02:50:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Olapade?

1919
02:50:22,014 --> 02:50:22,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1920
02:50:23,396 --> 02:50:23,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reynthal?

1921
02:50:24,577 --> 02:50:24,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1922
02:50:25,518 --> 02:50:25,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rossell?

1923
02:50:25,978 --> 02:50:26,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1924
02:50:26,218 --> 02:50:26,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo?

1925
02:50:27,700 --> 02:50:35,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative, motion passes as amended to read end of fall as a due date.

1926
02:50:36,483 --> 02:50:49,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Next up we have, oh, okay, and next up we have designer selection panel appointment offered by member Rousseau, member Lopate, and member Reinfeld.

1927
02:50:50,229 --> 02:50:53,790
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford School Committee appoints School Committee Vice Chair Jenny Graham

1928
02:50:54,370 --> 02:51:02,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee to the Designer Selection Panel for the Massachusetts School Building Committee's Designer Selection Process.

1948
02:52:05,112 --> 02:52:07,053

[SPEAKER_17]: end the use of out-of-school suspensions affected the first day of the school year, 21, except as provided by law, provides for the continuation of learning environment for every in-school suspension, ensures that in-school suspensions will not occur in isolation without instruction or rehabilitative counseling,

1953

[SPEAKER_17]: Selects alternative tools for use in disciplines such as restorative justice whenever possible.

[SPEAKER_17]: Establishes an annual reporting process that includes, but is not limited to, system-wide disciplinary measures reporting to the school committee, as well as establishing staff feedback process.

1955
02:53:08,996 --> 02:53:17,359
[SPEAKER_17]: be resolved that the superintendent will provide a detailed report of disciplinary actions taken for the 24-25 school year, as well as data from two prior school years.

1956
02:53:17,879 --> 02:53:29,123
[SPEAKER_17]: The report shall include a count of suspensions, suspended days by reason for suspension, and count of other means of student discipline for those same reasons.

1957
02:53:29,643 --> 02:53:36,225
[SPEAKER_17]: The report will show data disaggregated by school, by grade level, and by school and grade level.

1958

[SPEAKER_17]: The report will be presented no later than October 31st, 2025.

1960
02:53:43,786 --> 02:53:48,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1961
02:53:49,509 --> 02:53:52,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Just quickly, I'm totally flexible on the date.

1962
02:53:52,431 --> 02:53:54,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you need more time than this, that's fine.

1963
02:53:54,612 --> 02:54:06,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, there's been a lot going on and I think we saw like several really lackluster versions of this report a year or so ago at this time.

1964
02:54:06,798 --> 02:54:15,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just struck me that, like, A, that this trying to get on a school year schedule of, like, reporting for the school year made a lot of sense.

1965
02:54:16,606 --> 02:54:27,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And my particular interest is when we are talking about things happening at different levels that we are actually having conversation about things that are happening differently in different school buildings.

1966
02:54:28,775 --> 02:54:34,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think there's, I've heard people say our suspensions are back to where they were when we started all of this.

1967
02:54:35,621 --> 02:54:46,410
[SPEAKER_10]: which I think, you know, I don't think anyone's, like, lying about that necessarily, but I think that data needs to be, like, proved out.

1968
02:54:46,470 --> 02:54:56,038
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like for us to have a discussion on what those facts are rather than, like, the anecdotal, like, it seems like a lot of kids are getting suspended.

1969
02:54:56,098 --> 02:54:57,119
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to

1970
02:54:57,899 --> 02:55:10,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, like, lay this out and specifically point out that, like, the, the big difference I see, and what I'm looking for out of this is that we are going to look at and compare by school and by grade level.

1971
02:55:10,973 --> 02:55:11,553
[SPEAKER_10]: What's happening?

1972
02:55:11,613 --> 02:55:14,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if there are like, hot spots or flashes of.

1973
02:55:15,597 --> 02:55:22,042
[SPEAKER_10]: something really discrepant happening, that is a conversation that we should be having from a policy perspective.

1974
02:55:23,202 --> 02:55:26,805
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping that October 31st makes sense.

1975
02:55:28,106 --> 02:55:31,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you need more time, I'm totally open to that, too.

1976
02:55:32,149 --> 02:55:32,389
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1977
02:55:35,051 --> 02:55:37,152
[SPEAKER_17]: And Dr. Galussi, is that a good time frame for you?

1978
02:55:38,433 --> 02:55:38,713
[SPEAKER_17]: It is.

1979
02:55:39,434 --> 02:55:40,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that's fair.

1980
02:55:42,282 --> 02:55:44,622
