[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

[SPEAKER_08]: Paper 14-756 special permit zoning drive through Felsway property LLC.

00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:02,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in the city council on December 9th and it was tabled until this evening.

28
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:09,132
[SPEAKER_08]: The attorney is here with the client and Mr. Abbruzzese.

29
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

30
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:11,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

31
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, members of the council.

32
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:22,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd first like to thank each and every one on the council for the courtesy extended to myself and my client on December 9th.

33
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:24,579
[SPEAKER_10]: when I wasn't able to be here.

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:30,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that at this point some of the councilors are going to have some questions.

35
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:41,406
[SPEAKER_10]: We have our engineers here and Karen Johnson, representative of the petitioner, to answer any questions that the council may have.

36
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions for Mr. Bruese?

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion.

38
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Longo Kern.

39
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair would like to add that Councilor Penta is here.

40
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Please record that, clerk.

41
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:05,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

42
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,816
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't have clear plans with regards to the drive-through.

43
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:15,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you tell me how many cars are going to be able to be queued?

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you have the poster board you had last week with A, B, and C, and maybe we can outline that again.

45
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,698
[SPEAKER_17]: That was my main question last week.

46
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:47,033
Oh, yeah, thank you.

47
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's what I wanted.

48
00:02:57,132 --> 00:03:00,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Patrick Dunford, Traffic Engineer with VHB.

49
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:06,357
[SPEAKER_20]: As I understand it, there was questions regarding the drive-thru operation and the queue storage in particular.

50
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:11,661
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could just highlight that in the graphic we have in front of me.

51
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:17,804
[SPEAKER_20]: The drive-thru window is on the side of the Panera building in that tan area in the drive-thru lane.

52
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,566
[SPEAKER_20]: That's where the vehicle would pull up to pick up their goods.

53
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:29,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Leading up to that, there is a separated drive-thru lane extending around the bottom side of the building away from Riverside Avenue.

54
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:36,896
[SPEAKER_20]: In total, from the window to the very end where the main drive aisle picks up, you have 220 feet.

55
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:44,867
[SPEAKER_20]: With typical drive-thru spacing for passenger vehicles, that translates into about 10 cars.

56
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:56,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Anecdotally, from having looked at the few Panera drive-thru operations that are out there, that's more than adequate to handle what we've seen under their regular conditions.

57
00:03:56,832 --> 00:04:03,934
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a far more quiet operation than you might find in other drive-thru type uses that you may be more familiar with.

58
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Where are your other locations?

59
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:10,189
[SPEAKER_20]: The one I had looked at most recently was in Walpole, Massachusetts.

60
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:20,655
[SPEAKER_20]: That's located at the Walpole Mall, Route 1, pretty busy arterial in that area, and a very active shopping center, somewhat comparable to the Fellzoy Plaza.

61
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,597
[SPEAKER_17]: And tenant A is Panera.

62
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:29,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Tenant B is Karen Johnson.

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,242
[SPEAKER_22]: Tenant B is Smashburger, which I believe you've already

64
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:54,381
[SPEAKER_22]: looked at some of their applications pending, Common Vic license, liquor license as well, and tenancy is Noodles, which is a relatively new, fast, casual restaurant concept, one just recently opened in Burlington.

65
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:59,146
[SPEAKER_17]: On average, I guess at the other locations of Panera, what's the average wait time per order?

66
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:06,900
[SPEAKER_20]: From what I've seen with the orders, they can range if it's just a single cup of coffee to someone getting it in 30 seconds.

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,683
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the other orders with the sandwiches or more complicated drinks can be a couple of minutes.

68
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:17,386
[SPEAKER_20]: So it ranges in that 30 second to two minute, maybe two and a half minute window.

69
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:21,768
[SPEAKER_20]: With that level of activity and that type of turnover,

70
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:32,119
[SPEAKER_20]: In my time looking at these, actually the most recent being on a rainy day where you typically get your heaviest usage, there was about a four to six car maximum queue.

71
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Where on this site, that would put us basically back to the middle tenant and not back to the rear drive aisle.

72
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:41,586
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have a little bit of a buffer zone in there as far as drive-through storage.

73
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:48,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Just my comments, I think what

74
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:52,991
[SPEAKER_17]: These three restaurants are going to fix up the area that is in blight.

75
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, the demo has been done.

76
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,936
[SPEAKER_17]: My only concern is 10 cars going to be enough for a queue.

77
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,878
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a completely different location than Walpole.

78
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:07,522
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Wellington Circle, one of the probably busiest intersections in Massachusetts.

79
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:12,165
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you go up to Woburn, and there's a Starbucks drive-through.

80
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:14,647
[SPEAKER_17]: And I saw the other day it was 17 cars queued.

81
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,147
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're a quick cup of coffee only.

82
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:20,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's where you're buying sandwiches and soups and salads.

83
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:31,635
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have an extreme concern where whether or not 10 cars is going to be enough, especially where you have Stop and Shop right behind there.

84
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:35,618
[SPEAKER_17]: The senior citizens are always in and out of that location.

85
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:41,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how my counselors feel, but that would be my only concern.

86
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:43,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Blocking the way and never mind.

87
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:51,034
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think there's enough room to block the riverside, but blocking your own entrance and exit might be a problem, might become a problem.

88
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:53,534
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could add to that, hopefully it adds some comfort.

89
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:59,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Anytime you have a drive-thru use in a property, you have to look at both the drive-thru and the parking supply.

90
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:06,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I'm very confident from having done several drive-thru type uses, the 10 car storage is more than adequate.

91
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:09,278
[SPEAKER_20]: However, if someone was to pull into the site,

92
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:20,725
[SPEAKER_20]: This entire property has a total of 61 parking spaces on the site.

93
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:36,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Zoning requires only 26, so in anticipation of just making sure that we're not designing this down to the decimal place, we have far exceeded the parking supply where if someone does pull in, and it does tend to be a regular customer base at any sort of

94
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:46,430
[SPEAKER_20]: food establishment like this, they'll know, based on those wait times that I talked about, that you're probably a lot quicker just getting into the parking lot and walking in.

95
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,454
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd also add as well, I appreciate the concerns with the Starbucks history.

96
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:59,039
[SPEAKER_20]: They also have sometimes, if you've seen the complicated drink orders with individuals also getting the sandwiches.

97
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,622
[SPEAKER_20]: The Panera that I looked at, again, it's a pretty active site.

98
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,835
[SPEAKER_20]: did not come anywhere near that level.

99
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I don't anticipate this one would either.

100
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:23,069
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, um, in terms of the morning activity, uh, the coffee oriented activity with the other uses being the smash burger and the noodles, you're not going to find that type of activity at those restaurants in the morning, just in the parking lot.

101
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,234
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're going to be faced with the drive through lane that will be visible from Riverside Ave at the very end.

102
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:29,395
[SPEAKER_20]: If there ever was an issue,

103
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,931
[SPEAKER_20]: and a pretty ample parking field that'll be there for those that choose to walk in.

104
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:39,954
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's really the combination of the two that give me confidence that this can work more than acceptably.

105
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:50,039
[SPEAKER_17]: I think one positive is that you have the two other exits and entrances, but I don't put it past people to queue up 17, 18 cars for Panera.

106
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:53,041
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I frequent the one in Everett and

107
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:57,514
[SPEAKER_17]: 12 o'clock in the afternoon, you cannot find a seat, and the line is out the door.

108
00:08:57,714 --> 00:08:59,915
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's an extremely popular restaurant.

109
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,737
[SPEAKER_22]: It is, and that's also, I think, a very good point.

110
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:19,464
[SPEAKER_22]: The distinction between an exclusive sit-down restaurant, which is the Everett location, and a location like this, which combines a pickup window, is that Panera, and they're very smart, they know what they're doing, obviously, they know how to

111
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,593
[SPEAKER_22]: design their menu, they know how to accommodate their customer, they're very service-oriented.

112
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:36,656
[SPEAKER_22]: And what they've done in the drive-through locations that they're building from the ground up, which is essentially this location, they have created two kitchen lines within the kitchen.

113
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:45,598
[SPEAKER_22]: So from a production standpoint, the person that walks in and orders at the counter at front,

114
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:50,530
[SPEAKER_22]: their sandwich, their order is being produced in a separate line.

115
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,591
[SPEAKER_22]: So the drive-thru line, the drive-thru window has its own line.

116
00:09:55,151 --> 00:10:11,994
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that does increase the amount of time dramatically that, rather not increase the amount of time, it decreases the amount of time where they're from the order to the pickup for their food production.

117
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:13,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

118
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:15,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Penta.

119
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Two questions.

120
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to have the city solicitor come to the podium, please.

121
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:30,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I think point number one, I'm concerned about the legality of what's before us tonight.

122
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:33,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, how so?

123
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:38,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe you can explain how you can continue a public hearing, how you can continue a public hearing.

124
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you'd be specific, you mean about this hearing?

125
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:46,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this was on a few weeks ago and the request was made that, uh,

126
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:50,319
[SPEAKER_03]: it be continued to another night because somebody was in the hospital.

127
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:53,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that the hearing was opened and continue to today.

128
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:57,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and that people were asked to speak in favor.

129
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:01,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't watch the meeting, but I heard they spoke in favor or against just one correction.

130
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Solicitor, the hearing was opened.

131
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,681
[SPEAKER_08]: given people the opportunity to speak.

132
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:10,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it was open for people in opposition and then the public hearing was closed.

133
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a regular paper of the council that was tabled.

134
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:13,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

135
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I recall when this came up, I spoke with the city clerk about it and this was the method that he suggested.

136
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:18,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree.

137
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:23,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And the chair did his due diligence, as you know, before the meeting on this, knowing the attorney was sick.

138
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the chair was involved too.

139
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:29,310
[SPEAKER_05]: But my question is, revolves more around the fact that the hearing was closed.

140
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it need to be re-advertised again?

141
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it was closed cause no decision was made.

142
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:43,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, without having watched what occurred that night, I'm told that at least a portion of it was closed for those in favor or those against, but the rest of it was continued to tonight for your deliberation.

143
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the young lady that appeared before the council on that particular night indicated

144
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:49,953
[SPEAKER_05]: that she was willing to go forward with the meeting.

145
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:55,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And any further questions, she would refer them to Mr. Abruzzese, who unfortunately was not here that night.

146
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:55,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

147
00:11:55,475 --> 00:12:00,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's the reason for the request for a continuance, which I think is a normal courtesy that one would expect.

148
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:00,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not worried about the continuance.

149
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:03,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just talking about the legality of it for any kind of a challenge.

150
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabling it?

151
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:14,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can say honestly that in the two or three weeks since this was last before the council, I have not heard one word from anyone, a but or otherwise, objecting to procedurally

152
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,978
[SPEAKER_03]: the protocol that's been implemented for this before the council tonight.

153
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:20,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not, I'm not worried about what you heard or what you didn't hear.

154
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more concerned.

155
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,461
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way it could be, the only way it could be if you use the word legal or illegal is if it was challenged.

156
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:41,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had, I don't think first of all that it is illegal, but secondly, I haven't heard an inkling of any type of overture from the public that someone was denied the right to speak or that this matter isn't before this council tonight appropriately.

157
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't think that's the issue.

158
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, I'm not worried about what the public said to you or didn't say to you.

159
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:48,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm just more concerned.

160
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it this way.

161
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:56,528
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to ask me about the legality of this procedure, procedure and legality are synonymous for our purposes.

162
00:12:57,148 --> 00:13:06,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if what you want to do is to have me render an opinion about the legality of this proceeding, then what I would have to do is to go back, take a look at all of the documentary

163
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:13,287
[SPEAKER_03]: um, filings with the clerk that led up to this, take a look at the advertising, watch what occurred at the last meeting.

164
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:18,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And after discerning all of those facts with certainty, then I would render an opinion.

165
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:26,876
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're going to ask me right now, on the basis of your question within seconds later to render an opinion about this legality, I won't do so because it's imprudent.

166
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:31,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't expect a dissertation.

167
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I just asked a very simple question that the council

168
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a normal procedure in the council.

169
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

170
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:40,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Dela Russo.

171
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,449
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, Mr. President, just to help me understand what's going on here.

172
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:46,969
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the purpose of this questioning?

173
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's very simple.

174
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,612
[SPEAKER_05]: When you postpone a public hearing, it's the advertising.

175
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:57,294
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're postponing it, does it have to be re-advertised because you postponed it?

176
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:03,357
[SPEAKER_03]: This protocol, this process was suggested by the city clerk and I agree with him.

177
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,683
[SPEAKER_03]: This was not a second hearing.

178
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,664
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a continuation of the first hearing.

179
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:08,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

180
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:12,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clark, what is the procedure on a postponement of a public hearing?

181
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President?

182
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:18,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Counselor Villaruso.

183
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,068
[SPEAKER_08]: The public hearing was not postponed to my understanding.

184
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,428
[SPEAKER_10]: The public hearing was completed.

185
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:25,149
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just laid on the table for a moment.

186
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:33,651
[SPEAKER_08]: The public hearing was closed, and then the paper was laid on the table at the request of a counselor, because the attorney wasn't present.

187
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:36,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to ask the court the question, please.

188
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

189
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,515
[SPEAKER_05]: When hearing is either postponed or laid on the table, what is the procedure?

190
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:46,580
[SPEAKER_05]: If the hearing comes to an end on that particular night and no decision is made, does it need to be re-advertised?

191
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,201
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the question.

192
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:49,043
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the motion was to table.

193
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:52,787
[SPEAKER_15]: So that means that's what it is.

194
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:53,568
[SPEAKER_15]: It's unfinished now.

195
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:57,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Public hearings have been done the same way in the past.

196
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've had this before in Stop and Shop and 10 years ago, we tabled the public hearings.

197
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:09,447
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a number that we tabled for the next week or got referred to a committee.

198
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:19,934
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding was that it was simply to be tabled tonight and to be taken off the table for the purpose of taking a vote.

199
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:20,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Simple as that.

200
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:22,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to respectfully disagree with you.

201
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:26,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe councilor, Mr. Brucey, I think, excuse me.

202
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:33,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I think Mr. Point of clarity, it wasn't that it was to give the courtesy for you to come back to answer any questions, not to take a vote.

203
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:34,555
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the issue.

204
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:38,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And as the young lady was at the podium, that was her comment last time.

205
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, also to answer any questions that any of the councils may have.

206
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:42,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that.

207
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question, um, is, is this,

208
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:53,248
[SPEAKER_05]: approval going to the land?

209
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to Panera?

210
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to the people on the real estate?

211
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's it going to?

212
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,311
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the will of the council.

213
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,272
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

214
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:00,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking her the question, please.

215
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:01,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you've been around a long time.

216
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:02,394
[SPEAKER_08]: You should know.

217
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:03,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to ask her the question.

218
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:04,695
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't keep interrupting.

219
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:06,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do as I may, councilor.

220
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:07,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you certainly do.

221
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You do a good job of interrupting.

222
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:08,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

223
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:10,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you please answer the question?

224
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:11,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

225
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,721
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to be a fun year.

226
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:20,125
[SPEAKER_22]: The application was presented on behalf of the property owner, and I work for the property owner.

227
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:26,906
[SPEAKER_22]: We are representing that this is the drive-through special permit itself is for the Panera use.

228
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So why isn't Panera itself making the application?

229
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:39,894
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we are responsible for receiving all of the local permits for Panera short of operational permits, which they will come in and obtain themselves.

230
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:46,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So if Panera were to leave that place and at some time in the future, that's an allowable spot for another drive-through?

231
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,080
[SPEAKER_22]: If that, uh, if they were to leave,

232
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,403
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it all depends from a procedural perspective.

233
00:16:53,483 --> 00:17:13,007
[SPEAKER_22]: I would defer to, obviously, Attorney Abruzzi, but if you issue a special permit that is specific to Panera as the operator, then it would be my understanding that if a new tenant came in, we would have to reapply and then present the information for that tenant.

234
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:19,949
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, the information that we presented to you from a traffic perspective and a queuing perspective is tenant-specific.

235
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:23,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe special permits go to the applicant.

236
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:24,895
[SPEAKER_10]: They do.

237
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:31,317
[SPEAKER_10]: But this council has many times, uh, sought to assign them to the tenant only.

238
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:35,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have no objection if that's what the counselor is leading to.

239
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:36,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it within the last few months.

240
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:49,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved that to make that an amendment that it's Panera as the tenant is the only one entitled to this drive through on the motion as amended by council Penta council marks.

241
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And then vice president carry on.

242
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:52,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

243
00:17:53,865 --> 00:18:03,452
[SPEAKER_02]: During the site plan review, probably two months back, there was a recommendation, one of several recommendations, to alter the drive-through.

244
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:09,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just point out on the plan what exactly was altered for the drive-through?

245
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:11,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

246
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, Karen Johnson, it was a relatively minor request as it related to the drive-through.

247
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:27,314
[SPEAKER_22]: just point out that on this plan, the stop bar is now parallel to the left side of the building.

248
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:36,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Previously a car exiting the pickup window could continue straight heading in the same direction towards Riverside Avenue.

249
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:45,080
[SPEAKER_22]: And the recommendation was that as you're coming out of the drive through, you have to turn right and come to a stop bar.

250
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, that's parallel at that point in time.

251
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,756
[SPEAKER_22]: you can make a left turn or a right turn.

252
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,157
[SPEAKER_22]: So that was incorporated into the final plans.

253
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:53,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

254
00:18:54,197 --> 00:19:06,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also, um, the, uh, filtration system, uh, as a Panera or yourself agreed to, uh, we mentioned at the last,

255
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:15,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Smashburger that was a charcoal filtration system, but I'm being told there are other type of filtration systems that may best suit this.

256
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:21,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to go on record that yourself open era will provide the filtration system.

257
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:23,275
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

258
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:35,085
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just, uh, this is an issue for some of the other council members that, um, after meeting with some of the neighbors, they raised some concerns, both at the community development board meeting and at followup discussions.

259
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:46,987
[SPEAKER_22]: And after reviewing with our HVAC engineer and architect for Panera, which is primarily the odors emanating from a Panera will be primarily from baking bread.

260
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:53,029
[SPEAKER_22]: And so the vents over the ovens for that cooking process will have a charcoal filter.

261
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have a charcoal filter.

262
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

263
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:04,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other point I had was from neighbors in the area regarding no parking in front of the establishment on Riverside Ave.

264
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize that's under the city jurisdiction, but I just want you, as the owner of the property, representing the owner of the property, that I, as a member of the council, I'm sure other members agree, that we're gonna push so that there is no parking along the curb on Riverside Ave.

265
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:32,367
[SPEAKER_22]: That is acceptable, and that is also our expectation, as Pat Dunford mentioned earlier, we have more than enough parking onsite to service those uses.

266
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:39,087
[SPEAKER_22]: And we would discourage our operators and our customers and their employees from parking along Riverside.

267
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:50,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to be clear though, that it's, it's only, it's only along Riverside because I believe the residents on the opposite side, only on our side of Riverside would there be no parking signs.

268
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe the residents on the opposite side of Riverside do use that for parking.

269
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:55,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

270
00:20:55,672 --> 00:21:00,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It would only be on the retail side in front of the establishment.

271
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:27,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, uh, during site plan review, one of the recommendations was the exit out of your lot, uh, that there would be signage, which I believe, uh, uh, I see in the plan here, but I only see one sign unless that's just pointing to two separate areas where it says you have to exit, take a right onto commercial street rather than go back to the congested way of getting out onto Riverside Ave.

272
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

273
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you point to where those signs are located?

274
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:35,713
[SPEAKER_22]: of the title sign and what it would look like.

275
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:50,918
[SPEAKER_22]: It says exit to Commercial Street with an arrow pointing you down the right side of Ocean State Job Lot, which at that point could obviously connect you to the signalized intersection at Riverside and Commercial.

276
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:56,439
[SPEAKER_22]: And those signs will be placed at both exit points into the shopping center.

277
00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:01,761
[SPEAKER_22]: So the leaders coming off of that sign show going here and here.

278
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:04,142
[SPEAKER_22]: at both exit points.

279
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:12,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you have to have any discussion with Ocean State Job Lot relative to using that's their access driveway, correct?

280
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:12,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

281
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,868
[SPEAKER_22]: We did.

282
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:22,014
[SPEAKER_22]: We have an agreement, just to be clear on this issue for those of you that didn't participate in the Community Development Board process,

283
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:44,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Property that are owned by similar entities are where we're proposing the Riverside restaurants here.

284
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:50,449
[SPEAKER_22]: And this property here are in similar ownership.

285
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:58,212
[SPEAKER_22]: Ocean State Job Lot owns this piece here, out to here, and out to here.

286
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:03,875
[SPEAKER_22]: So in order for us to be able to

287
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:12,180
[SPEAKER_22]: use their area, we had to enter into a side agreement with Ocean State Job Lot, who owns that parcel.

288
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:24,567
[SPEAKER_22]: And we started this process of communicating with them, trying to come to an understanding about this, even before we closed on the property a little over a year ago.

289
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:32,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we knew that what we wanted to achieve with the Riverside parcel really would require

290
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:36,967
[SPEAKER_22]: a better disbursement of traffic, if you will.

291
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:41,550
[SPEAKER_22]: And we've talked about this a number of times with neighbors, with the Community Development Board.

292
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:49,295
[SPEAKER_22]: We understand that a single access point on Riverside is the minimum necessary.

293
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Our tenants would prefer to have two points.

294
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,959
[SPEAKER_22]: There previously were three access points along Riverside.

295
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:04,306
[SPEAKER_22]: We wanted to get as far away from the main plaza drive and as far away from the signalized intersection as possible with the access for the restaurants.

296
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:16,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Knowing that, again, better disbursement of the traffic is ideal in this situation, we entered into an agreement which is now recorded on the land record.

297
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:19,260
[SPEAKER_22]: So it is a permanent agreement with Ocean State.

298
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So if need be, at some point,

299
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:36,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we have it so that cars have to exit coming out of your lot out to the commercial street area through means of barriers or some type of?

300
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:51,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not asking you to make a definitive now, but if the traffic, as we all anticipate, is going to increase, which we hope it does with these three businesses, that at some point maybe to help alleviate some of the concerns we have

301
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:56,735
[SPEAKER_02]: with the queuing up, exiting onto Riverside Ave, that may be an alternative.

302
00:24:57,175 --> 00:25:09,603
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I think what we have to take a look at, and Pat Dunford obviously can give you a little bit more discussion on this item, is where is the traffic coming from and what it attributes to the larger problem.

303
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:16,428
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we all understand that the larger problem is with the queue at the signal on the Fellsway.

304
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,631
[SPEAKER_22]: And we hope to have a better solution at some point in the future.

305
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:29,317
[SPEAKER_22]: that would better facilitate the flow in of cars using our main plaza drive and the exit flow out.

306
00:25:29,697 --> 00:25:42,805
[SPEAKER_22]: One thing that we are proposing to do, and it's not in any of your materials, it's something that we have discussed with the neighbors, is just something as simple, and you can actually, you can see it on this plan.

307
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:45,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I do have a copy of it, which I can show you.

308
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:51,570
[SPEAKER_22]: What we'd like to do, and this, of course, would have to go to the Traffic Commission for approval,

309
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:59,168
[SPEAKER_22]: but is just proposed striping so that you can't block this intersection, because that creates a lot of conflict in this area.

310
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:04,389
[SPEAKER_22]: And we obviously don't control the signal at the Fells Way.

311
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,212
[SPEAKER_22]: This property had three access points.

312
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:19,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Historically, we're taking three access points, moving it down to two, and then also, excuse me, moving it down to one, and then also providing

313
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,236
[SPEAKER_22]: two outlets at the rear.

314
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:25,137
[SPEAKER_22]: And so the agreement with Ocean State is that we have the right to use that.

315
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:32,259
[SPEAKER_22]: We also have the right to a certain number of parking spaces on their property in this area.

316
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,541
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a tremendous expense to us being able to negotiate that agreement with Ocean State, as you may have guessed.

317
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:47,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And so at this point in time, it is really critical for the operation of these users to have access off Riverside.

318
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:50,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And just one last point.

319
00:26:51,055 --> 00:27:03,782
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned at a recent meeting that you were going to also do sidewalks on the opposite side of Riverside Ave to improve pedestrian safety.

320
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:05,844
[SPEAKER_22]: Not the full length of it.

321
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:16,570
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can... This plan does show a length of improvement of sidewalk and some street trees on the opposite side of Riverside.

322
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:30,831
[SPEAKER_22]: construction of a new crosswalk so that residents in the area of Riverside and the surrounding neighborhoods around 4th Street area would have a safer way of walking to our location.

323
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:38,295
[SPEAKER_22]: The new crosswalk will connect you to a new sidewalk system on our side of the property.

324
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:44,139
[SPEAKER_22]: That is something that we think will help in terms similar to

325
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:53,564
[SPEAKER_22]: the striping at the intersection, we think that'll help with pedestrian safety, and we think it will help with traffic operations.

326
00:27:54,965 --> 00:28:03,231
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure you're aware that we do have the impact fees, which I think on this property are close to $17,000.

327
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:14,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so we, as part of the building permit process, we will have to make that contribution, but this is above and beyond that.

328
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say linkage money?

329
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that what you just mentioned?

330
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:19,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

331
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:21,126
[SPEAKER_22]: This is subject to linkage fees.

332
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:24,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you know what the actual linkage fees are?

333
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,612
[SPEAKER_22]: It's it's about 17 17 to 18,000.

334
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:40,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I just want to say that just on that point, I think the biggest impact financially for the city will be meals taxes.

335
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:42,117
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

336
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:44,058
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Bob.

337
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,298
[SPEAKER_22]: That's an excellent point.

338
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:53,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, also in addition to the increased real estate tax base, I think the biggest

339
00:28:54,496 --> 00:29:06,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by far, but not many communities have linkage, and it's an extra additive when companies come in and do work up to a certain size.

340
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a benefit to this community.

341
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President,

342
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:13,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the neighbors had many concerns.

343
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:22,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The petitioner was good enough to sit down at a meeting with the neighbors a couple of weeks ago when we had that monsoon rainstorm.

344
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:27,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, during the site plan review, there was a number of questions answered.

345
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:34,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is not going to be a perfect situation relative to the traffic impact.

346
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had discussions.

347
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:38,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, someday we'll be able to sit down with the state.

348
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,950
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion,

349
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:50,587
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fells Plaza, you should be able to exit the Fells Plaza on the Fellsway and also be able to cross over the Fellsway and go east, like you go into Haines Square up the Fellsway.

350
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:55,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That would alleviate all of Riverside Ave or a lot of the traffic on Riverside Ave.

351
00:29:55,869 --> 00:30:01,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, right now, when you come out of the Fellsway, you have to take a right onto the Fellsway and go into Wellington Circle.

352
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:08,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And for many people in that particular area, that doesn't suit their need when they're coming out of stop and shop or, or, you know, a business establishment.

353
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I will support this here tonight, Mr. President.

354
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:22,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an addition, uh, to, uh, the neighborhood and something that we have to monitor for overall, uh, traffic impact and pedestrian safety in the area, Mr. President.

355
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a motion for the charcoal filter, correct?

356
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:25,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

357
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:25,836
Okay.

358
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:26,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

359
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:26,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor.

360
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:27,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

361
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor DelaRusso, then Vice President Caraviello.

362
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'm very glad that we've got such favorable results here tonight.

363
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:46,547
[SPEAKER_11]: The proprietors of the property have certainly shown, since they've come to Medved, a willingness to engage and be good neighbors.

364
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:56,371
[SPEAKER_11]: They've met with neighbors and listened to their concerns and made the appropriate amendations when asked.

365
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:11,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we can be certain that all the renters who are operating the restaurants there will be using exhaust systems that clean the air and remove any odors from it.

366
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:19,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also very delighted to see, and my question was going to be, did your traffic consultants

367
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:29,301
[SPEAKER_11]: look into the possibility of creating a do not block the grid type application on Riverside Ave where the plaza empties.

368
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad that you're looking into it.

369
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:46,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad that you're going to consult with the traffic department so that you can find a way of implementing that and do the appropriate research to present it to the traffic department.

370
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:48,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is going to be a nice addition.

371
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:49,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I see you're going to plant trees.

372
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:53,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, can you tell us any type of trees that are going to be there?

373
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:54,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Will there be any palm trees?

374
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:57,813
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm afraid not.

375
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:58,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

376
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:01,516
[SPEAKER_22]: It's unfortunately not the climate for, for palm trees.

377
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:07,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Not certainly not tonight and not two weeks ago, but thank you for your positive comments.

378
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:12,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, a motion to approve on the motion as amended as amended.

379
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,819
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President, caveat.

380
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

381
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,763
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, I also want to thank you for stepping up in such a short time after you purchased the property, take over this property.

382
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:24,363
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been a property of being in 15 years.

383
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:27,345
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it'll be a great addition to the neighborhood.

384
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:30,566
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll be obviously a lot better to look at than what was there.

385
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:31,386
[SPEAKER_24]: Just two questions.

386
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:33,027
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been to other Panera's in the past.

387
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:35,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there going to be like takeover packing?

388
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:38,338
[SPEAKER_24]: in the parking lot?

389
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:40,639
[SPEAKER_22]: They have asked for a couple of spaces, yes.

390
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:47,444
[SPEAKER_22]: So we haven't identified where those will be yet, but they're usually at more of a convenient location to the door.

391
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:49,765
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a pickup opportunity, and then they're done.

392
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:52,507
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, then you've got five minutes to run in and get your stuff.

393
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,828
[SPEAKER_24]: And one last question.

394
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you feel that three handicap spots is enough?

395
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:04,555
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I'm going to ask Ken, our site civil engineer, that question, because we did

396
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:14,695
[SPEAKER_22]: We did look at that very closely and we, you know, we tried to position those spaces closer to the ramps, obviously.

397
00:33:15,735 --> 00:33:16,615
[SPEAKER_22]: But Ken, why don't you?

398
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:24,657
[SPEAKER_24]: I just asked if I see you only, you only have three handicaps boxes in there today.

399
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:25,137
[SPEAKER_24]: That's adequate.

400
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:28,658
[SPEAKER_20]: That's per code for the number of spaces, 60 spaces.

401
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:30,239
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to provide at least three.

402
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,300
[SPEAKER_24]: If at some point we feel that you would add more, if there was a need for more.

403
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:50,472
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I may have said this before, but we do, as well as owning and developing our properties, we also manage them, and we have very close relationships with our tenants, the managers of those operations.

404
00:33:50,512 --> 00:34:05,156
[SPEAKER_22]: We check in with them on a regular basis, and we've had situations in the past, for example, our Whole Foods Center in Melrose, where partly because of the population characteristics, we did add some additional handicapped spaces, so we are very in tune

405
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:08,247
[SPEAKER_22]: what the customers need and responding to them.

406
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:10,028
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yes, we will do that if necessary.

407
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

408
00:34:11,388 --> 00:34:13,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight and Councilor Lungo-Kern.

409
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

410
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:17,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Having reviewed the paperwork, I find everything in order.

411
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:24,810
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel as though this is a long overdue and much needed revitalization to a site that's been in disrepair for quite some time, Mr. President.

412
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,771
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'd like to second Councilor De La Russo's motion to move for approval as amended.

413
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:31,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

414
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:33,412
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

415
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Camuso.

416
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:41,246
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to just move or ask, I know you have a do not block driveway sign heading into the stop and shop.

417
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:49,972
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of the drive-through where you say you can queue up to 10 cars, can we put a do not queue beyond this point sign?

418
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:54,215
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make that as part of the paper.

419
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:56,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Do not queue beyond this point.

420
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so you don't block any of the entrance.

421
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:08,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Like you do have three entrances, which is great, but I mean, if you start queuing around 15 cars, you're gonna start blocking spots.

422
00:35:08,855 --> 00:35:13,159
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could put a do not queue beyond this point, I think I'd be okay with it.

423
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,240
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about the right rear corner of the building?

424
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:17,322
[SPEAKER_17]: The right rear corner, yes, right here.

425
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:21,965
[SPEAKER_17]: So you don't block this exit and entrance, the top right, yes.

426
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:29,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether people listen to that sign or not, at least, most people probably will, so hopefully that would solve my issue.

427
00:35:32,203 --> 00:35:32,723
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

428
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:34,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

429
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:34,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

430
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

431
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:44,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Kristen Bartlett, 488 Riverside Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

432
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:50,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, so I actually live right across the street from this development.

433
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:58,008
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the difficulties that I had spoken about the last time that we were here was my concern about the traffic flow.

434
00:35:58,308 --> 00:36:02,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, Karen was able to chat with me a little bit and share some information about what their plan is.

435
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:11,219
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, again, still very concerned about the Ocean State job lot being used as an exit and entrance.

436
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:22,488
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are unfamiliar with Medford, why would you drive down Commercial Street to get into a plaza that very clearly has access on Riverside Avenue as well as on the Felsway?

437
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,850
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not well lit.

438
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:27,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not walk down there late at night.

439
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:31,156
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily, in my opinion, a safe area.

440
00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:49,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not going to be lit correctly, there's not going to be proper signage for it, and needless to say in the morning with the Dunkin' Donuts that is on that corner for Commercial Ave, I have almost gotten into a number of accidents trying to turn down Commercial Street in the morning because the cars are so far back in queue.

441
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:57,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that that's nothing that this particular development has any control over, but if it's not going to be lit properly, there is not going to be accurate signage,

442
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that it's a bad idea.

443
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,795
[SPEAKER_00]: The infrastructure for the area doesn't support that.

444
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,738
[SPEAKER_00]: There are schools right down the street.

445
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:16,830
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a mom, and I am, excuse me, and I'm dropping my daughter off at school, I'm not hopping out of my car, rain, snow, shine, because you have to unstrap them and get them out and go inside as well.

446
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:18,712
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get queued up.

447
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:33,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, living right across the street, the problems that we've had, and this weekend alone, where they've started doing construction, probably Wednesday or Thursday of this week, construction workers are parking in front of our house, so we don't have parking.

448
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:43,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We're asking the other retail spaces a little bit further up on the street to move their vehicles so that we can park in front of our home, not have our driveway blocked.

449
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:54,287
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough situation, and I understand from a culinary standpoint, restaurant standpoint, I went to school for this, having a drive-through is a great asset, especially in our community.

450
00:37:54,327 --> 00:38:08,831
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fast food restaurants on that strip, but the drive-through is, and having the exit on Riverside Avenue, without the lights being cued up, I can't get into my driveway to get home at night.

451
00:38:12,152 --> 00:38:12,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

452
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:18,894
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of approval, Councilor Penta.

453
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to refer back to some of my original comments.

454
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:33,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when Smashburger had its appearance before the Community Development Board and the discussion was there and now we're into Panera.

455
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,740
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lot of traffic that's going to be going into this particular area.

456
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anyone denies the fact that development for the sake of development sometimes just doesn't work.

457
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:51,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can just look at the development that's taking place in the city of Medford and all the traffic problems that we have.

458
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Wellington Circle's a perfect example.

459
00:38:54,383 --> 00:39:09,696
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and just because real estate is hot right now and you can buy and sell and make a pretty good profit, what is that doing to the people that are here that have to live with all this development, whether it's this young lady who just came up here and spoke or what have you?

460
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:16,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that the owners of the property, the new owners of the property, they want to do the right thing.

461
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also understand the traffic.

462
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:27,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I was down there at 1243 this afternoon, coming off of the Felsway, going down Riverside Avenue, trying to take a left into the stop and shop.

463
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cars, they were just queued already back.

464
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And this wasn't even prime time.

465
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:34,375
[SPEAKER_05]: This was just 12 o'clock, 1215, whatever it might be.

466
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

467
00:39:36,977 --> 00:39:37,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

468
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor DelaRusso.

469
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:39,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Today is December 23rd.

470
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does that have to do with it?

471
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:45,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

472
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:49,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we can go there on any Friday night or any Saturday afternoon.

473
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget December 23rd, OK?

474
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:51,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And the traffic is there.

475
00:39:52,695 --> 00:39:57,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're trying to intimate that it's because it's Christmas, nice try, Councilor DelaRusso.

476
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,200
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact of the matter is there's a lot of traffic down there.

477
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:04,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I feel that there's a compromise to this.

478
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:09,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see a strong objection from the neighborhood, unfortunately, for that young lady.

479
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: But the chief of police is here.

480
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:18,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And chief, maybe you should talk to her and find out what's going on in front of her house where she's trying to do the right thing with her children as a taxpayer.

481
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:29,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to move approval with a six-month review after the drive-through is open and to have it come back before the council just to see how this thing is working out.

482
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:31,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a fair compromise.

483
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:35,841
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done this in an awful lot of other businesses through the years.

484
00:40:36,382 --> 00:40:38,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had six months reviews, year reviews, whatever it might be.

485
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:41,369
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a big traffic issue that's going to be coming before us.

486
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's going to work, and as the young lady said, 10 cars in the queue seems to be OK.

487
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:49,416
[SPEAKER_05]: The other gentleman said four to six is normally what normally takes place.

488
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:52,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have the ability to put 10, then so be it.

489
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm going to move, Mr. President.

490
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no problem.

491
00:40:56,241 --> 00:40:58,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll support it, but with a six-month review.

492
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:00,985
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

493
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:02,307
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of approval.

494
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:06,414
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended by Councilor Lungo-Kern for do not queue beyond this point sign.

495
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:10,937
[SPEAKER_08]: A motion by Councilor Penter that the permit goes with Panera and not the land.

496
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:14,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks' motion for a charcoal filter.

497
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:19,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Penter, six month review from the date that the drive-thru opens.

498
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:20,485
[SPEAKER_08]: The clerk will call the roll.

499
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the roll is called, Councilor Marks.

500
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:35,894
[SPEAKER_02]: If the petitioner wouldn't mind, at a meeting a few weeks ago, I had brought up the issue about these metal drop-off containers that are located in many businesses throughout the community.

501
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:47,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the Fells Plaza has several, and I'm not sure if your property extends all the way to Aldi's, but directly across from Aldi's, there's a couple of metal containers

502
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:54,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe are for books or something, but at any given day, if you go out there, there's old computers, broken TVs.

503
00:41:55,488 --> 00:41:59,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really becoming an eyesore, and there's neighbors directly across the street.

504
00:42:01,494 --> 00:42:08,500
[SPEAKER_22]: After you mentioned that issue, I did speak with our property manager, and we had all of them removed from our property.

505
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are on the Alte property, which is now owned by Kimco.

506
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:21,729
[SPEAKER_22]: We do have an open dialogue with the owners of the property, and I ask the manager, our property manager, to reach out to his contact at CHEMCO and make him aware of it.

507
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:30,753
[SPEAKER_22]: Because a lot of times what happens is these boxes are dropped on the property, and sometimes the property owner is not aware of it if they're not there on a regular basis.

508
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:33,194
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I will have him continue to follow up with them on that.

509
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:34,194
[SPEAKER_02]: The President And you said CHEMCO?

510
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:34,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

511
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,175
[SPEAKER_22]: DeParle It's called CHEMCO.

512
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:35,715
[SPEAKER_22]: The President CHEMCO.

513
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:35,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

514
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:39,397
[SPEAKER_22]: DeParle Is the name of the current owner of the Aldi Shopping Center.

515
00:42:39,597 --> 00:42:41,437
[SPEAKER_02]: The President Well, I would ask, Mr. President, as a B paper,

516
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:56,921
[SPEAKER_02]: The council will send a letter to the property owners, Kimco, to respond to the metal containers that are on their property and what their plans are to maintain these particular containers, Mr. President.

517
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:58,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

518
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:00,882
[SPEAKER_08]: On the B paper, all those in favor?

519
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:02,123
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

520
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:02,683
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

521
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,584
[SPEAKER_08]: On the main paper, as amended, the clerk will call the roll.

522
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:13,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Caravello.

523
00:43:13,078 --> 00:43:13,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

524
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:15,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor DelaRusso.

525
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:15,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

526
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:16,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

527
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:16,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

528
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor McCurran.

529
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:18,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

530
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:20,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

531
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:20,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

532
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:21,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta.

533
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:21,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

534
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:23,023
[SPEAKER_15]: President Camuso.

535
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:23,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

536
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:26,225
[SPEAKER_08]: By vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper passes.

537
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:27,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

538
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:27,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

539
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you're feeling better.

540
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:30,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

541
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, we're into suspension.

542
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:33,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to move to take paper 14795 out of order.

543
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:45,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Petition from DJ Debonagno, 470 High Street, Medford Mass, to address the council about business parking in the city.

544
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:56,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

545
00:43:57,237 --> 00:44:05,307
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is DJ Dabeningo, proprietor of Dab's Lock, president of the Massachusetts Locksmiths Association from 470 High Street in West Medford.

546
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:15,620
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to start by thanking the council for giving me the opportunity tonight to address my concerns in regards to a topic on the minds of residents, business owners, and city officials alike.

547
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:22,156
[SPEAKER_21]: This issue is the fast approaching start of the parking enforcement pay to park program here in Medford.

548
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:27,418
[SPEAKER_21]: In concept, this is a program that makes sense and is somewhat feasible for the city of Medford.

549
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,300
[SPEAKER_21]: As it stands now, it is completely opposite.

550
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:44,707
[SPEAKER_21]: You have the city of Medford that goes from zero enforcement with posted signs, and in just 13 days from now, Medford will become a city that will have aggressive enforcement and requiring all those who interact with the majority of our business districts

551
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:47,084
[SPEAKER_21]: to pay to park to support the local economy.

552
00:44:47,905 --> 00:44:51,967
[SPEAKER_21]: That includes our customers, the business owners, and those who work for the businesses.

553
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:59,532
[SPEAKER_21]: In all due respect, how can you go from zero to 100% with no middle ground in between on something like parking enforcement?

554
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:04,375
[SPEAKER_21]: What would have been so wrong with first enforcing the posted time limits?

555
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:06,817
[SPEAKER_21]: That, my friends, makes no logical sense.

556
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:13,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Many of the loyal patrons of West Medford were highly confused and agitated to see the newly installed kiosks.

557
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:22,844
[SPEAKER_21]: Not only were they agitated that they now have to park just to support the local businesses, they were more upset about how the system works, using the vehicle's license plates.

558
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:33,065
[SPEAKER_21]: On Small Business Saturday, November 30th, I polled 20 people who were in West Medford supporting local businesses and asked them on the top of their heads, did they know their license plate?

559
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:36,626
[SPEAKER_21]: One person said yes, one person.

560
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:52,896
[SPEAKER_21]: When I was then asked why I was inquiring, I informed them that in order to start and continue to support the businesses in Medford, they would need to know their license plates to interact with these kiosks starting very soon.

561
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:55,159
[SPEAKER_21]: That's strike one, agitated customers.

562
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:59,584
[SPEAKER_21]: My next concern is the time limits which are to be enforced.

563
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:10,618
[SPEAKER_21]: No considerations were given in regards to the length of time the customers may need to spend in a particular business, whether it be a nail salon, hairdresser, real estate, or insurance office, or funeral home.

564
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,782
[SPEAKER_21]: One hour on the street and two hours in municipal lots is not realistic for every business district.

565
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:24,427
[SPEAKER_21]: This morning, I was informed by both the Chamber of Commerce and a city councilor that the on-street parking has been increased to two hours.

566
00:46:25,288 --> 00:46:28,950
[SPEAKER_21]: However, it is still not practical for our customers to watch the clock

567
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:41,305
[SPEAKER_21]: and leave what they are doing to move their vehicle or risk getting a $25 ticket, then being in jeopardy of not obtaining another parking spot as they cannot stay in the same spot for more than a lot of time and just continue to feed the meter.

568
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:47,489
[SPEAKER_21]: These parking time limits need to be evaluated further or our customers will go elsewhere where there is no time limit.

569
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:48,329
[SPEAKER_21]: That's strike two.

570
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Our customers are now more agitated.

571
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:57,746
[SPEAKER_21]: The biggest concern I have as it relates to this new parking enforcement program is how it's going to negatively affect small businesses in our city.

572
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:07,731
[SPEAKER_21]: At a grand opening event I had back in January of 2012, Mayor McGlynn stated, small businesses are the backbone of this community and help build a stronger economy.

573
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:13,254
[SPEAKER_21]: How are small businesses the backbone of our community when they are given no support from the city administration?

574
00:47:13,854 --> 00:47:18,717
[SPEAKER_21]: The traffic commission had set the new fee for the business parking permits at $400 per year.

575
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,324
[SPEAKER_21]: or $200 per six months.

576
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:27,167
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a 400% increase over the previous unenforced business permit parking fee.

577
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:35,152
[SPEAKER_21]: That breaks down to roughly over $33 a month for a non-guaranteed spot, just so business owners and their employees can park at their own businesses.

578
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:42,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I was informed this morning by the chamber and a city councilor that there are being changes made to the current program.

579
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:45,438
[SPEAKER_21]: The yearly cost for the business parking permit will remain at $100.

580
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:55,252
[SPEAKER_21]: But as it stands, there is no consideration given to businesses that have multiple employees, part-time employees, seasonal employees, and temporary help.

581
00:47:55,832 --> 00:48:03,940
[SPEAKER_21]: Some businesses have as many as six to 10 full-time employees, even more part-time employees, and numerous seasonal and temporary employees.

582
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,243
[SPEAKER_21]: The dollars will start to add up real quick.

583
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:09,933
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, just so we can park in front of our own businesses.

584
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:16,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Immediately putting this into action in 13 days will cause some businesses to make some very tough decisions.

585
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:22,833
[SPEAKER_21]: With the purchase of a $100 a year parking permit, businesses should be given the secondary placard for part-time

586
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:24,730
[SPEAKER_21]: temp or seasonal employees.

587
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:37,258
[SPEAKER_21]: It is disgusting that the original fee of $400 was given to businesses, not by the city of Medford, but by the representatives of Republic Parking, which is $13 to come up with that required fee.

588
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:44,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Business owners already pay for electric, gas or oil, insurance, water, sewer, rent or mortgage on their building.

589
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:47,820
[SPEAKER_21]: maintain company vehicles if they have any, and they have to pay their employees.

590
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:51,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the food service businesses pay even more.

591
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:54,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Now the city wants more and more with their hand held out.

592
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:58,836
[SPEAKER_21]: As it stands, the city has about $15 million in free cash.

593
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:06,772
[SPEAKER_21]: How is it even remotely feasible to charge businesses registered in the city so much more just to park in front of their own establishments?

594
00:49:07,392 --> 00:49:09,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Many business owners do not live in Medford.

595
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:17,135
[SPEAKER_21]: In West Medford alone, business proprietors come from East Boston, South Boston, Winchester, in addition to being from Medford.

596
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:20,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Those individuals had a choice to open up shop in Medford.

597
00:49:20,976 --> 00:49:22,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't force them to go elsewhere.

598
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:28,198
[SPEAKER_21]: No considerations were given to the multitude of delivery vehicles that keep the businesses operating.

599
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:30,799
[SPEAKER_21]: with the incoming products they need to stay in business.

600
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,802
[SPEAKER_21]: They need a place to park without having to fear being fined for just doing their jobs.

601
00:49:36,303 --> 00:49:43,487
[SPEAKER_21]: There was no consideration given as to creation of loading zones in the business districts, which need to be brought into fruition immediately.

602
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:46,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Strike three, now you have angry business owners.

603
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:54,253
[SPEAKER_21]: To date, the representatives from Republic Parking have been more forthcoming and willing to work with small businesses than the city of Medford.

604
00:49:55,411 --> 00:49:59,633
[SPEAKER_21]: They have repeatedly said that they want to work with us to make this favorable for everyone involved.

605
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:01,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford has not done this.

606
00:50:02,094 --> 00:50:08,558
[SPEAKER_21]: They have listened to the concerns from businesses as to what we know will work for our business districts.

607
00:50:08,978 --> 00:50:10,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford, again, has not.

608
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:13,661
[SPEAKER_21]: They are fighting for the interests of the business owners.

609
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford has not.

610
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I sense a growing trend here?

611
00:50:16,862 --> 00:50:17,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Bad things come in threes.

612
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:21,745
[SPEAKER_21]: After the West Medford meeting with Republic last Wednesday,

613
00:50:22,637 --> 00:50:31,285
[SPEAKER_21]: My full intention was to rally the troops, talk to every business owner, and fill this chamber with those to show our disgust with City Hall.

614
00:50:31,825 --> 00:50:35,429
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, a family member took sick on Friday and passed away Sunday night.

615
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:45,658
[SPEAKER_21]: In all due respect, my family comes before parking issues in this city, a city which clearly does not feel small business is the backbone of this city's economy.

616
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:55,203
[SPEAKER_21]: If changes are not immediately made to what's currently set in motion for the January 5th start, the following will immediately impact my business.

617
00:50:55,804 --> 00:51:07,491
[SPEAKER_21]: My temporary worker who comes in once a week will be told to stay home because I cannot justify buying a business permit for their vehicle and I will not ask them to keep an eye on the clock to keep moving their vehicle every one to two hours.

618
00:51:07,871 --> 00:51:12,094
[SPEAKER_21]: That puts undue stress not only on my worker but on his vehicle for constantly moving.

619
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:13,715
[SPEAKER_21]: My part-time worker

620
00:51:14,075 --> 00:51:25,037
[SPEAKER_21]: who is here until he returns to school in the middle of January, will be told again to stay home because you cannot conduct adequate and professional business if you have to worry about moving your car every one to two hours.

621
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:33,459
[SPEAKER_21]: It is completely unjustified to buy a business permit when they will be employed for three weeks into the start of this new program and then three months over the summer.

622
00:51:34,939 --> 00:51:40,820
[SPEAKER_21]: I will not be able to park at my own business during normal operating hours as I cannot come up with a spare $100.

623
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:46,183
[SPEAKER_21]: in time for the January 5th start day, especially right around the Christmas holiday.

624
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:49,085
[SPEAKER_21]: I am a lifelong resident of Medford.

625
00:51:49,785 --> 00:51:50,786
[SPEAKER_21]: I own a small business.

626
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:55,448
[SPEAKER_21]: I pay city taxes, and I am an individual that gives back to this community regularly.

627
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:59,050
[SPEAKER_21]: More should be done for Medford business owners like myself.

628
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,773
[SPEAKER_21]: For every business permit that is purchased, we should be able to have another car parked for free.

629
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:09,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Please help me to continue to stand for small businesses here in Medford.

630
00:52:10,486 --> 00:52:12,867
[SPEAKER_21]: In closing, tonight I want to leave everyone with this.

631
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:17,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't just to follow and accept these orders from the city is what has to happen.

632
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:20,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Following orders like a sheep following a shepherd.

633
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:26,833
[SPEAKER_21]: But we are all in danger of becoming sheep, mindlessly following the herd, never questioning authority.

634
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:36,440
[SPEAKER_21]: The great American poet Wendell Barry once said, when describing the perils of bowing at the altar of conformity, your mind is to be punched in a card and put away in a little drawer.

635
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,342
[SPEAKER_21]: When they want you to buy something, they will call you.

636
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:42,824
[SPEAKER_21]: When they want you to be a yes man, they will let you know.

637
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:46,667
[SPEAKER_21]: So friends, each day, do something that won't compute.

638
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:47,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't be a sheep.

639
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:51,090
[SPEAKER_21]: Think for yourselves and refuse to accept the status quo.

640
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:53,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for listening to my concerns tonight.

641
00:52:54,112 --> 00:52:56,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy holidays, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year.

642
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:14,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a lifelong resident of Medford, formerly living on Placid Road at my current address.

643
00:53:15,504 --> 00:53:20,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here tonight, not because I'm a business owner, nor I have a family member who owns a business in Medford.

644
00:53:21,027 --> 00:53:27,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here because I have a strong interest in the financial prosperity and wellbeing of the local community.

645
00:53:27,826 --> 00:53:34,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to preserve the economic stability that many of the local institutions have embedded from conducting business with the residents of Medford.

646
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:50,082
[SPEAKER_01]: This enforcement plan will not be the asset to residents or local businesses, rather a burden because it's penalizing individuals from privately investing in their own welfare, because it's the city's inability to maintain and create an adequate amount of parking spaces for the public use.

647
00:53:51,163 --> 00:53:55,746
[SPEAKER_01]: This enforcement plan will definitely free up parking spaces because it will drive people away.

648
00:53:56,443 --> 00:54:07,969
[SPEAKER_01]: The City Council members voted to allow a Selective Committee and the Mayor to gather proposals from different parking management companies without allowing the public to hear proposals before the Mayor signed on with one with Republic Parking.

649
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:18,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am well aware that in the Executive Session through Mass General Laws, Chapter 30B, is legal, and yes, the City quietly complied with the rules within the law.

650
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not arguing that.

651
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:28,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm arguing that the city has used an executive session as a means to bypass and trick the public on a matter that will be a hassle on a daily basis, multiple times a day.

652
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:34,103
[SPEAKER_01]: My tax dollars are paying for you to represent the interests of the residents of Medford.

653
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how this meter system is in the interest of the people.

654
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:42,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not solve anything relating to parking because the sole issue is the lack of physical space.

655
00:54:42,805 --> 00:54:50,407
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not go directly to business owners who so graciously pay double the amount in commercial taxes compared to the surrounding communities such as Winchester or Arlington.

656
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,987
[SPEAKER_01]: These communities have an abundance of free parking.

657
00:54:53,487 --> 00:54:55,808
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a designated parking lot for communities to pay

658
00:54:56,188 --> 00:55:01,651
[SPEAKER_01]: and park their cars all day while he or she travels through public transportation to go to work in and out of Boston.

659
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:05,753
[SPEAKER_01]: The meat is itself is not coming out of my taxes but out of my personal pocket.

660
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:11,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses located in Meffitt Square, West Meffitt Square, Haines Square are not corporations.

661
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:12,516
[SPEAKER_01]: They are mom-and-pop stores.

662
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,537
[SPEAKER_01]: The local businesses are here to support the local community.

663
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:21,000
[SPEAKER_01]: How can residents support their local community if their own city is charging them to do so in the first place?

664
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:29,921
[SPEAKER_01]: When the city proposed a new enforcement plan a while back, most residents thought that due to our $16 million surplus, technically $8 million,

665
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:42,075
[SPEAKER_01]: since the other $8 million is in reserves for water and sewer programs, the city was going to hire traffic enforcers that would patrol and ticket cars that have been on the street for an extended period of time, such as two plus hours.

666
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:52,721
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the patroller's job to solely drive around and take the cars that were parked, and ticket the notes, excuse me, and take note of the cars that have been parked there for a long time and ticket them.

667
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:57,784
[SPEAKER_01]: The city could have kept the money within the community and hire a parking force

668
00:55:58,224 --> 00:56:05,767
[SPEAKER_01]: made up of local residents, or they could have used the money to rebuild a garage that was behind Colleen's slash Salvatore's.

669
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:07,548
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem would have been solved.

670
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:13,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, the city agreed to pay $1 million to Republic Parking for the installment of the meters.

671
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,932
[SPEAKER_01]: This corporation has nothing to invest in our community.

672
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:22,754
[SPEAKER_01]: The headquarter region is in Tennessee, a far cry from a local community.

673
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:25,515
[SPEAKER_01]: The city officials cannot say that this money

674
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:30,517
[SPEAKER_01]: that will gain from the meters will be reinvested in the community for the upkeep and of the roads and sidewalks currently.

675
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:31,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

676
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:36,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one, we have a surplus budget now that can cover those costs.

677
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, Medford receives money for maintenance from the Massachusetts Office of Transportation because of Route 60, a state highway.

678
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:45,164
[SPEAKER_01]: running through a large portion of the city.

679
00:56:46,204 --> 00:56:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: No one expected the city to install meters that are charging $1 an hour, now that I just learned it's $2, to park when just last month an hour was free.

680
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:59,010
[SPEAKER_01]: This enforcement is too extreme and will not solve the problems of the city's lack of space.

681
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:04,453
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone wanted to be difficult, he or she has the ability to feed the meter all day without even moving his or her car.

682
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:11,097
[SPEAKER_01]: This enforcement provides no solution because the public will still be stuck with no parking spaces.

683
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:18,981
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the purpose to charge the business $300 extra for a permit now that I learned that it went back to the $100 originally?

684
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:24,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Our city's business districts were designed for street parking.

685
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:31,749
[SPEAKER_01]: If they weren't, there would have been more strip malls and parking lots, which we know have not been financially sound across many communities in this country.

686
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:43,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, people coming to Medford to stop in at an attorney's office at Xero, Governor's Ave, will not mind spending the $1 to park if they are coming to Medford for one day to meet with their attorney to sign settlement papers.

687
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:50,442
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the issue is that residents who use the services of the local businesses on a daily basis will be stuck with this burden.

688
00:57:51,022 --> 00:57:54,523
[SPEAKER_01]: The local businesses serve the community by providing the common

689
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:56,672
[SPEAKER_01]: the necessary commodities.

690
00:57:57,293 --> 00:58:05,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, residents will take their money to the CVS in Winchester, for example, and not the CVS in Meffitt Square, due to the simple judgment of parking.

691
00:58:06,622 --> 00:58:09,263
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 cents for 15 minutes doesn't seem like a lot.

692
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:20,146
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if I get caught up talking to someone at a Michi's or Colleen's ice cream shop and I go one minute over the meter, I get a $25 fine, when before that, 16 minutes would have been free.

693
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:25,128
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys may argue that if I'm not sure of how long I'll be, I should insert the highest value.

694
00:58:25,688 --> 00:58:28,229
[SPEAKER_01]: But why would I spend a dollar for only 16 minutes?

695
00:58:28,489 --> 00:58:35,291
[SPEAKER_01]: The city is making a profit off of me for overpaying the meter because of my fear of receiving a fee for being over the allotted time.

696
00:58:36,197 --> 00:58:43,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I request the council to vote on a motion to formally invite the public for a hearing five weeks after the parking enforcement has been in place.

697
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:48,059
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be mandatory that the mayor and the traffic commission is present during that hearing.

698
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:48,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

699
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:49,880
Thank you very much.

700
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:55,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

701
00:58:55,821 --> 00:59:01,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And on behalf of all the members of the council, we want to give you our condolences on your grandpa that passed away, DJ.

702
00:59:07,395 --> 00:59:09,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, John Costas, 25 Salem Street.

703
00:59:10,596 --> 00:59:13,057
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not here for Chevalier Theater for a change.

704
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:19,059
[SPEAKER_19]: This whole thing with the parking program, it's kind of a double-edged sword.

705
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:26,661
[SPEAKER_19]: In some ways, I'm really glad we have it, because we always had a problem with the merchants parking in front of their stores.

706
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:31,742
[SPEAKER_19]: And now I'm someone that I am sometimes guilty of parking in front of my store for more than an hour.

707
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:37,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I should get a ticket, and I have, I just pay the ticket, because it's my fault.

708
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:50,172
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm hoping is going to happen is that my customers are going to have a place to park, because right now we have merchants and the people that work for them park in front of my store all day long.

709
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:58,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, in the old days, the police department, you know, they, two or three times a week, they'd come by and, and, uh, deal with this.

710
00:59:58,737 --> 01:00:00,578
[SPEAKER_19]: And eventually people got the idea.

711
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:03,460
[SPEAKER_19]: If I park more than two hours in this spot,

712
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I will get a ticket.

713
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:09,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the police department said, I guess they don't want to do tickets anymore.

714
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:16,951
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe the system we have now isn't that great, but it's something that should be refined.

715
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:21,595
[SPEAKER_19]: But my big reason for being here is the traffic commission.

716
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:24,457
[SPEAKER_19]: This traffic commission did the same thing.

717
01:00:24,557 --> 01:00:25,998
[SPEAKER_19]: The last traffic commission did.

718
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:31,543
[SPEAKER_19]: They made the businesses pay the same amount of money as a commuter.

719
01:00:32,668 --> 01:00:39,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, originally, 30, 25 years ago, there was always a very large difference between a commuter and a business.

720
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:46,432
[SPEAKER_19]: And then 10 or 12 years ago, they decided to lower the commuter down to 100 and raise the businesses up to 100.

721
01:00:48,413 --> 01:00:53,535
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally don't think that a business should be considered at the same rate as a commuter.

722
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:58,896
[SPEAKER_19]: I think charging $100 for a commuter, even $400 for a commuter, is silly.

723
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,497
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a buck and a quarter a day.

724
01:01:01,568 --> 01:01:06,611
[SPEAKER_19]: The commuters are going to pay $6 a day if they have to park at a regular parking lot.

725
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:13,076
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like, and I'm glad the commission's here, I would like to see them change the rate.

726
01:01:14,357 --> 01:01:17,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe if they want to raise businesses a little bit, that's fine.

727
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:27,145
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think $100 or $400 is extremely low for someone to park in Medford Square in a commuter lot to go to Boston where they're going to pay $6.

728
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:28,686
[SPEAKER_19]: They should pay $1,000 or $1,500 a year

729
01:01:31,548 --> 01:01:33,528
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're still getting a big savings.

730
01:01:34,709 --> 01:01:44,031
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like the commission to reconsider the price structure and make a larger difference between the businesses and the commuter.

731
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:54,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think that the businesses serve as much better in the community than the commuter, because the commuter really doesn't support the square.

732
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:57,854
[SPEAKER_19]: They park in the lot over here, and they take the bus and go back home again.

733
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:00,055
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

734
01:02:01,002 --> 01:02:08,507
[SPEAKER_08]: As of today, just so you know, commuter passes will only be sold to Medford residents, so people that are actually paying excise taxes in our community.

735
01:02:09,088 --> 01:02:11,710
[SPEAKER_08]: As one member, I can't support that, but I hear your concern.

736
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,110
[SPEAKER_19]: I still think it should be.

737
01:02:13,171 --> 01:02:17,033
[SPEAKER_19]: We should make more money off the commuter since they get the most benefit out of it.

738
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:17,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

739
01:02:17,674 --> 01:02:18,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, John.

740
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello.

741
01:02:21,296 --> 01:02:22,297
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

742
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:26,960
[SPEAKER_24]: I think everybody behind this reel has heard the concerns of

743
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:38,582
[SPEAKER_24]: citizens, I hear them more than others because I work in this community and everywhere I've gone in the past few months, I've gotten pretty much beat up on.

744
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:48,864
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand that the young lady spoke earlier about re-evaluating in five weeks.

745
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:55,489
[SPEAKER_24]: I agree with her, maybe in 60 days we should have a re-evaluation period, see where we are, see what changes need to be made.

746
01:02:55,549 --> 01:03:00,092
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, there will be some necessary changes.

747
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:02,614
[SPEAKER_24]: As we said tonight, changes were made today.

748
01:03:03,695 --> 01:03:06,898
[SPEAKER_24]: So hopefully, I'd like to send that out, Mr. President,

749
01:03:08,254 --> 01:03:13,819
[SPEAKER_24]: 60 days, if we could review this with Republic Parking and the mayor.

750
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,821
[SPEAKER_24]: 60 days.

751
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:19,203
[SPEAKER_24]: 60 days, and send that paper to the mayor.

752
01:03:19,223 --> 01:03:20,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

753
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:23,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

754
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:24,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor DelaRusso.

755
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:27,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this body have any authority over the parking management plan?

756
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:28,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not.

757
01:03:28,648 --> 01:03:31,530
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually supported a resolution to combine the two commissions.

758
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:37,733
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't give them the right to set the fee structure probably about a year ago, a year and a half ago through a homeroom petition.

759
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:38,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Mr. President.

760
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:40,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, councilor Penta.

761
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:42,796
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'll let him speak.

762
01:03:43,677 --> 01:03:44,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Longo Kern.

763
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:46,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Longo Kern.

764
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:47,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll run the meeting.

765
01:03:47,138 --> 01:03:48,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Longo Kern has the floor.

766
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:49,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

767
01:03:50,355 --> 01:04:01,900
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, um, last Thursday after the meeting that took place for West Medford, I met with the, uh, not only the project manager, but the district manager, I spent an hour with them at a local business establishment in West Medford.

768
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And we went at it through a whole bunch of issues as it relates to what's going on.

769
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:14,745
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one, let's talk about the first one, um, which is the Winthrop street that goes on place that road up to the main entrance to the cemetery.

770
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,322
[SPEAKER_05]: in on Boston Avenue, up by the park and garage where Tufts University has theirs.

771
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:23,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they can sit there all day long for $5.

772
01:04:25,185 --> 01:04:28,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So first come, first serve, you get $5, it's the best deal of the day.

773
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:33,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But you go to Memphis Square or any one of the squares, you're going to have to put that quarter in that machine every 15 minutes.

774
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:38,274
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to be subject to whatever the penalty is going to be if, in fact, you don't feed the meter.

775
01:04:39,094 --> 01:04:40,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So in my conversation with them,

776
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:45,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Their answer was, listen, I'm just telling you what City Hall told us to do.

777
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:46,772
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's number one.

778
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:53,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, raising it from one hour to the two hours, that defeats the whole purpose of traffic enforcement.

779
01:04:54,456 --> 01:05:01,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because business people might be complaining over the fact that we're going to be getting an extra hour, that's not what they were asking for.

780
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:11,225
[SPEAKER_05]: All business was asking for in this council, and as the report for which the chief is sitting in the back of the room, dated, I believe, September 2009, your introductory sentence,

781
01:05:11,645 --> 01:05:14,126
[SPEAKER_05]: was a traffic enforcement plan for the city of Medford.

782
01:05:14,406 --> 01:05:23,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people who were violating traffic enforcement during the time periods that the traffic time allowed you, whether it was one hour, two hours, whatever it might be, get a ticket.

783
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,831
[SPEAKER_05]: This wasn't out there to put money in a meter.

784
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It was revenue enhancement, revenue enforcement.

785
01:05:30,313 --> 01:05:38,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Thirdly, as we continue on, why can't commuters pay more than a business person?

786
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:44,926
[SPEAKER_05]: The small business person in this community is the bloodline, is the lifeline within this community.

787
01:05:45,646 --> 01:06:01,820
[SPEAKER_05]: You start cutting down their walk-in customers, you start cutting into their daily operating finances as a result of worrying about what they're going to have to pay for a permit, or making sure that there's money in the meter, or making sure that they can keep their part-time employee, that's going to hurt them.

788
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to hurt them an awful lot.

789
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So I agree with the fact that commuters should be paying more.

790
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:16,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And for so many years, we've had people from Winchester hustle their way over to Medford, parking in spots, never mind never getting tagged, never even buying a pass.

791
01:06:16,343 --> 01:06:20,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But those that do buy a pass, as recorded downstairs, so be it.

792
01:06:20,203 --> 01:06:21,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's an issue that needs to be looked at.

793
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:28,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we heard a little while ago in one of the newspaper comments, I don't know if the reporter is here,

794
01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:42,516
[SPEAKER_05]: When he was speaking to the gentleman who was the president of the chamber, that gentleman of the chamber indicated that all four sections of the city are not the same, and they should be treated and looked upon as that.

795
01:06:43,397 --> 01:06:56,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And then subsequent to that, there was a follow-up story in the newspaper, and for which the gentleman appeared before the council, and saying he never said that, to the reporter right underneath the press, and basically said, you know, we're all gonna work together, and we come up with a plan, and we're working with the mayor.

796
01:06:57,395 --> 01:07:21,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, never once during this whole process from 2009 till today, 2014, has any one of the four squares individually and independently met with any group of people from the city of Medford as it relates to their business operation, what do you think we should do, how should we do it, give us your input, and let us see how we can negotiate something that's amicable and peaceful for everybody, if in fact we're gonna go forward with that.

797
01:07:22,089 --> 01:07:22,950
[SPEAKER_05]: That's yet to happen.

798
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,772
[SPEAKER_05]: The gentleman that owns the lock company hit it right in the head.

799
01:07:26,452 --> 01:07:28,473
[SPEAKER_05]: He has to let go a part-time employee.

800
01:07:29,134 --> 01:07:37,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And if he lets that part-time employee go, unfortunately, because he can't afford to pay the $400 rate as it was, now it's been reduced.

801
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,099
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to that next.

802
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:40,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact of the matter is, he lets that employee go.

803
01:07:41,301 --> 01:07:43,262
[SPEAKER_05]: That means he loses a walk-in customer.

804
01:07:43,282 --> 01:07:44,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That means he loses a sale.

805
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:50,646
[SPEAKER_05]: That means he loses some type of potential profit, which means that's going to impede upon his financial capability.

806
01:07:50,912 --> 01:07:56,934
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep on going, if in fact he's got a business that's just marginal, or he's making a decent salary.

807
01:07:57,255 --> 01:08:02,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But why should he be penalized for making a decent salary when he's given good service or service to the community?

808
01:08:03,217 --> 01:08:08,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we get today this memo, the first memo that came out today from the Chamber of Commerce.

809
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:09,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Great news.

810
01:08:09,439 --> 01:08:10,600
[SPEAKER_05]: We have wonderful news here.

811
01:08:11,158 --> 01:08:12,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Things have been changed.

812
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:29,370
[SPEAKER_05]: The executive director says, I wrote a letter, penned it to the mayor and to the traffic commission, and lo and behold, on the same day, a report comes back that the $400 that I'm assuming that the traffic commission initiated, because that's what the republic said, has now been reduced to $100.

813
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's been no public advertising or posting in the clerk's office of a meeting by the Traffic Commission.

814
01:08:37,632 --> 01:08:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the Mayor arbitrarily just did this because of a meeting that took place, that's wrong.

815
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:48,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And that shows you're right there with the power of this whole thing and where it's coming from City Hall.

816
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:53,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get another email from another taxpayer in the community who has a concern.

817
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Your concerns will be taken up at the next Traffic Commission meeting.

818
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:02,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So you tell me, Mr. Businessperson, and anyone who might be watching out there, what this is all about.

819
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:06,006
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have it one day, you go from 400 down to $100.

820
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:11,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Memphis City Council's never been advised on any of this, never been brought into a discussion.

821
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:15,108
[SPEAKER_05]: The Memphis City Council for years has been talking about this.

822
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:25,751
[SPEAKER_05]: The Channel 7 news that took place this past February, where the mayor blamed the council for not giving them the money for residential parking permits was absolutely wrong, it was a lie.

823
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:30,993
[SPEAKER_05]: This Memphis City Council has supported the police department in all those issues, including that particular matter.

824
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:37,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we continue on, Mr. President, relative to the fact about just how lazy people are.

825
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:44,813
[SPEAKER_05]: A perfect opportunity for the Medford business people to park behind Route 16 in St.

826
01:09:44,853 --> 01:09:50,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph's parking lot on a daily basis, and they wouldn't have to be worried about getting tagged of their employees.

827
01:09:50,996 --> 01:09:53,336
[SPEAKER_05]: All they would have to do was walk across the street.

828
01:09:53,697 --> 01:10:06,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a lighting problem that needs to be straightened out, isn't that a lot easier to do than worrying about a merchant parking in front of his store, or worrying about his employees parking in front of the store, or worrying about the city's not going to get the revenue that it's supposed to be getting?

829
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:07,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrong.

830
01:10:08,598 --> 01:10:09,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there.

831
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:12,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a municipal parking lot owned by the city.

832
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:22,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the city first took that over, I believe there was a transit trolley, because I was on it with another counselor, and we picked up merchants in the square, and they went behind there, and they thought it was well.

833
01:10:23,089 --> 01:10:29,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the wintertime comes, if it snows, gets out, or it's raining, you put an umbrella on, and hopefully the city would do what it's supposed to do.

834
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:33,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It plows and shovels, you know, their own municipal parking lot that they have over there.

835
01:10:34,966 --> 01:10:37,147
[SPEAKER_05]: All businesses aren't the same in this community.

836
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:40,528
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to one section of the city as compared to another.

837
01:10:41,509 --> 01:11:00,497
[SPEAKER_05]: But isn't it interesting, when you go to the South Medford area, and you're certain blocks of businesses that have nothing, no signage, no kiosks, and you try to compare them to other parts of the community that have signage and kiosks, then you ask the question, as I did, and the answer was, we're being told what City Hall told us to do.

838
01:11:00,837 --> 01:11:03,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We put these kiosks where we were supposed to put them.

839
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:15,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not going to bode well, because you are going to have businesses now fighting against businesses, because while one business has to toe the mark, another one doesn't because of no signage and no kiosks.

840
01:11:15,783 --> 01:11:19,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be a real problem once this thing gets itself implemented.

841
01:11:20,445 --> 01:11:28,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The unfortunate part is, and I don't know how the chamber ever got themselves hooked into this thing, it's not the chamber's problem, it's not the chamber's business.

842
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:35,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the city of Medford's problem, it's the mayor's problem, it's his program, it's his plan, and these public meetings should be taking place here.

843
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:42,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in the quiet zone of a chamber office, where in one meeting there was four people, another meeting there was 10, another meeting there was 12.

844
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:47,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the true representation of all the communities, all the business people in this community.

845
01:11:48,393 --> 01:11:59,681
[SPEAKER_05]: You can agree or disagree on what I'm saying, but the true fact of the matter is this whole parking initiative started in May in an executive session when the Medford City Council was asked, because of three people,

846
01:12:00,074 --> 01:12:08,819
[SPEAKER_05]: three people who came in, and I have everything here, and I've got the tape, and I've got the minutes of the meeting, three people came in and they said they can only do a 10-year proposal.

847
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:12,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And the council went along with the 10-year proposal with one proviso.

848
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:20,866
[SPEAKER_05]: You go forward and negotiate with that person, but you also come back and tell us what it would cost if the city of Medford was going to do it, and then we will make the decision.

849
01:12:21,226 --> 01:12:22,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And that decision never took place.

850
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:30,429
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor just went forward with the one that he presented back in May at that point in time, which happened to be Republic, and he went forward with that.

851
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:35,290
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a City of Medford Mayor McGlynn Traffic Enhancement Program.

852
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:44,572
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want some relief, and you want your voices heard, the only place that can seem to do it is to come before this City Council, and hopefully, hopefully he will listen.

853
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:52,814
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just astonished how in a period of less than 24 hours, you can go from a $400 fee down to $100.

854
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:57,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're only going to do it for a year, which means after a year, something's going to happen and change.

855
01:12:58,558 --> 01:13:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But no vote ever took place.

856
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:02,280
[SPEAKER_05]: No commission meeting ever took place.

857
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,462
[SPEAKER_05]: No parking board ever discussed this.

858
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:08,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, am I saying the right or the wrong thing?

859
01:13:09,245 --> 01:13:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you meet between yesterday to today to reduce from $400 to $100?

860
01:13:16,545 --> 01:13:20,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Leo Sacco, police chief in the city of Medford, and I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford.

861
01:13:22,089 --> 01:13:23,030
[SPEAKER_14]: There was not a meeting.

862
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:33,699
[SPEAKER_14]: I did poll the members based on the input that we received from the business community that there was obviously a concern with the raise in the business rates for the business permits.

863
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next meeting is scheduled for January 13th and may be moved up a week earlier.

864
01:13:39,343 --> 01:13:44,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And that will be published and will be a public record for the city clerk to post.

865
01:13:44,814 --> 01:13:47,561
[SPEAKER_05]: With all due respect, Chief, this is such a huge major change.

866
01:13:47,983 --> 01:13:49,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't there have ever been a public meeting?

867
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:52,075
[SPEAKER_05]: and have this on a public agenda.

868
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:53,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, anybody can call up.

869
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,837
[SPEAKER_05]: We can call amongst ourselves and pull ourselves.

870
01:13:56,017 --> 01:14:00,819
[SPEAKER_14]: December 9th, it was a public meeting, and that's when the rates were discussed, and that was posted with the city.

871
01:14:00,839 --> 01:14:01,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And $400.

872
01:14:01,339 --> 01:14:02,740
[SPEAKER_14]: $400 for a year.

873
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

874
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,141
[SPEAKER_14]: $200 for six months.

875
01:14:05,381 --> 01:14:08,382
[SPEAKER_14]: But to go from $400 to $100, that took place yesterday.

876
01:14:08,503 --> 01:14:09,203
[SPEAKER_14]: No, the $100, no.

877
01:14:09,503 --> 01:14:18,107
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been brewing for the past week with some of the input that we've received from the public folks who have met with the Chamber of Commerce people and the business people from the different districts.

878
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:21,948
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, the chamber hosted those meetings and facilitated those meetings.

879
01:14:22,428 --> 01:14:32,330
[SPEAKER_14]: And based on the, uh, the input that we received from those meetings and from the public, uh, determination was made that we did not have to implement the higher rate at this time.

880
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:42,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I did receive some, uh, communication from several council members that had some good ideas about where we should be going with the business rate and placards and things of that nature.

881
01:14:42,472 --> 01:14:43,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh,

882
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:46,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So tell me something similar to what Debs had mentioned here earlier.

883
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:55,121
[SPEAKER_14]: So the fact of the matter is I totally agree with, uh, you know, four to five weeks out that we review what's in place.

884
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:57,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise we're never going to get this thing off the ground.

885
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:05,764
[SPEAKER_14]: And this has been a mandate from this council that almost one meeting after another said that this parking management program has to go.

886
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:07,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not in it for the finances.

887
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:09,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in it for the parking management.

888
01:15:10,067 --> 01:15:12,469
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have 132 offices anymore.

889
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:13,170
[SPEAKER_14]: We have 106.

890
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,031
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the reason.

891
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,573
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we've made pitches to the mayor's office.

892
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,375
[SPEAKER_14]: If you hire more people, maybe it could be done.

893
01:15:19,755 --> 01:15:27,001
[SPEAKER_14]: But as the chief, I can never say that we could totally commit active duty police officers to performing the parking enforcement function.

894
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,523
[SPEAKER_14]: They always get called away for something else.

895
01:15:30,324 --> 01:15:35,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But chief, Memphis city council asked to come in with an alternative if the city was going to do it.

896
01:15:36,175 --> 01:15:37,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget the police department.

897
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:40,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have been private people, could have been retired people, whatever it might have been.

898
01:15:41,339 --> 01:15:44,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You were part of that committee that went to five of the surrounding cities and towns.

899
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:45,343
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

900
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:54,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And those cities and towns all said that they could not believe that an urban city like the city of Medford, this close to Boston, had free parking on every one of its public streets.

901
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:56,052
[SPEAKER_14]: They couldn't believe it.

902
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:06,399
[SPEAKER_05]: but when you go to Malden, Winchester, and Arlington with this free parking, because of the... Well, they may be looking into it, but the fact that... Point of information, Winchester's putting in meters.

903
01:16:06,419 --> 01:16:09,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Winchester is putting in meters within the next couple of months.

904
01:16:14,495 --> 01:16:20,199
[SPEAKER_05]: The difference is, and we're going to get into the issue of meters, but I didn't want to, but the difference is a kiosk and a meter, they're like night and day.

905
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:22,700
[SPEAKER_05]: People can see the meter and they can understand that.

906
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:33,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when you're driving down the street and you've got to figure out five car lengths ahead and look at it, a kiosk, and then you have to remember what your registration number is and it's raining out and you've got a couple of kids in the car, you're a senior citizen or whatever it might be.

907
01:16:34,368 --> 01:16:35,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a simple meter issue.

908
01:16:35,822 --> 01:16:37,683
[SPEAKER_14]: please councilor, don't sell the public shot.

909
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:39,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there'll be a learning curve.

910
01:16:39,324 --> 01:16:40,085
[SPEAKER_14]: We understand that.

911
01:16:40,105 --> 01:16:43,967
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think once they get beyond that point, they'll be able to manage those.

912
01:16:44,027 --> 01:16:46,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a hurt to the business community too.

913
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,791
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not, listen, we're not Newbury street in Boston.

914
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:54,714
[SPEAKER_14]: What I just heard, what I heard from the business community right now is someone wants to be able to park in front of his store.

915
01:16:54,754 --> 01:16:57,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone wants to have his employees park in front of his store.

916
01:16:57,116 --> 01:16:57,956
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the whole idea.

917
01:16:57,996 --> 01:16:59,077
[SPEAKER_14]: We want parking management.

918
01:16:59,097 --> 01:17:00,658
[SPEAKER_14]: We want people to go to his store.

919
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:05,992
[SPEAKER_05]: We can also have traffic enforcement, and if that's the case, then why did you increase it from one hour to two?

920
01:17:06,032 --> 01:17:09,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not just keep the one, nobody's arguing about increasing the time.

921
01:17:09,615 --> 01:17:13,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it was a situation, no, we did have several complaints.

922
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,181
[SPEAKER_14]: You can buy 15 minutes, but at least you have a two hour max.

923
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:20,185
[SPEAKER_14]: If a person goes into the hairdresser, they're not out in one hour.

924
01:17:21,435 --> 01:17:24,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, there are spots in the city where there's signs that say, one hour parking.

925
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:25,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's going to be increased to two.

926
01:17:26,117 --> 01:17:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: The signs are already up.

927
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:27,658
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, but it's.

928
01:17:28,078 --> 01:17:28,778
[SPEAKER_05]: The signs are already up.

929
01:17:28,798 --> 01:17:29,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to change all the signs?

930
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, many of them are already two hours.

931
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,300
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of them are one hour.

932
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,540
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of one hour parking.

933
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:39,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you justify a $5 all day parking on Playstead Road and on Boston Avenue?

934
01:17:40,163 --> 01:17:41,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we evaluated.

935
01:17:41,683 --> 01:17:45,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Tufts University, the parking garage at Tufts University is $8 for the day.

936
01:17:46,766 --> 01:17:48,346
[SPEAKER_14]: We want people to park on these streets.

937
01:17:48,386 --> 01:17:49,667
[SPEAKER_14]: We want them to pay the $5 for the day.

938
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:54,160
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that's going to begin and build to expand.

939
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,901
[SPEAKER_14]: The fee will go up if we see that the load is there.

940
01:17:57,921 --> 01:17:59,262
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this is all something new.

941
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:02,703
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to encourage people to pay for the $5 for the day.

942
01:18:03,624 --> 01:18:07,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then if that's the case, why don't you just have every parking meter in the city go to $5 a day?

943
01:18:08,006 --> 01:18:11,027
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you turn around and behind car lanes and that parking lot?

944
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:12,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Not everybody needs, say, $5.

945
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that parking lot, Chief,

946
01:18:14,075 --> 01:18:18,678
[SPEAKER_05]: As the gentleman said, Mr. Nash, who said from the company, we'll give a $25 ticket.

947
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:20,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll sit there all day, and they'll only get one ticket.

948
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:21,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what have they accomplished?

949
01:18:21,999 --> 01:18:22,740
[SPEAKER_05]: They go to Boston.

950
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,261
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to pay $40.

951
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:25,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

952
01:18:25,942 --> 01:18:26,062
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

953
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:27,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to make a bet?

954
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:30,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Speak to Mr. Nash.

955
01:18:30,504 --> 01:18:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you his number.

956
01:18:32,465 --> 01:18:33,506
[SPEAKER_17]: We specifically asked that.

957
01:18:33,546 --> 01:18:34,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information.

958
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:34,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information.

959
01:18:34,907 --> 01:18:36,067
[SPEAKER_17]: We specifically asked that question.

960
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:40,790
[SPEAKER_17]: They said they'd get multiple tickets if they were there for eight hours in a one-hour spot.

961
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:41,570
[SPEAKER_14]: They could.

962
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:42,791
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't happen that often.

963
01:18:42,871 --> 01:18:51,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I think initially they probably do just the one ticket for the day, but you know, if you get a series of those tickets and if they go unpaid, then you have to tow and hold.

964
01:18:51,596 --> 01:19:00,581
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, eventually they get caught up with, I mean, it's not, you know, it's certainly not a perfect science and this is, this is fertile territory.

965
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:05,104
[SPEAKER_14]: This is new territory for this whole parking enforcement plan.

966
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:06,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that being said.

967
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:10,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that as we go forward, there'll be some tweaking that will need to happen.

968
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:12,679
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that being said, Chief, and you're a reasonable person.

969
01:19:13,468 --> 01:19:15,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think seven members are reasonable over here.

970
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:17,410
[SPEAKER_05]: This should have all been discussed ahead of time.

971
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:21,731
[SPEAKER_05]: There should have been public meetings to listen to all and what possibly could be the concerns.

972
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:33,956
[SPEAKER_05]: That gentleman in the back who started this thing tonight, he shouldn't have had to got himself all worked up over the fact that it started at a $400 clip, and then all of a sudden, within 24 hours, it's reduced to $100 because enough people were complaining.

973
01:19:34,196 --> 01:19:39,078
[SPEAKER_05]: That young lady shouldn't have to come up here and be worried about not only the business and the enhancement and where the money's going.

974
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:41,439
[SPEAKER_05]: This only started off as a revenue,

975
01:19:42,472 --> 01:19:44,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Not an enhanced—revenue enforcement.

976
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:49,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the city did its own enforcement— Point of information, Councillor DelaRusso.

977
01:19:49,794 --> 01:19:52,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand what revenue enforcement means.

978
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:54,895
[SPEAKER_11]: If the Council could define that for us, please.

979
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:55,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking for information.

980
01:19:55,476 --> 01:19:57,096
[SPEAKER_05]: No, revenue enforcement is very simple.

981
01:19:57,436 --> 01:20:00,637
[SPEAKER_05]: If their sign says one hour parking, and that's all there is, you get a ticket.

982
01:20:01,481 --> 01:20:05,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Enforcement enhancement would mean you'd have to go and put the money in the meter for whatever it might be.

983
01:20:05,444 --> 01:20:10,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said to you before, there were certain elements on Main Street and South Medford that have absolutely nothing.

984
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:13,570
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are businesses that have absolutely nothing.

985
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,911
[SPEAKER_05]: No signage, no kiosks.

986
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:18,294
[SPEAKER_14]: There are certain elements citywide that did not receive.

987
01:20:18,454 --> 01:20:19,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Then how does that work, Chief?

988
01:20:19,555 --> 01:20:20,776
[SPEAKER_05]: All businesses are supposed to be the same.

989
01:20:21,977 --> 01:20:25,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they don't have a substantial business block.

990
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,680
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you talking about?

991
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,522
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have a substantial business block.

992
01:20:29,102 --> 01:20:29,783
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of places.

993
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take you to South Medford and I'll give you a block.

994
01:20:31,644 --> 01:20:33,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I know exactly what you're talking about.

995
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:33,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

996
01:20:33,546 --> 01:20:36,449
[SPEAKER_14]: But they don't have that substantial business block.

997
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:38,291
[SPEAKER_14]: But as I said just a few minutes ago.

998
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,376
[SPEAKER_14]: This is built to expand.

999
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:43,277
[SPEAKER_14]: If we see that, you know, we know what's going to happen.

1000
01:20:43,717 --> 01:20:49,399
[SPEAKER_14]: People that used to park all day where the meters are now or the kiosks are, they will now move.

1001
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:52,879
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll have some displacement and then we'll have to address that issue.

1002
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: With all due respect, I will show you two business blocks that one has more multiple businesses than the other.

1003
01:20:58,721 --> 01:20:59,421
[SPEAKER_05]: They have nothing.

1004
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one has a kiosk right in front of their business.

1005
01:21:01,802 --> 01:21:02,982
[SPEAKER_05]: This council voted on the map.

1006
01:21:04,168 --> 01:21:06,410
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the map subject to the- The map we voted on.

1007
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, Paul.

1008
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:16,937
[SPEAKER_05]: The map subject to the gentleman- It's council, just as I respect- It was the Walker report that they're going by and what the mayor's office is telling him these are the spots to put them in.

1009
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:17,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, we voted on the map.

1010
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:19,218
[SPEAKER_08]: The map we voted on had St.

1011
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:22,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph's and it was an inaccuracy in the chief work to get it taken out.

1012
01:21:23,121 --> 01:21:24,062
[SPEAKER_08]: We voted on the map.

1013
01:21:24,122 --> 01:21:24,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't mislead me.

1014
01:21:25,062 --> 01:21:26,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not misleading anybody.

1015
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:30,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just telling you it's unfair where the kiosk and the meters are going.

1016
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:35,342
[SPEAKER_05]: There are certain parts of this city that don't have them, Chief, and you know what I'm talking about.

1017
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:38,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are other parts of the city that do have them.

1018
01:21:38,569 --> 01:21:41,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Before anyone is misled, there are no ulterior motives.

1019
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:48,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that there is, but it doesn't seem to be fair for certain business blocks to have them and other business blocks not to have them.

1020
01:21:48,652 --> 01:21:51,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, if you want to expand the program, bring a motion forward.

1021
01:21:51,472 --> 01:21:51,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Nappies.

1022
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:53,053
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of businesses.

1023
01:21:53,073 --> 01:21:55,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me ask you this, if you're so concerned.

1024
01:21:55,173 --> 01:21:58,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that works here in City Hall, why is City Hall being exempt?

1025
01:21:58,954 --> 01:21:59,614
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working here.

1026
01:21:59,634 --> 01:22:00,534
[SPEAKER_05]: The kiosks are right out here.

1027
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:01,534
[SPEAKER_05]: They should put kiosks in here?

1028
01:22:01,554 --> 01:22:02,214
[SPEAKER_05]: The kiosks are right out here.

1029
01:22:02,314 --> 01:22:02,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1030
01:22:03,175 --> 01:22:03,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1031
01:22:03,975 --> 01:22:04,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw them when I drove in.

1032
01:22:04,955 --> 01:22:07,095
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the kiosk is the parking lot behind.

1033
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:10,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Every employee here is like every employee that works for a business.

1034
01:22:10,356 --> 01:22:13,237
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have to pay, then employees at City Hall should have to pay.

1035
01:22:13,437 --> 01:22:14,697
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's going to be treated the same.

1036
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:19,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

1037
01:22:19,118 --> 01:22:20,178
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not misinformation.

1038
01:22:20,838 --> 01:22:22,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're talking from the chair again.

1039
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:22,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got one more meeting.

1040
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to talk as much as I want.

1041
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:24,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1042
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the rudest person I've ever met from that chair, you know that?

1043
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any more questions for the Chief?

1044
01:22:30,441 --> 01:22:32,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have many Councillors that want to participate.

1045
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:35,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Longo-Kern, and then the gentleman behind you.

1046
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Camuso.

1047
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:50,224
[SPEAKER_17]: While the chief's here, just to address the main concern that I think DJ from Dabbs Locks brought up, is the part-time or seasonal business passes, is that something that could be, I think that's something that we can work out.

1048
01:22:50,244 --> 01:23:00,988
[SPEAKER_14]: That was one of the reasons why, you know, as the chair of the Traffic Commission, that I did recommend that we go back to the 100, and now it gives us some time to evaluate going forward.

1049
01:23:01,355 --> 01:23:09,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm going to admit that it was my recommendation to the traffic commission that it go 200 for six months and 400 for the year.

1050
01:23:10,401 --> 01:23:18,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So based on my recommendation to them, I felt it was only right that it be my recommendation that we go back to the 100 and we will have a meeting on that.

1051
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:22,289
[SPEAKER_14]: If we don't change it to an earlier time, it'll be January 13th.

1052
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So it'll become official at that point.

1053
01:23:24,871 --> 01:23:30,415
[SPEAKER_14]: But the fact of the matter is we do realize that there are other options that we should be looking at rather than the rush to judgment

1054
01:23:30,782 --> 01:23:33,143
[SPEAKER_14]: and just blanket everyone with that higher fee.

1055
01:23:33,764 --> 01:23:41,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I would just make a recommendation to the Traffic Commission as well as the administration that the seasonal passes and the part-time passes be looked into.

1056
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:51,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's something that can be managed, whether it's an employee that just works Mondays and pays a $25 fee versus an employee who works three months out of the year and pays $35.

1057
01:23:51,853 --> 01:23:56,055
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we can create a fee structure to make it manageable and help the business community.

1058
01:23:56,795 --> 01:24:00,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree, but I also ask the business community to look

1059
01:24:00,653 --> 01:24:10,622
[SPEAKER_14]: at their employees, if they're going to be working all day and not need to go out on their vehicle for deliveries or whatever, that they find alternate parking and that they walk.

1060
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:13,544
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to be able to park right in that square.

1061
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:17,648
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to find alternate parking that's free, and they'll have to walk.

1062
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:22,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we can't cater to every single whim.

1063
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:23,873
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we can try to do the best we can.

1064
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:27,050
[SPEAKER_14]: but we need people to be cooperative as well.

1065
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:32,033
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there are other options if people are willing to, to, uh, to walk a little, a little bit.

1066
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:36,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1067
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:36,816
Yeah.

1068
01:24:37,136 --> 01:24:37,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1069
01:24:37,476 --> 01:24:38,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lunko.

1070
01:24:38,197 --> 01:24:38,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

1071
01:24:40,138 --> 01:24:41,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1072
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:43,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the chief being up here tonight.

1073
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I served on the committee with the chief and, uh, I can tell you, uh, as one member on the committee back, uh, that was appointed by the mayor back in 2000 and,

1074
01:24:53,735 --> 01:25:06,921
[SPEAKER_02]: eight is that our mission was to take a look at how other communities operate, uh, their parking enforcement and to, uh, secondly, see if parking enforcement was necessary in the community.

1075
01:25:07,461 --> 01:25:11,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And overwhelmingly, if anyone read the report that was issued back in September, 2009,

1076
01:25:13,378 --> 01:25:26,301
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue was the fact that we were doing very little parking enforcement, and our major number one issue was to provide consistent in-house parking enforcement citywide.

1077
01:25:26,641 --> 01:25:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our number one objective.

1078
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:39,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was to not outsource, but to have, as was mentioned earlier, maybe crossing guards, retired police officers, civilians go out there and do the ticketing.

1079
01:25:40,304 --> 01:25:47,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we're experiencing now, Chief, and this is really no reflection on you, is that we're looking at surrounding communities.

1080
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:48,989
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, we hear Somerville mentioned.

1081
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:54,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Somerville has had a parking program in effect for almost 30 years.

1082
01:25:54,873 --> 01:25:58,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you mentioned, they've improved upon their parking program.

1083
01:25:58,895 --> 01:26:00,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very aggressive in some of them.

1084
01:26:00,817 --> 01:26:03,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And by no means do I think method should be that way.

1085
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe we should have started off with baby steps.

1086
01:26:07,424 --> 01:26:10,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have done some consistent enforcement.

1087
01:26:10,728 --> 01:26:11,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

1088
01:26:11,689 --> 01:26:16,935
[SPEAKER_02]: A year later, say maybe we can introduce pay for parking.

1089
01:26:17,495 --> 01:26:20,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe at some point we'll look at city-wide permits.

1090
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:26,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe at some point we'll look about taking it in-house and outsourcing certain aspects of the program.

1091
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:33,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could have looked at this rather than all of a sudden go for a Cadillac approach from day one.

1092
01:26:34,037 --> 01:26:49,640
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when the program was first mentioned, there was a lot of talk by this council saying, you know what, whatever happens, there has to be a good four or five-week grace period where they give out fake tickets and residents are aware of what's going on and so forth.

1093
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:58,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I read from the administration, the ambassador program in the districts one week prior to implementation to guide consumers.

1094
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So one week prior to the middle of January, when this is supposed to start, there are going to be some ambassadors with red coats and badges, I guess, walking around our business districts, introducing people in their busy life to the kiosk and how to operate them.

1095
01:27:16,178 --> 01:27:20,621
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't find anywhere in the mayor's proposal where it says there'll be a grace period.

1096
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:26,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I speak for all my council members that that was a key issue in this community.

1097
01:27:26,946 --> 01:27:30,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, if we're going to move forward on this program, uh, I think that's vital.

1098
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:38,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, it was mentioned that, um, you know, this is new territory and it is new territory.

1099
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with some of the speakers.

1100
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_02]: because we haven't had the public input like we should have had in this community.

1101
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:49,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just talking about business owners, I'm talking about residents.

1102
01:27:49,633 --> 01:27:52,375
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been hearing from business owners the last several months.

1103
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait till the residents find out.

1104
01:27:55,557 --> 01:28:02,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait till the residents who are going to the corner store to get a newspaper find out they have to feed a kiosk and put their plate in there.

1105
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:04,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they put the wrong plate number,

1106
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't spit it out, right, Chief?

1107
01:28:07,196 --> 01:28:10,959
[SPEAKER_02]: If I plug in a wrong digit on my plate number... It's not going to know what your plate number is.

1108
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:11,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1109
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you to put the right number in.

1110
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a ticket thinking I did the right thing, and then I'm going to have to appeal the ticket.

1111
01:28:16,903 --> 01:28:20,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And just my last point, because I've talked ad nauseum on this subject.

1112
01:28:21,026 --> 01:28:25,989
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the one part of this program that you'd say, you know what?

1113
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:31,255
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want any politics involved in this because every city we went to, they said, you know what?

1114
01:28:31,695 --> 01:28:33,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep this free from city hall.

1115
01:28:33,657 --> 01:28:34,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it a standalone.

1116
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:37,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't have any involvement with city hall.

1117
01:28:37,981 --> 01:28:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We outsourced every part of this program except for the hearings.

1118
01:28:44,508 --> 01:28:48,752
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor's administrator will take care of the hearings.

1119
01:28:49,986 --> 01:28:51,487
[SPEAKER_02]: The one aspect you'd say, you know what?

1120
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want any involvement in this.

1121
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one aspect the mayor kept.

1122
01:28:55,911 --> 01:29:01,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And during budget time, we said, Mr. Mayor, you're going to go from 20 tickets a year to 2,000.

1123
01:29:01,656 --> 01:29:12,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still think that administrator who has several other roles in the city is going to be able to keep up with all the demand and increase for public hearings?

1124
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:17,950
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked that an additional part-time person be on to take care of the hearings, and the mayor denied that.

1125
01:29:19,095 --> 01:29:23,897
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor said he didn't believe that there'd be an additional increase in the need for hearings.

1126
01:29:25,058 --> 01:29:25,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's false.

1127
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:28,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be a big need.

1128
01:29:28,899 --> 01:29:30,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are going to be outraged.

1129
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:37,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, chief, even though we're going to have a picture of their plate when the car drives by, takes a picture of the plate.

1130
01:29:37,995 --> 01:29:41,878
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could be pulled over for a number of different reasons on the roadside.

1131
01:29:42,398 --> 01:29:45,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's going to increase the hearings tenfold in this community.

1132
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:58,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I don't think the city's quite ready for a full-fledged enforcement program that involves kiosks on the roads, that involves an outside company that's going to be very aggressive.

1133
01:29:59,511 --> 01:30:04,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard at the meetings that the chamber had, and I appreciate they had that, but the gentleman there was saying,

1134
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:06,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to work with the businesses.

1135
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:10,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make sure this is going to be so laid back and so easy.

1136
01:30:11,593 --> 01:30:17,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And then his henchmen, who was three feet from him, that didn't open his mouth, was counting the dollars.

1137
01:30:18,617 --> 01:30:20,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're going to be very aggressive.

1138
01:30:21,178 --> 01:30:24,440
[SPEAKER_02]: You better bet your bottom dollar, their revenue is based on what they take in.

1139
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:34,585
[SPEAKER_14]: All I can tell you, Counselor, the meetings I've attended, it's been stressed to them over and over that we don't want them hiding behind a tree and jumping out and dropping a ticket on somebody.

1140
01:30:35,353 --> 01:30:37,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think they're getting the message.

1141
01:30:37,073 --> 01:30:38,934
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to know until it actually begins.

1142
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:40,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Money talks, Chief.

1143
01:30:41,194 --> 01:30:41,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Money talks.

1144
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:51,177
[SPEAKER_02]: When they have their operation, they hire the employees, they put up that money that was fronted for the kiosk is on Republic, the employees, their health insurance.

1145
01:30:51,657 --> 01:31:01,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the cost gets established and once residents and business owners know that there's going to be ticketing out there, in my opinion, people are going to

1146
01:31:02,417 --> 01:31:03,457
[SPEAKER_02]: stay away from the areas.

1147
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:07,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And then revenue is going to go down, Chief, and it's going to be a self-fulfilling process.

1148
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:15,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be out there hiding behind barrels, looking to get money any way they can to comply with the contract.

1149
01:31:16,121 --> 01:31:17,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I disagree with you on that.

1150
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:19,802
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was in-house, we can control it.

1151
01:31:20,202 --> 01:31:20,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We could say, you know what?

1152
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: let's not do this, let's not do that.

1153
01:31:23,212 --> 01:31:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you outsource, especially in a 10 year contract, you're at their mercy, chief, you're at their mercy.

1154
01:31:29,894 --> 01:31:46,437
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem with, with in-house, and I know you realize this, the cost of benefits, the hiring of the staff, when other city entities, the police, the fire, the public works crew, they're not hiring enough bodies to maintain and to keep up with the retirements.

1155
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:52,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that that's where it came from, that that's why it did not stay in-house, that it was outsourced.

1156
01:31:53,280 --> 01:32:03,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus, this is a parking management company that's a nationwide company, a nationwide leader in the field, and it's felt that they would do the right thing.

1157
01:32:03,062 --> 01:32:10,124
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as the hearings, I don't think there's a person that could handle the hearings better than the person that's been doing them right now.

1158
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:16,965
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there's an allegation that there's going to be interference at that level, I don't see that happening.

1159
01:32:17,728 --> 01:32:19,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Will there be increased hearings?

1160
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:20,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Initially, there will be.

1161
01:32:21,171 --> 01:32:26,575
[SPEAKER_14]: But we've seen in the past, whenever enforcement really gets going, compliance rates go up.

1162
01:32:27,515 --> 01:32:32,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So after the first surge, the compliance rates will go up, and I don't think the hearings will be there.

1163
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,641
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to address the multitude of problems.

1164
01:32:35,661 --> 01:32:45,808
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the business parking in the business districts, but also the resident permit parking, the people that have to call every single day to have a non-permitted vehicle tagged.

1165
01:32:46,374 --> 01:32:49,015
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be on a regular, routine basis.

1166
01:32:49,095 --> 01:32:50,376
[SPEAKER_14]: These streets are going to get hit.

1167
01:32:50,636 --> 01:32:57,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, based on the number of calls that we've been receiving at the police station over the last couple of weeks, people are getting the message this is for real.

1168
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:06,844
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's amazing what they're asking for, for the variances and the exceptions that they're asking for, that only means that they were getting away with an awful lot for a long period of time.

1169
01:33:08,485 --> 01:33:12,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I have to say at this point, people were complaining that enforcement wasn't happening.

1170
01:33:14,808 --> 01:33:15,808
[SPEAKER_14]: We're starting a new day.

1171
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:17,029
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to happen.

1172
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:23,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's that, you know, I think the key is that it won't be overly aggressive, but there's such flagrant violations out there.

1173
01:33:23,512 --> 01:33:24,692
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to be dealt with.

1174
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:26,193
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also agree.

1175
01:33:26,253 --> 01:33:31,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to, before I forget everything that the points you brought up, the, the other issue was the, uh, the grace period.

1176
01:33:32,996 --> 01:33:42,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that they're talking about two weeks, but I also know that they mentioned that if it doesn't seem to be people aren't learning how to use the kiosk, there's some confusion that's going on.

1177
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,100
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to go beyond that.

1178
01:33:43,864 --> 01:33:54,567
[SPEAKER_14]: The permit parking, until they get the permit parking squared away for the new decals or whether it's going to be virtual, whether it's just registering your license plate, that's going to take a little while.

1179
01:33:55,487 --> 01:34:04,129
[SPEAKER_14]: In the police department, even when we had 132 officers, the month of January was pretty much a grace period every year, so people could get all of them.

1180
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that in the mayor's proposal, but if you say it's in there.

1181
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying it's a month, but I think

1182
01:34:08,979 --> 01:34:11,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I've encouraged that it's going to take more than two weeks.

1183
01:34:11,384 --> 01:34:11,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1184
01:34:11,885 --> 01:34:18,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to get back, if you look at the contract that was signed, two thirds of the revenue is derived from tickets.

1185
01:34:19,962 --> 01:34:23,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The actually paying on the meters is just a secondary thing.

1186
01:34:24,005 --> 01:34:24,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1187
01:34:24,786 --> 01:34:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a secondary thing.

1188
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:28,809
[SPEAKER_02]: The lion's share of their revenue is going to be by ticketing.

1189
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:32,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way they're going to get that lion's share of the revenue is to be aggressive.

1190
01:34:33,253 --> 01:34:36,615
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care if you go up and pay a quarter, run the store, and come back out.

1191
01:34:36,995 --> 01:34:38,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That has no bearing on them at all.

1192
01:34:39,017 --> 01:34:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the business of issuing tickets, Chief.

1193
01:34:41,879 --> 01:34:43,440
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the business of issuing tickets.

1194
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:49,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I hear someone from the company say, oh, we're not going to work with everyone, don't worry about it.

1195
01:34:49,485 --> 01:34:50,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a red flag to me.

1196
01:34:51,306 --> 01:35:00,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I don't want to say it's going to happen, but you know, because I hope it doesn't chief, but let me tell you this, this is not what we bargained for.

1197
01:35:00,633 --> 01:35:03,435
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you it won't be like some of them to that degree.

1198
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:05,157
[SPEAKER_14]: It will not be like that, like some of them.

1199
01:35:05,197 --> 01:35:08,699
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there's a violation, it's a violation of someone is in violation.

1200
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:09,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I see that.

1201
01:35:11,654 --> 01:35:25,078
[SPEAKER_14]: My thoughts are that Boston Avenue from University Avenue down to Harvard Street and College Avenue from Boston Ave back to Stanley Ave, that's where people are parking all day for free right now.

1202
01:35:25,538 --> 01:35:26,859
[SPEAKER_14]: They're there for the entire day.

1203
01:35:27,259 --> 01:35:29,820
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where the enforcement's going to take place.

1204
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:31,940
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where the violations will occur.

1205
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:36,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And obviously, that's where the city's going to gain some revenue.

1206
01:35:39,002 --> 01:35:41,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, there have been free spaces for too long.

1207
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:56,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, too, if we could just find out the money from the resident permit parking, business permit parking, and commuter resident permit parking, does that go into the general fund?

1208
01:35:57,213 --> 01:36:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does Republic get a cut on the money that's derived from that?

1209
01:36:04,755 --> 01:36:09,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's the regular business permit parking, then there's resident commuter.

1210
01:36:10,528 --> 01:36:13,289
[SPEAKER_02]: permit parking, and then there's regular permit parking.

1211
01:36:14,989 --> 01:36:19,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But that money, does Republic get a cut on whatever they bring in?

1212
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:29,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And just my last point, I had a gentleman that sent me an email just this morning, and he was trying to get a resident permit parking sticker.

1213
01:36:29,852 --> 01:36:31,013
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to the police station.

1214
01:36:31,373 --> 01:36:32,973
[SPEAKER_02]: He was told to go to City Hall.

1215
01:36:32,993 --> 01:36:34,754
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his $10 check in his hand.

1216
01:36:35,134 --> 01:36:36,394
[SPEAKER_02]: At City Hall, they

1217
01:36:37,157 --> 01:36:46,600
[SPEAKER_02]: handed him a sheet of paper with a logo that said PAC method, and it said learn more about pay by phone, and he had to go back home to pay by phone.

1218
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:49,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And there has to be better outreach, Chief.

1219
01:36:49,902 --> 01:36:54,883
[SPEAKER_02]: We use reverse 911 to notify residents when it's going to rain in this community.

1220
01:36:57,035 --> 01:36:58,416
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how often we use it, Chief.

1221
01:36:58,436 --> 01:36:59,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get bashed if we don't use it.

1222
01:37:00,016 --> 01:37:00,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what to tell you.

1223
01:37:00,997 --> 01:37:04,958
[SPEAKER_02]: But the big issues, Chief, the big issues like this, no mention at all.

1224
01:37:05,358 --> 01:37:06,779
[SPEAKER_02]: No mention at all, reverse 9-1-1.

1225
01:37:06,819 --> 01:37:07,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming.

1226
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:07,839
[SPEAKER_14]: It is coming.

1227
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:08,260
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1228
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:08,940
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming too late, Chief.

1229
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,701
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not coming this week with Christmas.

1230
01:37:10,841 --> 01:37:11,821
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming next week.

1231
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:13,182
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming next week.

1232
01:37:14,082 --> 01:37:14,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chief.

1233
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:15,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1234
01:37:15,463 --> 01:37:15,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Knight.

1235
01:37:17,944 --> 01:37:19,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1236
01:37:19,164 --> 01:37:20,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief, thank you for being here this evening.

1237
01:37:22,025 --> 01:37:25,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's safe to say that come January, this plan is going to roll out, correct?

1238
01:37:27,156 --> 01:37:32,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And moving forward, you know, I think that there are a lot of things that could have been done differently.

1239
01:37:32,498 --> 01:37:38,781
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a lot of different approaches that we could have taken to, you know, share information, to notify the public, to keep people informed.

1240
01:37:39,661 --> 01:37:44,123
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the stark reality of the matter is that this has happened, and this has happened in January.

1241
01:37:44,163 --> 01:37:45,664
[SPEAKER_13]: This has happened in just a couple of short weeks.

1242
01:37:46,175 --> 01:37:56,617
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess my question to you chief is, um, it is the control and the oversight responsibility of the traffic and parking commission to set the regulations, to set where the parking spots are, to set what the rates are, correct?

1243
01:37:56,897 --> 01:37:57,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1244
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:02,418
[SPEAKER_13]: And the parking and the traffic and parking commission tend to meet monthly.

1245
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:03,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

1246
01:38:03,159 --> 01:38:03,679
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1247
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:04,539
[SPEAKER_14]: And when do they meet you?

1248
01:38:05,419 --> 01:38:10,220
[SPEAKER_14]: The second Tuesday of every month at 2 PM at the Academy building, 90 main street.

1249
01:38:16,853 --> 01:38:24,938
[SPEAKER_13]: And Chief, at these Traffic and Parking Commission meetings recently, I've seen the minutes and I've seen a lot of mention about this program and the rollout of this program.

1250
01:38:25,879 --> 01:38:30,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving forward, do you anticipate any changes based upon what we've heard here today?

1251
01:38:30,081 --> 01:38:38,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the business community has been outspoken in terms of what their wants, needs, and desires are, and it seems like the commission's responded somewhat.

1252
01:38:40,688 --> 01:38:44,710
[SPEAKER_13]: As Councilor Mark said, when this rolls out, the residents are going to have a whole new set of concerns.

1253
01:38:45,758 --> 01:38:50,462
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, my question to you, I guess, would be, is once a month enough during the rollout?

1254
01:38:50,802 --> 01:38:59,207
[SPEAKER_13]: And what can we do to improve the dialogue between the administration, the council, and the Traffic and Parking Commission going forward to address residents' concerns as they arise?

1255
01:38:59,608 --> 01:39:03,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, as it happens right now, Alva Erickson's my administrative assistant.

1256
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:06,292
[SPEAKER_14]: She is the secretary to the Traffic Commission.

1257
01:39:06,332 --> 01:39:07,253
[SPEAKER_14]: She feels calls.

1258
01:39:07,313 --> 01:39:13,457
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would say probably 90% of the calls that she's been getting and has been getting over a longer period of time

1259
01:39:13,965 --> 01:39:16,666
[SPEAKER_14]: a traffic and parking related, which are traffic commission issues.

1260
01:39:17,366 --> 01:39:23,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hate to give them more work, but that's where the first phone call needs to go to.

1261
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:30,130
[SPEAKER_14]: If there are issues, if there were concerns that maybe we just, we just didn't see and they can bring it to her attention.

1262
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:33,391
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get it on the agenda and she'll tell them what the mechanism is.

1263
01:39:33,431 --> 01:39:37,292
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's a petition that's required and we'll get it on the traffic commission agenda.

1264
01:39:38,073 --> 01:39:44,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I think monthly will be okay, but we'll certainly adjust that if we see that there's substantial issues that need to be addressed going forward.

1265
01:39:45,019 --> 01:39:49,523
[SPEAKER_14]: And we plan to have regular contact with Republic Parking, the Park Medford office.

1266
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:55,088
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have the traffic officers checking with them probably on a daily basis, and I expect them to check with us.

1267
01:39:56,616 --> 01:40:12,984
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not familiar with all the variances and the exemptions that we've granted over the years for people on permanent parking streets that corner homes that are able to get the permit for the side street beside their house, or people that have no parking and we allow them a permit for a side street that is a permanent parking street.

1268
01:40:13,024 --> 01:40:19,707
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot that this company has to take on that they're not totally familiar with.

1269
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:22,048
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I've been saying it right along,

1270
01:40:22,573 --> 01:40:26,674
[SPEAKER_14]: We have great hopes that this parking management company will do a great job for us.

1271
01:40:28,094 --> 01:40:29,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But we can't pin all our hopes on it.

1272
01:40:29,855 --> 01:40:31,475
[SPEAKER_14]: There are going to be bumps in the road.

1273
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:33,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're just going to have to address them as we go along.

1274
01:40:35,136 --> 01:40:37,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see anything being tragic about it.

1275
01:40:37,077 --> 01:40:39,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can turn around and rectify it.

1276
01:40:39,077 --> 01:40:43,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of it may be just a phone call and take care of a problem.

1277
01:40:43,358 --> 01:40:46,559
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't require a commission meeting to take a vote on something.

1278
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,599
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's a common sense thing, we'll correct it.

1279
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:49,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1280
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:50,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Chief.

1281
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:50,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

1282
01:40:54,143 --> 01:40:55,063
[SPEAKER_08]: We have three motions.

1283
01:40:55,984 --> 01:40:59,725
[SPEAKER_08]: First one is vice president care of yellow counselor.

1284
01:40:59,745 --> 01:41:00,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Pet chief.

1285
01:41:01,326 --> 01:41:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, two things.

1286
01:41:05,427 --> 01:41:09,869
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys went from 100 to 400 and then you had a telephone call to reduce it down to one.

1287
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:12,230
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I did not have a telephone call to reduce it down.

1288
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:18,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I had discussions with, with individuals from the business community, receive several emails from the traffic commission.

1289
01:41:18,212 --> 01:41:19,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about how did you get to 100?

1290
01:41:21,328 --> 01:41:22,269
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd you go from 400 to 100?

1291
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:24,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what it is today.

1292
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got that with a phone call.

1293
01:41:26,511 --> 01:41:29,333
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no public meeting, so there was no traffic commission meeting.

1294
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:33,856
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but I don't need a traffic commission meeting to talk to someone in the business community that has a concern.

1295
01:41:33,876 --> 01:41:34,396
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I understand that.

1296
01:41:34,416 --> 01:41:34,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

1297
01:41:34,796 --> 01:41:35,477
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where it came from.

1298
01:41:35,497 --> 01:41:37,258
[SPEAKER_05]: But to make a change like that.

1299
01:41:37,398 --> 01:41:38,738
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an official change yet.

1300
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:39,359
[SPEAKER_14]: OK?

1301
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:40,480
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an official change.

1302
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:41,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question to you is this.

1303
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:46,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you want to make the change when

1304
01:41:47,238 --> 01:41:49,280
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can look at this and say, OK, it's $400.

1305
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:50,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's a little excessive.

1306
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:52,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can make it three or two.

1307
01:41:53,223 --> 01:42:03,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're going to make the change for the business person, why can't you just allow all their people to work for them, give them stickers, and just let them come under that one fee?

1308
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:09,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Because today, if they were to get it under the existing system, every one of their employees would have to have a business permit.

1309
01:42:09,595 --> 01:42:10,195
[SPEAKER_14]: They would have to pay $100.

1310
01:42:11,994 --> 01:42:14,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to change what's in place.

1311
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:15,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just trying to keep it the same for the first year.

1312
01:42:16,015 --> 01:42:25,037
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm saying, if you get the $100, say you were going to charge the $400, and all the employees that work for that particular company, they have a sticker that gives them the privilege.

1313
01:42:25,758 --> 01:42:28,518
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saying $400, and if they have 20 employees, they're all?

1314
01:42:28,538 --> 01:42:30,599
[SPEAKER_05]: They have one employee, they have 10 employees, or whatever it might be.

1315
01:42:30,779 --> 01:42:31,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a motion?

1316
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:31,759
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1317
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:33,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking him a question.

1318
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:34,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just confused.

1319
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if you wanted to raise it to $400.

1320
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I simply stated in return just the fact that

1321
01:42:39,969 --> 01:42:46,934
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just easier to maintain what's in place today than to recreate or recalibrate what's already been passed.

1322
01:42:47,415 --> 01:42:56,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So then how are we going to justify, if you're going to do that, going from $400 down to $100, so all these outer towners that are coming here, they're going to still be able to pay $100 a year?

1323
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:56,481
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1324
01:42:56,722 --> 01:42:58,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what are they going to pay?

1325
01:42:58,783 --> 01:43:02,606
[SPEAKER_14]: No, if they come, if they park in the commuter parking areas, they're paying $5 a day.

1326
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:04,187
[SPEAKER_14]: If they work 20 days a month, that's $100 a month.

1327
01:43:04,207 --> 01:43:04,708
[SPEAKER_14]: 12 months a year, that's $1,200.

1328
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:12,645
[SPEAKER_14]: All the people that park in the residential commuter permit will be the $100.

1329
01:43:12,985 --> 01:43:21,434
[SPEAKER_14]: So the resident, based on all of the information that we've received over the years, the residents of the city want to have first dibs on those parking spaces on Playstead.

1330
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:28,240
[SPEAKER_14]: The only way we could do that is to create the residential permit parking, commuter parking pass.

1331
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:31,884
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was going to be the same rate as the business permit.

1332
01:43:31,964 --> 01:43:33,025
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a Metro resident.

1333
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:43,374
[SPEAKER_14]: The most they would be paying in any calendar year would have been $400, whereas the person that's from out of town that may occupy that same space is paying $5 for the full day.

1334
01:43:44,114 --> 01:43:48,937
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're there every single day that they work, if they work 20 days out of the month, that's $100 for the month.

1335
01:43:48,957 --> 01:43:52,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But you just got through saying you have out-of-towners, you have residential people, and you have business people.

1336
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So how many out-of-towners do we have parking?

1337
01:43:55,301 --> 01:43:56,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea.

1338
01:43:56,281 --> 01:44:04,486
[SPEAKER_14]: There's 50-some-odd spaces there, and I would say the bulk of them are out-of-town because they were all there between probably 6 in the morning and 8 in the morning, and those spaces are filled.

1339
01:44:04,586 --> 01:44:07,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they're out-of-towners, can't they be charged more for being out-of-towners?

1340
01:44:07,348 --> 01:44:09,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they're paying $5 a day.

1341
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:09,569
[SPEAKER_05]: $5 a day.

1342
01:44:09,589 --> 01:44:10,409
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a bargain.

1343
01:44:10,629 --> 01:44:11,490
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not getting a permit.

1344
01:44:11,729 --> 01:44:12,910
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bargain, $5 a day.

1345
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:13,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't they be charged?

1346
01:44:13,751 --> 01:44:15,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, again, we have to start someplace.

1347
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:17,173
[SPEAKER_14]: It will grow.

1348
01:44:17,273 --> 01:44:18,114
[SPEAKER_14]: It will expand.

1349
01:44:18,174 --> 01:44:19,735
[SPEAKER_14]: We try to keep it within reason.

1350
01:44:20,116 --> 01:44:21,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but we discussed this before.

1351
01:44:21,857 --> 01:44:25,720
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the first time that this has been discussed on the Council of Outer Towners coming in.

1352
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:37,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're telling me that I can park at the end of Placeton Road for $5 a day as compared to downtown West Medford or downtown Medford Square, and every 15 minutes I've got to put a quarter in there, I'm going to get a ticket.

1353
01:44:39,275 --> 01:44:40,876
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the kiosks are there for.

1354
01:44:40,896 --> 01:44:42,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, if you're packing in the square.

1355
01:44:42,677 --> 01:44:52,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll go hustle down the street and get the bus that takes me directly to Boston from West Medford, or from Medford Square, or Governors Avenue, $100.

1356
01:44:52,201 --> 01:44:53,522
[SPEAKER_05]: What have we accomplished?

1357
01:44:53,702 --> 01:45:01,326
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's the only place that there's commuter parking, except for the little spot over here at the end of the Hyatt lot by 101 George B. Hassett.

1358
01:45:01,766 --> 01:45:03,187
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a commuter area as well.

1359
01:45:04,078 --> 01:45:06,039
[SPEAKER_14]: For Placestead Road, it's the only other commuter area.

1360
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:09,460
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't park and be a commuter or any place else and receive a commuter pass.

1361
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,100
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to pay $5.

1362
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:13,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tufts University would be the only other place.

1363
01:45:13,321 --> 01:45:14,261
[SPEAKER_14]: College Avenue, Boston Avenue.

1364
01:45:14,281 --> 01:45:15,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But what about up and down Governor's Avenue?

1365
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:16,321
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1366
01:45:16,341 --> 01:45:18,202
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no meters on Governor's Avenue.

1367
01:45:18,222 --> 01:45:19,022
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no kiosks.

1368
01:45:19,082 --> 01:45:20,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there going to be signs there?

1369
01:45:20,122 --> 01:45:21,043
[SPEAKER_14]: There are signs today.

1370
01:45:21,103 --> 01:45:22,283
[SPEAKER_14]: There are signs up there today.

1371
01:45:22,303 --> 01:45:23,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Two hours.

1372
01:45:23,123 --> 01:45:23,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been there for years.

1373
01:45:24,364 --> 01:45:25,484
[SPEAKER_05]: But where's the enforcement?

1374
01:45:26,684 --> 01:45:27,144
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming.

1375
01:45:27,785 --> 01:45:30,125
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the parking lot in Medford Square next to the electric company?

1376
01:45:30,725 --> 01:45:32,586
[SPEAKER_14]: That's business permit or two hours.

1377
01:45:34,929 --> 01:45:36,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief, you got all the answers tonight.

1378
01:45:36,853 --> 01:45:38,435
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm impressed.

1379
01:45:38,495 --> 01:45:40,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been living with this thing for a while.

1380
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:42,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't have all the answers earlier.

1381
01:45:42,062 --> 01:45:42,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to do some homework.

1382
01:45:43,845 --> 01:45:44,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just end.

1383
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:45,789
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the only part that I don't understand.

1384
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:51,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You started in a direction, and now you're just going back and starting from scratch.

1385
01:45:52,665 --> 01:45:56,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the whole idea was to be a revenue enforcement, number one.

1386
01:45:56,729 --> 01:45:58,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's parking management.

1387
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:00,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking at it from parking management.

1388
01:46:00,272 --> 01:46:00,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Turnover of parking.

1389
01:46:00,772 --> 01:46:01,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you want to call it.

1390
01:46:01,673 --> 01:46:02,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Turnover of parking.

1391
01:46:02,494 --> 01:46:03,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you want.

1392
01:46:03,134 --> 01:46:04,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Turnover of the parking spaces, OK?

1393
01:46:05,056 --> 01:46:13,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard anybody from the chamber, anybody, talk about that parking lot on Route 16 being a viable spot for all business people and all employees to park over there.

1394
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:17,041
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what I said earlier about people looking for alternate locations.

1395
01:46:17,101 --> 01:46:19,662
[SPEAKER_14]: They're out there if people are willing to take the effort.

1396
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:24,644
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a business in High Street and Medford Square, you should not be parked in front of your business.

1397
01:46:24,924 --> 01:46:26,645
[SPEAKER_14]: You're taking away a customer's spot.

1398
01:46:27,726 --> 01:46:33,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to embarrass my colleague, but when we had this conversation a while ago regarding a parking garage, remember?

1399
01:46:33,408 --> 01:46:33,968
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you say?

1400
01:46:34,028 --> 01:46:34,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm lazy.

1401
01:46:34,408 --> 01:46:35,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to park right out in front.

1402
01:46:36,827 --> 01:46:38,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way there, I don't want to walk.

1403
01:46:38,648 --> 01:46:40,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know something, you can't have it both ways.

1404
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:49,136
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a business owner and you have employees and you know you have a spot that you can go to and it's a little bit of a walk, at least for this part of the square, that's number one.

1405
01:46:49,576 --> 01:46:51,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, all the other squares are different.

1406
01:46:51,618 --> 01:46:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have that same unique opportunity to have that huge parking lot all day long to park as an owner and employee.

1407
01:46:58,123 --> 01:47:00,845
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also have to say, I mean, we've looked at these different areas.

1408
01:47:00,945 --> 01:47:04,968
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you, I know because West Medford is here, I think

1409
01:47:06,233 --> 01:47:13,155
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, all of the folks involved in this parking management piece have tried to bend over backwards to accommodate the business employee.

1410
01:47:13,495 --> 01:47:18,777
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually created spaces that didn't exist for business permits.

1411
01:47:19,197 --> 01:47:27,040
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a section of High Street between, I want to say maybe Hammond Place and Brooks Street that was going to be

1412
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:30,734
[SPEAKER_14]: marked either one hour or two hour and business permit.

1413
01:47:31,275 --> 01:47:36,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are spaces that are not too far removed from the center of the square, and employees could park there.

1414
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:41,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, along, place that road along the park after 10 a.m., it's wide open.

1415
01:47:43,145 --> 01:47:45,346
[SPEAKER_14]: After 10 a.m., there's no parking there between 6 a.m.

1416
01:47:45,386 --> 01:47:45,887
[SPEAKER_14]: and 10 a.m.

1417
01:47:45,907 --> 01:47:50,871
[SPEAKER_14]: in the morning to eliminate the commuters that would park all the way along the park up to Century Street Extension.

1418
01:47:51,812 --> 01:47:54,153
[SPEAKER_14]: But after 10 a.m., any employee can park there all day.

1419
01:47:54,374 --> 01:47:55,855
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a short walk to the square.

1420
01:47:56,406 --> 01:48:02,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But who makes the determination what section and location of businesses in the city are going to be having a kiosk or a sign?

1421
01:48:02,829 --> 01:48:03,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Who makes that determination?

1422
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,011
[SPEAKER_14]: That was based on the report.

1423
01:48:05,111 --> 01:48:06,291
[SPEAKER_14]: That was based on the Walker report.

1424
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:07,552
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also business spaces.

1425
01:48:07,572 --> 01:48:14,416
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll say for one person, I was against the idea of putting business permit spaces in the parking lot behind the stores in West Medford square.

1426
01:48:14,456 --> 01:48:18,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that that's those spaces, you know, we're looking to, to,

1427
01:48:19,622 --> 01:48:25,624
[SPEAKER_14]: make the businesses solvent and let them make money, but they wanted to have business spaces in that lot.

1428
01:48:26,164 --> 01:48:29,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how many spaces are in that lot, but there are not a lot.

1429
01:48:29,805 --> 01:48:35,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you give 10 spaces to business employees, but that was the decision and that's what we'll run with.

1430
01:48:35,806 --> 01:48:36,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But who made that decision?

1431
01:48:36,907 --> 01:48:39,507
[SPEAKER_14]: But that was, because I guess it exists today.

1432
01:48:40,067 --> 01:48:41,988
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it exists today, they didn't want to change it.

1433
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:47,754
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have to say, we've tried to accommodate all the different issues.

1434
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:50,857
[SPEAKER_14]: South Medford has the Yale Street parking lot.

1435
01:48:51,317 --> 01:48:52,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I've spoken with some business owners there.

1436
01:48:52,939 --> 01:48:57,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Their employees can get a permit, can park in the Yale Street parking lot.

1437
01:48:57,824 --> 01:49:03,530
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have other establishments from Main Street all the way almost back to Medford Square that are businesses that have nothing.

1438
01:49:04,017 --> 01:49:06,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but we also have the same thing on Salem Street.

1439
01:49:06,379 --> 01:49:08,421
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have the same thing on the further end of High Street.

1440
01:49:08,441 --> 01:49:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but how do you do it if it's a business person, Chief?

1441
01:49:10,283 --> 01:49:11,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you have to start somewhere.

1442
01:49:12,044 --> 01:49:20,331
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a business person, and I have the same type of a business as you, and one part of the city is competing, and I don't have nothing in front of me, and you do, I'm not going to sit there.

1443
01:49:20,351 --> 01:49:21,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to sit there.

1444
01:49:21,753 --> 01:49:26,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what, eventually it can grow if we see that there's enough need for this.

1445
01:49:27,011 --> 01:49:34,581
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we've had some things that were on the map on locations and we took them away and we said, look, you can't put them right there if you're not going to do the next block up.

1446
01:49:37,305 --> 01:49:44,935
[SPEAKER_14]: But based on what's there, all of the areas that have been covered with either a meter or a kiosk have been pretty much confined business districts.

1447
01:49:46,488 --> 01:49:57,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Not, not the outlying, you know, one or two stores and we're not throwing a meter in front of the barbershop and the, and the convenience store because they were, they were set alone from the rest of the business area.

1448
01:49:57,972 --> 01:50:11,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking with the two gentlemen and I'll conclude on particular issues that they brought up, they were told this is where you go from city hall and these are the places cause they've heard it from other locations, from other folks.

1449
01:50:11,716 --> 01:50:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't they having it?

1450
01:50:12,956 --> 01:50:14,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're being told what to do from city hall.

1451
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:16,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not fair.

1452
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's being told what to do from city hall?

1453
01:50:19,401 --> 01:50:22,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Republic, where to put the signs, where to put the meters.

1454
01:50:22,762 --> 01:50:23,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1455
01:50:23,402 --> 01:50:26,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was, everything was based off of the original plan.

1456
01:50:26,963 --> 01:50:29,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about the Walker report.

1457
01:50:29,624 --> 01:50:32,865
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about the Walker report as they've gone around and they've heard all these complaints.

1458
01:50:32,905 --> 01:50:41,307
[SPEAKER_14]: And I walked the square with Mr. Nash, every one of the business districts, the Hillside and South Medford, Haines Square, Medford Square and West Medford Square.

1459
01:50:42,395 --> 01:50:44,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And they already had the map plotted out where they wanted to make corrections.

1460
01:50:44,997 --> 01:50:46,058
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not talking about the map.

1461
01:50:46,078 --> 01:50:49,261
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole idea was to listen to the business people for which they're listening to.

1462
01:50:49,801 --> 01:50:57,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they bring up corollaries or comparisons, they want to know how come in one part of the city someone has another part of the city and another one doesn't have it.

1463
01:50:58,809 --> 01:50:59,229
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

1464
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:03,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I would suggest you make a motion and bring it forward if you think there should be additional meetings.

1465
01:51:03,833 --> 01:51:07,016
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that the chief and the traffic, what do they call yourself now?

1466
01:51:07,056 --> 01:51:07,737
[SPEAKER_05]: The traffic committee?

1467
01:51:07,817 --> 01:51:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Commission?

1468
01:51:08,177 --> 01:51:09,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a traffic commission.

1469
01:51:09,418 --> 01:51:10,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Commission is still the same name.

1470
01:51:10,806 --> 01:51:17,349
[SPEAKER_05]: They should entertain any complaint, or any concern, not a complaint, any concern that a business person has as a, you know, if the whole thing- One information, Mr. President.

1471
01:51:17,669 --> 01:51:19,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, have you- One information, Councilor Knight.

1472
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:25,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you received any complaints or any concerns about locations and one business having one and one business not?

1473
01:51:25,112 --> 01:51:34,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any- No, I've heard some things- A question about disparities and- No, I haven't heard so much of the disparities as, you know, placement of the kiosk concern that it was right at their front door and-

1474
01:51:34,516 --> 01:51:36,897
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, slight movement out of the way might have been.

1475
01:51:37,077 --> 01:51:45,698
[SPEAKER_13]: But in terms of Joe pizza versus Espresso's pizza versus Amici's pizza, have you heard any concern about a business owner being very concerned about being treated differently or unfairly?

1476
01:51:45,878 --> 01:51:46,538
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I have not.

1477
01:51:46,759 --> 01:51:46,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1478
01:51:47,019 --> 01:51:50,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1479
01:51:50,379 --> 01:51:50,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

1480
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:52,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't heard it.

1481
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification.

1482
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification.

1483
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:04,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I was speaking to the chief in terms of as the chair of the pocket commission who has the oversight authority of the plan, who would be the official receptacle for any complaints.

1484
01:52:05,811 --> 01:52:06,731
[SPEAKER_13]: as the chair of the committee.

1485
01:52:07,771 --> 01:52:08,272
[SPEAKER_13]: So the chair.

1486
01:52:10,132 --> 01:52:10,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1487
01:52:11,532 --> 01:52:12,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, chief.

1488
01:52:13,233 --> 01:52:13,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1489
01:52:13,473 --> 01:52:14,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Gentleman behind you.

1490
01:52:17,694 --> 01:52:18,834
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, Anthony D'Antonio.

1491
01:52:18,874 --> 01:52:19,934
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to make it brief.

1492
01:52:19,994 --> 01:52:23,315
[SPEAKER_23]: I got an octopus and buccalus soaking in water, and all.

1493
01:52:23,335 --> 01:52:24,075
[SPEAKER_23]: I got to change the water.

1494
01:52:24,155 --> 01:52:25,536
[SPEAKER_23]: When's that going to be coming over tomorrow?

1495
01:52:25,556 --> 01:52:29,657
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen, seriously, this parking thing is wrong from day one.

1496
01:52:30,597 --> 01:52:32,397
[SPEAKER_23]: Counselor Knight, you made a very interesting statement.

1497
01:52:32,437 --> 01:52:34,018
[SPEAKER_23]: You said you had it in your hands.

1498
01:52:34,038 --> 01:52:35,498
[SPEAKER_23]: We're discussing this thing.

1499
01:52:36,089 --> 01:52:37,891
[SPEAKER_23]: We could have made the change if we could have done this and that.

1500
01:52:38,271 --> 01:52:38,711
[SPEAKER_23]: What happened?

1501
01:52:38,751 --> 01:52:39,272
[SPEAKER_23]: Nothing happened.

1502
01:52:41,194 --> 01:52:49,401
[SPEAKER_23]: We could have gone to Chevalier or the McGlynn School or something that had a huge citywide meeting like they did for the Green Line and have the questions answered.

1503
01:52:50,302 --> 01:52:52,744
[SPEAKER_23]: This is too quick for too much.

1504
01:52:53,745 --> 01:53:00,631
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the repercussions from this are going to be grand and I'm still against

1505
01:53:01,367 --> 01:53:03,668
[SPEAKER_23]: citizens in Medford having to pay for parking permit.

1506
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:04,408
[SPEAKER_23]: We pay taxes.

1507
01:53:04,448 --> 01:53:07,449
[SPEAKER_23]: We pay an excise tax that should have been talked about many, many years ago.

1508
01:53:08,589 --> 01:53:10,809
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's on our backs to pay an excise tax.

1509
01:53:11,129 --> 01:53:15,311
[SPEAKER_23]: If you pay an excise tax, we should get a sticker that says you're a Medford resident.

1510
01:53:15,331 --> 01:53:16,911
[SPEAKER_23]: It gives you the ability to park anywhere.

1511
01:53:16,931 --> 01:53:20,692
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't even know if charging citizens to park in their own streets is legal.

1512
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:21,452
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1513
01:53:21,532 --> 01:53:21,772
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it?

1514
01:53:22,052 --> 01:53:22,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Does anybody know that?

1515
01:53:23,453 --> 01:53:24,653
[SPEAKER_23]: But this whole thing,

1516
01:53:26,163 --> 01:53:37,209
[SPEAKER_23]: As far as your question with them about did they have any discussion of preferences about if they had a parking area there, I think the citizens and the business owners of Medford show a lot of respect, especially to Chief Sacco.

1517
01:53:37,549 --> 01:53:40,050
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're not going to embarrass him in front of this person.

1518
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:44,052
[SPEAKER_23]: But the thing you have to understand is Republic is a public company.

1519
01:53:44,898 --> 01:53:49,581
[SPEAKER_23]: They sit in that boardroom and they see those numbers, just like when Staple says, okay, close that store, close this store.

1520
01:53:50,041 --> 01:53:55,445
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to say, hey, start kicking the numbers up and you're going to see stuff, stuff happen.

1521
01:53:55,525 --> 01:53:56,326
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, this is wrong.

1522
01:53:56,546 --> 01:53:57,166
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just wrong.

1523
01:53:58,127 --> 01:54:03,030
[SPEAKER_23]: Store owners, a group of guys got together and they resolved this whole thing.

1524
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:03,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Very simple.

1525
01:54:05,152 --> 01:54:13,317
[SPEAKER_23]: And to put it down in a little more micro, um, causal that the problem we have in the city of Medford,

1526
01:54:14,237 --> 01:54:16,100
[SPEAKER_23]: with the parking is actually enforcement.

1527
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:17,261
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not the chief's fault.

1528
01:54:17,642 --> 01:54:23,190
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the fact that most of the money goes to the school department and we can't put 20 police officers that we need in the street.

1529
01:54:24,155 --> 01:54:27,037
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to have police officers on the street.

1530
01:54:27,237 --> 01:54:29,238
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to have the right amount of people in the fire department.

1531
01:54:29,759 --> 01:54:33,221
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very important, especially in today's time with what's going on.

1532
01:54:33,802 --> 01:54:37,944
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have to find a way to cut here and put here.

1533
01:54:38,465 --> 01:54:46,610
[SPEAKER_23]: And then this problem may start to go away without bringing in a private enterprise that's going to show you what a private enterprise is all about.

1534
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:53,935
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just think it's so hard for the business owners now to try to keep their heads afloat, their heads above water.

1535
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:55,590
[SPEAKER_23]: And now this is a detriment.

1536
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:57,811
[SPEAKER_23]: This is like being punished to go and shop.

1537
01:54:58,411 --> 01:55:04,352
[SPEAKER_23]: So anyway, next time around, you know, let's have a, let's do this right the next time.

1538
01:55:04,612 --> 01:55:04,972
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1539
01:55:05,292 --> 01:55:05,632
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1540
01:55:09,873 --> 01:55:10,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1541
01:55:10,433 --> 01:55:11,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address.

1542
01:55:11,433 --> 01:55:11,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1543
01:55:12,753 --> 01:55:15,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford.

1544
01:55:15,734 --> 01:55:17,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Merry Christmas city council.

1545
01:55:17,754 --> 01:55:23,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went through a 10 year contract with a company and so the mayor wants another 10 year contract.

1546
01:55:24,002 --> 01:55:26,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet with the new access station, he's going to ask for three.

1547
01:55:28,365 --> 01:55:30,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't we learned the error of Medford's ways?

1548
01:55:31,087 --> 01:55:32,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's much too risky.

1549
01:55:33,569 --> 01:55:39,753
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor is being inconsistent when he gives a 10-year contract out, but the previous 10-year contract he did failed.

1550
01:55:41,414 --> 01:55:43,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's republic access to the roadways.

1551
01:55:43,576 --> 01:55:45,197
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is, republic access.

1552
01:55:45,237 --> 01:55:46,258
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to take your pictures.

1553
01:55:46,998 --> 01:55:50,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no TV station even discuss this, so no one in the community knows.

1554
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:54,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Reverse 9-1-1, as Councilor Mark cited.

1555
01:55:55,496 --> 01:56:00,003
[SPEAKER_06]: My point here tonight is parking meters versus parking enforcement.

1556
01:56:01,827 --> 01:56:04,151
[SPEAKER_06]: The Council President mentioned an area near my home.

1557
01:56:05,322 --> 01:56:07,583
[SPEAKER_06]: where vehicles park in the bus stop all the time.

1558
01:56:08,103 --> 01:56:08,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're in the crosswalk.

1559
01:56:09,024 --> 01:56:14,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, Chief Sacco, tonight I nearly got run over again, but I can't even bother you with it, because it's a daily occurrence.

1560
01:56:15,487 --> 01:56:17,148
[SPEAKER_06]: They speed on Salem Street.

1561
01:56:17,908 --> 01:56:23,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 20-mile-an-hour zone right after Nappy's, 20-mile-an-hour zone, but they think it's a raceway to Revere.

1562
01:56:24,171 --> 01:56:25,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the raceway.

1563
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:27,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And I live there, Councilor Del Russo.

1564
01:56:27,793 --> 01:56:29,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in my computers right near the window.

1565
01:56:29,334 --> 01:56:31,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen car crash after car crash.

1566
01:56:31,895 --> 01:56:33,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I have videotape right on my phone.

1567
01:56:34,542 --> 01:56:37,685
[SPEAKER_06]: of the fire department there, God bless them, at two in the morning, they did an amazing job.

1568
01:56:38,005 --> 01:56:42,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Two car crashes in front of the dance studio, a year apart, hitting that same tree.

1569
01:56:42,569 --> 01:56:43,390
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless that tree.

1570
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:44,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It saved the dance studio.

1571
01:56:44,471 --> 01:56:45,972
[SPEAKER_06]: The woman sent me a note.

1572
01:56:46,652 --> 01:56:51,757
[SPEAKER_06]: She only saw a tire mark in front of the store.

1573
01:56:51,777 --> 01:56:52,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So my point is this.

1574
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:57,802
[SPEAKER_06]: The kiosks can't stop the cars from all the bus stops all around Medford.

1575
01:56:59,072 --> 01:57:07,197
[SPEAKER_06]: We need people to do that, and why can't we hire local people, pay local people, instead of sending our money south to Nashville?

1576
01:57:07,878 --> 01:57:11,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes no sense to me, and I know that there's some on the council that agree with that.

1577
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:28,411
[SPEAKER_06]: We're sending our money south, we should be hiring people, we should tear up the contract, and you know, I read an article in the paper by a councilor, it said something about business owners considering litigation, I think, an injunction against the mayor, two things, and I'll leave right now.

1578
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:35,988
[SPEAKER_06]: an injunction against the mayor to stop it, or let it happen and let's vote the mayor out finally.

1579
01:57:36,348 --> 01:57:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: This is his Waterloo.

1580
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:40,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Napoleon is here at Waterloo.

1581
01:57:40,111 --> 01:57:41,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor McGlynn, goodbye.

1582
01:57:41,952 --> 01:57:44,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph, Merry Christmas.

1583
01:57:44,594 --> 01:57:45,375
[SPEAKER_06]: To you too, Paul.

1584
01:57:50,379 --> 01:57:51,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record.

1585
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:53,522
[SPEAKER_04]: John Sproul, 20 Metcalf Street, Miffin.

1586
01:57:54,783 --> 01:57:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, this parking program will not be a success

1587
01:58:00,062 --> 01:58:12,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to appear pessimistic, but the fact is that this city council should never, never have given the mayor the right to make a 10-year contract.

1588
01:58:13,046 --> 01:58:15,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you were thinking when you did that.

1589
01:58:16,828 --> 01:58:17,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification.

1590
01:58:17,828 --> 01:58:19,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification.

1591
01:58:19,348 --> 01:58:21,089
[SPEAKER_05]: John, the council never voted for that.

1592
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:29,832
[SPEAKER_05]: The council only voted for the mayor to negotiate up to 10 years and then come back to the council for a final vote in comparison to

1593
01:58:30,406 --> 01:58:31,627
[SPEAKER_05]: if the city was going to do it.

1594
01:58:32,428 --> 01:58:37,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what you're saying is that his signing a 10-year contract is illegal.

1595
01:58:38,733 --> 01:58:41,516
[SPEAKER_04]: He did not get this, according to you, Councilor Pena.

1596
01:58:42,257 --> 01:58:45,960
[SPEAKER_04]: He did not get the council's permission to do that, yet he went ahead and did it.

1597
01:58:46,535 --> 01:58:47,896
[SPEAKER_04]: He got the permission.

1598
01:58:48,216 --> 01:58:50,437
[SPEAKER_08]: John, the records will indicate the city solicitor's here.

1599
01:58:51,237 --> 01:58:56,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Council voted 7-0 to give the mayor the signatory authority to move forward with a 10-year contract.

1600
01:58:56,179 --> 01:58:57,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not true.

1601
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:58,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what the council voted for.

1602
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:58,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Solicitor.

1603
01:58:59,040 --> 01:58:59,700
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not true.

1604
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:00,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Solicitor.

1605
01:59:00,741 --> 01:59:01,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not true.

1606
01:59:02,962 --> 01:59:06,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1607
01:59:06,683 --> 01:59:08,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Rumley, I'm city solicitor.

1608
01:59:08,204 --> 01:59:10,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

1609
01:59:11,525 --> 01:59:12,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Council resolution 14-472,

1610
01:59:16,282 --> 01:59:26,950
[SPEAKER_03]: act enacted on May 20th, 2014 says it is the intention of the city to enter into a 10 year agreement with a successful proposal.

1611
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: General laws chapter 30 B section 12 requires city council approval for a contract that exceed three years.

1612
01:59:36,416 --> 01:59:42,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body pursuant to the provisions of chapter 30 B section 12

1613
01:59:43,973 --> 01:59:53,081
[SPEAKER_03]: approve and authorize the city of Medford to enter into an agreement with a successful proposal for a term of up to 10 years.

1614
01:59:53,221 --> 01:59:54,462
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the vote on that counselor?

1615
01:59:54,602 --> 01:59:56,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven zero of this.

1616
01:59:56,263 --> 01:59:57,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that sit behind this rail.

1617
01:59:57,984 --> 01:59:58,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1618
01:59:58,265 --> 01:59:58,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Of this council.

1619
01:59:59,065 --> 02:00:00,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the clarification.

1620
02:00:00,467 --> 02:00:01,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone want to give facts now?

1621
02:00:02,468 --> 02:00:06,992
[SPEAKER_08]: John point of further.

1622
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:09,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's not the intent.

1623
02:00:09,214 --> 02:00:10,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the intent of the council.

1624
02:00:10,655 --> 02:00:12,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the official minutes of the meeting?

1625
02:00:13,124 --> 02:00:15,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not no that was the resolution that was the mayor's document.

1626
02:00:15,886 --> 02:00:26,137
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the mayor's resolution was not amended It was most certainly was council cover yellow when I asked you the question Was it not your opinion that the final vote was have to come before the council?

1627
02:00:30,567 --> 02:00:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1628
02:00:31,188 --> 02:00:36,293
[SPEAKER_03]: What was said was that you would see a draft of the contract before it was signed and that was done.

1629
02:00:36,734 --> 02:00:42,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I reminded you that night that that promise was fulfilled because I'm the one that made that promise to you.

1630
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:44,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for following through on that solicitor.

1631
02:00:44,843 --> 02:00:46,405
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the amendment is right here.

1632
02:00:46,425 --> 02:00:47,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The amendment is by myself.

1633
02:00:47,566 --> 02:00:49,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amended by myself that the mayor and

1634
02:00:49,568 --> 02:00:55,271
[SPEAKER_05]: to prefer to end the meeting with the council to explain the program in depth prior to the final decision.

1635
02:00:55,351 --> 02:00:55,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did.

1636
02:00:55,911 --> 02:00:56,832
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not.

1637
02:00:57,012 --> 02:00:57,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not.

1638
02:00:57,712 --> 02:00:58,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.

1639
02:00:58,213 --> 02:01:01,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not have been adequate for you, but we did do that.

1640
02:01:01,334 --> 02:01:03,376
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the only vote that you got was back in May.

1641
02:01:03,476 --> 02:01:04,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a meeting, counselor.

1642
02:01:04,776 --> 02:01:11,420
[SPEAKER_03]: May 20th, a 7-0 vote, allowing us to enter into this contract, a contract which you were informed of before it was signed.

1643
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,401
[SPEAKER_03]: went into an executive session.

1644
02:01:12,421 --> 02:01:15,525
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're doing is entirely disingenuous to say that you would do it.

1645
02:01:15,585 --> 02:01:16,386
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your opinion.

1646
02:01:16,406 --> 02:01:18,829
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a sham.

1647
02:01:18,869 --> 02:01:19,650
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, it's a sham.

1648
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:21,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you just level with the people?

1649
02:01:21,072 --> 02:01:22,314
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I am leveling with the people.

1650
02:01:22,354 --> 02:01:23,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you level with the people?

1651
02:01:23,655 --> 02:01:25,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I am leveling with the people.

1652
02:01:27,098 --> 02:01:27,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Counselor.

1653
02:01:28,058 --> 02:01:30,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the difference is my opinion is correct.

1654
02:01:30,259 --> 02:01:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you seem to think everything you do is correct.

1655
02:01:32,599 --> 02:01:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we voted for it.

1656
02:01:33,099 --> 02:01:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the official records, I think the official records tell it.

1657
02:01:35,779 --> 02:01:35,799
[SPEAKER_05]: 7-0.

1658
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:40,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Before a final decision is made, he was supposed to come back to the council.

1659
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:40,760
[SPEAKER_05]: We did.

1660
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:43,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Father viewing public.

1661
02:01:43,541 --> 02:01:43,881
[SPEAKER_03]: 7-0.

1662
02:01:43,901 --> 02:01:45,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Solicitor.

1663
02:01:45,301 --> 02:01:46,021
[SPEAKER_08]: 14-472.

1664
02:01:46,661 --> 02:01:56,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Counselor, Mr. Solicitor, we had a meeting of the committee of the whole where we were presented, members were here that are in the audience this evening were at that meeting

1665
02:01:56,821 --> 02:01:58,422
[SPEAKER_08]: and they participated in that meeting.

1666
02:01:58,822 --> 02:02:00,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It was packed and it was in the room right over here.

1667
02:02:02,064 --> 02:02:02,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

1668
02:02:06,947 --> 02:02:08,048
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a point of information.

1669
02:02:08,348 --> 02:02:09,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Your point is over.

1670
02:02:10,269 --> 02:02:13,311
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a meeting in September when the council met him there.

1671
02:02:13,491 --> 02:02:17,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We also got a three page piece of document that says not for publication.

1672
02:02:17,794 --> 02:02:19,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It was confidential meeting.

1673
02:02:19,495 --> 02:02:20,296
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a different meeting.

1674
02:02:20,816 --> 02:02:21,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

1675
02:02:27,831 --> 02:02:29,514
[SPEAKER_08]: doing it for 30 years, maybe it's over.

1676
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:33,339
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, I have a half a brain like you don't.

1677
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:34,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

1678
02:02:35,142 --> 02:02:36,624
[SPEAKER_08]: John Starrar, still.

1679
02:02:37,385 --> 02:02:40,470
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be right behind me, councillor, for all you know.

1680
02:02:42,610 --> 02:02:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

1681
02:02:43,611 --> 02:02:44,911
[SPEAKER_05]: The clarification is this.

1682
02:02:45,432 --> 02:02:53,597
[SPEAKER_05]: We met in May, and we took a vote as seven members of the council to allow the mayor to go forward to negotiate what Republic at that time was one of three.

1683
02:02:53,837 --> 02:02:56,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were told not to say a word to anyone about anything.

1684
02:02:57,199 --> 02:03:01,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in September, we had a meeting when the first draft of the contract came back before us.

1685
02:03:01,502 --> 02:03:06,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of that resolution in May was that it would be explained to us prior to the final decision.

1686
02:03:07,145 --> 02:03:09,646
[SPEAKER_05]: The Memphis City Council never took a vote after May.

1687
02:03:09,667 --> 02:03:11,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, you just corrected yourself.

1688
02:03:11,187 --> 02:03:11,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1689
02:03:13,389 --> 02:03:15,610
[SPEAKER_08]: That we would have a meeting, nothing to do with another vote.

1690
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:16,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address.

1691
02:03:19,351 --> 02:03:20,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address, sir.

1692
02:03:20,232 --> 02:03:22,313
[SPEAKER_04]: John Sterella, 20 Metcalf Street.

1693
02:03:22,633 --> 02:03:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1694
02:03:23,453 --> 02:03:27,335
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact remains that the city council did finally give the mayor permission.

1695
02:03:27,395 --> 02:03:28,936
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's the way he interpreted it.

1696
02:03:29,156 --> 02:03:29,736
[SPEAKER_04]: He went ahead.

1697
02:03:30,276 --> 02:03:32,437
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have signed a contract for three years.

1698
02:03:33,438 --> 02:03:37,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in there for a purpose so that this city would not be committed for 10 years.

1699
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:40,881
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years is a long time, but

1700
02:03:41,533 --> 02:03:46,936
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens now is that it's only a seven year contract with a three year addendum.

1701
02:03:46,956 --> 02:03:47,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it gets up to 10.

1702
02:03:48,597 --> 02:03:49,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1703
02:03:49,117 --> 02:03:49,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1704
02:03:50,518 --> 02:03:50,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1705
02:03:50,978 --> 02:03:57,842
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, but the fact remains that the, uh, uh, this parking program is just another tax to the people.

1706
02:03:58,462 --> 02:03:59,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases revenue.

1707
02:04:00,063 --> 02:04:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the purpose of all of this is.

1708
02:04:02,925 --> 02:04:07,207
[SPEAKER_04]: What we really need is a, um, parking enforcement program.

1709
02:04:07,737 --> 02:04:09,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be done at no cost at all.

1710
02:04:10,017 --> 02:04:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I discussed this with the mayor at one time.

1711
02:04:12,978 --> 02:04:25,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Down in the city of Delray Beach in Florida, where I went, they have a program there where war veterans who are retired are happy to enforce parking.

1712
02:04:25,881 --> 02:04:27,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And they get a uniform.

1713
02:04:27,121 --> 02:04:28,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't get paid.

1714
02:04:28,241 --> 02:04:29,202
[SPEAKER_04]: They do it for nothing.

1715
02:04:30,062 --> 02:04:31,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor could have gone ahead with that.

1716
02:04:32,602 --> 02:04:33,883
[SPEAKER_04]: He never did follow through.

1717
02:04:34,463 --> 02:04:35,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish he had.

1718
02:04:36,893 --> 02:04:39,816
[SPEAKER_04]: If we need more police, we ought to have more police.

1719
02:04:39,876 --> 02:04:40,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's primary.

1720
02:04:41,917 --> 02:04:43,298
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't have to have police.

1721
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:49,023
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people who are happy to serve this city at no cost at all.

1722
02:04:51,305 --> 02:04:52,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Torello.

1723
02:04:52,866 --> 02:04:57,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, sir.

1724
02:04:57,210 --> 02:04:57,330
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

1725
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:59,232
[SPEAKER_25]: Vince Master Mateo, 10 Schoolhouse Road.

1726
02:04:59,552 --> 02:04:59,832
Hi, Vince.

1727
02:05:00,353 --> 02:05:00,433
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

1728
02:05:00,773 --> 02:05:01,954
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I'm just here.

1729
02:05:02,554 --> 02:05:05,457
[SPEAKER_25]: I found out about the meters, I believe,

1730
02:05:06,134 --> 02:05:17,483
[SPEAKER_25]: Saturday night when I was driving home, I saw a few places where there's some garbage bags over the meters, and I found out, obviously, that we're getting meters, that this is a new thing happening.

1731
02:05:18,984 --> 02:05:26,650
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to let you know, I'm part of a silent majority of the West Medford residents that everyone that I know wants nothing to do with this at all.

1732
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:33,095
[SPEAKER_25]: If you guys, if this is about a revenue thing, which obviously it sounds like it is, could you just find another way?

1733
02:05:33,195 --> 02:05:35,497
[SPEAKER_25]: Could we discuss with the people, with the residents,

1734
02:05:36,033 --> 02:05:38,954
[SPEAKER_25]: another way to gain the revenue that you guys need?

1735
02:05:40,214 --> 02:05:41,094
[SPEAKER_25]: Would that be possible?

1736
02:05:41,134 --> 02:05:47,035
[SPEAKER_25]: And also, to your point, Robert Penta, I did call the mayor's office the other day.

1737
02:05:47,055 --> 02:05:49,456
[SPEAKER_25]: I was disgusted when I heard what was going on.

1738
02:05:49,516 --> 02:05:57,657
[SPEAKER_25]: I talked to probably about, I don't know, maybe between 30 and 60 local residents that are absolutely outraged at this.

1739
02:05:58,117 --> 02:06:02,198
[SPEAKER_25]: And I called the mayor's office, and I asked, who was responsible for this decision?

1740
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,461
[SPEAKER_25]: And I asked, was it the city council?

1741
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:05,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Were the council members?

1742
02:06:05,422 --> 02:06:06,923
[SPEAKER_25]: And she said, no, it was just the mayor.

1743
02:06:07,663 --> 02:06:07,864
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1744
02:06:07,884 --> 02:06:12,247
[SPEAKER_25]: So, so that's what I got right from the phone call that I called mayor's office.

1745
02:06:14,188 --> 02:06:20,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And he, I mean, so I don't know what council angle, current point of clarification information.

1746
02:06:20,513 --> 02:06:28,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I, it may be council marks would be best to answer this, but just what was said earlier as with regards to possibly veterans or

1747
02:06:28,822 --> 02:06:33,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Julian and other cities and towns, the council has made probably 10 different resolutions.

1748
02:06:33,983 --> 02:06:37,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Council Marks has sat on a committee, gave recommendations to the mayor.

1749
02:06:37,504 --> 02:06:43,606
[SPEAKER_17]: I think when we made the resolution, it was to hire retired police officers to do parking enforcement.

1750
02:06:43,646 --> 02:06:47,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's much better than paying a million dollars to a Tennessee company, correct?

1751
02:06:48,467 --> 02:06:50,208
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not what the mayor wanted to do.

1752
02:06:50,248 --> 02:06:51,568
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what he wanted to do.

1753
02:06:51,808 --> 02:06:53,249
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted parking enforcement.

1754
02:06:53,369 --> 02:06:55,689
[SPEAKER_17]: We gave recommendations for many different things.

1755
02:06:55,849 --> 02:06:58,150
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we sat in meetings.

1756
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,921
[SPEAKER_17]: to discuss, ask questions.

1757
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:01,663
[SPEAKER_17]: We tried to give recommendations.

1758
02:07:01,743 --> 02:07:03,444
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, he wanted the kiosk.

1759
02:07:03,604 --> 02:07:08,028
[SPEAKER_17]: We questioned meters rather than kiosks once we knew that's the type of program he wanted.

1760
02:07:08,648 --> 02:07:08,828
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

1761
02:07:09,169 --> 02:07:19,457
[SPEAKER_25]: What about a solution of maybe having local, like if you're a West Metro resident, get a sticker so, and you can drive down there and park wherever you'd like and not have to pay the kiosk?

1762
02:07:22,734 --> 02:07:28,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something you'd have to bring up with the mayor, because we gave him the authority to sign the 10-year contract.

1763
02:07:28,117 --> 02:07:35,381
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, but his office just told me the other day, two days ago, that's who can make those decisions.

1764
02:07:35,821 --> 02:07:37,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just being upfront and telling you the truth.

1765
02:07:37,422 --> 02:07:37,962
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, I know.

1766
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:39,643
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just speaking for the residents.

1767
02:07:39,823 --> 02:07:43,685
[SPEAKER_25]: I know you heard from the business owners, because there's a whole slew of people that are coming behind me.

1768
02:07:44,105 --> 02:07:46,447
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just telling you, it's like, this is a compelling event.

1769
02:07:47,567 --> 02:07:49,108
[SPEAKER_25]: And people are upset about it.

1770
02:07:49,468 --> 02:07:50,108
[SPEAKER_25]: They've had enough.

1771
02:07:50,548 --> 02:07:52,870
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just hope you guys just represent the people.

1772
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:53,730
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all I ask.

1773
02:07:55,211 --> 02:07:55,551
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1774
02:07:56,451 --> 02:07:57,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

1775
02:07:57,972 --> 02:08:02,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I could, because the gentleman has a great point.

1776
02:08:02,854 --> 02:08:18,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And since 2009, when the Parking Advisory Committee made their recommendations, to today, the mayor has created his own committee to work on parking enforcement.

1777
02:08:18,932 --> 02:08:21,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was members of him, his administration.

1778
02:08:22,935 --> 02:08:24,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's who devised this plan.

1779
02:08:25,317 --> 02:08:29,801
[SPEAKER_02]: This was no one but the mayor and his department heads that put together this plan.

1780
02:08:30,221 --> 02:08:38,487
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the parking enforcement advisory committee, this plan is apples and the mayor's plan is oranges.

1781
02:08:39,188 --> 02:08:41,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Two completely different plans.

1782
02:08:42,226 --> 02:08:51,972
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different plans, of which much of what you mentioned about local in-house enforcement and so forth was addressed in our plan.

1783
02:08:52,513 --> 02:08:55,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bare bones enforcement of existing signs.

1784
02:08:56,575 --> 02:08:58,716
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in our current plan.

1785
02:08:59,057 --> 02:09:07,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the past four years, the mayor has, and he's the chief executive officer, so if you're looking for someone to make change to the plan,

1786
02:09:08,154 --> 02:09:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: You're speaking to the wrong people.

1787
02:09:09,835 --> 02:09:10,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a legislative body.

1788
02:09:11,236 --> 02:09:14,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We open, uh, we have a public meeting, right?

1789
02:09:14,978 --> 02:09:16,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just say we're a public meeting.

1790
02:09:16,779 --> 02:09:21,381
[SPEAKER_02]: People can come up and speak, but if you want to affect change, it's the mayor.

1791
02:09:22,602 --> 02:09:28,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've tried, believe me, countless times to get the mayor to one of our meetings, uh, so he can speak before the people.

1792
02:09:29,186 --> 02:09:32,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But the mayor under the city charter is not required to do so.

1793
02:09:33,068 --> 02:09:34,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been on the council 14 years.

1794
02:09:34,849 --> 02:09:36,750
[SPEAKER_02]: He has never come before the podium in 14 years.

1795
02:09:37,637 --> 02:09:39,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's his prerogative.

1796
02:09:39,939 --> 02:09:45,844
[SPEAKER_02]: But my suggestion is that if people are upset, they should contact the mayor's office.

1797
02:09:46,384 --> 02:09:57,814
[SPEAKER_02]: When I voted for allowing the mayor, because state law said he can only enter into a contract up to three years, the three bids that came back were all for 10 years, or seven, or 10, I forget what it was.

1798
02:09:58,054 --> 02:09:59,435
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all past the three years.

1799
02:10:00,076 --> 02:10:02,798
[SPEAKER_02]: My vote was to allow him to enter into a contract.

1800
02:10:03,298 --> 02:10:05,900
[SPEAKER_02]: The language in the contract is the mayor's.

1801
02:10:06,998 --> 02:10:11,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not have support much of the language that was in there.

1802
02:10:11,443 --> 02:10:16,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anyone behind this reel vote to raise the business permit packet from $100 to $400?

1803
02:10:17,168 --> 02:10:22,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anyone vote to bring Republic or a private outside company to come in and do the work?

1804
02:10:23,255 --> 02:10:26,138
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not vote on any portion of this proposal.

1805
02:10:27,033 --> 02:10:31,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say to the council, we did not vote on any part of this proposal.

1806
02:10:31,774 --> 02:10:33,615
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the mayor's proposal.

1807
02:10:33,995 --> 02:10:35,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope it works well for him.

1808
02:10:35,795 --> 02:10:39,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I'm hearing from the residents, they wish there was more input.

1809
02:10:39,536 --> 02:10:43,718
[SPEAKER_02]: They wish there was a time that we had that we could sit down and iron over some of the issues.

1810
02:10:44,098 --> 02:10:46,538
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like your point about the reverse 911 call.

1811
02:10:46,558 --> 02:10:48,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Just come up so the people at home can hear you.

1812
02:10:48,759 --> 02:10:49,039
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1813
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:51,600
[SPEAKER_25]: I like your point about the reverse 911 call.

1814
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:54,761
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, if the wind's blowing too hard out, we get a reverse 911 call.

1815
02:10:56,248 --> 02:10:58,772
[SPEAKER_25]: There's so many easy ways to address this.

1816
02:10:59,152 --> 02:11:00,854
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, just the people know.

1817
02:11:01,034 --> 02:11:02,997
[SPEAKER_25]: And I appreciate all your service up here.

1818
02:11:03,458 --> 02:11:07,563
[SPEAKER_25]: This is actually the first time I've been to a city hall meeting, and it's a nice.

1819
02:11:08,681 --> 02:11:10,262
[SPEAKER_25]: Nice event to be here.

1820
02:11:10,342 --> 02:11:15,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Obviously, I didn't want to be here, to be honest with you, but I just didn't want to look at these meters anymore.

1821
02:11:15,923 --> 02:11:33,309
[SPEAKER_25]: And the agony of going down just to West Medford really quickly to go grab a sub or go grab a pizza and worry about getting a $25 ticket, it changes the whole complexity of our wonderful area of Medford that I'm proud to be a member here and a resident here.

1822
02:11:33,329 --> 02:11:35,390
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been here for 14 years.

1823
02:11:35,410 --> 02:11:35,990
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a ton of

1824
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:47,137
[SPEAKER_25]: young people moving in, and it's something nice that I know everyone says, well, Somerville's doing it, Winchester does it, I don't really, I'm not a big fan of Somerville, I'm not a big fan of Winchester.

1825
02:11:47,717 --> 02:12:01,405
[SPEAKER_25]: I love the way Medford is, and I'd like to keep it that way, and there's a lot of things here that I just think would be important for all, and like I said, anything you guys can do, I will do my best as a resident to talk to the mayor,

1826
02:12:02,063 --> 02:12:08,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything anyone can do to get rid of these, I mean, if we need sawsaws, whatever, I'm here to help.

1827
02:12:11,066 --> 02:12:12,147
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, thank you for your time.

1828
02:12:12,167 --> 02:12:13,647
[SPEAKER_25]: I really do appreciate it.

1829
02:12:13,807 --> 02:12:19,069
[SPEAKER_25]: And thanks again for your point about the reverse 911 call, and I also appreciate your support, too.

1830
02:12:19,989 --> 02:12:20,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

1831
02:12:20,529 --> 02:12:20,970
[SPEAKER_25]: Merry Christmas.

1832
02:12:21,450 --> 02:12:21,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Merry Christmas.

1833
02:12:25,332 --> 02:12:26,874
[SPEAKER_21]: 2 quick things, and I'll stop talking tonight.

1834
02:12:27,835 --> 02:12:32,840
[SPEAKER_21]: On what Councilor Marks was saying earlier, what would it require to change the city charter to get the mayor here for the meetings?

1835
02:12:33,641 --> 02:12:36,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Because if this is his parking program, he should have to answer for it.

1836
02:12:36,664 --> 02:12:41,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I'm coming here with legitimate gripes, legitimate heartfelt concerns,

1837
02:12:41,609 --> 02:12:53,297
[SPEAKER_21]: that are gonna cause undue hardships to my business, make me lay off friends of mine who work for me, who basically do me a favor and don't ask for a dime raise, or anything out of the ordinary.

1838
02:12:53,357 --> 02:12:54,557
[SPEAKER_21]: If they need a day off, they get it.

1839
02:12:55,018 --> 02:12:56,439
[SPEAKER_21]: But I still haven't gotten an answer.

1840
02:12:56,459 --> 02:13:01,682
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't expecting one from you guys tonight, but I haven't gotten an answer what I need to do about my temporary parking permits.

1841
02:13:02,022 --> 02:13:03,223
[SPEAKER_21]: We are two days from Christmas.

1842
02:13:03,623 --> 02:13:10,828
[SPEAKER_21]: I can tell you right now, I cannot afford even a permit for myself, and there's nothing in place for temporary, part-time, or seasonal employees.

1843
02:13:11,328 --> 02:13:21,778
[SPEAKER_21]: CB Scoops in my West Medford district, not to point her out, but over the summer, she has four or five kids at night or during the afternoon working there, waiting on customers because the line is out the door.

1844
02:13:22,199 --> 02:13:25,902
[SPEAKER_21]: What are 16, 17, and 18-year-olds supposed to do for a three-month time span?

1845
02:13:26,663 --> 02:13:31,067
[SPEAKER_21]: So my first thing is asking about changing the charter to actually get the mayor here.

1846
02:13:31,087 --> 02:13:33,049
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's his program, he should have the answer for it.

1847
02:13:35,066 --> 02:13:39,087
[SPEAKER_21]: is the businesses in West Medford is quite different from all the other squares.

1848
02:13:39,127 --> 02:13:40,988
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a lot of drop-off, pick-up.

1849
02:13:41,088 --> 02:13:45,330
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a dog groomer right next to mine, literally dropping the pooch off, picking the pooch up.

1850
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:49,771
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a dry cleaner across the street, dropping off your clothes, picking up.

1851
02:13:49,811 --> 02:13:52,092
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in there no more than a minute to two minutes.

1852
02:13:52,532 --> 02:13:58,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Why should you have to spend two to three minutes to interact with this instrument just so you could park and drop off?

1853
02:13:58,874 --> 02:14:00,855
[SPEAKER_21]: No considerations were made to drop-off zones.

1854
02:14:01,225 --> 02:14:06,249
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one 30-minute spot in Medford in front of one eatery place.

1855
02:14:06,329 --> 02:14:11,072
[SPEAKER_21]: We have seven places where you can get something to eat, where you can call your order in and pick it up.

1856
02:14:11,152 --> 02:14:14,315
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in there less than two minutes unless they're busy, which is good for them.

1857
02:14:14,855 --> 02:14:17,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Still no considerations towards loading zones.

1858
02:14:17,877 --> 02:14:19,839
[SPEAKER_21]: How are these deliveries supposed to come?

1859
02:14:19,919 --> 02:14:25,423
[SPEAKER_21]: With the Depot Square, she has fish that comes in directly from Ipswich as soon as they catch it and kill it.

1860
02:14:26,755 --> 02:14:31,440
[SPEAKER_21]: With big trucks, where are they supposed to park except double parking or parking in the handicapped spot?

1861
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:33,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Republic's answer, they'll get a ticket.

1862
02:14:33,742 --> 02:14:36,144
[SPEAKER_21]: After how many tickets do you think they're still going to come back to Medford?

1863
02:14:37,005 --> 02:14:38,887
[SPEAKER_21]: No consideration was given to loading zones.

1864
02:14:39,467 --> 02:14:41,649
[SPEAKER_21]: So please keep that in mind.

1865
02:14:41,889 --> 02:14:44,472
[SPEAKER_21]: And if there's anything I can do to help to get the mayor here.

1866
02:14:45,893 --> 02:14:46,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Please let me know.

1867
02:14:46,733 --> 02:14:56,555
[SPEAKER_21]: But if this is his program, and you guys can't answer for it, and you voted something, and he went completely in a different direction, then he should be the one to answer for it, not the seven of you.

1868
02:14:57,075 --> 02:15:01,096
[SPEAKER_21]: So I mean, I've always been a big supporter of McGlynn.

1869
02:15:01,616 --> 02:15:04,456
[SPEAKER_21]: I had him at an anniversary celebration this past March.

1870
02:15:04,476 --> 02:15:06,457
[SPEAKER_21]: He came in, spent the afternoon with my office.

1871
02:15:07,077 --> 02:15:12,678
[SPEAKER_21]: But I can tell you that the support is dwindling after this issue, because it's an undue hardship

1872
02:15:13,603 --> 02:15:20,705
[SPEAKER_21]: 13 days before this project is set to go into place, I need to come up with all this money around the holiday season and now mourning the loss of a family member.

1873
02:15:21,445 --> 02:15:27,946
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, please tell me where I need to do and where I went wrong by choosing to open a shop in Medford.

1874
02:15:28,347 --> 02:15:42,890
[SPEAKER_21]: I could have gone to Stoneham or any other local community where I could have paid more for a monthly rent but had off-street parking for both me, my employees, and my customers where there would be no consideration for pay to park because it would have been in a little strip mall.

1875
02:15:44,584 --> 02:15:44,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1876
02:15:45,484 --> 02:15:49,146
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ, just so you know, you are being heard.

1877
02:15:49,926 --> 02:15:57,069
[SPEAKER_08]: The Chamber of Commerce has worked very, very, very diligently, and I think we've seen results in that with the press release that went out today.

1878
02:15:57,889 --> 02:16:01,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not going to be $400 come January 15th.

1879
02:16:01,551 --> 02:16:01,791
[SPEAKER_08]: It's $100.

1880
02:16:02,291 --> 02:16:07,233
[SPEAKER_08]: The business permit and the commuter permit is staying the same, which people already should be paying down.

1881
02:16:07,797 --> 02:16:10,217
[SPEAKER_08]: in the business lot, either that or they're parking illegally already.

1882
02:16:10,237 --> 02:16:10,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

1883
02:16:10,818 --> 02:16:17,539
[SPEAKER_21]: My, my response was, you know, if this, if the $400 was going to stick come January 5th, I would pull down my blinds, put a big sign on the door.

1884
02:16:17,859 --> 02:16:19,819
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to know when I'll reopen call city hall.

1885
02:16:20,219 --> 02:16:25,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause as soon as it's affordable for me to come to my business and my workers to be here, we will reopen for business.

1886
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:27,320
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the business permit, there is no change.

1887
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,621
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, a hundred dollars up until now.

1888
02:16:29,921 --> 02:16:30,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1889
02:16:30,281 --> 02:16:36,482
[SPEAKER_08]: The police, as the chief said, I've been very busy with other stuff, but technically if you don't have a sticker right now in that parking lot,

1890
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:38,081
[SPEAKER_08]: you should be ticketed and towed.

1891
02:16:38,301 --> 02:16:38,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1892
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:43,465
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but is there, is there any thing in motion or is there anything I can do?

1893
02:16:43,485 --> 02:16:47,288
[SPEAKER_08]: 60 days, as the chief mentioned earlier, this is going to be a work in progress.

1894
02:16:47,488 --> 02:16:48,729
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably very fluid, right?

1895
02:16:48,749 --> 02:16:48,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief.

1896
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:52,311
[SPEAKER_08]: And uh, as needs come up,

1897
02:16:53,447 --> 02:17:01,193
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't see to buy a $100 permit for a vehicle that's going to be with me for three weeks, if that, and then three months over the summer.

1898
02:17:01,253 --> 02:17:02,093
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not fair.

1899
02:17:03,775 --> 02:17:05,216
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's currently right now.

1900
02:17:05,476 --> 02:17:06,176
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I understand.

1901
02:17:06,197 --> 02:17:10,700
[SPEAKER_08]: If your people are parking in that lot without a permit on their vehicle right now, they're illegally parked.

1902
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,140
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1903
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:14,883
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as the businesses in Medford Square are doing the same thing as the Governor's Avalon.

1904
02:17:15,784 --> 02:17:19,846
[SPEAKER_08]: People are used to lax enforcement around here.

1905
02:17:19,906 --> 02:17:20,427
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.

1906
02:17:20,767 --> 02:17:28,531
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was one of my considerations when I opened my business in West Medford, was the parking, was the price on the rent, the location, the walk around traffic.

1907
02:17:29,011 --> 02:17:30,712
[SPEAKER_21]: But it was one of the mitigating factors.

1908
02:17:31,352 --> 02:17:41,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Had I known that two years later there would be this kind of cost assimilated extra to my business, I would have gone elsewhere, where these issues wouldn't have been an issue.

1909
02:17:41,855 --> 02:17:54,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So just, just so everyone knows, including yourself, all the members of the council, I think we're asked a similar question when the city solicitor and the mayor presented this, everyone thinks it's an automatic 10 years.

1910
02:17:55,624 --> 02:18:01,248
[SPEAKER_08]: It's similar to the trash and recycling program that happened when this place was filled to the rafters.

1911
02:18:02,228 --> 02:18:03,409
[SPEAKER_08]: We still heard some complaints.

1912
02:18:03,789 --> 02:18:05,371
[SPEAKER_08]: We worked on it as we moved forward.

1913
02:18:05,811 --> 02:18:10,594
[SPEAKER_08]: But most importantly, there is a clause that we can get out of this by purchasing the equipment.

1914
02:18:10,927 --> 02:18:11,067
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

1915
02:18:11,487 --> 02:18:16,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And our city solicitor, as you know, is top notch.

1916
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:16,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, absolutely.

1917
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:26,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And if for some reason they want to overturn this at some point, there'll be a dollar value, but it can be done.

1918
02:18:26,936 --> 02:18:32,319
[SPEAKER_08]: But tell your employees they've been lucky they haven't got ticketed in that lot without their pocket permits up to this point.

1919
02:18:32,459 --> 02:18:38,463
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't see it feasible to purchase a permit for a vehicle that's not a full-time employee.

1920
02:18:39,314 --> 02:18:43,999
[SPEAKER_21]: that's, you know, a friend of mine since we were six coming in one day a week, cause that's what his schedule permits.

1921
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:45,081
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

1922
02:18:45,361 --> 02:18:45,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1923
02:18:45,661 --> 02:18:46,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Merry Christmas again.

1924
02:18:46,582 --> 02:18:50,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if I could just make one announcement from the chair to park Medford is up and running.

1925
02:18:51,488 --> 02:18:53,650
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually get the application on your smartphones.

1926
02:18:54,371 --> 02:18:55,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's a pretty interesting website.

1927
02:18:57,595 --> 02:18:59,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I was fooling around with it tonight before the meeting.

1928
02:18:59,777 --> 02:19:00,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh,

1929
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:03,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1930
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:05,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't have smartphones.

1931
02:19:05,591 --> 02:19:07,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't even have a phone.

1932
02:19:07,052 --> 02:19:08,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't even have computers.

1933
02:19:08,733 --> 02:19:10,013
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably don't have a car then either.

1934
02:19:10,053 --> 02:19:10,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

1935
02:19:10,233 --> 02:19:11,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't go to the library.

1936
02:19:11,474 --> 02:19:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Can somebody come to City Hall and get the permit?

1937
02:19:13,415 --> 02:19:13,995
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the question.

1938
02:19:14,015 --> 02:19:20,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody can go to 577 Main Street on Medford Chief.

1939
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:21,118
[SPEAKER_08]: 575 Main Street.

1940
02:19:21,458 --> 02:19:25,180
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be a fully operational business meeting place.

1941
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was worked on in the contract.

1942
02:19:27,968 --> 02:19:34,772
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as the Chamber of Commerce and everyone else involved wanted to make sure that there was a place where people can go on a full-time basis.

1943
02:19:35,152 --> 02:19:41,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So people are actually going to be able to get the answers quicker now than currently coming to City Hall where the tax office and everyone else has been doing it.

1944
02:19:42,035 --> 02:19:43,956
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully that's helpful, Councilor Penta.

1945
02:19:54,322 --> 02:19:56,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I started to allude to it when I was talking about it.

1946
02:19:57,853 --> 02:20:02,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does Medford have to start at 7 in the morning to 7 at night, when Boston starts at 8 in the morning?

1947
02:20:02,595 --> 02:20:05,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them, all the other Saturdays, why are we 7?

1948
02:20:05,476 --> 02:20:08,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we stayed consistent with some of the posting that's already out there.

1949
02:20:08,978 --> 02:20:09,778
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the only reason.

1950
02:20:10,099 --> 02:20:12,460
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's actually going to begin at 7 in the morning.

1951
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:14,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, could you make a recommendation to start at 8 instead of 7?

1952
02:20:14,781 --> 02:20:17,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the signs say 7 AM to 7 PM.

1953
02:20:17,482 --> 02:20:20,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's 7 AM, 7 PM, Monday through Saturday.

1954
02:20:20,203 --> 02:20:22,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's absurd, 7 o'clock.

1955
02:20:22,564 --> 02:20:24,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad enough these businesses are hurting.

1956
02:20:25,125 --> 02:20:26,386
[SPEAKER_05]: This hurts them even more, 7 in the morning.

1957
02:20:27,992 --> 02:20:29,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't say that it's going to begin right at 7.

1958
02:20:29,812 --> 02:20:33,693
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they just went according to the times posted on the signs.

1959
02:20:33,833 --> 02:20:36,194
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's bad enough that the rubbish is all over the square.

1960
02:20:36,234 --> 02:20:38,935
[SPEAKER_05]: The people put them out ahead of time and that can't be enforced.

1961
02:20:39,675 --> 02:20:40,415
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we have this.

1962
02:20:40,655 --> 02:20:48,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the problem with the rubbish in the square is, you know, years ago they did do the overnight pickup, but people complained about that.

1963
02:20:48,317 --> 02:20:53,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And then now, so now they're coming through at nine and 10 o'clock in the morning causing gridlock on Salem street.

1964
02:20:53,058 --> 02:20:57,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's, that's part of the problem with the trash, but the parking, just to correct that, uh,

1965
02:20:58,577 --> 02:21:01,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I said 575, it's 557 Main Street.

1966
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:02,601
[SPEAKER_14]: 557 Main Street.

1967
02:21:03,662 --> 02:21:08,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, right at the corner of Main Street and Dexter Street in South Method.

1968
02:21:09,367 --> 02:21:09,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

1969
02:21:09,888 --> 02:21:10,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1970
02:21:13,591 --> 02:21:15,013
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we have one.

1971
02:21:16,298 --> 02:21:34,454
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval with the seasonal passes from Councilor Lungo Kern, Councilor Caviello to look at the program 60 days after its inception, and Councilor Mox to get a listing of all the commuter, commuter residential, permit parking, if it goes into the general fund, and if not, what fund it goes to.

1972
02:21:34,494 --> 02:21:35,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct, Councilor Mox?

1973
02:21:36,616 --> 02:21:37,477
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1974
02:21:37,657 --> 02:21:38,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I want to amend it.

1975
02:21:38,858 --> 02:21:39,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1976
02:21:39,639 --> 02:21:40,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

1977
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:41,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say 60 days?

1978
02:21:42,888 --> 02:21:43,868
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the council is stating.

1979
02:21:43,928 --> 02:21:49,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to amend it to 30, get a report in 30 days because... 30 days, they're not even going to be ticketing.

1980
02:21:49,191 --> 02:21:49,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1981
02:21:49,731 --> 02:21:51,892
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 days after it starts, after the program starts.

1982
02:21:54,373 --> 02:21:55,554
[SPEAKER_08]: After the 30-day grace period.

1983
02:21:56,554 --> 02:21:57,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, all right, all right, I'm sorry.

1984
02:21:57,595 --> 02:21:59,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you, I thought you, okay, okay.

1985
02:22:01,863 --> 02:22:03,425
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1986
02:22:03,706 --> 02:22:03,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1987
02:22:04,086 --> 02:22:04,687
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1988
02:22:04,707 --> 02:22:05,188
[SPEAKER_07]: The ayes have it.

1989
02:22:05,228 --> 02:22:06,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President, Caraviello.

1990
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:10,194
[SPEAKER_07]: On the suspension, Mr. President, if we could take 14788 and 14795, excuse me, and 794.

1991
02:22:10,235 --> 02:22:12,758
[SPEAKER_07]: 14794, petition for a common victualized license by Leonard Tekja.

1992
02:22:19,587 --> 02:22:20,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I say that right?

1993
02:22:20,247 --> 02:22:20,707
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1994
02:22:20,747 --> 02:22:21,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Teja.

1995
02:22:21,367 --> 02:22:21,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Teja.

1996
02:22:21,928 --> 02:22:22,268
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1997
02:22:22,828 --> 02:22:24,168
[SPEAKER_08]: 76 4th Street, Medford, Mass.

1998
02:22:24,508 --> 02:22:26,648
[SPEAKER_08]: For the Lighthouse, 20 High Street, Medford, Mass.

1999
02:22:27,989 --> 02:22:29,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Vice President Caraviello.

2000
02:22:29,989 --> 02:22:30,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2001
02:22:30,929 --> 02:22:32,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, I reviewed the gentleman's papers.

2002
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:34,490
[SPEAKER_24]: They all seem to be in order.

2003
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:39,091
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm happy that the restaurant will be staying open with a new owner.

2004
02:22:39,571 --> 02:22:39,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2005
02:22:42,052 --> 02:22:43,112
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the menu going to change?

2006
02:22:43,132 --> 02:22:43,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you have new food?

2007
02:22:43,832 --> 02:22:44,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything's going to stay the same?

2008
02:22:44,812 --> 02:22:46,053
[SPEAKER_09]: For now, just smile and food.

2009
02:22:46,453 --> 02:22:47,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Smile and food.

2010
02:22:48,872 --> 02:22:49,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2011
02:22:49,432 --> 02:22:50,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Later on, maybe down the road.

2012
02:22:50,593 --> 02:22:58,295
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, just, you know, I mean, I'm honored to have this dream come true in Medford, where I live.

2013
02:22:58,455 --> 02:23:00,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So just keep it going, that's all.

2014
02:23:01,476 --> 02:23:01,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2015
02:23:02,236 --> 02:23:03,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Another Medford resident?

2016
02:23:03,536 --> 02:23:03,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2017
02:23:03,756 --> 02:23:04,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Give him back to his city.

2018
02:23:04,617 --> 02:23:05,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

2019
02:23:05,197 --> 02:23:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

2020
02:23:05,897 --> 02:23:06,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

2021
02:23:06,237 --> 02:23:06,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

2022
02:23:06,677 --> 02:23:07,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

2023
02:23:07,037 --> 02:23:07,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a nice holiday.

2024
02:23:08,118 --> 02:23:08,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a nice holiday.

2025
02:23:08,878 --> 02:23:09,838
[SPEAKER_13]: To all of you.

2026
02:23:10,138 --> 02:23:14,960
[SPEAKER_13]: In reviewing the paperwork, I see here that it indicates that you're a sole proprietor and that you will have no employees working for you.

2027
02:23:16,208 --> 02:23:17,849
[SPEAKER_09]: That was mistakenly done.

2028
02:23:18,169 --> 02:23:22,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the accountant is in the process of taking care of that.

2029
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:28,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I will have, at least for now, one employee in addition to the business growing or so.

2030
02:23:29,012 --> 02:23:31,293
[SPEAKER_09]: We can add another one or two, depending.

2031
02:23:32,393 --> 02:23:41,316
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, but as of right now, I addressed that with my accountant person, which he'll take care of that in the process of the workers' comp and all that stuff.

2032
02:23:44,477 --> 02:23:44,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2033
02:23:45,638 --> 02:23:47,640
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

2034
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:47,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

2035
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:49,061
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

2036
02:23:49,661 --> 02:23:50,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

2037
02:23:50,382 --> 02:23:50,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

2038
02:23:51,022 --> 02:23:51,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

2039
02:23:51,663 --> 02:23:52,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a nice holidays.

2040
02:23:52,924 --> 02:23:54,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, while we're in the suspension, 14-788.

2041
02:23:54,625 --> 02:24:04,893
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the appropriate funds and authorize the mayor on the grant to preserve land for public park known as the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Guard.

2042
02:24:05,593 --> 02:24:07,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Medford City Council.

2043
02:24:07,955 --> 02:24:13,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Lauren DiLorenzo, Director of the Office of Community Development here at City Hall 85 George B. Hassett Drive.

2044
02:24:13,686 --> 02:24:16,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Before you hear again tonight, asking for your support, please.

2045
02:24:17,770 --> 02:24:30,263
[SPEAKER_12]: For us to be able to accept a combination of federal earmarks, private foundations, and private contributions to construct the park which we are

2046
02:24:31,431 --> 02:24:36,295
[SPEAKER_12]: in naming the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Garden at the grounds of the Medford Senior Center.

2047
02:24:37,015 --> 02:24:45,382
[SPEAKER_12]: The purpose of the park is to honor the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings and, of course, the connection to the city of Medford and to this area.

2048
02:24:46,182 --> 02:25:00,914
[SPEAKER_12]: In particular, Crystal Campbell, Martin Richard, Lingzi Liu, Sean Collier, all those others who were injured, and also the first responders, the people who were compassionate that day and stepped out of their own concerns for themselves.

2049
02:25:01,479 --> 02:25:02,159
[SPEAKER_12]: to help others.

2050
02:25:05,141 --> 02:25:12,164
[SPEAKER_12]: We've worked very hard to put forward a package that did not require any funding by the taxpayers of the city of Medford.

2051
02:25:13,085 --> 02:25:16,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm asking for your support for this program so we can build this park.

2052
02:25:17,287 --> 02:25:18,668
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that you'll be proud of it.

2053
02:25:19,228 --> 02:25:21,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that you'll be able to use it.

2054
02:25:22,069 --> 02:25:23,370
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be able to contemplate.

2055
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:24,891
[SPEAKER_12]: We can recreate there.

2056
02:25:25,271 --> 02:25:27,032
[SPEAKER_12]: It will also serve a solemn purpose.

2057
02:25:29,286 --> 02:25:36,090
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a picture of Martin Richard, a very young boy, with his teeth.

2058
02:25:37,151 --> 02:25:40,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is the picture that will bring me to tears.

2059
02:25:41,874 --> 02:25:43,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Not only me, I'm sure a lot of people.

2060
02:25:44,356 --> 02:25:46,938
[SPEAKER_12]: But that young boy had teeth of a man.

2061
02:25:47,498 --> 02:25:52,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are teeth a young boy is to grow into, to serve him, to bring him to manhood.

2062
02:25:53,202 --> 02:25:54,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And that didn't happen that day.

2063
02:25:55,983 --> 02:25:56,504
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really

2064
02:25:57,705 --> 02:26:02,209
[SPEAKER_12]: is a failure of all of us that that young boy did not achieve manhood.

2065
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:04,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, I have my own Martin Richard.

2066
02:26:04,371 --> 02:26:04,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a son.

2067
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:07,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a son who had buck teeth like that.

2068
02:26:07,734 --> 02:26:10,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a son who had two sets of braces by the time he was 10.

2069
02:26:11,017 --> 02:26:13,319
[SPEAKER_12]: When I see that boy, I see my son.

2070
02:26:13,879 --> 02:26:15,260
[SPEAKER_12]: My son's going to college.

2071
02:26:16,161 --> 02:26:18,003
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm able to see my son this holiday.

2072
02:26:18,443 --> 02:26:20,084
[SPEAKER_12]: These kids did not go home.

2073
02:26:20,365 --> 02:26:21,265
[SPEAKER_12]: They had parents.

2074
02:26:21,806 --> 02:26:22,647
[SPEAKER_12]: They had sisters.

2075
02:26:23,267 --> 02:26:24,008
[SPEAKER_12]: They had brothers.

2076
02:26:25,208 --> 02:26:29,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the people that we work with in this community have also suffered injuries as that event.

2077
02:26:30,511 --> 02:26:35,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm asking you to please support us in this adventure by approving this appropriation.

2078
02:26:36,034 --> 02:26:36,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2079
02:26:36,955 --> 02:26:37,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Lauren.

2080
02:26:37,515 --> 02:26:42,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I may, from the chair, we have a paper before us that gave the annual, um,

2081
02:26:43,809 --> 02:26:47,891
[SPEAKER_08]: price for mulching and the fountain service, and it's $3,000 per year.

2082
02:26:47,911 --> 02:26:49,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the council ask for that?

2083
02:26:49,751 --> 02:26:55,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the electricity costs for the fountain to operate in the lighting is estimated at $1,500 per year.

2084
02:26:55,813 --> 02:26:59,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for answering these important questions before the council has voted on this.

2085
02:27:00,015 --> 02:27:00,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2086
02:27:00,415 --> 02:27:01,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor DelaRusso.

2087
02:27:01,636 --> 02:27:02,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Move approval.

2088
02:27:03,896 --> 02:27:04,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

2089
02:27:04,757 --> 02:27:06,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

2090
02:27:07,498 --> 02:27:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

2091
02:27:09,198 --> 02:27:10,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2092
02:27:10,419 --> 02:27:10,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

2093
02:27:12,363 --> 02:27:15,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, indeed, the maintenance issue was one concern.

2094
02:27:16,626 --> 02:27:27,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving forward on a project without a maintenance plan made no sense, and I'm glad we were able to table the paper to get a report back from the administration.

2095
02:27:28,914 --> 02:27:37,299
[SPEAKER_02]: However, as I stated, I believe it was last week, that I would support a modest

2096
02:27:37,998 --> 02:27:43,562
[SPEAKER_02]: plan to memorialize the Marathon bombing victims.

2097
02:27:46,184 --> 02:27:57,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I see this Peace Garden as a great option on remembering, as a remembrance area.

2098
02:27:57,852 --> 02:28:06,958
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in this day and age, especially in this economy, with all the many needs that we have in our community,

2099
02:28:07,666 --> 02:28:22,058
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, from street sidewalk repairs to a new police station, to an updated public library, uh, to, uh, the boys and girls club that has to close their art room because there's mold.

2100
02:28:22,498 --> 02:28:25,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So a hundred kids on a daily basis can't use the art room.

2101
02:28:26,602 --> 02:28:35,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we also spoke a couple of weeks ago about repurposing, which is 150 yards, uh, from this, uh, proposed site.

2102
02:28:36,011 --> 02:28:46,375
[SPEAKER_02]: the transportation shelter, um, uh, which, uh, would, uh, go hand in hand with, uh, in the proximity of, uh, this particular peace garden.

2103
02:28:47,116 --> 02:28:54,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I, at this point, um, I understand the fact that there was mentioned of no taxpayer dollars going into this.

2104
02:28:55,399 --> 02:29:04,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, however, uh, the Cummings grant, the, uh, wind resorts, 250,000, uh, even the park grant that we're voting on tonight,

2105
02:29:05,958 --> 02:29:09,239
[SPEAKER_02]: could have been used for other purposes in our community.

2106
02:29:10,179 --> 02:29:15,760
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have sought this funding for many other purposes in our community that are needed.

2107
02:29:16,441 --> 02:29:33,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to understate the need to memorialize the victims of that tragic incident that took place and many thousands of people that were impacted both mentally and physically by that occurrence.

2108
02:29:35,437 --> 02:29:55,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I, in all good faith, could not vote for the Peace Garden in this particular $299,000 park grant because it's my job to look in the community, see what the needs are, and try to address the needs.

2109
02:29:56,354 --> 02:29:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, $1,298,000 on apostle land

2110
02:30:01,202 --> 02:30:23,436
[SPEAKER_02]: which I've stated both at committee whole meetings and publicly, I don't believe that the intersection of Riverside and Shipway is the appropriate place to have, if we're going to put a Peace Garden, an area to reflect, a solemn area.

2111
02:30:23,836 --> 02:30:25,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very high traveled area.

2112
02:30:26,658 --> 02:30:29,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Just last week, I was coming up to the city council meeting

2113
02:30:29,903 --> 02:30:34,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone drove up on the median strip right here on Riverside Ave.

2114
02:30:34,504 --> 02:30:37,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We take the turn to go to City Hall, take the right.

2115
02:30:37,645 --> 02:30:39,446
[SPEAKER_02]: They drove right up onto the road over there.

2116
02:30:40,866 --> 02:30:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a high-traveled area.

2117
02:30:43,287 --> 02:30:58,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, I believe as a community, which was already mentioned, actually, there was behind the Columbus School, the softball field named after Krista Campbell,

2118
02:30:59,522 --> 02:31:10,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, in my opinion, we could have done a tasteful memorial plaque somewhere in the community to recognize the victims of the Marathon bombing.

2119
02:31:11,132 --> 02:31:25,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the administration would like to call back the 250,000 from Wynn Resorts and use it towards possibly the mold issue at the Boys and Girls Club.

2120
02:31:26,062 --> 02:31:32,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Use it towards improvements on our roads, the potholes that we're seeing throughout our city.

2121
02:31:33,325 --> 02:31:38,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Use it towards the repurposing of the transportation shelter, Mr. President.

2122
02:31:39,588 --> 02:31:50,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been inundated from that one article in the local paper about the transportation shelter with repurposes, repurpose uses from residents of this community.

2123
02:31:50,794 --> 02:31:55,596
[SPEAKER_02]: The gentleman from the paper actually told me that he put it on his website

2124
02:31:55,915 --> 02:32:00,879
[SPEAKER_02]: and also has received a number of people responding back.

2125
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:12,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to see that also take some attention, Mr. President, which is in the heart of our downtown business district, before we move on $1,298,000.

2126
02:32:13,410 --> 02:32:23,559
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if the administration is willing to take the $250,000 from Wynn Resorts and apply it to other needs, I mentioned and other members of the council have,

2127
02:32:24,466 --> 02:32:25,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I could support this here tonight.

2128
02:32:26,307 --> 02:32:38,312
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, Mr. President, I will not support this park grant because I believe it should be spent on local existing parks currently in our community need updating.

2129
02:32:38,692 --> 02:32:45,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's been some improvement throughout the city and parks, but as we know, we have, I believe it's 24 parks in this community.

2130
02:32:45,855 --> 02:32:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: They always need updating on the taut lots, uh, in the basketball courts and, uh, throughout the parks.

2131
02:32:53,551 --> 02:32:56,033
[SPEAKER_02]: for themselves, the ball fields, and so forth.

2132
02:32:56,113 --> 02:33:03,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be my motion tonight, Mr. President, to take the $250,000 out of this particular proposal.

2133
02:33:03,679 --> 02:33:06,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll approve the $299,000 for the park grant.

2134
02:33:07,622 --> 02:33:12,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure wind management, this is part of a million dollars they want to give the city.

2135
02:33:14,068 --> 02:33:14,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Wind resorts, I mean.

2136
02:33:15,749 --> 02:33:17,791
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of a million dollars they want to give the city.

2137
02:33:18,211 --> 02:33:21,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they wouldn't mind where we spent the million dollars.

2138
02:33:21,413 --> 02:33:21,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Any community needs.

2139
02:33:23,628 --> 02:33:31,100
[SPEAKER_02]: My motion is to take the $250,000, have the administration take that money back out of the proposal.

2140
02:33:32,662 --> 02:33:34,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That would mean lowering the proposal by $250,000.

2141
02:33:36,059 --> 02:33:42,861
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we heard last week, I think it was Longo Kern, that questioned the upkeep of the fountains.

2142
02:33:43,281 --> 02:33:44,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I've questioned the upkeep of the fountains.

2143
02:33:46,002 --> 02:33:57,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Mrs. Pop mentioned that it was $250,000, roughly, the cost for the water fountain, the fountains that are going to take place.

2144
02:33:57,675 --> 02:34:24,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if the administration wanted to move forward, we can remove the water fountain, we can remove the estimated roughly $3,000 in yearly outside costs to maintain the fountains, and move forward with a memorial that is what the mayor deems worthy, but on a smaller scale, and also be able to accomplish some of the many other needs we have in our community, Mr. President.

2145
02:34:24,772 --> 02:34:26,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I would offer, Mr. President,

2146
02:34:27,351 --> 02:34:40,980
[SPEAKER_02]: $250,000, if the administration agrees upon it, be removed, the project be lowered by $250,000 with the removal of the fountains, and that money be repurposed back into the needs of the community, Mr. President.

2147
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:41,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

2148
02:34:41,221 --> 02:34:41,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Dillon.

2149
02:34:41,501 --> 02:34:49,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, first of all, let me clarify for the record that the $250,000 that was part of the wind contract is in addition to the $1 million.

2150
02:34:50,127 --> 02:34:55,170
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not part of that, so it does not affect the $1 million and the purposes for which that will be given to the city.

2151
02:34:56,130 --> 02:34:57,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Second of all, this project- Point of information, Mr. President.

2152
02:34:58,412 --> 02:34:59,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Counselor.

2153
02:34:59,532 --> 02:35:05,136
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, last week, I think it was Counselor Caviello that asked the question, and we got a different answer last week, so that's fine.

2154
02:35:05,176 --> 02:35:06,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like me to bring the city solicitor up?

2155
02:35:06,977 --> 02:35:09,079
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the one who executed the contract with the mayor.

2156
02:35:09,099 --> 02:35:10,320
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I'm going to ask him to come up.

2157
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask him to come up.

2158
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:14,222
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just telling you that- Let's clarify the record.

2159
02:35:14,242 --> 02:35:17,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that that was a misspoken sentence.

2160
02:35:17,464 --> 02:35:18,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been.

2161
02:35:18,285 --> 02:35:18,645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

2162
02:35:18,665 --> 02:35:19,306
[SPEAKER_03]: We all misspeak.

2163
02:35:19,346 --> 02:35:19,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

2164
02:35:19,646 --> 02:35:20,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he gave the answer, so.

2165
02:35:20,947 --> 02:35:24,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave the answer, and I said that the contract that we have with Wynn

2166
02:35:24,639 --> 02:35:28,180
[SPEAKER_03]: was the place where that $250,000 was dedicated.

2167
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:30,861
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't say that it was part of the million dollars.

2168
02:35:31,501 --> 02:35:32,141
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.

2169
02:35:32,181 --> 02:35:33,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can look at the tape.

2170
02:35:33,141 --> 02:35:34,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so, but that's all right.

2171
02:35:35,082 --> 02:35:49,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's be clear then, for once for all, for the entire citizenry, the $250,000 which is being paid by through that contract is not part of the $1 million per year, which would be coming to the city from the casino.

2172
02:35:50,086 --> 02:35:51,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mr. President, then,

2173
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:59,589
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, whether it's a million or a million, 250,000, the fact of the matter is that money could be used for any purpose in the community.

2174
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:01,091
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may address that, please.

2175
02:36:01,111 --> 02:36:01,992
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe I had the floor.

2176
02:36:03,854 --> 02:36:04,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2177
02:36:04,791 --> 02:36:08,793
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as I was continuing to say on that, is that, no, actually, that's not correct.

2178
02:36:08,873 --> 02:36:10,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we've gone over this before.

2179
02:36:10,434 --> 02:36:12,895
[SPEAKER_12]: The money here is allocated for a specific purpose.

2180
02:36:13,255 --> 02:36:15,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Each of the park grants are allocated for this project.

2181
02:36:15,877 --> 02:36:18,538
[SPEAKER_12]: The Cummings Foundation is allocated for this project.

2182
02:36:18,898 --> 02:36:21,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, isn't the wind pressure what's allocated for this project?

2183
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:23,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, just a point of information, Mr. President.

2184
02:36:23,821 --> 02:36:24,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2185
02:36:24,982 --> 02:36:27,803
[SPEAKER_02]: No one said this money wasn't allocated for a particular purpose.

2186
02:36:27,963 --> 02:36:31,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you applied for a grant for this particular purpose.

2187
02:36:31,798 --> 02:36:38,464
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm saying is, you could have applied for the PAC grant to improve renovations to other existing PACs.

2188
02:36:38,624 --> 02:36:39,224
[SPEAKER_02]: We did apply.

2189
02:36:39,244 --> 02:36:39,825
[SPEAKER_02]: We have received.

2190
02:36:39,885 --> 02:36:40,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you did.

2191
02:36:40,405 --> 02:36:40,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you did.

2192
02:36:40,846 --> 02:36:43,408
[SPEAKER_12]: And the state is the one who allocated this funding for this park.

2193
02:36:43,448 --> 02:36:44,989
[SPEAKER_12]: They wanted to give it to this park.

2194
02:36:45,109 --> 02:36:53,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm saying is, with the $250,000, the mayor could have went and said, I want to spend it on X, Y, and Z. He opted to spend it on the Peace Guard.

2195
02:36:54,017 --> 02:36:55,038
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his prerogative.

2196
02:36:55,558 --> 02:36:57,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want people to believe that

2197
02:36:58,079 --> 02:37:02,862
[SPEAKER_02]: When resorts came to the mayor and said, we're only giving you $250 for the Peace Gardener, you get nothing.

2198
02:37:03,222 --> 02:37:04,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the case.

2199
02:37:04,543 --> 02:37:05,423
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the case.

2200
02:37:05,744 --> 02:37:15,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the paper before you is to approve a funding package for a grant that has been designed, is going ahead in construction, and will not be able to go ahead without full funding.

2201
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:22,273
[SPEAKER_12]: It is contingent on federal earmarks, state earmarks, and park grant that requires the entire project to be funded.

2202
02:37:22,494 --> 02:37:23,434
[SPEAKER_12]: The paper's before you.

2203
02:37:23,734 --> 02:37:26,036
[SPEAKER_12]: This grant agreement must be executed by December 31st.

2204
02:37:26,949 --> 02:37:32,512
[SPEAKER_12]: This paper and approval has to be in to the state by that date in order for the city to receive those funds.

2205
02:37:33,053 --> 02:37:34,713
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not, they will lose those funds.

2206
02:37:35,694 --> 02:37:37,695
[SPEAKER_12]: I've spoken about this project as much as I can.

2207
02:37:37,775 --> 02:37:42,818
[SPEAKER_12]: If the council wants to be, you know, object to this particular project, that's his prerogative to do so.

2208
02:37:43,158 --> 02:37:48,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm asking the rest of the councils to please support this application and move it forward the way that it is and the amount that it's funded.

2209
02:37:49,002 --> 02:37:49,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2210
02:37:49,202 --> 02:37:49,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President?

2211
02:37:50,082 --> 02:37:52,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lungo-Kern and then Councilor De La Rucia.

2212
02:37:53,721 --> 02:37:54,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Camuso.

2213
02:37:54,762 --> 02:37:59,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I was actually going to go on the same lines as Councilor Marks with regards to just the fountain.

2214
02:37:59,685 --> 02:38:02,946
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this project is going to be beautiful.

2215
02:38:03,066 --> 02:38:11,411
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the Office of Community Development has worked tremendously hard on it, but I do also feel that $1.3 million is excessive.

2216
02:38:11,932 --> 02:38:14,553
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not to say these victims don't deserve it.

2217
02:38:15,113 --> 02:38:18,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's to say they don't deserve something that's worth $2, $3, $4 million?

2218
02:38:18,275 --> 02:38:21,257
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think we really need to

2219
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:31,264
[SPEAKER_17]: scale back on the project to a point, I think that fountain is going to cause a lot of expense in the years to come.

2220
02:38:31,784 --> 02:38:36,266
[SPEAKER_17]: It's $250,000, I thought it was $257,000 just to build the fountain.

2221
02:38:37,286 --> 02:38:44,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Never mind the sole cost of the maintenance plan, which we did receive a memorandum on the maintenance.

2222
02:38:45,030 --> 02:38:47,811
[SPEAKER_17]: The majority of the maintenance is going to come with the fountain.

2223
02:38:50,089 --> 02:38:51,369
[SPEAKER_17]: The fountain's going to break eventually.

2224
02:38:51,409 --> 02:38:52,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Pieces are going to break.

2225
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:57,771
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to cost the city a great deal of money, $5, $10, every year.

2226
02:38:57,791 --> 02:39:07,134
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's one thing that maybe I would like to move Councilor Marks's paper first and reduce this project by possibly a fountain.

2227
02:39:07,743 --> 02:39:10,605
[SPEAKER_12]: May I respond to Councilor Lungelkorn's comments?

2228
02:39:12,227 --> 02:39:15,609
[SPEAKER_12]: You are right that fountains require more maintenance in a piece of open space.

2229
02:39:15,729 --> 02:39:27,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I will tell you we did have a meeting with several of the departments, Board of Health, DPW, and Water Department, and others, and Pam Kelly from the Council on Aging.

2230
02:39:27,639 --> 02:39:35,785
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will say that everybody who sat around that table, and I know we're not going to be here indefinitely ourselves, but everybody who sat around that table wanted

2231
02:39:36,188 --> 02:39:41,290
[SPEAKER_12]: to participate and have all spoken in support to maintain this to the best of their ability to do so.

2232
02:39:41,790 --> 02:39:46,732
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor has been working diligently to acquire funds to fund a maintenance account.

2233
02:39:47,232 --> 02:39:48,172
[SPEAKER_12]: He's committed to that.

2234
02:39:48,812 --> 02:39:50,353
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand the concerns that you have.

2235
02:39:50,653 --> 02:39:53,754
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a simply run water spray fountain.

2236
02:39:53,774 --> 02:39:54,795
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't go very high.

2237
02:39:54,815 --> 02:39:55,775
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a few feet high.

2238
02:39:56,383 --> 02:39:58,384
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a great enclosure over it.

2239
02:39:58,604 --> 02:40:00,305
[SPEAKER_12]: There will not be any walking in it.

2240
02:40:00,365 --> 02:40:07,309
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a technical pool where people have to have the water quality in order that they are going to drink it.

2241
02:40:07,369 --> 02:40:10,251
[SPEAKER_12]: But it also has to be clean and meet public safety standards.

2242
02:40:10,531 --> 02:40:12,692
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is some maintenance that is revolved around that.

2243
02:40:13,052 --> 02:40:16,014
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be operational for the season.

2244
02:40:16,034 --> 02:40:17,855
[SPEAKER_12]: It will not be operational in the wintertime.

2245
02:40:18,335 --> 02:40:23,558
[SPEAKER_12]: But other communities do have spray pools as part of projects.

2246
02:40:23,638 --> 02:40:24,759
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are maintained.

2247
02:40:25,332 --> 02:40:30,377
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said, we had a meeting, and the people who work for you are committed to taking care of it.

2248
02:40:30,397 --> 02:40:32,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2249
02:40:32,619 --> 02:40:34,881
[SPEAKER_17]: If I may ask, when would the grand opening to this be?

2250
02:40:35,861 --> 02:40:36,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first, let's go to bid.

2251
02:40:36,822 --> 02:40:40,886
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the other comment that I want to make, is that those costs that we have are estimates.

2252
02:40:40,906 --> 02:40:44,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, the construction costs will come in, and it may be much better than what we have as an estimate.

2253
02:40:45,129 --> 02:40:49,113
[SPEAKER_12]: But we have to estimate to make sure that the project can be awarded as it goes ahead.

2254
02:40:51,669 --> 02:40:58,574
[SPEAKER_12]: If we do all the things that we're supposed to do, the state is going to put this project out to bid, and bids should be hopefully received by April.

2255
02:40:59,074 --> 02:41:02,136
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll begin construction around May, June.

2256
02:41:02,536 --> 02:41:14,124
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the time frame that we're working toward, and that's one of the reasons why we have these time frames where we have specific actions that need to be taken so that we can move it forward and get into this next construction season.

2257
02:41:14,944 --> 02:41:17,826
[SPEAKER_17]: So it should be complete September, October?

2258
02:41:17,886 --> 02:41:18,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, September, October.

2259
02:41:23,311 --> 02:41:23,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor?

2260
02:41:23,831 --> 02:41:24,532
[SPEAKER_17]: For now, thank you.

2261
02:41:26,333 --> 02:41:33,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'm somewhat surprised at some of the remarks and concerns I'm having tonight, but that's fine.

2262
02:41:35,518 --> 02:41:47,005
[SPEAKER_11]: This commemorates the victims of a heinous terrorist attack that happened within arm's reach of our community.

2263
02:41:47,706 --> 02:41:52,989
[SPEAKER_11]: It memorializes a citizen of Medford who was an innocent victim

2264
02:41:53,563 --> 02:42:08,253
[SPEAKER_11]: of that dastardly terrorist attack, the first such attack to succeed by hideous terrorists in the United States since September of 11th.

2265
02:42:10,275 --> 02:42:14,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford has a moral obligation to go along with this project.

2266
02:42:17,059 --> 02:42:22,023
[SPEAKER_11]: The eyes of not just the city, the state, but the nation look upon this.

2267
02:42:22,734 --> 02:42:28,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've received the encouragement of state officials to proceed with this.

2268
02:42:29,638 --> 02:42:30,999
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very significant.

2269
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:49,891
[SPEAKER_11]: And I failed to see how people who were around and lived in this region in the aftermath of that attack can want to diminish something like this.

2270
02:42:50,905 --> 02:42:51,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

2271
02:42:51,945 --> 02:42:52,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Penta.

2272
02:42:54,086 --> 02:43:00,068
[SPEAKER_05]: The moral obligation that we have as a community is to recognize every single person, however they die, dastardly or not.

2273
02:43:00,508 --> 02:43:09,830
[SPEAKER_05]: We have many, many veterans that have died and they have never received this type of a recognition and they will probably die in the future defending our country, defending another person's land.

2274
02:43:11,331 --> 02:43:12,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Counselor Knight.

2275
02:43:13,275 --> 02:43:15,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Crystal Campbell was a regular citizen.

2276
02:43:15,336 --> 02:43:16,396
[SPEAKER_13]: She wasn't a veteran.

2277
02:43:16,436 --> 02:43:18,137
[SPEAKER_13]: She wasn't a member of our armed services.

2278
02:43:18,217 --> 02:43:21,438
[SPEAKER_13]: She wasn't a military soldier in a foreign land.

2279
02:43:22,018 --> 02:43:31,042
[SPEAKER_13]: She was an individual who went to go watch the Boston Marathon, which is one of our most historic events that we have here in the city of Medford, and she was tragically murdered by terrorists.

2280
02:43:31,862 --> 02:43:32,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your point.

2281
02:43:32,822 --> 02:43:34,743
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about moral obligations in this

2282
02:43:35,432 --> 02:43:37,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Knight, you can have yours, I have mine.

2283
02:43:37,452 --> 02:43:48,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel that my moral obligation is to make sure that every single person, however they die in this, whether they lived in Medford or not, or whether they worked in Medford, however they died, they receive like and type recognition.

2284
02:43:49,335 --> 02:43:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, Councilor De La Rosa, you're amazed.

2285
02:43:51,835 --> 02:43:52,696
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you be amazed?

2286
02:43:53,196 --> 02:43:54,976
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your opinion, other people have their opinion.

2287
02:43:55,296 --> 02:43:57,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they don't see it the same way as you.

2288
02:43:57,637 --> 02:44:00,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the water fountain is something that we really don't need.

2289
02:44:01,017 --> 02:44:01,798
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for $250,000, you know,

2290
02:44:05,277 --> 02:44:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still getting the park, you're still getting the ballads, you're still getting the recognition for not only the members that ran and Crystal Campbell and all of those.

2291
02:44:14,001 --> 02:44:14,641
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing that.

2292
02:44:15,361 --> 02:44:28,066
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, it's kind of like interesting how the mayor can just go around and take a picture, and you were in the picture, we've had this conversation, for whatever the reason is, and presupposes the city council's gonna vote for this back in October.

2293
02:44:28,426 --> 02:44:31,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Pictures in the local newspaper, standing there with the big check for $299,000.

2294
02:44:33,684 --> 02:44:37,627
[SPEAKER_05]: We never even discussed this for a vote, never mind whether we wanted to do it or we didn't want to do it.

2295
02:44:38,167 --> 02:44:39,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about the money used for PACs.

2296
02:44:40,229 --> 02:44:42,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Most recently, I don't know how a guy does this.

2297
02:44:43,351 --> 02:44:48,436
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to a, I believe, a Schreyer Auditorium meeting most recently.

2298
02:44:48,656 --> 02:44:56,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, the mayor went to the Schreyer Auditorium and he committed $5,000 to them to celebrate their anniversary that's coming up.

2299
02:44:57,235 --> 02:44:58,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was the vote on the council on that?

2300
02:44:58,616 --> 02:44:59,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2301
02:44:59,816 --> 02:45:00,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

2302
02:45:01,157 --> 02:45:07,440
[SPEAKER_11]: So am I to understand that these people are going to be re-victimized because of someone's dislike of the mayor?

2303
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:09,842
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that have to do with dislikes of the air?

2304
02:45:10,002 --> 02:45:13,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a financial obligation in this community to make sure how the money is spent.

2305
02:45:14,346 --> 02:45:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the man to go and make a commitment, whether it be $5,000 or $299,000 on behalf of this council, is wrong.

2306
02:45:20,853 --> 02:45:21,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely wrong.

2307
02:45:22,255 --> 02:45:24,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unnecessary, and it's wrong.

2308
02:45:24,978 --> 02:45:28,661
[SPEAKER_05]: If any one of the members of this council went ahead and did that, you know where we'd be right now?

2309
02:45:28,721 --> 02:45:30,103
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd be brought up on charges.

2310
02:45:30,769 --> 02:45:31,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way we'd be.

2311
02:45:31,709 --> 02:45:34,150
[SPEAKER_12]: You're speaking about a check ceremony that's at the state.

2312
02:45:34,170 --> 02:45:36,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a symbolic ceremony for the state.

2313
02:45:36,391 --> 02:45:38,852
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have known about it, Lauren, but none of us knew about it.

2314
02:45:39,172 --> 02:45:40,972
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a symbolic gesture.

2315
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:42,193
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a cardboard check.

2316
02:45:42,293 --> 02:45:43,813
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a picture-taking opportunity.

2317
02:45:43,853 --> 02:45:46,474
[SPEAKER_12]: The state wants to fund this project.

2318
02:45:46,714 --> 02:45:48,195
[SPEAKER_12]: They also believe in this project.

2319
02:45:48,215 --> 02:45:51,696
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to fund it, but this hasn't been discussed over here to find out what's going on.

2320
02:45:52,856 --> 02:45:54,377
[SPEAKER_12]: The money's not going someplace else.

2321
02:45:54,397 --> 02:45:55,957
[SPEAKER_12]: The money is to this project from the state.

2322
02:45:56,137 --> 02:45:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councillor Marks.

2323
02:45:58,357 --> 02:46:15,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, the picture that was taken back on October 27th of this year was with the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and this was submitted to the paper as a press release from the mayor's office.

2324
02:46:16,242 --> 02:46:18,323
[SPEAKER_02]: The paper didn't write an article about it.

2325
02:46:18,703 --> 02:46:23,264
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor submitted a press release stating Mayor McGlynn was pleased to accept $299,000 in grant funding.

2326
02:46:25,918 --> 02:46:27,861
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a cardboard check.

2327
02:46:27,981 --> 02:46:29,302
[SPEAKER_12]: It cannot be deposited.

2328
02:46:29,362 --> 02:46:35,931
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a symbolic gesture dependent on the execution of a grant agreement, which is before you tonight.

2329
02:46:36,051 --> 02:46:44,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, so the mayor wanted to come out in front of the issue and accept a check that wasn't approved by the grant

2330
02:46:45,373 --> 02:46:48,894
[SPEAKER_02]: by the grant states approved by the city council.

2331
02:46:49,195 --> 02:46:51,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the city council saying we want to approve this.

2332
02:46:51,575 --> 02:46:55,677
[SPEAKER_02]: The grant is saying you can't accept funding until the city council approves it.

2333
02:46:56,097 --> 02:47:03,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're almost near Christmas, and we're being asked to vote on the grant that the mayor accepted, offered a press release.

2334
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:07,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Mr. President, just if I could, Mr. President,

2335
02:47:09,282 --> 02:47:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the mayor started working on this in April of 2013.

2336
02:47:12,563 --> 02:47:28,046
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked 11 months with him and whoever else in his office, didn't make any mention to anyone that he was moving forward on a project this size, didn't make any mention that he was trying to memorialize the victims of the bombing.

2337
02:47:28,706 --> 02:47:35,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And in April of 2014, came out right around there, came out with his plan.

2338
02:47:36,508 --> 02:47:40,071
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a memorial across the street and the funding and so forth.

2339
02:47:40,451 --> 02:47:45,515
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time he mentioned he didn't let this out because he didn't have the funding yet.

2340
02:47:46,055 --> 02:47:48,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was looking, scurrying around to find money.

2341
02:47:49,037 --> 02:47:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to Wynn Resort, old faithful.

2342
02:47:52,680 --> 02:47:55,262
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that the city has an agreement with them.

2343
02:47:55,855 --> 02:47:58,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And he asked them for money for this memorial.

2344
02:47:59,118 --> 02:48:01,060
[SPEAKER_02]: He started looking for grant funding.

2345
02:48:01,401 --> 02:48:03,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was successful in finding it.

2346
02:48:03,363 --> 02:48:04,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I give him credit for that.

2347
02:48:04,964 --> 02:48:09,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean that I'm on board because the mayor did all this work behind the scenes.

2348
02:48:10,069 --> 02:48:12,552
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean he's just going to get my buy-in.

2349
02:48:12,572 --> 02:48:17,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to have a memorial for the woman that was struck a couple of weeks ago on Winthrop Street?

2350
02:48:18,574 --> 02:48:20,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we start talking about tragedies though?

2351
02:48:20,235 --> 02:48:20,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, no.

2352
02:48:21,055 --> 02:48:24,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mentioned about tragedies and how we want to recognize one of our own.

2353
02:48:24,737 --> 02:48:28,819
[SPEAKER_02]: There are countless residents in this community that are struck and killed on our roads.

2354
02:48:29,399 --> 02:48:35,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I hear an outcry of creating memorials throughout the community for residents that are killed on our streets?

2355
02:48:36,823 --> 02:48:42,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, Mr. President, and no one's trying to belittle this or make this less of anything.

2356
02:48:42,668 --> 02:48:52,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And how dare people accuse other people of not being of higher authority or great morals because they don't support what the mayor put forward.

2357
02:48:52,736 --> 02:48:53,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a smokescreen.

2358
02:48:54,497 --> 02:48:58,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those people want to come out with their money, let them put their money where their mouth is.

2359
02:48:58,481 --> 02:49:03,885
[SPEAKER_02]: These business owners in the community, let them put their money where their mouth is and make large donations.

2360
02:49:05,146 --> 02:49:06,807
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're that concerned, Mr. President.

2361
02:49:07,188 --> 02:49:08,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk is cheap, Mr. President.

2362
02:49:10,934 --> 02:49:13,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor, you're factually incorrect.

2363
02:49:13,316 --> 02:49:15,098
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor has presented this plan before.

2364
02:49:15,138 --> 02:49:16,199
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a press conference.

2365
02:49:16,239 --> 02:49:18,841
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been in the local newspaper.

2366
02:49:18,901 --> 02:49:20,863
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not a mystery about this project.

2367
02:49:20,883 --> 02:49:21,704
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been discussed.

2368
02:49:23,986 --> 02:49:26,969
[SPEAKER_12]: It has not been a secret for one year.

2369
02:49:26,989 --> 02:49:32,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But Lauren, with all fairness to everybody, he may have had his press, but this has never been presented until last week.

2370
02:49:33,995 --> 02:49:37,116
[SPEAKER_05]: But the council never took a vote on it, whether they forwarded it or against it.

2371
02:49:37,137 --> 02:49:39,558
[SPEAKER_12]: He may not have taken a vote, but it's been publicly presented.

2372
02:49:39,598 --> 02:49:43,159
[SPEAKER_05]: He's talked to several members of this council, including myself on this particular matter.

2373
02:49:43,179 --> 02:49:44,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe he talked to you, but he didn't talk to me.

2374
02:49:45,220 --> 02:49:46,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, pick up the phone, and I'm sure you will.

2375
02:49:46,581 --> 02:49:47,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should I have to pick up the phone?

2376
02:49:47,862 --> 02:49:49,342
[SPEAKER_05]: This is his project, not mine.

2377
02:49:49,622 --> 02:49:50,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm proud to be part of it.

2378
02:49:50,903 --> 02:49:51,683
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I can say.

2379
02:49:52,224 --> 02:49:54,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get back to the issue.

2380
02:49:54,405 --> 02:49:54,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

2381
02:49:54,705 --> 02:49:55,625
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a point of information.

2382
02:49:55,645 --> 02:49:56,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.

2383
02:49:56,225 --> 02:49:56,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking.

2384
02:49:56,786 --> 02:49:57,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Get back to the issue now.

2385
02:49:57,746 --> 02:49:58,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2386
02:50:00,188 --> 02:50:01,889
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm asking for your support on this proposal.

2387
02:50:01,909 --> 02:50:06,673
[SPEAKER_12]: We could debate these opinions all night long.

2388
02:50:06,814 --> 02:50:08,095
[SPEAKER_12]: The project is the project.

2389
02:50:08,435 --> 02:50:10,296
[SPEAKER_12]: The project is designed with a fountain in it.

2390
02:50:10,737 --> 02:50:18,043
[SPEAKER_12]: In order to reduce the project budget requires a redesign, requires the agencies to agree to a redesign, and I don't think that's going to happen.

2391
02:50:18,643 --> 02:50:20,365
[SPEAKER_12]: So the project is before you.

2392
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:26,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, point of, no, no, go with your clarification.

2393
02:50:26,902 --> 02:50:29,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you say, you're asking us for a vote.

2394
02:50:29,703 --> 02:50:30,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

2395
02:50:30,283 --> 02:50:33,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the vote is $250,000 less than what this is.

2396
02:50:33,584 --> 02:50:34,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you the project won't go ahead.

2397
02:50:34,845 --> 02:50:36,806
[SPEAKER_12]: The project is not fully funded as it's designed.

2398
02:50:36,906 --> 02:50:41,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if the mayor says this is part of, this is not part of the million dollars, this is an,

2399
02:50:41,948 --> 02:50:44,168
[SPEAKER_05]: an excess of it, then let them go to win to get the other $250,000.

2400
02:50:44,709 --> 02:50:48,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All we're saying is, all I'm saying is- Why would you do that?

2401
02:50:48,029 --> 02:50:50,230
[SPEAKER_12]: You already have another million dollars.

2402
02:50:50,270 --> 02:50:51,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor, you made your point of clarification.

2403
02:50:52,070 --> 02:50:57,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I will vote for the park grant, but I'm not going to vote for the $250,000 because of other issues.

2404
02:50:57,531 --> 02:51:01,552
[SPEAKER_05]: You can place that pocket that's in desperate, desperate need of upgrading.

2405
02:51:01,772 --> 02:51:03,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And nothing, there's not a dime going over there.

2406
02:51:03,232 --> 02:51:04,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Your point of clarification.

2407
02:51:04,292 --> 02:51:05,692
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my point of clarification.

2408
02:51:05,732 --> 02:51:05,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

2409
02:51:06,072 --> 02:51:09,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm trying to give you as much leeway as I can, but Councillor Knight has been patiently waiting.

2410
02:51:10,820 --> 02:51:12,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2411
02:51:12,961 --> 02:51:19,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Lauren, it's my understanding that the PAC grant application process is almost backwards, where you have to have an actual project in place, and this is what it is.

2412
02:51:19,542 --> 02:51:19,702
[SPEAKER_12]: It does.

2413
02:51:19,722 --> 02:51:20,462
[SPEAKER_12]: This has happened before.

2414
02:51:20,522 --> 02:51:24,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually, Clota, from my office, is the person who's represented the applications before you.

2415
02:51:25,423 --> 02:51:26,823
[SPEAKER_12]: They submit the application.

2416
02:51:26,863 --> 02:51:28,264
[SPEAKER_12]: They tell you where they're going to get funded.

2417
02:51:28,344 --> 02:51:31,404
[SPEAKER_12]: They did do that ceremony with the picture-taking and the checks.

2418
02:51:31,724 --> 02:51:34,285
[SPEAKER_12]: There were other communities that were there in addition to the city of Medford.

2419
02:51:35,165 --> 02:51:39,546
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they require you to submit the documentation, which includes a grant agreement,

2420
02:51:39,933 --> 02:51:44,417
[SPEAKER_12]: and the approval from the city council authorizing the full funding of that portion of the project.

2421
02:51:44,797 --> 02:51:46,019
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what's before you tonight.

2422
02:51:46,979 --> 02:51:47,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2423
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:50,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I stated it last week, and I'll state it again.

2424
02:51:50,583 --> 02:51:51,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a good project.

2425
02:51:51,784 --> 02:51:53,285
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a project that I'm going to support.

2426
02:51:53,926 --> 02:51:55,627
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel as though it's going to be a draw to the square.

2427
02:51:55,667 --> 02:51:59,971
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to give people a reason to come down to Medford Square and frequent our local businesses.

2428
02:52:00,572 --> 02:52:06,237
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also going to provide the residents of the two housing authority buildings, the two affordable housing

2429
02:52:06,910 --> 02:52:08,972
[SPEAKER_13]: buildings there, a nice place to respite.

2430
02:52:09,032 --> 02:52:10,514
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to revitalize our waterfront.

2431
02:52:10,534 --> 02:52:13,236
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to provide us with access to our waterfront for once.

2432
02:52:13,276 --> 02:52:19,122
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've heard the council talk time and time again about one of our most underutilized assets here in the city of Medford being the waterfront.

2433
02:52:19,543 --> 02:52:19,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we are.

2434
02:52:19,963 --> 02:52:23,607
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in a process right now of opening up an opportunity to utilize our waterfront.

2435
02:52:24,365 --> 02:52:27,948
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also looking at the plan and the improvements that the plan is going to bring.

2436
02:52:27,988 --> 02:52:34,173
[SPEAKER_13]: The plan is going to help improve ADA compliance at the senior center and ADA compliance at certain egresses.

2437
02:52:35,074 --> 02:52:37,856
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also going to allow for multimodal transportation, Mr. President.

2438
02:52:37,876 --> 02:52:39,237
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to open it up to a bikeway.

2439
02:52:39,837 --> 02:52:41,819
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I really think it's a great project.

2440
02:52:41,899 --> 02:52:44,000
[SPEAKER_13]: It beautifies an existing location.

2441
02:52:44,581 --> 02:52:48,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And more than that, I think that it's going to be a project of national significance.

2442
02:52:49,024 --> 02:52:53,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if we're in a position right now to do a project of national significance, that we need to do it the right way.

2443
02:52:54,392 --> 02:52:57,093
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to wholeheartedly support this paper as filed, Mr. President.

2444
02:52:57,773 --> 02:52:58,954
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion for approval.

2445
02:52:59,114 --> 02:53:08,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a second motion from Councilor Marks to deduct $250,000 from the petition that's before us for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

2446
02:53:09,318 --> 02:53:11,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the funding from Wynn Resorts.

2447
02:53:12,299 --> 02:53:13,840
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to call that vote first.

2448
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:17,761
[SPEAKER_08]: A yes vote is to eliminate the fountains.

2449
02:53:19,242 --> 02:53:21,563
[SPEAKER_08]: A yes vote will be to eliminate the fountains

2450
02:53:23,349 --> 02:53:26,631
[SPEAKER_08]: and the $250,000 for the Crystal Campbell Memorial Peace Garden.

2451
02:53:26,992 --> 02:53:30,875
[SPEAKER_08]: A no vote will then bring the final vote back to this council.

2452
02:53:31,595 --> 02:53:34,878
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is on Councilor Marks' first paper.

2453
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:39,482
[SPEAKER_08]: A yes vote is to eliminate the fountain.

2454
02:53:42,504 --> 02:53:43,245
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

2455
02:53:43,265 --> 02:53:44,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

2456
02:53:44,946 --> 02:53:46,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call has been requested by Councilor Penta.

2457
02:53:49,650 --> 02:53:50,551
[SPEAKER_08]: The clerk will call the roll.

2458
02:53:51,031 --> 02:53:51,512
[SPEAKER_15]: First person.

2459
02:54:04,864 --> 02:54:05,064
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2460
02:54:05,124 --> 02:54:09,567
[SPEAKER_08]: By a vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

2461
02:54:09,987 --> 02:54:21,775
[SPEAKER_08]: We now have the paper before us to fund the crystal Campbell memorial peace garden as presented by the mayor without cutting out the fountains at this site.

2462
02:54:22,848 --> 02:54:25,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And roll call has been requested, Councilor Penta.

2463
02:54:27,389 --> 02:54:28,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you want to speak?

2464
02:54:29,850 --> 02:54:30,630
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to speak or you want?

2465
02:54:31,730 --> 02:54:34,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2466
02:54:34,831 --> 02:54:46,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not afraid of making a no vote on this particular matter tonight because I'm just, I don't know when it's going to stop in this community, but I am never going to have my vote be presupposed by the mayor of this community on anything.

2467
02:54:46,794 --> 02:54:50,075
[SPEAKER_05]: He's presupposed this council on linkage on this particular matter.

2468
02:54:50,496 --> 02:54:56,945
[SPEAKER_05]: He has presupposed this council on taking money from free cash without offering us any opportunity of our input.

2469
02:54:57,466 --> 02:55:03,053
[SPEAKER_05]: He has taken money by raising water and sewer rates, again, without no input from this council.

2470
02:55:04,035 --> 02:55:06,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We have so many issues within this community.

2471
02:55:06,930 --> 02:55:18,474
[SPEAKER_05]: that need to be looked at that have really presented itself with some taxpayer concerns, whether it's the new parking meters or whatever it might be, the buildings.

2472
02:55:18,974 --> 02:55:21,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Our own building right here, it could collapse at any day.

2473
02:55:21,495 --> 02:55:22,655
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even know if it's going to happen.

2474
02:55:23,115 --> 02:55:26,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Well over a year old, not taking care of your own house that you live in.

2475
02:55:26,556 --> 02:55:28,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I just can't see it.

2476
02:55:28,637 --> 02:55:30,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the Campbell family is looking,

2477
02:55:31,978 --> 02:55:36,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize if you think that this is a vote against your daughter, but it is not a vote against your daughter.

2478
02:55:37,221 --> 02:55:40,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the fiscal and the financial responsibility that I have before here.

2479
02:55:41,003 --> 02:55:44,225
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said to you before, I've got no problem in cutting this in half.

2480
02:55:44,285 --> 02:55:52,931
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said last week, I think there's a leftover $500,000, and you could build a beautiful memorial over there.

2481
02:55:53,371 --> 02:55:55,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, this is just another

2482
02:55:55,804 --> 02:56:03,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge event that the mayor is going to pull off, and it's just another place where he's going to put his stone there with his name here, Michael McGlynn, and memory of, and this and that.

2483
02:56:03,749 --> 02:56:05,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's great, if that's what he needs.

2484
02:56:05,410 --> 02:56:06,771
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's what he needs to survive.

2485
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:08,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need that to survive.

2486
02:56:08,131 --> 02:56:12,574
[SPEAKER_11]: All I need, all I need is to know that I'm- I'm a little confused.

2487
02:56:12,694 --> 02:56:17,237
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not about fiscal responsibility.

2488
02:56:17,277 --> 02:56:18,978
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about you being mad at the mayor.

2489
02:56:21,489 --> 02:56:27,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you keep saying that the mayor, the mayor, the mayor, he's forever in this room.

2490
02:56:28,617 --> 02:56:32,642
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't even come to these meetings, and you bring him into this room constantly.

2491
02:56:33,263 --> 02:56:34,584
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't understand.

2492
02:56:34,685 --> 02:56:35,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is this?

2493
02:56:36,987 --> 02:56:38,629
[SPEAKER_11]: With the words that come out of your mouth,

2494
02:56:39,890 --> 02:56:42,111
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see fiscal responsibility.

2495
02:56:42,131 --> 02:56:44,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear— Let me turn that on.

2496
02:56:44,593 --> 02:56:44,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2497
02:57:05,424 --> 02:57:06,885
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done their patriotic duty.

2498
02:57:07,225 --> 02:57:09,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look in front of Meffitt High School.

2499
02:57:09,605 --> 02:57:13,066
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a plaque over there that hasn't seen an ounce of restoration.

2500
02:57:13,867 --> 02:57:14,847
[SPEAKER_05]: An ounce of restoration.

2501
02:57:15,007 --> 02:57:22,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all the names of the people on there from World War II that have died, that have never seen their names restored, that gave the ultimate sacrifice.

2502
02:57:23,490 --> 02:57:25,530
[SPEAKER_05]: This girl unfortunately died.

2503
02:57:25,851 --> 02:57:29,572
[SPEAKER_05]: She was murdered by a terrorist, and I hope he gets his due when he goes.

2504
02:57:30,437 --> 02:57:41,222
[SPEAKER_05]: but to spend a million three at this point in time, at that particular location with that kind of money, knowing, knowing that 250,000 of that could be used for anything else in this community.

2505
02:57:41,442 --> 02:57:44,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just, I listen, I understand where you're coming from.

2506
02:57:44,343 --> 02:57:46,904
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a financial decision to you at this point.

2507
02:57:47,144 --> 02:57:48,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everyone made their points.

2508
02:57:49,394 --> 02:57:55,477
[SPEAKER_08]: In the interest of holiday spirit and this isn't tragic, I'm just trying to do right by the body and take a vote to move forward.

2509
02:57:55,617 --> 02:57:56,257
[SPEAKER_05]: One last thing.

2510
02:57:56,557 --> 02:57:59,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Lauren, we went to the meeting and the mayor said the phone was coming off the hook.

2511
02:57:59,398 --> 02:58:00,178
[SPEAKER_05]: The phone was ringing.

2512
02:58:00,439 --> 02:58:05,221
[SPEAKER_05]: He only got $4,375 in miscellaneous contributions.

2513
02:58:05,881 --> 02:58:07,802
[SPEAKER_05]: $250,000 he took from when?

2514
02:58:08,162 --> 02:58:12,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other outside contribution was from Cummings, $100,000 that he earmarked.

2515
02:58:13,004 --> 02:58:15,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So where is all this money that the phone was ringing off the hook?

2516
02:58:15,765 --> 02:58:18,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I have to say, to be fair, counselor,

2517
02:58:19,938 --> 02:58:25,304
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor has done all of this to receive all of this money.

2518
02:58:25,784 --> 02:58:28,347
[SPEAKER_12]: He has personally gone and spoken to people.

2519
02:58:28,727 --> 02:58:29,688
[SPEAKER_12]: He has asked.

2520
02:58:29,848 --> 02:58:30,669
[SPEAKER_12]: He has solicited.

2521
02:58:30,689 --> 02:58:37,436
[SPEAKER_12]: There are business people in the community that we've talked about before, representatives of unions, who want to do some volunteer work over there.

2522
02:58:39,614 --> 02:58:48,141
[SPEAKER_12]: made it his mission to go forth and collect this money and present it to you without having to go into your general fund or anything else like that.

2523
02:58:48,461 --> 02:58:52,565
[SPEAKER_12]: So you may believe that this number should be whatever it is.

2524
02:58:53,547 --> 02:58:58,009
[SPEAKER_12]: But he, personally, has done this work to get this money before you.

2525
02:58:58,250 --> 02:59:01,471
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't really think that it's fair to say he hasn't.

2526
02:59:01,491 --> 02:59:02,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So he got the $4,375.

2527
02:59:02,252 --> 02:59:04,513
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he would have gotten?

2528
02:59:05,073 --> 02:59:11,097
[SPEAKER_12]: The Cummings Grant Foundation would not have happened without the mayor asking for that.

2529
02:59:11,117 --> 02:59:15,299
[SPEAKER_05]: When did the mayor ever come before the council and say, listen, I'd like to do this in memory of Christine Campbell.

2530
02:59:15,519 --> 02:59:16,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make an application.

2531
02:59:16,599 --> 02:59:17,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you guys support it?

2532
02:59:17,720 --> 02:59:19,320
[SPEAKER_05]: He has never one of these things here.

2533
02:59:19,340 --> 02:59:20,001
[SPEAKER_05]: He's coming for the council.

2534
02:59:20,021 --> 02:59:21,021
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't have to go to the council for that.

2535
02:59:21,041 --> 02:59:21,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the whole thing.

2536
02:59:21,881 --> 02:59:22,521
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't have to.

2537
02:59:22,541 --> 02:59:23,681
[SPEAKER_05]: He has to go to council now to accept this.

2538
02:59:23,701 --> 02:59:25,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So if he doesn't have to, then we don't have to either.

2539
02:59:25,462 --> 02:59:31,643
[SPEAKER_12]: He's here now to do what the council's role is, and that is to approve the expenditure of the funds.

2540
02:59:31,683 --> 02:59:32,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we're here.

2541
02:59:33,604 --> 02:59:36,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't, I don't, he, this project is not over.

2542
02:59:36,905 --> 02:59:39,465
[SPEAKER_12]: We are still accepting donations if people would like to contribute.

2543
02:59:39,765 --> 02:59:46,947
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have to say, this isn't the spirit of which I can't imagine what people want to contribute with this kind of atmosphere in this own

2544
02:59:47,927 --> 02:59:49,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Place the City Hall.

2545
02:59:49,408 --> 02:59:51,129
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of negativity that's happening.

2546
02:59:51,169 --> 03:00:13,283
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the way to fundraise I'll tell you this doesn't make me won't feel very comfortable about about this being a positive community in which to do development and which to move ahead I mean as Council night I said we've talked about clippership linear pockets part of the master plan part of the goals that we've been all been working on we can personalize this if you want to but it's not positive and I think it's detrimental and it really you know, I

2547
03:00:13,563 --> 03:00:18,467
[SPEAKER_12]: We are each responsible for our own decisions that we make and for the actions that we take, and it's before you right now.

2548
03:00:18,487 --> 03:00:19,428
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to say anything else.

2549
03:00:19,488 --> 03:00:27,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And before the roll is called, Councilor Lungo-Kernan and Councilor Marks, but I'm glad they picked that location because it's not only going to be great for the seniors.

2550
03:00:28,196 --> 03:00:32,380
[SPEAKER_08]: This young woman lived about a hundred yards from the site.

2551
03:00:33,361 --> 03:00:39,406
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some significance in my vote with that piece.

2552
03:00:39,994 --> 03:00:40,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lengelkern and Councilor Larkin.

2553
03:00:40,974 --> 03:00:42,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Camuso.

2554
03:00:42,295 --> 03:00:53,901
[SPEAKER_17]: I just make a motion to request that the mayor, like he had mentioned, I believe it was at a meeting at the senior center when this was discussed, he's going to continue to fundraise.

2555
03:00:53,921 --> 03:00:58,123
[SPEAKER_17]: He's going to request funds from individuals within the community as well.

2556
03:00:58,163 --> 03:01:02,445
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a lot of people would still be willing to donate to this project.

2557
03:01:03,025 --> 03:01:05,966
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope that those funds are put into an account.

2558
03:01:06,127 --> 03:01:07,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I would motion that those funds be put into an account

2559
03:01:09,522 --> 03:01:14,623
[SPEAKER_17]: for the continued maintenance that will have to go on on the site, especially with the fountain.

2560
03:01:15,324 --> 03:01:16,124
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a tough vote.

2561
03:01:16,144 --> 03:01:19,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I do believe that all councilors have good intentions.

2562
03:01:20,145 --> 03:01:28,387
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are questions about the fiscal responsibility in the extent of the project.

2563
03:01:28,427 --> 03:01:35,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think they come from any place besides being concerned about every single taxpayer within the community.

2564
03:01:36,855 --> 03:01:42,519
[SPEAKER_17]: I, too, feel that the 1.3 is extensive, but it's going to be a wonderful project.

2565
03:01:42,559 --> 03:01:49,844
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's an extremely, obviously, hard project to vote against, especially some of us who knew the victims.

2566
03:01:51,265 --> 03:01:53,947
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just ask that that motion be applied tonight.

2567
03:01:53,967 --> 03:01:55,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2568
03:01:55,388 --> 03:01:57,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little confused about the motion.

2569
03:01:58,751 --> 03:02:03,814
[SPEAKER_13]: The council is opposed to the project, but she wants to add a contingency to the project.

2570
03:02:04,675 --> 03:02:06,156
[SPEAKER_17]: I never said I was opposed to the project.

2571
03:02:07,117 --> 03:02:08,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you just voted to reduce the funding.

2572
03:02:08,938 --> 03:02:09,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't vote against it.

2573
03:02:09,638 --> 03:02:10,718
[SPEAKER_17]: You voted to reduce the funding.

2574
03:02:10,898 --> 03:02:11,378
[SPEAKER_17]: I agreed.

2575
03:02:11,938 --> 03:02:13,479
[SPEAKER_13]: You voted to reduce the funding.

2576
03:02:13,499 --> 03:02:15,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that mean I'm going to vote for or against the program?

2577
03:02:15,099 --> 03:02:15,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2578
03:02:15,419 --> 03:02:16,740
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm trying to clarify right now.

2579
03:02:16,760 --> 03:02:18,820
[SPEAKER_17]: So don't put words in my mouth.

2580
03:02:18,880 --> 03:02:21,001
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't stipulate how I'm going to vote.

2581
03:02:21,021 --> 03:02:21,641
[SPEAKER_17]: We have moved on.

2582
03:02:21,661 --> 03:02:24,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Before when you were opposed to the project, that wasn't on.

2583
03:02:24,242 --> 03:02:27,102
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I never said I was opposed to the project.

2584
03:02:27,242 --> 03:02:28,343
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's extensive.

2585
03:02:28,423 --> 03:02:30,023
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a wonderful project, but it's

2586
03:02:30,808 --> 03:02:35,012
[SPEAKER_17]: extensive, $1.3 million when we have potholes all over the city.

2587
03:02:35,032 --> 03:02:38,314
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just trying to understand the amendment to the paper.

2588
03:02:39,415 --> 03:02:47,983
[SPEAKER_17]: The amendment is to continue to fundraise like the mayor said he was going to, and that that money that is collected go towards the maintenance in the future.

2589
03:02:53,407 --> 03:02:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Meeks.

2590
03:02:55,469 --> 03:02:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2591
03:02:57,151 --> 03:02:58,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it ironic that

2592
03:02:59,509 --> 03:03:16,013
[SPEAKER_02]: An hour ago, we were talking about parking enforcement in the community and the lack of communication from the administration and why we're experiencing the, um, concern from business owners and residents at this particular stage for parking enforcement.

2593
03:03:16,433 --> 03:03:20,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are with a project that the mayor kept secret for 11 months.

2594
03:03:21,195 --> 03:03:23,035
[SPEAKER_02]: No communication with the council at all.

2595
03:03:23,873 --> 03:03:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he needs a vote, and everyone's questioning why we're asking questions.

2596
03:03:29,015 --> 03:03:31,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, I made the mention about a maintenance plan.

2597
03:03:31,777 --> 03:03:33,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told, no, no, we need a vote tonight.

2598
03:03:34,338 --> 03:03:36,299
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you the maintenance plan next week we're meeting.

2599
03:03:36,479 --> 03:03:40,040
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you a vote next, we'll get the maintenance plan next week.

2600
03:03:40,821 --> 03:03:45,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing that all this surrounds the lack of communication.

2601
03:03:46,363 --> 03:03:49,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if members of the council over here feel, hey,

2602
03:03:50,175 --> 03:03:53,816
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get presented items, and they're just going to vote whatever the mayor presents.

2603
03:03:53,836 --> 03:03:55,416
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your prerogative.

2604
03:03:56,397 --> 03:04:03,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, if I ask questions or have concerns, I don't think anyone should take exception to other members asking questions.

2605
03:04:04,699 --> 03:04:05,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't, Mr. President.

2606
03:04:06,280 --> 03:04:09,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it gets voted up, down, then so be it.

2607
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:11,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I go on to the next issue, Mr. President.

2608
03:04:11,401 --> 03:04:17,983
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel strongly, as I said last week, that a modest memorial is the way to go in our community.

2609
03:04:18,869 --> 03:04:20,330
[SPEAKER_02]: a modest memorial.

2610
03:04:21,672 --> 03:04:29,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the needs that we have and the needs that are out there in the community, as I mentioned, when you have people calling you up about
