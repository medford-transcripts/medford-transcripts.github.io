1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested in the new TV3 station and had questions with regards to the cable advisory committee.

2
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:08,554
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first I was aware that a committee has been established.

3
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:20,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm obviously out of the loop, so I was just wondering if we could get a copy of how many people are on the advisory committee and who they are, as well as have they met yet, and if there are any minutes.

4
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to just amend this.

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,601
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's been any minutes, if we could get a copy of those minutes so we can better see.

6
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,455
[SPEAKER_07]: what's been transpired, I think it's great.

7
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:39,899
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the station up and running to a point and just want to keep an idea of what's happening so we're able to answer people's questions as well.

8
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:40,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member, if I could amend that to ask if we're doing interviews for a manager of the station also?

10
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:48,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

11
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:49,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

12
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:50,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

13
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,666
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Council Member Kern, seconded by Council Member DelaRusso,

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,242
[SPEAKER_05]: as amended by President Caraviello.

15
00:00:58,783 --> 00:00:59,543
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

16
00:00:59,864 --> 00:00:59,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

17
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:03,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

18
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:06,430
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-535 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

19
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:16,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be to be provided a breakdown from the school department of the number of school transfers from one public school to another.

20
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:17,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Request

21
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:24,584
[SPEAKER_05]: in 2015, 16, 17, and the number of transfers allowed by each school.

22
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:29,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the numbers be broken down by school.

23
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Member Kern.

24
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Carviello.

25
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:36,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe within the next couple nights we're meeting with the superintendent of schools to go over.

26
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:41,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have it yet, but hopefully we'll get it sooner than later, the budget for the school department.

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I was recently asked how many transfers there are from one school to another by a resident, and I have

28
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea, so I said I would put this on.

29
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:57,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be curious to see how many transfer requests are out there and how many are allowed per each school.

30
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:01,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's a discrepancy with the amount of children that are in each school.

31
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:11,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to see, and there was an issue with class size for one of the grades at the Roberts that was discussed last night at the school committee meeting.

32
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to see how it is all broken down over the last three years so we can get a better idea.

33
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,480
[SPEAKER_07]: When we look at the numbers, we can kind of have the big picture.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to be able to answer people's questions.

35
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:28,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of people do request, I don't know if it's a lot, but people do request transfers.

36
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:32,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just something that we've never asked and we've never got an answer to.

37
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:39,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it'd be relevant to get these answers before we meet with the superintendent or at least before we

38
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:43,174
[SPEAKER_07]: vote on the budget potentially next Tuesday.

39
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:45,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could move approval with a roll call vote.

40
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:46,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

41
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso.

42
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:50,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, Mr. President.

43
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lago-Curran and seconded by Councilor DelaRusso, a roll call vote has been requested.

44
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

45
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

46
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:02,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

47
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:05,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

48
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:05,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

49
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:06,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nye.

50
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:07,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

51
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lago-Curran.

52
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:09,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

53
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:10,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Moxley?

54
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:11,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

55
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:12,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

56
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

57
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,497
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caviello?

58
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:15,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

59
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

61
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,604
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-536, offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

62
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:33,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be provided a list from the school department of all increased and decreased class sizes within our Memphis public schools.

63
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,935
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if a class is adding a class due to class size issues

64
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:40,229
[SPEAKER_05]: of vice versa.

65
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

66
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Carviello.

67
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I put this on last week.

68
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:57,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was Wednesday, Thursday, I started getting phone calls with regards to the concern of class sizes, mainly at one school and one grade.

69
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:06,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And I put this on because there's talk of every year, I'm assuming, depending on the numbers, there may be one or two or three.

70
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how many.

71
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:20,877
[SPEAKER_07]: where a teacher is pulled from a grade to accommodate another grade, and I wanted to see how many of those we have this coming year so we can obviously get control of it and make sure all our class sizes allow.

72
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:34,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe after last night's meeting, we were guaranteed that all class sizes would be under 22, and I believe the class average is about 20 students per classroom, so I just want to make sure we

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,963
[SPEAKER_07]: maintain that level and we make sure that we're gonna provide those little class sizes to everybody, every student across the board.

74
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

75
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:48,725
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lango-Kern, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

76
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,345
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

77
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

78
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

79
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,849
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-537 offered by Councilor Lango-Kern.

80
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be provided

81
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:12,032
[SPEAKER_05]: with a list from the school department of all new hires and newly created positions within the fiscal year 2018 budget.

82
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:18,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that we also receive a list of all positions that have been eliminated.

83
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

84
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again, President Carviello.

85
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:31,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Each year we are left with the large school budget and to look and see, try to figure out who's been added, who's been taken out of the budget.

86
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:51,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Each year we have sometimes a position or two or three that has been created which obviously is something that I think needs to be in bold print if not obviously given to us separately so we can understand what is going on in the school system and be able to vote on the budget accordingly.

87
00:05:51,649 --> 00:06:01,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So I asked for a list of all those new hires and newly created positions as well as all the positions that are being eliminated so we can do our job.

88
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:03,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kearns.

89
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by?

90
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

91
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,248
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

92
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:11,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

93
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

94
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, roll call has been requested.

95
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Del Rosso?

96
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:21,433
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

97
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

98
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:23,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

99
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Night, no.

100
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Longo-Kearns?

101
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:27,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

102
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:29,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Box?

103
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:30,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

104
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:31,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott Pelli?

105
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:31,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

106
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:42,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, a motion passes.

107
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:54,498
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-538, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the lack of attention from utility companies regarding double poles in our community be discussed.

108
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:55,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

109
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:03,204
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'd like to, I received a letter from

111
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:07,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent of WIRES, Stephen Randazzo.

112
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:11,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a recent happening, Mr. President.

113
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:16,880
[SPEAKER_03]: The letter is dated June 5, 2017, and it's from Verizon.

114
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:28,128
[SPEAKER_03]: As we all know, National Grid, for many years in this community, was the custodian of all the telephone poles, or I should say a good majority of the telephone poles in the city.

115
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:38,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And just recently, Verizon and National Grid reached an agreement on who the custodian of the poles are, and I think this is pertinent information for this council.

116
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:45,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to read just a portion, Mr. President, as I stated dated June 5th, 2017, from Verizon.

117
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:58,469
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, dear municipal official, this is to inform you that effective May 31st, 2017, National Grid and Verizon have reached an agreement that changes the way the two companies perform

118
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,200
[SPEAKER_03]: utility pole work in your community.

119
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,141
[SPEAKER_03]: The agreement updates operating procedures in place for more than 30 years.

120
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:19,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the new agreement, custodial areas where one or more other pole owner had assumed responsibility for replacing and installing new utility poles on a municipal basis have been eliminated.

121
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:27,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, National Grid will be responsible for all replacements, relocations, and new installations of jointly owned poles.

122
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:37,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Verizon will be responsible for removing all jointly owned poles once the replacement pole is installed and all facility transfers are completed.

123
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:52,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, Mr. President, according to this letter, Verizon will now be responsible for the removal of all double poles, which is brand new to this community and I think one that people should be aware of.

124
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President,

125
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:05,191
[SPEAKER_03]: to address the lack of attention with utility companies to the number of double poles we have in the community.

126
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:14,299
[SPEAKER_03]: According to our Superintendent Owais, we have a little over 8,400 telephone poles within the community.

127
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:24,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to the latest list I just received, there are roughly 245 double poles in the community.

128
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at it as a street situation, almost one out of every three streets in our community has a double pole on it.

129
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:45,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, the current list is Verizon has 88 poles that they're responsible for removing wires, and that's why the pole is still up, the double pole.

130
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:53,035
[SPEAKER_03]: National Grid has 51 poles they're responsible for, and Comcast has 101 poles.

131
00:09:53,815 --> 00:10:00,058
[SPEAKER_03]: The city of Method, Mr. President, and I'm proud to report this, back several years ago,

132
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:11,571
[SPEAKER_03]: was on close to, I believe it was 90 to 100 poles, that we had fire call boxes that were still hooked up, and they were holding the utility companies from removing the double pole.

133
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:17,335
[SPEAKER_03]: To date, Mr. President, we have one double pole on the city of Method.

134
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a huge accomplishment, and the Superintendent of Wires, Steven Randazzo, should be commended on his work, Mr. President,

135
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:37,470
[SPEAKER_03]: putting together a priority list and getting our city utility, which is the fire call box, off the poles, Mr. President.

136
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But double poles, as we know, are a blight to our community and a public safety concern to area residents.

137
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:50,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Utility companies are unresponsive and have no incentive to remove double poles in a reasonable time frame.

138
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:56,902
[SPEAKER_03]: The current system for moving poles is dysfunctional and the state law ineffective.

139
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:08,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Municipalities need a new approach that holds utility companies accountable, requiring better coordination and improved communication to resolve this problem.

140
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:17,800
[SPEAKER_03]: As we all know, Chapter 164, Section 34B forbids companies from keeping double poles up for more than 90 days.

141
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:23,185
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there is no penalty to the utility company for not complying with the law.

142
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:25,807
[SPEAKER_03]: On July 28, 2005, the Mass Supreme Court, Judicial Court,

143
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:38,559
[SPEAKER_03]: upheld a lower court ruling overturning a Bedford Mass bylaw imposing $100 a day fine for each set of double utility poles.

144
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,225
[SPEAKER_03]: The court ruled that only the state legislature has the authority to impose a fine for keeping double poles.

145
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:54,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So based on that decision back in 2005, Mr. President, I offered a council resolution on October 3rd

146
00:11:55,343 --> 00:12:18,054
[SPEAKER_03]: 2006 requesting our state delegation amend chapter 164 section 34 B allowing city or town to the ability to enact local ordinances or bylaws prohibiting double polls beyond the 90 days punishable by a fine not to exceed a maximum of $100 per occurrence per day.

147
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:21,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, um, rep score Tino,

148
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:43,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on October 6, 2006, based on the council resolution, offered a sponsor to build, Mr. President, with that exact terminology, which would allow, it was House Bill 1675, which would allow local cities and towns to actually find these utility companies.

149
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:48,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got bantered around in the state house, and

150
00:12:50,634 --> 00:13:01,002
[SPEAKER_03]: What ultimately ended up happening, from what I understand, is that the utility companies were upset.

151
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:12,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The utility companies, Mr. President, were upset because they said it was unfair.

152
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,319
[SPEAKER_03]: to find the custodian of the pole.

153
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:25,423
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, at the time, if National Grid owned the pole, they also had Comcast, Verizon on the pole, and they may be the ones holding up the process.

154
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:31,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So they said, how can you find us as the custodian where these other utilities are holding up the process?

155
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my opinion, Mr. President,

156
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:46,281
[SPEAKER_03]: The responsibility of the utility company that's the pole owner, they have license agreements with all these other attachees that are on the pole.

157
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:52,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And their license agreement states that they have the authority to transfer wires

158
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,411
[SPEAKER_03]: at the attachee's expense.

159
00:13:54,892 --> 00:14:06,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So if National Grid thought Comcast was taking too long removing their wires, under their license agreement, they can go in at the attachee's expense and remove the wires, and we can get rid of the double pole.

160
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:15,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see how the ambiguity that's out there really lends itself to a process that is not functioning, Mr. President.

161
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:20,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has been an issue, as you can see, it dates back to 2006 and far beyond that.

162
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to offer tonight, Mr. President, with the hopes of getting approval from this council, is that the state create, and this would be the Department of Telecommunications, they create, Mr. President, a statewide database

163
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,803
[SPEAKER_03]: which they oversee and they enforce.

164
00:14:47,323 --> 00:15:10,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, there's a database called Poll Lifetime Management System, and all the utility companies, it's PLM, all the utility companies and many municipalities have access to this system, so they can go online and look at these reports, which I have a copy in front of me, that states who's on the poll, how long the poll's been there, and who's responsible for taking their wires off.

165
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, they have access to this system, but there's no oversight by the state.

166
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:34,517
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, uh, request tonight through a motion of this council is that, uh, we request our state delegation, uh, to file legislation, creating the statewide enforcement and penalty structure under the oversight and responsibility of the mass department of public utilities.

167
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And by doing so, Mr. President, we'll create a state entity that's responsible for the oversight and also serve as an online tracking process that allows review of the state and possible finding by the state.

168
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So the municipalities don't have to get involved.

169
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the utility, Mass.

170
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:02,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Public Utilities, which currently right now is the oversight for utilities in Massachusetts.

171
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:04,222
[SPEAKER_03]: They should step up to the plate.

172
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: and take responsibility.

173
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:14,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be my recommendation tonight, Mr. President, that our state delegation file legislation to allow enforcement by Mass.

174
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:19,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Public Utilities and also the ability to find, Mr. President, by Mass.

175
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:20,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Public Utilities.

176
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:32,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can once and for all put this issue in the rearview mirror and not have to reinvent this issue every year after year when the utility companies

177
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: just ignoring our request to remove double poles, Mr. President.

178
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

179
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso?

180
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:42,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

182
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

183
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,486
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

184
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote.

185
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:57,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

186
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso?

187
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:00,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

188
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:01,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

189
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:01,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

190
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:02,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

191
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:02,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

192
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:03,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative.

193
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,618
[SPEAKER_06]: None in the negative motion passes.

194
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:08,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Petitions presentations and similar matters.

195
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,480
[SPEAKER_06]: 17 five three nine petition by Lisa defibrillators.

196
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:39,712
[SPEAKER_05]: 32 Winford Way, Medford to address the council about property owners maintaining minimal standards of care.

197
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

198
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:41,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

199
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:41,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Address for the record, please.

200
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:43,213
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

201
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Name Lisa DeFabritas, Winford Way.

202
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:45,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

203
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:47,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

204
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:59,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to kindly request the council to consider the implementation of an ordinance to require property owners to maintain their property at a minimum standard of care and cleanliness.

205
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:04,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Some cities have such an ordinance in place, but Medford does not.

206
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:14,358
[SPEAKER_14]: The majority of residents do maintain their property in good condition, but the few who do not cause a significant impact to their neighbors and to those who pass by these properties.

207
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:24,802
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, one, this potential fire hazard for uncut grass that grows to excessive heights that can become a fire hazard in the summertime.

208
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Two, the attraction of unwanted animals and pests.

209
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:37,154
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, rotted wood on structures of a property or lying on their property that can attract termites and easily spread to neighboring homes.

210
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,958
[SPEAKER_14]: The attraction of rats, mice that can cause infestation.

211
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:53,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Three, the deterrence of prospective buyers who want to purchase or invest in a property that is in close proximity to a neglected property.

212
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,986
[SPEAKER_14]: The depreciation value of a property that is in the vicinity of a neglected or deplorable property.

213
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:13,417
[SPEAKER_14]: One could argue from a legal standpoint that a negligent property owner could be liable for damages because their negligence causes the loss of value to another property owner.

214
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:20,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Lastly, it's simply unsightly, inoffensive to see a neglected property in our neighbourhood.

215
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:29,501
[SPEAKER_14]: In allowing property to be kept in deplorable conditions goes against the efforts of the city to maintain a sense of pride and decency in our community.

216
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:39,985
[SPEAKER_14]: The city has ordinances in place for dog owners, dog waste, property owners to keep their sidewalks clear of debris and snow, public littering, et cetera.

217
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:57,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Not having an ordinance in place to address negligent property owners hurts the majority of residents by allowing so-called slum property owners to embarrass our city, cause a depreciation of surrounding property value and increase safety risks.

218
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:13,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, without an ordinance in place, the city and its residents are helpless to address this issue, leaving individual residents to try and resolve matters on their own, which could result in bad situations amongst neighbors that could lead to civil unrest and violence.

219
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:28,137
[SPEAKER_14]: We shouldn't have to wait until a bad situation occurs before recognizing the need for a common sense ordinance to ensure Medfit can be proud of its city and its surroundings.

220
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:42,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to share a copy of an ordinance from another city regarding the cleanliness expectations from its residents and property owners that I'm happy to leave as a reference for consideration.

221
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:44,230
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for your time.

222
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

223
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor DelaRusso.

224
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

225
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could, through the chair, ask the citizen, Ms.

226
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: DeFabritis, is there a particular incident that is inspiring you to ask for this ordinance?

227
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:17,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, my second question would be,

228
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:31,047
[SPEAKER_04]: to ask if she's aware or finds a failing in public health regulations and building code regulations that are often invoked to remedy these situations.

229
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

230
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:32,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I have.

231
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:39,711
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, for years, I lived next to a property like that.

232
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:44,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And for years, I lived next to a property in that

233
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,036
[SPEAKER_14]: in deplorable conditions.

234
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:56,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Both myself and many of my residents, the neighbors on my street have tried for years to reach out to the city to have this addressed.

235
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:10,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I personally myself over the past year have spoken to the building department, the health department, the police, the city, every department that everyone has referred me to, I have contacted and I have been told that there is nothing they can do about it unless

236
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:14,731
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a safety issue.

237
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:18,452
[SPEAKER_14]: There was limitations and it brought me to this particular point.

238
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:24,853
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no ordinance in the city that allows the city to address this problem.

239
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,774
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if there was an audience, the city and the police can go there and say, Hey, this is the audience.

240
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,995
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to take care of this.

241
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:30,875
[SPEAKER_14]: This is unacceptable.

242
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:36,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever the conditions as stated forth in an ordinance sort of allows the authorities of the city to enforce it.

243
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:41,365
[SPEAKER_14]: and or potentially fine property owners if they don't keep them.

244
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:43,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I'm only asking a minimal standard.

245
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:47,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm not saying they have to keep it as a palace, but there are certain minimal expectations.

246
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:54,570
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel that everybody should respect for your community and for your neighbors.

247
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure I answered all your questions.

248
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:58,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

249
00:22:58,531 --> 00:22:59,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

250
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:00,172
[SPEAKER_14]: My pleasure.

251
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

252
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:02,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

253
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:04,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Max.

254
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

255
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:11,154
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an ordinance regarding the exterior of the property.

256
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a clean it or lean it ordinance.

257
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:14,596
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in effect for a number of years.

258
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:34,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I know the building department has used that for several properties throughout the community, uh, and have been, uh, very, uh, responsive to, uh, the owners of the property and cleaning the property itself regarding a property that may have other issues as council Del Russo mentioned,

259
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,536
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe border health issues or road in issues, which would be border health.

260
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I think they could enforce if they needed to.

261
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:52,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's just a matter of getting the right attention to get down there and have them take a look at the property to see if it's in need.

262
00:23:53,221 --> 00:24:00,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, I'm not aware of the property, but, um, like I said, the cleaner to lean it, uh, would apply to the exterior.

263
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:04,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So if someone has, uh, just say a bathtub on their front lawn,

264
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe it or not, it's happened before.

265
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a portable toilet in the driveway that's been sitting there for six months.

266
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:15,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, that would be ideal for the clean it or lean it.

267
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:16,523
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be ideal.

268
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we could remedy, I don't know if you want to give an address, but we can recommend through this council that the board of health as well as code enforcement go out to the property and do a site view.

269
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:35,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I did go to the building department last week and they were,

270
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:41,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I explained it and they told me there was only limited resources.

271
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:48,769
[SPEAKER_14]: They were limited to what they could do based on the clean it or lean it that you were referring to.

272
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:54,110
[SPEAKER_14]: They did mention that they were going to go there and try and talk to the owner about it.

273
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:56,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't heard back.

274
00:24:59,051 --> 00:24:59,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry?

275
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,751
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the information's Councilor Scott Pelley.

276
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:02,872
[SPEAKER_02]: The board applauding that?

277
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:04,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

278
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, yeah, because we, I'm sorry to interrupt.

279
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:11,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I, I just, I wasn't, I don't know if someone just put, put a port a party.

280
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a building department should know through the permitting process, correct?

281
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:16,563
[SPEAKER_02]: The board of health.

282
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably not a, it's not a legal one.

283
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:19,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

284
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:21,384
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, I know, but if it's there too long.

285
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:21,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

286
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:22,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

287
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:23,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.

288
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:31,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there are, there are many issues in this particular property and, and I, um, I'm for sure there are other properties throughout the city.

289
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:37,448
[SPEAKER_14]: The bottom line is it's just like, there should be a minimal expect, you know, expectations of property owner.

290
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:38,068
[SPEAKER_14]: For example,

291
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:43,131
[SPEAKER_14]: what about the, you know, there is no ordinance for currently or anything on the books about grass.

292
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:49,915
[SPEAKER_14]: When you have a drought, like a situation we had last year where it didn't rain all summer and you have grass, it's, you know, like four feet high.

293
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:54,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's, if I ask it, there should be some kind of ordinance and expectation there.

294
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:59,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it applies to all that, just so you know that it applies to grass.

295
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's I'm happy.

296
00:26:00,705 --> 00:26:03,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It applies to putting items on your lawn or in your yard.

297
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:13,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I was told by the building, I don't mean to interrupt, I was told by the building last week that that was not applicable to the situation.

298
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:15,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've got bogus information.

299
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:18,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

300
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:21,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's applied in other circumstances.

301
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:29,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to give out where the property was, but that clean and lean, and it was regarding tall bushes, regarding tall grass that was unkept,

302
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:35,471
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to two people, one in person, one on the phone, gave them the property address.

303
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,694
[SPEAKER_14]: They said they were going to go out and speak to them.

304
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:45,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I was told that they were limited to what they were able to do to enforce it, or force

305
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:48,211
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the property owner to do anything about it.

306
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:52,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I've been after this for years and more recently last week.

307
00:26:52,717 --> 00:26:54,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have yet to see any results.

308
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I haven't heard anybody back from the building department.

309
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:02,130
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, if there's an ordinance, if that is applicable, then, um,

310
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a written document?

311
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:07,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is there somewhere?

312
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:07,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a city ordinance.

313
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:08,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a city ordinance.

314
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:11,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the site section, but it's a city ordinance.

315
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:14,558
[SPEAKER_14]: And that pertains to everything that I'm describing?

316
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:15,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

317
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:15,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

318
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:16,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

319
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:16,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

320
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:25,622
[SPEAKER_14]: So they can use that to enforce the property owner to make their property

321
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:29,925
[SPEAKER_14]: comply to a certain standard.

322
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:30,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it or lean it.

323
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it meaning clean it up or lean it.

324
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:39,647
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm very confused because again, I've been to every department in the city for the past year and a half or two years and I have.

325
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:42,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're that confused, grab a seat and you can come back here with us.

326
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:43,888
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to.

327
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:55,150
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, if I could get a copy of that ordinance at some point and if maybe the building department can follow up on this, um,

328
00:27:56,564 --> 00:28:00,766
[SPEAKER_14]: and I can get some answers to know what the next step.

329
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:01,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

330
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us an address.

331
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:02,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have an address?

332
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,169
[SPEAKER_14]: We need an address.

333
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:07,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

334
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:08,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

335
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:09,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

336
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

337
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:12,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

338
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:13,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

339
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:14,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Addresses all the time.

340
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:16,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lococo.

341
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:19,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to mention the clean and Alina ordinance too.

342
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like,

343
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:28,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we get the proper department, you know, the person in the building department, we can try to get somebody out there for a site visit.

344
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:34,107
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the best way to do that is for her to email us all and we can, you know, obviously help work it out.

345
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:35,388
[SPEAKER_07]: But I agree.

346
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:37,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of properties.

347
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I was contacting the building department last week on a property on Doonan Street.

348
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:45,035
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been under construction for about two and a half years.

349
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:46,096
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no stairs.

350
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:50,219
[SPEAKER_07]: There's rocks and, I mean, grass couldn't even grow because there's rocks everywhere and I'm

351
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:53,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is hard for the building departments.

352
00:28:54,122 --> 00:29:04,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes their hands are tied, but for something like this, it seems like our Board of Health and our building department should be able to do a site visit.

353
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:09,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there's no permit on that port-a-potty that's in somebody's driveway, something should be done.

354
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:10,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

355
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Nice.

356
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:23,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I have had great luck with the Board of Health and the Code Enforcement Office in getting some of these issues rectified as well, so I really think it might be that we need to point an individual in the right direction.

357
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:29,808
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, though, the lady was kind enough to pass out a copy of an ordinance that I'm hoping we can all get copies of.

358
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:33,251
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point in time, I'd ask that the paper be received and placed on file.

359
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:38,056
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an opportunity to take a look at the draft ordinance that's in place, and we can contrast that with our

360
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:46,346
[SPEAKER_16]: existing rules and regulations that are established by the Board of Health and the Building Commission, and then we can determine whether or not we need to move forward with a minimum standard of cleanliness ordinance, Mr. President.

361
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

362
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry, if you can make us copy.

363
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:55,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

364
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

365
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:05,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I think on the face, when you look at these properties that are distressed, they're a symptom to a larger issue.

366
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:14,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And although I appreciate the clean it or lean it approach, it's not just residents that we have a problem with.

367
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:15,787
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also businesses.

368
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:25,694
[SPEAKER_10]: So my position is a lot of these instances, when you delve a little deeper, you're dealing with people who are barely hanging on.

369
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:29,237
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the folks working two jobs who don't have time to mow the lawn.

370
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:36,162
[SPEAKER_10]: They're being deaf by paper cuts in fees and expenses from the city.

371
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:40,069
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really think it's a very slippery slope.

372
00:30:40,690 --> 00:31:01,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we're going to start to really look at enforcing a clean it or lean it, then it should also be applied, perhaps more heavy-handedly, to the property owners who allow their commercial properties to remain empty and an eyesore on the city for a tax write-off in their real estate portfolio.

373
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:06,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly those people can afford it far more than some individual who may be

374
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:09,025
[SPEAKER_10]: is having trouble keeping their property.

375
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:20,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would urge you, as you start to look at this ordinance and delve into it deeper, to consider that some of these folks, it's an issue of finance and time.

376
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:29,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is another one of those methods and approaches that can often lead to gentrification.

377
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,945
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's no secret how I feel about balancing our development

378
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:40,056
[SPEAKER_10]: and our image with not gentrifying our residents out.

379
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:43,599
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just ask you to consider those things as you look at it.

380
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

381
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

382
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Nugent.

383
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:55,707
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Knight that we review and place on file, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

384
00:31:56,587 --> 00:32:03,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The messenger is doing that as we speak.

385
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:04,813
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

386
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:08,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

387
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:13,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Vice President Marks to move suspension of the rules.

388
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

389
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

390
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:26,146
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

391
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a member of this August body.

392
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:33,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I come here tonight on two very important issues.

393
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:38,090
[SPEAKER_00]: that directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community.

394
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:43,254
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act.

395
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:50,359
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage.

396
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,282
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go.

397
00:32:55,103 --> 00:33:01,288
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots

398
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:06,897
[SPEAKER_00]: were never acted upon, because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it.

399
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:10,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew.

400
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, it did pass from those members that did vote.

401
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:24,224
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community.

402
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:28,106
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for.

403
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:31,107
[SPEAKER_00]: The Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002,

404
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:51,786
[SPEAKER_00]: addressed itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

405
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:57,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time.

406
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:01,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back

407
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:03,629
[SPEAKER_00]: 52%.

408
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiscal year 2014, 31%.

409
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:04,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiscal year 2015, 29.7%.

410
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And this present past fiscal year 2016, they're at 18%.

411
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:18,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to the assessed evaluation at the 1.5%, the state will give back approximately 18%, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100%.

412
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:42,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to members up at the legislature, and I've spoken to other cities and towns, where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bank for the buck.

413
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,399
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys and gals are into this thing on the second year.

414
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:47,081
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have no program.

415
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:58,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values.

416
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three primary things.

417
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,759
[SPEAKER_00]: at a minimum of each one of those.

418
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:08,842
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18.

419
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:11,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry, he's not here when he comes back.

420
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:15,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you.

421
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:20,287
[SPEAKER_00]: The intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following.

422
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:26,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Since in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people

423
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,946
[SPEAKER_00]: have been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth.

424
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:43,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back.

425
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:50,401
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend

426
00:35:51,089 --> 00:36:17,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Section 18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%,

427
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,141
[SPEAKER_00]: until further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation.

428
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:23,843
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first part.

429
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:47,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again.

430
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:53,698
[SPEAKER_00]: My amendment to that portion states basically this, at the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies.

431
00:36:54,238 --> 00:37:04,400
[SPEAKER_00]: If in fact, if in fact the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot.

432
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:08,781
[SPEAKER_00]: You are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA.

433
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:14,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent.

434
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,261
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are provisos in there.

435
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,262
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 12, it's a 12 page document.

436
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:20,222
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 18 sections to go with it.

437
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:23,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read.

438
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:29,065
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great latitude that up to a nine member board or a commission has with that money.

439
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:32,105
[SPEAKER_00]: And you as a council haven't even been right into the picture.

440
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:36,447
[SPEAKER_00]: No public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent.

441
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:42,008
[SPEAKER_00]: While 30% can go to housing, historical and open space and recreational.

442
00:37:42,482 --> 00:37:49,306
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same, if not similar, situations that CPA will approve.

443
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:53,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you folks really need to take a deep, hard look at this particular law.

444
00:37:54,489 --> 00:38:11,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as of July 1, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month, and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of $1 million, is being collected here at City Hall, and the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this,

445
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:16,371
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time.

446
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:40,091
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I would like to talk about is the money that on October 7th, 2014, after many weeks of, excuse me, on October 7th in 2014, I don't know what's going on here, on October 7th,

447
00:38:41,673 --> 00:39:04,279
[SPEAKER_00]: On 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn at that point in time signed the contract on October 7th, 2014, five additional addendums, five additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract.

448
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that stands out is the following.

449
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,681
[SPEAKER_00]: It says he's recommending $250,000

450
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,121
[SPEAKER_00]: of the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements.

451
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:27,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following.

452
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:32,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did that the same day he made that announcement.

453
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,204
[SPEAKER_00]: On December 18th, 2015, the mayor sent out a

454
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:50,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice to the members of the city council, which basically said in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the mayor some proposed uses.

455
00:39:51,081 --> 00:40:06,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred from the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016.

456
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:13,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go a little bit further and we go to December 23rd, 2014.

457
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:25,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation for district improvements.

458
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:36,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke.

459
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:37,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly,

460
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:54,306
[SPEAKER_00]: we have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements to business districts.

461
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,007
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the catch.

462
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,708
[SPEAKER_00]: The prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said.

463
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:05,250
[SPEAKER_00]: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond

464
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:07,488
[SPEAKER_00]: the fixed amount that we collected.

465
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:14,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account?

466
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:22,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Each district right now is $100,000 behind in what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square.

467
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:38,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money because that money should be designated in the real estate account.

468
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,433
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfair to the business districts in this community.

469
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,001
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an election year.

470
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:44,822
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a lot of puffing going along.

471
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:46,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to do this and we're going to do that.

472
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:54,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in.

473
00:41:55,009 --> 00:42:03,635
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated.

474
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:15,272
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming and not be forthcoming from that account.

475
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:16,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's unfair.

476
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:25,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there.

477
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, I would like to

478
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:34,432
[SPEAKER_00]: ask that someone on the council, maybe all the council members ask the mayor, where is the money?

479
00:42:35,192 --> 00:42:37,253
[SPEAKER_00]: When is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts?

480
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:39,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we see it?

481
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:45,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word.

482
00:42:45,176 --> 00:42:46,816
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not political puffing.

483
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:54,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Mr. Um, I'd like to pass out the site and sections of the law for which we just talked about.

484
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give one to each one, including the clerk?

485
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:03,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are.

486
00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:18,478
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes and their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good.

487
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:23,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100 percent back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape.

488
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,340
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's only progressed for 18 percent of this year,

489
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base.

490
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:34,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point.

491
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another tax, another tax that cannot be accounted for.

492
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

493
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:45,032
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with, because it's not even coming from the city of Medford.

494
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:47,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.

495
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:54,570
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear.

496
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we paying for these things?

497
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:02,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and soil surplus account?

498
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:07,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement?

499
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just doesn't make any sense.

500
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:13,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up.

501
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:16,157
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't understand what's going on in this building here.

502
00:44:16,564 --> 00:44:17,925
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely no communication.

503
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:23,447
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here.

504
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:26,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.

505
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:28,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

506
00:44:28,229 --> 00:44:29,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Knight.

507
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

508
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,072
[SPEAKER_16]: To the gentleman at the podium, I do believe, and refresh my memory, because I know you got a lot of good notes there.

509
00:44:36,193 --> 00:44:40,695
[SPEAKER_16]: At one point in time, the previous administration did put forward a paper for the council to appropriate $250,000.

510
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:41,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that correct?

511
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:41,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

512
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:41,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

513
00:44:46,243 --> 00:44:47,303
[SPEAKER_16]: And do you know when that happened?

514
00:44:47,924 --> 00:44:53,225
[SPEAKER_00]: December, the first time it came about, after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7, 2014.

515
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:55,306
[SPEAKER_16]: October, 2014.

516
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,687
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the contract was signed.

517
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:57,187
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

518
00:44:57,207 --> 00:45:00,308
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the paper was introduced to the council floor, I believe.

519
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was presented before the council floor.

520
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:06,730
[SPEAKER_00]: A representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night.

521
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was the following January.

522
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:12,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe on January 28 of the following year,

523
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:14,535
[SPEAKER_00]: the full-blown discussion.

524
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Even maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night.

525
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:16,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.

526
00:45:16,976 --> 00:45:18,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.

527
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:26,820
[SPEAKER_16]: But so that— There was a request made of the council to appropriate $250,000 to the building districts, but the previous council didn't act on it.

528
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,620
[SPEAKER_00]: The administration absolutely said it.

529
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,961
[SPEAKER_00]: That money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis.

530
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:34,453
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sale of real estate to the five business districts.

531
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:37,174
[SPEAKER_16]: The previous administration did send us a paper requesting an appropriation.

532
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:38,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, and we got that, as a matter of fact.

533
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:41,017
[SPEAKER_16]: And then that money was never appropriated because the council failed to act, correct?

534
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:41,557
[SPEAKER_00]: You never got it.

535
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:43,338
[SPEAKER_00]: You never got the request to have it appropriated.

536
00:45:44,218 --> 00:45:48,181
[SPEAKER_16]: See, I'm remembering that we got a paper requesting the $250,000 be appropriated.

537
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:53,444
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I ask, because my recollection is a little bit different than that that was presented.

538
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:55,665
[SPEAKER_16]: But with that being said, I rest, Mr. President.

539
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:02,931
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017.

540
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:04,251
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of money.

541
00:46:04,732 --> 00:46:05,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And where is it?

542
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it back into the business districts?

543
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:15,653
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis.

544
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:23,915
[SPEAKER_00]: This was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us.

545
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:26,968
[SPEAKER_00]: as the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated.

546
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:29,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Council Member Kern.

547
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Carviello.

548
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:38,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank prior Councilor Penter for coming forward and refreshing our memory.

549
00:46:38,856 --> 00:46:43,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that, I agree with you, if it should come out of anywhere, it should be the sale of real estate.

550
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:53,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure you're aware, the latest we've heard is that we are going to be asked to vote out of it, take the money out of free cash at some point

551
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,183
[SPEAKER_07]: in the near future to give $50,000 to each business district.

552
00:46:57,663 --> 00:47:03,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, too, I mean, I feel that it should come out of the budget rather than free cash, but that's the way, that's what's playing out now.

553
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:16,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose.

554
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:20,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000,

555
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,753
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000.

556
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,291
[SPEAKER_00]: and they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed.

557
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:29,891
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not being done.

558
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:31,492
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no meeting.

559
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:44,816
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here.

560
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:46,936
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is still taxpayers' money.

561
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:52,798
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors

562
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,141
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it.

563
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:06,924
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semi-annual basis, revenue coming in.

564
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:09,424
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just go on and on.

565
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:12,325
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least on this particular issue, there's nothing.

566
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:15,326
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented.

567
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:20,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please?

568
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you pass them up?

569
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:22,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.

570
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:26,447
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody.

571
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,308
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it.

572
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:39,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers?

573
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:49,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money

574
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:51,967
[SPEAKER_00]: did the city of Medford take in in its first year?

575
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,608
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going into your second year of a CPA.

576
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:56,870
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the intent of spending that money?

577
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the committee?

578
00:48:58,691 --> 00:48:59,631
[SPEAKER_00]: What's their findings?

579
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:01,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the public meeting?

580
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:03,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the public hearing for input?

581
00:49:04,214 --> 00:49:06,596
[SPEAKER_00]: You're into the second year of it, three years to go.

582
00:49:06,616 --> 00:49:09,338
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make any sense.

583
00:49:10,138 --> 00:49:10,979
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to read the law.

584
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:12,580
[SPEAKER_00]: The law is very specific.

585
00:49:13,688 --> 00:49:20,272
[SPEAKER_00]: On the CPA especially, after it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board.

586
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:22,714
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be done right after the fact.

587
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:24,495
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to have meetings.

588
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:26,776
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to have this presented to the people.

589
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:27,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me?

590
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a board.

591
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:30,079
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a board.

592
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the public meetings on how to spend the money?

593
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:34,822
[SPEAKER_05]: They've already had one.

594
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:36,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me what it was?

595
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:37,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

596
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:39,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a public meeting before the council?

597
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:39,925
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

598
00:49:40,655 --> 00:49:42,318
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you've got to read and understand.

599
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:44,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the 12 pages that make up the law.

600
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:46,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very specific.

601
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:50,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm offering to you is here is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold.

602
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:56,279
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community?

603
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:59,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it.

604
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:00,862
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nice try.

605
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:08,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property.

606
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:09,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes into a skew.

607
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:12,472
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complex situation.

608
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:24,859
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community.

609
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,920
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation.

610
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:35,344
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do.

611
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,345
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't even know that.

612
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:40,807
[SPEAKER_00]: None of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for.

613
00:50:41,027 --> 00:50:42,608
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't even had any input.

614
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:46,531
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about as transparent as the number six.

615
00:50:49,592 --> 00:50:49,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

616
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:52,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions from anybody?

617
00:50:53,975 --> 00:51:03,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll be back in June and July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward,

618
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:15,597
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.

619
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

620
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:18,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

621
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

622
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:23,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address the record.

623
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:26,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Joyce Paul and I'm in a Mason street in Medford.

624
00:51:27,705 --> 00:51:30,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I was recently elected to the state committee.

625
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:36,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had no idea how many people would talk to me about how many issues they would talk to me about.

626
00:51:37,705 --> 00:51:39,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And money is the number one.

627
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:52,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely support Bob Penta saying that if we're supposed to get money back from the state and we're not getting it back, then we need to address that.

628
00:51:53,268 --> 00:51:59,610
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't seem fair to say to people, if you give us 1.5%, the state will match it.

629
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:04,027
[SPEAKER_08]: and that will be helpful to the area.

630
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:08,547
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're not getting the money back, we're not getting the money back, and it's not fair to the people.

631
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:19,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I also support having a little bit more understanding about this 250,000, this 500,000 in the business district.

632
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:31,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know very much about that, but I do know a number of people have talked about the Preservation Act, and I'm not sure we all know in any way all the details that you know,

633
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:40,235
[SPEAKER_08]: but I do think that I would like to see us get a little better care and I don't feel like we're getting, you know, the care that we should.

634
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:41,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

635
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:42,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

636
00:52:46,137 --> 00:52:46,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

637
00:52:46,537 --> 00:52:47,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

638
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:49,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

639
00:52:49,538 --> 00:52:51,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

640
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:58,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to bring up some of the points that Mr. Penta was talking about, excuse me,

641
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:03,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Tomorrow night, there is a meeting of the Community Preservation Commission.

642
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:06,951
[SPEAKER_15]: It's at the high school, I believe, at 5 o'clock.

643
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:15,517
[SPEAKER_15]: The funds collected so far is $1,200,000, as I believe you know from the subcommittee meetings on the budget.

644
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:22,583
[SPEAKER_15]: What you also know, too, is that—I mean, this also connects to what Lisa was saying.

645
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:23,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I forget your last name.

646
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:23,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

647
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:34,599
[SPEAKER_15]: in Medford, as the assessor said, are going up an average of 10% to 14%.

648
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,042
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said that based on historical records.

649
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:43,584
[SPEAKER_15]: So the CPA tax is going to be collecting a lot more money, too.

650
00:53:44,604 --> 00:53:49,967
[SPEAKER_15]: One other clarification I want to make is I was opposed to the CPA in 2015.

651
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:56,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And when it passed, the very next day after the election, I went to the Office of Elections

652
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,914
[SPEAKER_15]: secretary of state's office, and I asked them, how do we get rid of this?

653
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,336
[SPEAKER_15]: And they said, you don't.

654
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:07,139
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only one way after five years.

655
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:13,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, maybe what Mr. Penta said is true, but they didn't tell me that, about the city council being able to put it on the ballot.

656
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:16,608
[SPEAKER_15]: But what was told to me from the secretary of state's office is,

657
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:22,461
[SPEAKER_15]: It can only get on the ballot to be repealed the same way it got on the ballot to be passed.

658
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:30,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, you have to go out in citizen effort drive to go out and get the signatures, to get this thing on the ballot, to get it repealed.

659
00:54:30,924 --> 00:54:40,908
[SPEAKER_15]: And one final thing I want to say about the matching from the state is only half of the cities and towns have the CPA.

660
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:48,297
[SPEAKER_15]: but all 351 cities and towns pay into the fund that funds the towns that have it.

661
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:59,845
[SPEAKER_15]: So an unfortunate aspect of this is that lesser affluent communities that don't have the CPA end up through their taxes funding more affluent towns.

662
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:03,648
[SPEAKER_15]: We really don't need the CPA.

663
00:55:04,128 --> 00:55:06,370
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely agree with the purposes of it.

664
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,793
[SPEAKER_15]: The preservation of historical landmarks and open spaces,

665
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:15,674
[SPEAKER_15]: But Medford already sits on surpluses and budgets.

666
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:20,015
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a property tax that goes up every single year.

667
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:22,056
[SPEAKER_15]: We have surpluses in other accounts.

668
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:29,458
[SPEAKER_15]: There are other ways that we can do the objectives of the CPA without having the CPA.

669
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:35,600
[SPEAKER_15]: And if Mr. Pinter is right of some way of freezing this or reducing it, please,

670
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:41,628
[SPEAKER_15]: By all means, do that, because as the last speaker said, this is what's on the mind of the people.

671
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:51,182
[SPEAKER_15]: How are people going to upkeep their properties when they have the connectivity tax coming at them?

672
00:55:51,562 --> 00:56:00,648
[SPEAKER_15]: When they have the perpetual property tax, when they have the meals tax, and the sales tax, and two income taxes, and fees to go to Wrights Pond, and fees for this, that, and the other thing.

673
00:56:01,148 --> 00:56:02,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Gene Neuzil's right.

674
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:04,830
[SPEAKER_15]: This is death by paper cuts.

675
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:09,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And this body has the power to do something about that.

676
00:56:10,053 --> 00:56:11,514
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, these are our neighbors.

677
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,216
[SPEAKER_15]: We know the people who own these restaurants out here.

678
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,017
[SPEAKER_15]: We grew up here our whole lives.

679
00:56:16,557 --> 00:56:17,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Please, common sense.

680
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Please, thank you, Mr. President.

681
00:56:19,718 --> 00:56:20,919
[SPEAKER_15]: It was voted on by the people.

682
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:23,780
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can get it repealed, we'll review the paper.

683
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,161
[SPEAKER_15]: The people voted it in.

684
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:40,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and I sat at a polling center on election day, and as people came in, Mr. President, and they looked at that doctor's prescription of a ballot question, they went up to the poll worker, and they said, hey, can you explain this to me?

685
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:44,907
[SPEAKER_15]: And when they were told, basically, it's a surrogate on your profile, oh, I'm not voting for that.

686
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:46,523
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right.

687
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:46,843
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right.

688
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:51,484
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a citizen effort drive, and kudos to Roberta Kammerer for what she did.

689
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:55,405
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't agree with the CPA, but I definitely admire her efforts.

690
00:56:55,626 --> 00:56:56,626
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a job well done.

691
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:08,589
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was also done in a way that wasn't specifically clear to the voters of this community as to what was actually going to happen.

692
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:10,769
[SPEAKER_15]: And Matt, you're right.

693
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:12,530
[SPEAKER_15]: It was voted on by the people.

694
00:57:14,123 --> 00:57:14,664
[SPEAKER_15]: What did he say?

695
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:16,685
[SPEAKER_15]: 1300 people didn't even vote on it.

696
00:57:17,045 --> 00:57:18,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Most people didn't even turn it over.

697
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:26,591
[SPEAKER_15]: More effort should be made to clarify exactly what was being voting on and that there was even a ballot question.

698
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:27,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

699
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:27,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

700
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:30,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

701
00:57:30,554 --> 00:57:32,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

702
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:39,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 281 Park Street and the CPA did pass, much to my dismay, but

703
00:57:39,848 --> 00:57:43,392
[SPEAKER_09]: because I didn't feel that the question was as clear and everyone had the information.

704
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:49,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But now that it has passed, when I heard of the Riverside Plaza, I thought, oh, that's a perfect use of our CPA funds.

705
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:58,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm hoping that there's some way that maybe this commission can say, you know what, let's pay for that Riverside Plaza, even if we have to delay the start of it a few months.

706
00:57:58,867 --> 00:58:12,591
[SPEAKER_09]: and take that $250,000 and put it back into the budget and maybe pave four or five roads in the city and beautify the area because who wants to go to a park that's surrounded by streets that are filled with potholes?

707
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:26,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can cover up that railway line on Salem Street because if we have a specific fund that is created for parkland, historic and low income, then that is definitely the first place that we should go for that.

708
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:32,919
[SPEAKER_09]: A half a million dollar project that's funded partially by grant money could be completely funded if we use the CPA money.

709
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be a benefit to the community since that has passed.

710
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:38,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope that will happen.

711
00:58:38,043 --> 00:58:42,406
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a meeting tomorrow night at 630 at the high school, the superintendent's conference room.

712
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:47,470
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go there and make your suggestions to the members of the committee.

713
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

714
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:48,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

715
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:53,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

716
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:54,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Castaneda.

717
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts.

718
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:10,035
[SPEAKER_12]: The CPA tax, it does not hurt me that much at $60 a year approximate versus the $6,000 per year with the real estate tax.

719
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:20,657
[SPEAKER_12]: So putting it on a scale in the scheme of things, I would like to see my owner occupy real estate tax exemption pass at the full 35%.

720
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:25,098
[SPEAKER_12]: The state would give us, and that would

721
00:59:26,248 --> 00:59:43,723
[SPEAKER_12]: save us the $400 future increase under Prop 2.5 and reduce it $400, which would be $800 savings that we've missed out for many, many, many years, as Somerville, Everett, and Malden has been doing so, if you lived in one house, your own house.

722
00:59:45,425 --> 00:59:48,728
[SPEAKER_12]: And as far as the CPA, the vote was

723
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:58,451
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to explain it, but it was on page two and it seemed like 10,500 people voted for the mayorship.

724
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:06,195
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems to me about only 8,500 voted for the CPA.

725
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:11,378
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, it was about $2,000 on my memory that never turned it over.

726
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:17,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And CPA tax is supposed to be used if it ever gets used.

727
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:22,410
[SPEAKER_12]: For one is open space.

728
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:32,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, all of a sudden we possibly have a dirty 21E where I want my bike path to go the one half mile out of the 20 miles that's already built.

729
01:00:33,516 --> 01:00:38,179
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 1 20th is incomplete and that's right behind your council president.

730
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,481
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't understand that.

731
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:44,423
[SPEAKER_12]: If there is a dirty 21E, that is open space.

732
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And if someone started to dig around there for whatever reason,

733
01:00:49,434 --> 01:00:52,577
[SPEAKER_12]: why it was initiated and found arsenic and lead.

734
01:00:53,978 --> 01:00:54,678
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like that.

735
01:00:55,819 --> 01:01:03,045
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Brianna was quoted in the transcript, which I finally read today, that what about the soccer fields over there?

736
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:10,831
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had said previously at one of these meetings, well, how about those pastor already there by the proposed new dog park?

737
01:01:12,893 --> 01:01:16,296
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand this country and the city.

738
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:17,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Something is amiss.

739
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:27,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow night, 630 at the CPA meeting at the superintendent's conference room at Meffitt High School.

740
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,751
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too far for my bicycle.

741
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:30,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, sir.

742
01:01:30,671 --> 01:01:31,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

743
01:01:31,472 --> 01:01:38,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'd like to have a point of clarification.

744
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:46,741
[SPEAKER_00]: The two sections that I'm referring to on the section 18, basically what the proposal says is as follows.

745
01:01:47,608 --> 01:02:08,966
[SPEAKER_00]: At any time after imposition of the surcharge, the legislative body may approve by way of a vote to put on hold any local surcharge tax that cannot receive the matching dollar amount from the state upon population rank in real estate property tax levy calculation, as promulgated by Chapter 44B of the Massachusetts state statute.

746
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:15,131
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows citizen taxpayers to their fair return of their tax payments until such time

747
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:24,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Until such time, the state has the ability to match the intent and return amount as originally intended, as legislated, and voted upon.

748
01:02:25,185 --> 01:02:26,286
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not killing it.

749
01:02:26,386 --> 01:02:31,830
[SPEAKER_00]: All it's doing is, how can you tax somebody for something that you're not getting for what you're supposed to be getting?

750
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:44,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part of it is basically saying, very simply, at the end of five years, after the date of approval, and after Sections 3 to 7, which is inclusive, have been accepted by the city or town,

751
01:02:44,775 --> 01:02:50,360
[SPEAKER_00]: said sections shall come to an end, and the surcharge imposed for the past five years shall end.

752
01:02:50,640 --> 01:03:05,012
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city or town want to continue on with sections three to seven, that's the inclusive part for which the city of Medford accepted, of the Preservation Act, said act shall once again be placed upon the ballot for the taxpayers to vote upon.

753
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:08,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the way it was the first time to be voted upon in November of 2015.

754
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:13,579
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair, but to turn around and leave the law the way it is,

755
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:19,342
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take it off, you've got to go out there and get the signatures to have the people voted off.

756
01:03:19,622 --> 01:03:21,183
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think that's right.

757
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:23,044
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sunset legislation.

758
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:25,245
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it should be after five years.

759
01:03:25,565 --> 01:03:32,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's really working out that if it's working out that well, then maybe the taxpayers will vote it and maybe the taxpayers won't.

760
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:37,630
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't give them that chance in that choice, this will just keep going on at it for item.

761
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:42,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a tax that'll never end because it doesn't have the opportunity to end.

762
01:03:42,973 --> 01:03:43,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

763
01:03:44,193 --> 01:03:48,955
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

764
01:03:49,635 --> 01:03:50,415
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

765
01:03:51,576 --> 01:03:52,916
[SPEAKER_05]: To receive and place on file.

766
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:55,377
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

767
01:03:56,117 --> 01:04:00,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

768
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, just as a point of inquiry.

769
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:05,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of inquiry, please.

770
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand they just received it and placed it on a file.

771
01:04:10,192 --> 01:04:13,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked the council to review it so we could have a discussion.

772
01:04:13,634 --> 01:04:16,235
[SPEAKER_00]: We could review it for the discussion for the July meeting.

773
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:18,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

774
01:04:19,697 --> 01:04:21,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Carviello.

775
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any way you can put the argument in writing for us?

776
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:25,480
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

777
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:27,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to you.

778
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:29,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just have, like, just this?

779
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:31,904
[SPEAKER_00]: One is present and the other one is proposed.

780
01:04:32,044 --> 01:04:32,925
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the section of the law.

781
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,699
[SPEAKER_00]: To the left on the top, it'll say present.

782
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:38,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next one down says proposed.

783
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:49,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to just know exactly the argument, not necessarily the, the law of what the city count, you believe the city council can do.

784
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:52,263
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want, I will send you a letter as it relates to that.

785
01:04:52,823 --> 01:04:53,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

786
01:04:53,483 --> 01:04:53,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

787
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:54,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

788
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:56,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to interrupt you.

789
01:04:56,284 --> 01:04:57,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Counsel DelaRusso.

790
01:04:58,384 --> 01:05:02,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take hands papers in the hands of the clerk by counselor DelaRusso.

791
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:12,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Scott Pelley, be it resolved that the City Council discuss concerns with Airbnb's.

792
01:05:13,488 --> 01:05:14,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

793
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:15,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

794
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:22,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we've talked about this issue in recent past, but I just wanted to revisit this.

795
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:31,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a few phone calls from a few constituents that were very concerned that we have a functioning

796
01:05:32,445 --> 01:05:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Airbnb in our neighborhoods and probably more than one and we're not and we're really not Following what's happening in those those areas and and and look into You know any ordinances or Rules or any health codes that have to be passed.

797
01:05:53,438 --> 01:05:58,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can I don't know if we can Ask the

798
01:05:59,908 --> 01:06:04,509
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can look at what subcommittee we can move this to, if we can.

799
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:06,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we already have this paper in subcommittee.

800
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is.

801
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

802
01:06:11,191 --> 01:06:11,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is it?

803
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:12,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember?

804
01:06:12,831 --> 01:06:14,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, I think you can refer to that.

805
01:06:14,451 --> 01:06:17,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was you that proposed it.

806
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:24,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I've actually drafted a draft ordinance regulating short-term rentals, and I'm just putting the finishing touches on it.

807
01:06:24,374 --> 01:06:25,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually waiting for a little bit of

808
01:06:26,064 --> 01:06:30,306
[SPEAKER_16]: feedback from two neighboring communities, and once I received that information, I was going to produce a paper.

809
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:42,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimately, the paper that I put together with the proposal was to require a short-term rental operator's license, and it would define a short-term rental as a book stay of 29 consecutive nights or fewer.

810
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:54,699
[SPEAKER_16]: The state's division of local services has offered a number of opinions on this relative to whether or not we could tax them as a motel or as a short-term lodging facility, so there are some technical questions and some technical expertise that's going to be

811
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:58,138
[SPEAKER_16]: required, Mr. President, before we can put together a working ordinance.

812
01:06:59,118 --> 01:07:08,339
[SPEAKER_16]: In my research, one of the other things I found is that in a lot of places, they've drafted and implemented ordinances that are so restrictive that they make it impossible to enforce.

813
01:07:08,379 --> 01:07:10,900
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something that I think we need to take a look at as well.

814
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:16,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if we're going to craft an ordinance, we're going to have to craft something that's going to be able to be enforced.

815
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:21,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if it's an ordinance that can't be enforced, people are going to continue with their behavior, and they're not going to comply with the regulations.

816
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:28,795
[SPEAKER_16]: There's been several conversations that I've had between you and I, actually, because we were both working on this together, to address the issue.

817
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:34,097
[SPEAKER_16]: But I thank Councillor Scott Pelly for bringing it up, and I can send him a copy of the draft proposal as soon as the finishing touches are put on it.

818
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:38,179
[SPEAKER_05]: At least for safety reasons anyway, no other reason.

819
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, and I appreciate that.

820
01:07:41,381 --> 01:07:47,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Councillor Knight does an unbelievable job with his homework, so I think it's very important.

821
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:56,553
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the concerns loud and clear about the safety and letting our public safety officials, fire, police know what's going on.

822
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and right now we don't have that.

823
01:07:58,814 --> 01:08:04,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate your effort and, uh, um, I will let those residents know that we'll have something soon.

824
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:04,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

825
01:08:05,597 --> 01:08:05,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

826
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:17,083
[SPEAKER_16]: A couple of the items that, um, would be being looked at would be an annual license, um, a residency requirement for the operator that has to reside in the property.

827
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:22,711
[SPEAKER_16]: On-site and off-street parking must be made available and utilized for all patrons in their vehicles.

828
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:24,732
[SPEAKER_16]: So on-site, off-street parking.

829
01:08:24,752 --> 01:08:26,493
[SPEAKER_16]: That means that they're not going to be parking in neighborhoods.

830
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:29,474
[SPEAKER_16]: No more than two adults per bedroom per stay.

831
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:33,795
[SPEAKER_16]: No more than foreign-related individuals staying during the same stay.

832
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:40,498
[SPEAKER_16]: The provision of a copy of the noise, trash, and parking ordinances posted inside the rental dwelling and included in the rental contract.

833
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:45,120
[SPEAKER_16]: The provision of a 24-7 emergency contact hotline for all the neighbors.

834
01:08:45,733 --> 01:09:14,250
[SPEAKER_16]: to be posted on the front door in case anything happens, a physical safety inspection of the dwelling by the city on a quarterly basis, the cost of which will be borne by the short-term operator, the ability for the city to institute discipline that's progressive up to and including fines and the revocation of license, and the requirements for a general liability insurance policy, Mr. President, and a figure that has to be determined to ensure that personal property and individuals that are staying in the place are

835
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:16,171
[SPEAKER_16]: protected appropriately.

836
01:09:16,231 --> 01:09:18,973
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are the, some of the things, some of the things that we've looked at, uh, thus far.

837
01:09:19,473 --> 01:09:19,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

838
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:21,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

839
01:09:21,794 --> 01:09:22,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

840
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I just want to thank councilor Scott Pollack for bringing this forward.

841
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:34,943
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually did come up at the last, uh, community police meeting through a number of residents from actually different sections of the city, different neighborhoods that had that same concern.

842
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:36,764
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really does impact the quality of life.

843
01:09:36,784 --> 01:09:42,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, take a look, uh, you have more cars in the road, more cars parked in overcrowded neighborhoods.

844
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:47,750
[SPEAKER_11]: cars coming and going at different times of the day and night, so it really does become disruptive.

845
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,032
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that we need to make sure we do have an ordinance in place.

846
01:09:51,052 --> 01:10:02,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that Councilor Knight has been working on this, and hopefully we can meet soon to review this in a subcommittee, but it's something I definitely support, and I thank my colleague for bringing it forward.

847
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:07,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I think last time I looked, I think there was like 74 B&Bs operating in the city of Medford.

848
01:10:07,905 --> 01:10:11,888
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot, there's more than- And this is becoming the Uber of houses.

849
01:10:12,715 --> 01:10:12,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

850
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:16,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's a, it's a major concern and it does impact all neighborhoods.

851
01:10:16,137 --> 01:10:18,658
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, it's something that we need to look at sooner than later.

852
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:20,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

853
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:29,042
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by I'd like to amend the paper.

854
01:10:29,082 --> 01:10:31,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, get an update from our state delegation.

855
01:10:31,063 --> 01:10:35,805
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that there was, um, a paper going through the house of representatives to regulate short term leases.

856
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:38,926
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that there was also a paper in the Senate that was very different that was going through.

857
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:40,827
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we could get an update from our state delegation,

858
01:10:41,378 --> 01:10:44,519
[SPEAKER_16]: as to the deliberations regarding any implementation of state law.

859
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:49,160
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that will be helpful as we look forward to constructing our local ordinance.

860
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,821
[SPEAKER_16]: It needs to comply with the state standard.

861
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:51,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

862
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:53,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

863
01:10:54,182 --> 01:10:55,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caravaglio.

864
01:10:55,682 --> 01:10:59,303
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could just make sure that the whole council gets a copy.

865
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:02,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's going to go to subcommittee, and Councilor Knight's working on it.

866
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:07,445
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could just all get a copy so we can review it in the next month or so, that would be great.

867
01:11:08,205 --> 01:11:10,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give you the next one to watch coming down the line.

868
01:11:10,735 --> 01:11:11,275
[SPEAKER_05]: is Tackler.

869
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:22,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Tackler is an app that allows anybody to do anything on license plumbers, cognitive electricians, to do work on people's houses just by going on an app.

870
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be coming down the line next.

871
01:11:23,722 --> 01:11:24,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll watch.

872
01:11:25,503 --> 01:11:25,864

[SPEAKER_04]: He comes from a very dedicated family in the city of Medford.

883
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:25,424

884

[SPEAKER_04]: He was a fierce campaigner, a one-time candidate himself for the school committee.

01:16:28,092 --> 01:16:32,794

940
01:16:33,075 --> 01:16:39,638
[SPEAKER_05]: We strongly believe that this purchase will not only save dollars to this community.

[SPEAKER_05]: I respectfully request that this paper be forwarded to the Committee of the Whole for deliberation during the budget hearing process.

01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:14,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Councilor Marks.

951
01:17:19,317 --> 01:17:20,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

952
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for the edification of the people at home,

953
01:17:23,818 --> 01:17:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a longstanding issue in the community, leak detection.

954
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I know former Councilor Penta, this was a big issue of his.

955
01:17:34,723 --> 01:17:46,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently right now, Mr. President, it ranges, but the last estimates we received from the MWRA is roughly 17 to 20 percent of our water in the community is unaccounted for water.

956
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:51,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And each and every ratepayer pays additional on their bill for this unaccounted for water.

957
01:17:52,317 --> 01:17:57,300
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular new system is a technology that is an acoustic whistle.

958
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a device they put on the water mains and the gate valves.

959
01:18:01,763 --> 01:18:05,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And it pinpoints where leaks are throughout the entire city.

960
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:10,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And roughly 90% of the leaks that we have out there don't surface.

961
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:13,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are underground leaks that we're not aware of.

962
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:21,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to the company that we met with, Aklar Technologies, the city over a five-year period

963
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:36,019
[SPEAKER_03]: If we spot out these leaks and fix the leaks, we could save roughly $5 million from this $900,000 investment and roughly 15,000 gallons — 15 million gallons of water annually.

964
01:18:36,499 --> 01:18:46,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask, Mr. President, in the interest of moving this forward on behalf of the beleaguered ratepayers of water and sewer in this community, we move this forward.

965
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:50,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also ask, Mr. President, that we get a report back because

966
01:18:51,572 --> 01:19:01,841
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great system and we're going to be alerted of many new leaks that we're not aware of and we also need the capability within our water and sewer department to follow up on these leaks.

967
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:10,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have yet to see any new additional water and sewer employees with the main focus of this particular project in the budget.

968
01:19:11,395 --> 01:19:26,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I also ask, Mr. President, that part of the water unaccounted for in this community, some of its leaks, other of the unaccounted for water is the fact that our whole school department is not paying for water, even though it's needed.

969
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:28,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That's considered unaccounted for.

970
01:19:29,307 --> 01:19:38,852
[SPEAKER_03]: and every municipal building, even though it's meted, is still not being charged, and we don't include that in our operating expense under the budget, which it should be.

971
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,633
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be an operating expense in the budget.

972
01:19:41,954 --> 01:19:45,215
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already sat through the budget side on the municipal side.

973
01:19:45,616 --> 01:19:52,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any additional money for water or sewer on the city side, and tomorrow night we're meeting with the schools.

974
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna ask that question, but I guarantee ya, it's not part of the operating expense

975
01:19:58,227 --> 01:19:59,848
[SPEAKER_03]: of the school side, Mr. President.

976
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:06,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we really want to get a handle on unaccounted for water, to me, that's hydrants, that is leaks.

977
01:20:07,374 --> 01:20:08,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not needed property.

978
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not unaccounted for.

979
01:20:10,817 --> 01:20:16,020
[SPEAKER_03]: When I can tell how much money and how much water you're using, that's not unaccounted for.

980
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:18,422
[SPEAKER_03]: That's accounted for, Mr. President.

981
01:20:18,642 --> 01:20:23,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every taxpayer and ratepayer in this community, their water is accounted for.

982
01:20:24,562 --> 01:20:30,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it'd be nice to have a budget where you don't have to put that in as an operating expense, but that's not reality.

983
01:20:30,904 --> 01:20:32,405
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not reality, Mr. President.

984
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:37,587
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hold the school department and the municipal side accountable for the water they use.

985
01:20:38,187 --> 01:20:39,308
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no incentive there.

986
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,489
[SPEAKER_03]: They can let the faucets run all night here.

987
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:43,329
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care.

988
01:20:43,629 --> 01:20:45,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets put onto the rate payers.

989
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mr. President, we really need to address that.

990
01:20:49,251 --> 01:20:50,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy we're moving forward on this.

991
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:57,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think, as I mentioned, I and I inflow and infiltration with the sewer department, with our sewer pipes.

992
01:20:58,385 --> 01:21:05,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's costing the ratepayers millions of dollars a year to treat groundwater that's seeping into our sewer pipes as raw sewage.

993
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge issue that needs to be addressed.

994
01:21:08,892 --> 01:21:10,373
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one step in the process.

995
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has to be accompanied with additional personnel.

996
01:21:13,955 --> 01:21:15,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

997
01:21:15,977 --> 01:21:17,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we already voted on this a couple of weeks ago.

998
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:20,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we get a response back, Mr. Clerk?

999
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:22,777
[SPEAKER_03]: on our recommendation?

1000
01:21:25,658 --> 01:21:27,559
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there was a resolution offered a few weeks ago.

1001
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:29,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the same exact resolution.

1002
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:29,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1003
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we, I think it came with this.

1004
01:21:31,281 --> 01:21:32,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1005
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:33,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't got a response from that.

1006
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:34,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1007
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should get a response soon.

1008
01:21:37,443 --> 01:21:46,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President on the, why the schools and the municipal side, uh, are not paying through their operating expense of the budget on the motion.

1009
01:21:47,307 --> 01:21:47,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1010
01:21:48,353 --> 01:21:49,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

1011
01:21:49,594 --> 01:21:51,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, just real quick.

1012
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:56,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to point out, I know that this is Debbie Downer time, but it's a hidden tax.

1013
01:21:57,798 --> 01:22:06,163
[SPEAKER_01]: When the water is put on through the water rate payers, it's another hidden tax, and it gets around Prop 2 1⁄2, and I just wanted to make everybody aware of that.

1014
01:22:06,443 --> 01:22:12,406
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nobody wants to hear that, because it's not good news, but it's a hidden tax, and so that's all I wanted to say.

1015
01:22:12,506 --> 01:22:12,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1016
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:13,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1017
01:22:16,275 --> 01:22:18,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, Bob Penton, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

1018
01:22:19,256 --> 01:22:20,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Two components on this particular issue.

1019
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:22,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it's coming up now.

1020
01:22:23,177 --> 01:22:27,799
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is I think it's about $112,000.

1021
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:29,940
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that it would cost.

1022
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:38,383
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we were led to believe and what we were told when we changed over from the old metering system to the new one, to have a computerization program upstairs in the engineer's office.

1023
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:45,912
[SPEAKER_00]: that would detect and identify anybody's house in the city of Medford where water would be constantly running or wherever leak might be.

1024
01:22:46,552 --> 01:22:54,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a daily basis, it would be reviewed, and that homeowner, taxpayer, ratepayer, would be identified either by a phone call or an email or what have you.

1025
01:22:54,754 --> 01:22:56,575
[SPEAKER_00]: That still hasn't taken place.

1026
01:22:57,035 --> 01:23:02,537
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the next big thing you really need to address is that 10 years is already up relative to the meters that are in the houses.

1027
01:23:03,097 --> 01:23:07,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to have to take a second look on those batteries that are in there and just how accurate they are.

1028
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:13,122
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest that you make a resolution to investigate that with the Water and Soil Commissioner.

1029
01:23:13,343 --> 01:23:21,126
[SPEAKER_00]: What's their intent going forward as it relates to the accuracy of the batteries that are there, the meters that are there right now that are over 10 years?

1030
01:23:21,466 --> 01:23:28,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And second of all, why can't some money in that multimillion dollar surplus account be used to put that program

1031
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:30,538
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to have an employee.

1032
01:23:30,618 --> 01:23:33,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an automatic program that just spits it out on a daily basis.

1033
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:41,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just looks at it, and it's just, you know, as Jeannie Martin just said, you know, why keep hurting the taxpayer rate payer for no reason at all?

1034
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:46,601
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just simple, common sense, everyday business practices that should be employed.

1035
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:47,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor.

1036
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:48,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1037
01:23:48,841 --> 01:23:55,563
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, as amended by, I think we had it in the paper, by Councilor Marks.

1038
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:02,351
[SPEAKER_05]: actually report back on the priority of the leaks and how we're going to address this properly.

1039
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:10,453
[SPEAKER_05]: The original paper we were going to report back on the report on the administration will let us know on the priority of the leaks also.

1040
01:24:10,533 --> 01:24:11,434
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as we get an answer.

1041
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1042
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:14,495
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

1043
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:15,775
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

1044
01:24:16,575 --> 01:24:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1045
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:21,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dela Russo?

1046
01:24:21,217 --> 01:24:21,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1047
01:24:22,037 --> 01:24:22,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

1048
01:24:22,637 --> 01:24:22,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1049
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:23,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nays?

1050
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:24,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1051
01:24:24,495 --> 01:24:25,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor McCurran?

1052
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:26,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1053
01:24:26,476 --> 01:24:27,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Monks?

1054
01:24:27,477 --> 01:24:27,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1055
01:24:27,897 --> 01:24:28,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1056
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:31,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Absence.

1057
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:32,700
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caprio?

1058
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:33,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1059
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:37,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absence.

1060
01:24:39,485 --> 01:24:52,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we adjourn on Sunday, January 25th at 10 o'clock at Veterans Memorial Park, we will be dedicating some more, I think about 36 more names will be added to Veterans Memorial Park.

1061
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:56,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if everybody could turn out there, it would be a nice day.

1062
01:24:57,913 --> 01:25:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 o'clock on Sunday, Veterans Memorial Park.

1063
01:25:02,355 --> 01:25:10,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Records of the meeting of June 6th, 2017 were tabled and passed to Vice President Knox.

1064
01:25:12,481 --> 01:25:13,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1065
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:16,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam, do you want to report on the second meeting?

1066
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:16,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1067
01:25:21,704 --> 01:25:23,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Knight to report the subcommittee report.

1068
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:37,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Mr. President, earlier this morning, uh, this afternoon, uh, the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances met to discuss paper, I believe it was 11 474, um, related to, um, wireless telecommunication towers in the city of Medford.

1069
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:43,747
[SPEAKER_16]: A presentation was put on by the, uh, city solicitor and the building commissioner.

1070
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:44,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

1071
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:51,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Upon conclusion of the presentation, the council moved, uh, the subcommittee moved to, uh, refer the paper to the committee of the whole.

1072
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:54,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, the paper is going to go before the committee of the whole for further discussion and deliberation.

1073
01:25:54,873 --> 01:26:04,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, it was a rather well thought out and technical ordinance that governed the placement of cell phone towers and wireless telecommunication facilities in the city of Medford.

1074
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:05,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1075
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:13,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor on the motion by council on the motion by council night that we accept vice president marks.

1076
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:15,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1077
01:26:15,945 --> 01:26:19,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank my council colleague for calling the meeting.

1078
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:34,890
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular ordinance was something that was proposed back in 2011 to address concerns of companies coming into this community and erecting cell towers in residential areas.

1079
01:26:35,651 --> 01:26:39,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time we put together, I believe it was a seven or eight page ordinance,

1080
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:51,203
[SPEAKER_03]: that protected neighborhoods in the first place, and secondly, made it difficult for those who wanted to come in here and thought they just had to apply for a building permit and an electrical permit.

1081
01:26:51,903 --> 01:27:07,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what this ordinance does, Mr. President, it really puts some teeth out there that keeps these particular cell towers to industrial and commercial zone 2 areas and keep them away from neighborhoods.

1082
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:25,171
[SPEAKER_03]: It also puts a number of restrictions, height restrictions, setback restrictions, and, in my opinion, will go a long way to ensuring neighborhoods that all of a sudden a 74-foot cell tower is not going to appear in their neighborhood.

1083
01:27:25,712 --> 01:27:33,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we all are aware, and it was recently on the news, I think it was Channel 5, they did a spotlight report on the MBTA.

1084
01:27:33,898 --> 01:27:35,880
[SPEAKER_03]: The MBTA is looking to raise revenue now,

1085
01:27:36,657 --> 01:27:44,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of that, they're also offering riders on their commuter rail the ability to access the Internet.

1086
01:27:45,379 --> 01:27:52,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And in doing so, Mr. President, they have to erect a number of these cell towers along the route of the train.

1087
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city of Method, as far as I know, we're getting three now.

1088
01:27:57,661 --> 01:28:00,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It was two, and now there was just a third request.

1089
01:28:00,602 --> 01:28:02,142
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting three, Mr. President.

1090
01:28:02,822 --> 01:28:05,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, the intent is to provide

1091
01:28:06,747 --> 01:28:11,368
[SPEAKER_03]: cell communication and Internet access, which is great on the train.

1092
01:28:11,408 --> 01:28:12,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to that.

1093
01:28:12,908 --> 01:28:20,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got to make sure when these cell towers are erected that they're erected in a way that is not a blight to the neighborhood.

1094
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:32,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I'm concerned, the one near Tyler Ave or the address of Tyler Ave is in a neighborhood, Mr. President, even though it's on train tracks that abut the neighborhood.

1095
01:28:32,592 --> 01:28:35,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And Charnwood Road, again, in a neighborhood,

1096
01:28:35,415 --> 01:28:36,495
[SPEAKER_03]: abuts train tracks.

1097
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:40,037
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one, I believe, is in the Wellington area.

1098
01:28:42,357 --> 01:28:43,378
[SPEAKER_03]: On River's Edge, thank you.

1099
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Which does abut residential areas, too, Mr. President.

1100
01:28:47,559 --> 01:28:54,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So this ordinance will go a long way for protecting our neighborhoods.

1101
01:28:54,782 --> 01:29:04,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to the eventual sending this to the Office of Community Development for their recommendations, and then eventual passage, Mr. President,

1102
01:29:04,968 --> 01:29:05,588
[SPEAKER_03]: on this ordinance.

1103
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, counselor, for taking that out of my balls for us.

1104
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:10,831
[SPEAKER_05]: How's the knife?

1105
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:12,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President.

1106
01:29:12,452 --> 01:29:19,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's also very important to point out that although this is an ordinance change, it will have to go through the legislative process, but it's also a zoning change.

1107
01:29:19,536 --> 01:29:25,059
[SPEAKER_16]: So because it's a zoning change, it's going to take about 180 days from start to finish for the paper to come to fruition.

1108
01:29:25,519 --> 01:29:28,140
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to think that people will think this is something we're delaying.

1109
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:31,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, it has to go to the community development board, come back to the council.

1110
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:33,443
[SPEAKER_16]: There has to be a series of public hearings before, uh,

1111
01:29:33,881 --> 01:29:37,664
[SPEAKER_16]: we can move on it, so that's why it's good that we're starting the process now.

1112
01:29:38,324 --> 01:29:38,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1113
01:29:39,525 --> 01:29:44,209
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Nunez, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1114
01:29:44,689 --> 01:29:45,410
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1115
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:45,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1116
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1117
01:29:48,192 --> 01:29:54,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The tabled records of the meeting of June 6, 2017 were passed to Vice President Marks.

1118
01:29:54,877 --> 01:29:58,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Vice President, were you able to review those records, and how did you find them?

1119
01:29:59,881 --> 01:30:01,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I reviewed the records.

1120
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:02,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it to be an honor.

1121
01:30:02,482 --> 01:30:02,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1122
01:30:03,615 --> 01:30:11,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight, for the approval of the records.

1123
01:30:12,537 --> 01:30:19,638
[SPEAKER_05]: The records of the meeting of June 13th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

1124
01:30:20,078 --> 01:30:22,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

1125
01:30:23,138 --> 01:30:24,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the records in order.

1126
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,699
[SPEAKER_02]: My motion will place on file.

1127
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:31,900
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco, all in favor, aye.

1128
01:30:33,206 --> 01:30:34,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1130
01:30:38,335 --> 01:30:39,117
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1131

[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
