    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=0.031s">I'm</a>  interested in the new TV3 station and had questions with regards to the cable advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4.853s">It</a>  was the first I was aware that a committee has been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=9.435s">I'm</a>  obviously out of the loop, so I was just wondering if we could get a copy of how many people are on the advisory committee and who they are, as well as have they met yet, and if there are any minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=20.619s">I'd</a>  like to just amend this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=21.579s">If</a>  there's been any minutes, if we could get a copy of those minutes so we can better see. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=27.574s">what's</a>  been transpired, I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=29.475s">We</a>  have the station up and running to a point and just want to keep an idea of what's happening so we're able to answer people's questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=40.159s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=41.6s">Council</a>  Member, if I could amend that to ask if we're doing interviews for a manager of the station also?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=48.363s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=49.343s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=50.384s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=51.684s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Council Member Dello Russo, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=56.22s">as</a>  amended by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=58.783s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=59.864s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=60.424s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=63.748s">17-535</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=66.911s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council be to be provided a breakdown from the school department of the number of school transfers from one public school to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=76.841s">Request</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=78.842s">in</a>  2015, 16, 17, and the number of transfers allowed by each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=85.044s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the numbers be broken down by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=89.166s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=90.406s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=91.767s">I</a>  believe within the next couple nights we're meeting with the superintendent of schools to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=96.468s">We</a>  don't have it yet, but hopefully we'll get it sooner than later, the budget for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=102.27s">I</a>  was recently asked how many transfers there are from one school to another by a resident, and I have <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=108.065s">I</a>  had no idea, so I said I would put this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=110.446s">I'd</a>  be curious to see how many transfer requests are out there and how many are allowed per each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=117.591s">I</a>  know there's a discrepancy with the amount of children that are in each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=121.714s">So</a>  I just want to see, and there was an issue with class size for one of the grades at the Roberts that was discussed last night at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=132.438s">So</a>  I just want to see how it is all broken down over the last three years so we can get a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=137.459s">When</a>  we look at the numbers, we can kind of have the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=141.12s">I</a>  also want to be able to answer people's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=144.161s">I</a>  know a lot of people do request, I don't know if it's a lot, but people do request transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=149.022s">So</a>  it's just something that we've never asked and we've never got an answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=153.343s">So</a>  I think it'd be relevant to get these answers before we meet with the superintendent or at least before we <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=160.832s">vote</a>  on the budget potentially next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=163.474s">So</a>  if I could move approval with a roll call vote.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=166.576s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=167.597s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=169.138s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=170.859s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lago-Curran and seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, a roll call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=177.603s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=181.646s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=182.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=184.408s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=185.328s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=186.349s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=187.169s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=188.37s">Councilor</a>  Lago-Curran.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=195.018s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=195.838s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=198.5s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=201.002s">17-536,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=204.645s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided a list from the school department of all increased and decreased class sizes within our Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=214.031s">For</a>  example, if a class is adding a class due to class size issues <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=219.348s">of</a>  vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=220.269s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=221.79s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=223.891s">I</a>  put this on last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=226.233s">I</a>  believe it was Wednesday, Thursday, I started getting phone calls with regards to the concern of class sizes, mainly at one school and one grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=237.881s">And</a>  I put this on because there's talk of every year, I'm assuming, depending on the numbers, there may be one or two or three. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=246.287s">I</a>  don't know how many. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=248.667s">where</a>  a teacher is pulled from a grade to accommodate another grade, and I wanted to see how many of those we have this coming year so we can obviously get control of it and make sure all our class sizes allow. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=261.078s">I</a>  believe after last night's meeting, we were guaranteed that all class sizes would be under 22, and I believe the class average is about 20 students per classroom, so I just want to make sure we <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=275.72s">maintain</a>  that level and we make sure that we're gonna provide those little class sizes to everybody, every student across the board.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=283.903s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=284.423s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lango-Kern, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=289.545s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=292.246s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=293.707s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=296.688s">17-537</a>  offered by Councilor Lango-Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=300.349s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=303.868s">with</a>  a list from the school department of all new hires and newly created positions within the fiscal year 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=312.092s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we also receive a list of all positions that have been eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=318.975s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=320.235s">Thank</a>  you again, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=323.257s">Each</a>  year we are left with the large school budget and to look and see, try to figure out who's been added, who's been taken out of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=333.018s">Each</a>  year we have sometimes a position or two or three that has been created which obviously is something that I think needs to be in bold print if not obviously given to us separately so we can understand what is going on in the school system and be able to vote on the budget accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=351.649s">So</a>  I asked for a list of all those new hires and newly created positions as well as all the positions that are being eliminated so we can do our job.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=362.425s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Longo-Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=364.666s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=368.027s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=369.508s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=388.896s">Vice</a>  President Box? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=389.957s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=390.977s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=391.778s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=394.263s">Yes,</a>  five in the affirmative, two in the negative, a motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=402.969s">17-538,</a>  offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the lack of attention from utility companies regarding double poles in our community be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=414.558s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=416.979s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=419.161s">First,</a>  I'd like to, I received a letter from <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=424.572s">Superintendent</a>  of WIRES, Stephen Randazzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=428.495s">And</a>  this is a recent happening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=431.977s">The</a>  letter is dated June 5, 2017, and it's from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=437.581s">As</a>  we all know, National Grid, for many years in this community, was the custodian of all the telephone poles, or I should say a good majority of the telephone poles in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=448.77s">And</a>  just recently, Verizon and National Grid reached an agreement on who the custodian of the poles are, and I think this is pertinent information for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=459.357s">So</a>  I'd like to read just a portion, Mr. President, as I stated dated June 5th, 2017, from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=466.441s">This</a>  is, dear municipal official, this is to inform you that effective May 31st, 2017, National Grid and Verizon have reached an agreement that changes the way the two companies perform <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=478.919s">utility</a>  pole work in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=481.78s">The</a>  agreement updates operating procedures in place for more than 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=485.961s">Under</a>  the new agreement, custodial areas where one or more other pole owner had assumed responsibility for replacing and installing new utility poles on a municipal basis have been eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=499.866s">Instead,</a>  National Grid will be responsible for all replacements, relocations, and new installations of jointly owned poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=507.992s">Verizon</a>  will be responsible for removing all jointly owned poles once the replacement pole is installed and all facility transfers are completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=517.974s">So</a>  right now, Mr. President, according to this letter, Verizon will now be responsible for the removal of all double poles, which is brand new to this community and I think one that people should be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=534.858s">I</a>  offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=537.665s">to</a>  address the lack of attention with utility companies to the number of double poles we have in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=545.812s">According</a>  to our Superintendent Owais, we have a little over 8,400 telephone poles within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=555.204s">And</a>  according to the latest list I just received, there are roughly 245 double poles in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=564.97s">So</a>  if you look at it as a street situation, almost one out of every three streets in our community has a double pole on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=574.506s">Right</a>  now, the current list is Verizon has 88 poles that they're responsible for removing wires, and that's why the pole is still up, the double pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=585.931s">National</a>  Grid has 51 poles they're responsible for, and Comcast has 101 poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=593.815s">The</a>  city of Medford, Mr. President, and I'm proud to report this, back several years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=600.605s">was</a>  on close to, I believe it was 90 to 100 poles, that we had fire call boxes that were still hooked up, and they were holding the utility companies from removing the double pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=612.372s">To</a>  date, Mr. President, we have one double pole on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=618.516s">And</a>  that is a huge accomplishment, and the Superintendent of Wires, Steven Randazzo, should be commended on his work, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=630.126s">putting</a>  together a priority list and getting our city utility, which is the fire call box, off the poles, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=637.93s">But</a>  double poles, as we know, are a blight to our community and a public safety concern to area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=644.594s">Utility</a>  companies are unresponsive and have no incentive to remove double poles in a reasonable time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=651.497s">The</a>  current system for moving poles is dysfunctional and the state law ineffective. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=657.622s">Municipalities</a>  need a new approach that holds utility companies accountable, requiring better coordination and improved communication to resolve this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=669.593s">As</a>  we all know, Chapter 164, Section 34B forbids companies from keeping double poles up for more than 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=678.541s">However,</a>  there is no penalty to the utility company for not complying with the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=684.286s">On</a>  July 28, 2005, the Mass Supreme Court, Judicial Court, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=689.171s">upheld</a>  a lower court ruling overturning a Bedford Mass bylaw imposing $100 a day fine for each set of double utility poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=699.18s">The</a>  court ruled that only the state legislature has the authority to impose a fine for keeping double poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=706.226s">So</a>  based on that decision back in 2005, Mr. President, I offered a council resolution on October 3rd <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=715.343s">2006</a>  requesting our state delegation amend chapter 164 section 34 B allowing city or town to the ability to enact local ordinances or bylaws prohibiting double polls beyond the 90 days punishable by a fine not to exceed a maximum of $100 per occurrence per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=738.074s">Uh,</a>  um, rep score Tino, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=741.941s">Then</a>  on October 6, 2006, based on the council resolution, offered a sponsor to build, Mr. President, with that exact terminology, which would allow, it was House Bill 1675, which would allow local cities and towns to actually find these utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=764.267s">And</a>  it got bantered around in the state house, and <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=770.634s">What</a>  ultimately ended up happening, from what I understand, is that the utility companies were upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=787.026s">The</a>  utility companies, Mr. President, were upset because they said it was unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=793.158s">to</a>  find the custodian of the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=795.899s">For</a>  instance, at the time, if National Grid owned the pole, they also had Comcast, Verizon on the pole, and they may be the ones holding up the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=805.863s">So</a>  they said, how can you find us as the custodian where these other utilities are holding up the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=812.646s">And</a>  in my opinion, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=815.651s">The</a>  responsibility of the utility company that's the pole owner, they have license agreements with all these other attachees that are on the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=827.102s">And</a>  their license agreement states that they have the authority to transfer wires <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=833.01s">at</a>  the attachee's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=834.892s">So</a>  if National Grid thought Comcast was taking too long removing their wires, under their license agreement, they can go in at the attachee's expense and remove the wires, and we can get rid of the double pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=847.061s">So</a>  you can see how the ambiguity that's out there really lends itself to a process that is not functioning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=855.664s">And</a>  this has been an issue, as you can see, it dates back to 2006 and far beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=861.785s">So</a>  what I want to offer tonight, Mr. President, with the hopes of getting approval from this council, is that the state create, and this would be the Department of Telecommunications, they create, Mr. President, a statewide database <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=883.5s">which</a>  they oversee and they enforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=887.323s">Right</a>  now, there's a database called Poll Lifetime Management System, and all the utility companies, it's PLM, all the utility companies and many municipalities have access to this system, so they can go online and look at these reports, which I have a copy in front of me, that states who's on the poll, how long the poll's been there, and who's responsible for taking their wires off. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=911.96s">And,</a>  uh, they have access to this system, but there's no oversight by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=916.984s">So</a>  my, uh, request tonight through a motion of this council is that, uh, we request our state delegation, uh, to file legislation, creating the statewide enforcement and penalty structure under the oversight and responsibility of the mass department of public utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=935.457s">And</a>  by doing so, Mr. President, we'll create a state entity that's responsible for the oversight and also serve as an online tracking process that allows review of the state and possible finding by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=952.74s">So</a>  the municipalities don't have to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=955.12s">It's</a>  the utility, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=956.841s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities, which currently right now is the oversight for utilities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=962.882s">They</a>  should step up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=964.769s">and</a>  take responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=966.71s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation tonight, Mr. President, that our state delegation file legislation to allow enforcement by Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=974.772s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities and also the ability to find, Mr. President, by Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=979.414s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=981.154s">So</a>  we can once and for all put this issue in the rearview mirror and not have to reinvent this issue every year after year when the utility companies <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=993.197s">just</a>  ignoring our request to remove double poles, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=997.479s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1065.534s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1066.954s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1068.134s">I'd</a>  like to kindly request the council to consider the implementation of an ordinance to require property owners to maintain their property at a minimum standard of care and cleanliness. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1080.452s">Some</a>  cities have such an ordinance in place, but Medford does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1084.674s">The</a>  majority of residents do maintain their property in good condition, but the few who do not cause a significant impact to their neighbors and to those who pass by these properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1094.658s">For</a>  example, one, this potential fire hazard for uncut grass that grows to excessive heights that can become a fire hazard in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1105.805s">Two,</a>  the attraction of unwanted animals and pests. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1108.487s">For</a>  example, rotted wood on structures of a property or lying on their property that can attract termites and easily spread to neighboring homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1117.875s">The</a>  attraction of rats, mice that can cause infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1122.939s">Three,</a>  the deterrence of prospective buyers who want to purchase or invest in a property that is in close proximity to a neglected property. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1134.76s">The</a>  depreciation value of a property that is in the vicinity of a neglected or deplorable property. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1141.766s">One</a>  could argue from a legal standpoint that a negligent property owner could be liable for damages because their negligence causes the loss of value to another property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1154.516s">Lastly,</a>  it's simply unsightly, inoffensive to see a neglected property in our neighbourhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1161.018s">In</a>  allowing property to be kept in deplorable conditions goes against the efforts of the city to maintain a sense of pride and decency in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1171.042s">The</a>  city has ordinances in place for dog owners, dog waste, property owners to keep their sidewalks clear of debris and snow, public littering, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1181.057s">Not</a>  having an ordinance in place to address negligent property owners hurts the majority of residents by allowing so-called slum property owners to embarrass our city, cause a depreciation of surrounding property value and increase safety risks. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1197.969s">Additionally,</a>  without an ordinance in place, the city and its residents are helpless to address this issue, leaving individual residents to try and resolve matters on their own, which could result in bad situations amongst neighbors that could lead to civil unrest and violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1215.507s">We</a>  shouldn't have to wait until a bad situation occurs before recognizing the need for a common sense ordinance to ensure Medford can be proud of its city and its surroundings. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1229.638s">I</a>  would like to share a copy of an ordinance from another city regarding the cleanliness expectations from its residents and property owners that I'm happy to leave as a reference for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1243.269s">And</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1291.707s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1292.087s">Yes,</a>  I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1294.508s">First</a>  off, for years, I lived next to a property like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1300.051s">And</a>  for years, I lived next to a property in that <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1305.055s">in</a>  deplorable conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1307.176s">Both</a>  myself and many of my residents, the neighbors on my street have tried for years to reach out to the city to have this addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1316.359s">I</a>  personally myself over the past year have spoken to the building department, the health department, the police, the city, every department that everyone has referred me to, I have contacted and I have been told that there is nothing they can do about it unless <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1333.871s">It's</a>  a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1334.771s">There</a>  was limitations and it brought me to this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1338.492s">There</a>  is no ordinance in the city that allows the city to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1344.893s">You</a>  know, if there was an audience, the city and the police can go there and say, Hey, this is the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1348.814s">You</a>  need to take care of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1350.035s">This</a>  is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1350.915s">Whatever</a>  the conditions as stated forth in an ordinance sort of allows the authorities of the city to enforce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1357.424s">and</a>  or potentially fine property owners if they don't keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1361.685s">Again,</a>  I'm only asking a minimal standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1363.566s">I</a>  mean, I'm not saying they have to keep it as a palace, but there are certain minimal expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1367.687s">I</a>  feel that everybody should respect for your community and for your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1375.63s">I'm</a>  not sure I answered all your questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1378.111s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1378.531s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1448.14s">There's</a>  a portable toilet in the driveway that's been sitting there for six months.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1452.341s">And</a>  to me, that would be ideal for the clean it or lean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1455.642s">That</a>  would be ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1457.063s">So</a>  I think we could remedy, I don't know if you want to give an address, but we can recommend through this council that the board of health as well as code enforcement go out to the property and do a site view.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1470.667s">I</a>  did go to the building department last week and they were, <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1475.867s">I</a>  explained it and they told me there was only limited resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1482.528s">They</a>  were limited to what they could do based on the clean it or lean it that you were referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1489.389s">They</a>  did mention that they were going to go there and try and talk to the owner about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1496.151s">I</a>  haven't heard back. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1499.051s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>
