    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2.571s">I</a>  would like to welcome everyone to the member school committees rules and policy subcommittee meeting for today, Tuesday, April 25 2023 from 430 to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=19.46s">The</a>  agenda for today is we will be discussing, as approved by the committee on January 24th, 2022, the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will review the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan for recommended updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=33.486s">This</a>  meeting is continued from our previous meetings, which were held on December 6th, 2022, March 2nd, 2023, and March 28th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=49.561s">If</a>  you would like to send me any comments or questions rather than raising your hand and just participating in the meeting, you can do that by sending me an email at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=68.033s">Please</a>  include your first and last name, your Medford Street address, if you are not a staff member, if you are a staff member, just say that, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=77.975s">You</a>  can watch this meeting on Medford Community Media, Comcast Channel 15, or Verizon Channel 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=86.158s">You</a>  could also log in on our Zoom meeting, which is https://mps02155-org.zoom.us, backslash J, backslash 974-999-49349. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=107.663s">You</a>  could also call in on a phone by calling 1-929-205-6099. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=111.004s">And</a>  the meeting ID is 974-9994-9349. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=112.744s">You</a>  can also find our agenda and all this information on our website, mps02155.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=117.685s">I'm</a>  going to call the roll.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=136.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=136.969s">Uh,</a>  member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=142.696s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=143.958s">But</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=145.82s">Remember</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=148.023s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=155.118s">fourth</a>  meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=155.679s">I</a>  actually thought this is our third, but it's our fourth meeting on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=159.026s">I'd</a>  like to welcome everyone here, the superintendent, assistant superintendent, the director of <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=167.943s">Special</a>  Director of, what's your title, Jov? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=170.865s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=171.345s">Student</a>  Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=172.626s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=172.966s">That's</a>  the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=173.827s">I</a>  knew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=174.387s">I</a>  was having a moment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=176.629s">And</a>  the principal, assistant principals, I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight and for our attorney, Mr. Greenspan, for making it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=187.476s">So</a>  we are going to, in our last meeting, we <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=193.04s">Discussed</a>  having a lot of questions for Mr. Greenspan, and he was kind enough to provide some answers and go through the current policy, the current <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=204.886s">bullying</a>  prevention and intervention plan, it's a mouthful, and provide his feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=210.93s">So</a>  unless anybody has anything they wanna say, I think it makes sense to share his feedback, bring up the document, share his feedback and go through those items one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=223.858s">And</a>  then if anybody has questions about what he had to say, we can then discuss those. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=230.642s">Does</a>  that sound fine to everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=233.716s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=234.457s">All</a>  right, now let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=235.657s">I</a>  usually am sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=241.842s">There</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=242.622s">Share</a>  is the one button that's green. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=245.144s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=253.43s">All</a>  right, great.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=254.651s">So</a>  for those that might be joining us for the first time, we are reviewing this extensive document to try and find a way to make it more usable, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=263.826s">and</a>  to bring it up to date, as well as identify any areas where we want to actually make policy change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=273.449s">This</a>  is a copy of the document that Mr. Green's been sent back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=280.552s">And</a>  so I will just start at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=284.733s">He</a>  does indicate that by law, we must biannually <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=290.993s">That's</a>  twice every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=295.038s">Every</a>  two years for regulations, we have to go through this document and. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=300.193s">review</a>  it, revise it, or simply approve it as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=304.494s">I</a>  will say that I'm not sure that, well, it says November 2022, I do remember doing that, but I think we just rubber stamped what was already here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=312.617s">So</a>  that's just a comment that we need to really get on this and make sure that it's on a schedule and that we are doing this as required. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=324.921s">Scrolling</a>  down, some of the comments are really, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=329.971s">pretty</a>  straightforward, remove the word new, it's not new. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=335.193s">Anybody</a>  can just jump in since I will not necessarily be able to see you if you raise hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=340.595s">So</a>  just jump in if I say something that you do wanna talk about, I'm gonna just keep going on things where I can't imagine, well, where I don't think that anybody will have something to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=351.578s">This</a>  one here, I do believe we actually had numerous conversations in previous meetings, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=357.16s">Right</a>  now the policy is for any student, and it should say student or member of the school staff, which I think is great because we had wondered about whether we could just incorporate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=369.204s">So</a>  I have taken these comments, the ones that are similar to this one, for instance, it should say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=378.728s">So</a>  I have a Google Doc that I have added that to, and we will look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=386.116s">Again,</a>  same thing, this policy is for students or member of the school staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=398.644s">Okay,</a>  so this gets back to, I have to mute my alerts, I'm sorry, I keep getting email notices that are really annoying and distracting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=409.05s">Okay,</a>  this gets back to what we, so sort of our principal <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=413.528s">point</a>  when we started going through this document, there's a lot of duplication. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=416.289s">So</a>  in this case, this simply says that we will create this very document so that this is that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=424.231s">So</a>  we don't need to include language saying we'll create the thing that we're looking at.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=428.832s">I</a>  have a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=430.072s">It's</a>  my middle.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=430.792s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=431.132s">McLaughlin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=432.233s">So</a>  I'm assuming that the comments on the right are from Attorney Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=437.534s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=438.514s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=438.734s">Because</a>  they yeah, just the Katie me any LT is a little.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=442.075s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=442.621s">confusing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=443.161s">So</a>  just want to make sure that folks know that the comments on the right are from attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=447.625s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=450.787s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=451.708s">I</a>  have not even noticed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=456.011s">Here</a>  we have, this was one that I sort of a question for <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=461.17s">The</a>  educator or administrative team here and the screen span mentions this a couple of different times that this is mandatory, it is not optional and I want to make sure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=476.6s">We</a>  don't have to get into whether it is happening or not right now, but it needs to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=481.924s">And</a>  I also don't have any concept of like, do we really have false accusations happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=488.408s">Which</a>  we talked about extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=491.47s">But</a>  when one does happen, it's required that there is an educational component to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=497.354s">It's</a>  not just like, hey, you accused somebody of bullying and you completely made it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=502.504s">We're</a>  going to just suspend you or give you detention or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=504.986s">And</a>  that's the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=507.448s">It</a>  must include an educational component. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=511.411s">So,</a>  this is a comment and there's nothing to change in this document, because it does say that will be part. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=518.977s">I</a>  just wanted to highlight that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=524.252s">So</a>  this is one that when we've been going through this in the last three meetings, we've done a fair bit of, well, actually, this is the current one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=537.562s">Forgive</a>  me, this is not the new one we've been working up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=540.424s">But</a>  the law is that this is only for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=546.348s">The</a>  suggestion is to remove staff members because a student may make an anonymous complaint against a staff member. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=554.789s">the</a>  school, this says the school can't take disciplinary action, which of course, if an anonymous report comes in about a staff member and the district does an investigation and decides that it's valid, we can't have it in our policy that the district therefore can do nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=576.098s">That</a>  is kind of a, Dr. Edward Benson?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=581.28s">Yes,</a>  I just was going to add that if an anonymous complaint did come in, we would conduct an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=589.085s">So</a>  we would be able, the district can always take an action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=595.649s">I</a>  just wanted to provide that clarification that, so if it's, you know, if legally it's not supposed to be in there, that's fine that it's removed.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=608.518s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=608.998s">I</a>  do have a question, oh, Mayor McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=612.037s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=612.618s">Yeah,</a>  I think it needs to be parsed out a little bit because it's a little confusing in terms of the way I'm looking at it so if I understand it correctly, an anonymous complaint of bullying or retaliation will not result in disciplinary action taken against a student, obviously until <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=629.196s">an</a>  investigation is made, I would assume it says solely on the best on the basis of an anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=635.44s">So</a>  in other words, they're not going to take disciplinary action against a student, for example, suspending a student solely on the basis of an anonymous report, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=647.092s">should</a>  there be an investigation based on an anonymous report and the investigation shows that there was, you know, reasonable cause for bullying or whatever, that then disciplinary action should be taken, can be taken even against the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=660.904s">So</a>  I think this whole thing is a little bit confusing and I just want both Howard to clarify because obviously I think if there's a staff member <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=671.148s">disciplinary</a>  action can be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=673.009s">But</a>  again, I would assume it wouldn't be based solely on an anonymous report, which says solely on the basis of an anonymous report, that there would be an investigation to determine that the anonymous report was accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=685.298s">Because</a>  obviously, anonymous reports, you know, could just be somebody, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=691.722s">you</a>  know, creating a hoax or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=694.283s">So</a>  I guess it's just a little bit unclear to me, and I think maybe instead of having it be like three sentences right now, which is essentially what it is in one sentence, that we might want to just break it down into individual sentences or something, because I'm not really understanding what you guys are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=713.169s">In</a>  terms of how, I'm sorry, just to clarify, in terms of how it applies to <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=718.497s">a</a>  student but not a staff member or a staff member but not a student based solely on the basis of an anonymous report, which I think anything based solely on the basis of anonymous report, disciplinary action wouldn't be taken because it couldn't be unless it was confirmed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=736.293s">Well,</a>  I think this policy only will now apply to students, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=743.88s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=744.697s">part,</a>  because we did add our members of the community, the school community or school staff in another spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=752.96s">But</a>  this is the I'm sorry, which section are we in? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=756.322s">Sorry,</a>  we're in the never ending section without titles.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=760.963s">But</a>  so yeah, this first part is about false accusations.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=768.306s">And</a>  then the second sentence is unrelated, it seems.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=772.408s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=774.945s">So</a>  as member McLaughlin said, like, you know, this should be broken, separated.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=779.971s">I</a>  would probably say no disciplinary action will be taken against a student on the basis of an anonymous report because, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=801.121s">Well,</a>  first of all, we're not gonna take any action against anybody based on an anonymous report.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=805.743s">Exactly,</a>  based solely on an anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=807.824s">It's</a>  the solely, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=809.184s">So</a>  that was the piece that I'm talking about.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=811.025s">Right,</a>  that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=812.646s">But</a>  what I'm trying to understand is, if there's an anonymous report against a student, we'll skip the staff and all that other stuff for now, against a student, and then our administration or the principal or whoever does an investigation and determines that there's something there, they are still allowed to <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=831.817s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=832.878s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=833.638s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=834.759s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=835.879s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=839.461s">Can</a>  you clarify when you say, when your comments say only includes a student, like, can you clarify what that like means in an overarching sense for the policy, like under the law?</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=858.01s">Under</a>  the law, we're talking about a, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=863.265s">bullying</a>  report, bullying student to student, basically, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=872.015s">Point</a>  of information, or actually raising my hand.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=877.001s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=878.867s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=879.267s">I</a>  don't think that's the impression that we've had, Howard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=882.488s">And</a>  so I guess maybe that begs the question if you're saying that that is what is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=888.23s">I</a>  think that according to what I saw in the DESE bullying standards, it can be a student or a staff member. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=895.532s">I</a>  don't think it can be a parent or community member. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=898.473s">I</a>  think you're right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=899.353s">I</a>  think outside of the school is a different issue, although there's some gray areas around social media and that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=907.315s">particularly</a>  with student and staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=908.936s">So</a>  I would agree with you that I don't think it could be a parent, caregiver, or community member, but the student and staff member, I think it can be based on what I've seen in terms of my own research on DESE and bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=924.404s">So</a>  I would say, yeah, includes staff members.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=928.306s">I</a>  think we should just clarify to make sure that no action is taken based on solely on the basis of an anonymous report.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=939.07s">and</a>  remove parent caregiver.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=944.934s">Howard,</a>  are you saying that under the law, an allegation cannot be brought against anybody but a student or a staff member?</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=963.765s">I</a>  believe so, and I'll double check that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=970.279s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=970.659s">I</a>  think that's what I'm trying to be clear about is like, what is, what are the, like the, the actor parameters that you're saying we need to adhere to, to make sure that we actually are adhering to those.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=985.306s">I'll</a>  double check that and get back to you by email.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=993.19s">Um,</a>  I do think, um, the.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=998.898s">But</a>  I do wanna be clear that, and we'll get to this further on, but that the, am I correct, Howard, that the only people who can file bullying complaints are students and staff?</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1012.762s">Yes,</a>  I believe so.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1014.562s">So</a>  our form that is available for the community, frankly, on our website, parents, caregivers, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1026.941s">Anybody</a>  in the community can't just fill it out to accuse a student or staff member of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1032.684s">The</a>  bullying that is defined by this law, I mean, bullying has a broader meaning and set of situations, but for the purposes of our forms and our process and our authority, it's students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1051.476s">I</a>  believe so, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1053.017s">And</a>  then when I mentioned that to member Graham, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1055.815s">in</a>  a conversation we had earlier today, you know, the question was like, well, how does a five-year-old file a bullying report? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1065.018s">And</a>  of course, in my mind, like hopefully the staff member that was around would be doing it, but that sort of seemed like a pretty good example of, I mean, and maybe it's just a matter of like whose name gets listed is the student, even if they're not typing, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1085.218s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1086.779s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1088.659s">I</a>  think that that's, you know, respectfully, Howard, I think that parents and caregivers and even community members can file a report of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1097.382s">And</a>  I think that, you know, Joan, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1099.842s">Bowen</a>  will have some background on this and maybe Dr. Cushing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1106.304s">But</a>  I think that they can, in fact, in fact, I know that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1113.751s">And</a>  that they are required to be investigated because there's going to be sometimes student sometimes you can imagine all kinds of scenarios where a student may be getting bullied and not want to file a complaint and the parent does right and because it's you know an important issue and what have you so there's a whole bunch of nuance around this, but I do think that we're confusing two issues and I guess this is what. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1134.081s">I</a>  want to parse out a little bit for folks so that we're not right now, we went from talking about anonymous reports to a whole other subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1142.788s">So</a>  I guess I'd like to, you know, finish up the anonymous report question comment, which I think the whole issue is that this is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1154.717s">based</a>  solely, you know, solely on the basis of anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1158.3s">So,</a>  you know, that they can't be disciplined based solely on an anonymous report, which I would agree with, and I think is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1166.768s">I</a>  don't know the question of whether a parent, caregiver, or community member can be disciplined by the school or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1172.974s">Any</a>  other action can be taken against this <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1174.955s">them</a>  on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1176.156s">And</a>  that's where the nuance around parent, caregiver or community member came in for me, not about whether or not they can file a bullying report, because I believe that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1186.882s">So</a>  I think we're like mixing up a couple of issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1189.603s">And</a>  I would respectfully ask that maybe we break them down and, you know, finish one before we potentially start another.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1197.287s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1198.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1199.122s">I</a>  think the anonymous stuff, in my mind, we've finished that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1203.666s">But</a>  I do think we would want to tread very carefully about like, if one of our students goes to a restaurant and bullies the staff, business owners and staff members from a restaurant showing up at Medford public schools to file a bullying report is a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1226.618s">I</a>  wouldn't support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1228.379s">And</a>  not that I don't think it should get addressed, but I mean, it does seem like an expansion that doesn't make sense in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1242.568s">And</a>  I mean, I don't know that- Sorry, just a point of information here.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1245.23s">I'm</a>  not sure what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1246.511s">Are</a>  you talking about an anonymous report or an other report? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1249.953s">I'm</a>  not sure what you're saying.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1252.075s">Well,</a>  the only anonymous reporting can happen by people who actually have access to our anonymous reporting system, which are students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1259.719s">I</a>  mean, we're not going to take a piece of paper slipped under somebody's door and call that a report.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1264.143s">Well,</a>  if I'm not mistaken, it's on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1266.464s">Well,</a>  it's on the website, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1268.305s">It's</a>  not just... Yeah, you're right.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1270.006s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1270.406s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1270.987s">I</a>  forgot about that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1272.307s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1272.728s">So</a>  in any case, I guess what I'm saying is, what are we talking about right here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1276.27s">Because</a>  I'm not talking about a student going to a business and something happening there, which obviously is another issue and is a whole other nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1285.015s">And</a>  I think that we could get into all of these various conversations and throw a million different scenarios in the pot and you know go go down that road and I don't think anybody has the time for that I think what I'm trying to say is that okay for the anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1298.008s">You</a>  know, I believe Howard attorney Greenspan is going to check on the parent caregiver or community member issue which I don't think can be included there personally because the school is not going to take disciplinary action against parent care giver or community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1311.722s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1312.683s">Number</a>  two, I think the other issue around whether you know <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1317.873s">caregivers,</a>  or community members for that matter, can file a bullying report, which is different than an anonymous report, which frankly they can based on the website, but a bullying report is another question altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1329.856s">Certainly</a>  I know parent caregivers are, potentially community members can too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1333.357s">What</a>  happens if you have a kid in DCF custody who's only confiding in their parish member? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1338.699s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1339.16s">And</a>  they're being bullied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1340.241s">I</a>  mean, I would assume they would go to a staff member and have that worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1342.844s">But</a>  but we don't necessarily know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1344.305s">So</a>  I think, again, that's probably a question for Attorney Greenspan to answer in terms of who can file a bullying report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1351.693s">But</a>  I just want to say for folks watching and others, I you know, and certainly they can look on Desi's website themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1358.06s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1358.84s">I</a>  firmly believe that parent caregivers can and in fact have so and I would defer to Dr. Cushing and Joan Bowen and the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[tZVXN6zzUHw_SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1372.605s">Hi,</a>  thank you, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1374.826s">So</a>  in looking at the model forms on the state website, it does list parent as someone who can fill out a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1384.669s">So</a>  I think what it was, was a few years ago when we went through this, we basically cleaned up the formatting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1392.131s">And</a>  didn't really touch a lot of the substance but updated all of the forms, because the model form is a pretty abysmal form for actual practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1402.04s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1403.181s">It's</a>  two sided it doesn't offer a lot of space for writing and things like that so two years ago, we didn't go through and have these great in depth conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1411.608s">And</a>  I think what is a holdover is that parent, caregiver, or community member, what we probably did, what I probably did two years ago was put caregiver in where parent was because that's the language that Medford and other places are using. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1429.556s">So</a>  I think if we just said student or staff member, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1434.498s">that</a>  would be appropriate for whoever it be, and then remove parent, caregiver, or community member, because as people have mentioned, we don't have the capacity to get involved in that, other than say, recommend that maybe they need to file the criminal harassment complaint against those individuals with local law enforcement.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1454.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1455.55s">Mr.</a>  DeLava, did you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1459.432s">I</a>  see your hand.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1460.452s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1462.225s">So</a>  I've been reading this thing like four times in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1466.746s">No,</a>  no, I'm glad, but I just want to make sure we go back to what I keep reading was this is related to the false accusation, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1477.289s">Like</a>  we were getting confused on two different things of make a report who can't, but I keep reading this part and I'm like, okay, this is what I brought up last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1488.088s">which</a>  is the false accusation part where we did sort of a bullying investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1493.03s">The</a>  parent did not feel that the assessment of bullying was accurate and therefore felt that somebody falsely filled out this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1502.654s">So</a>  now how does that person get affected? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1505.555s">I</a>  guess that's how I'm thinking of that.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1508.576s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1508.917s">I</a>  appreciate bringing that back around because I think I got lost in this anonymous part. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1514.739s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1518.655s">So</a>  anyway, so I think we can, Dr. Cushing's hand is up still because he needs to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1525.738s">I</a>  think we can move on from this paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1527.219s">I</a>  think one thing that's very evident, there's no structure to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1530.94s">It's</a>  just a long dump. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1533.101s">And</a>  so we will tease those things apart between anonymous versus filing a bullying report, which is not an anonymous report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1544.106s">And</a>  then I guess I will ask the question, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1550.665s">and</a>  I forgive me for not remembering this, but is anonymous reporting even part of the law? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1557.308s">It</a>  is, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1559.148s">Which</a>  I find sort of fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1560.789s">It's</a>  like, how can you have a form to fill out if it's anonymous? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1565.511s">There's</a>  no form if it's anonymous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1567.092s">It's</a>  the same as slipping a piece of paper under somebody's door and thinking that that's a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1573.576s">Not</a>  that I don't think we should have anonymous stuff, but I guess we'll have to normalize that and figure out how to bring it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1579.539s">But</a>  we should move on to the next comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1584.662s">This</a>  was another one of those, make sure we're doing it, the educational parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1592.046s">Actually.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1593.58s">make</a>  sure this is happening since it is in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1596.182s">This</a>  is more than what is required for the regulations.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1603.806s">I</a>  have a point of information.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1606.147s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1606.768s">Just</a>  what is, how are we going to make sure that that is happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1609.85s">So</a>  I think it needs to be built into the school calendar.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1612.151s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think,</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1620.103s">Oh,</a>  that the plan gets reviewed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1622.245s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1623.486s">We</a>  have our policy on annual, on reports and presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1630.151s">So</a>  I think that we might be able to slip that in there as something like, because we have things that are every couple of years or even every three years, and we can have it in there that will receive a presentation with the recommended edits and changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1644.283s">And</a>  that sort of will work backwards from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1646.524s">Remember,</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1648.862s">Um,</a>  Howard is your point that the law requires us to do this every two years and we are saying we are going to do it every one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1657.486s">And</a>  is that really a decision that we need to make?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1660.647s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1663.268s">I</a>  think that's the question.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1666.05s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1666.49s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1667.15s">Um,</a>  I didn't quite get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1668.991s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1669.571s">Um,</a>  unless anybody has any recommendations differently, I think we should switch back to doing the two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1675.214s">I</a>  mean, we haven't even been keeping up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1677.795s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1678.478s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1680.579s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1682.54s">Good</a>  idea.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1682.8s">Do</a>  we need to make a motion or do we just want to say yes?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1687.182s">I</a>  don't think we need to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1688.403s">All</a>  right, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1689.303s">Then</a>  I agree.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1690.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1697.888s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1700.409s">Next</a>  up we have</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1706.226s">Member</a>  Musso, can you just hover over that item so we can see the comment open? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1711.788s">Yeah,</a>  because we don't know which one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1712.908s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1713.308s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1715.929s">So</a>  this one says, this seems very broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1717.53s">It</a>  might not be possible the way it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1720.211s">This</a>  is the document that all unacceptable student behavior and treating these incidents with standard school disciplinary procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1728.793s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, this would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1734.26s">I</a>  mean, every kindergarten teacher would spend their whole day just writing up reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1739.063s">And</a>  they wouldn't actually spend time with their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1741.885s">So</a>  I certainly understand that this is wildly broad as written. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1747.828s">But</a>  perhaps we actually don't include this and and <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1761.18s">I</a>  mean, we have other policies that say how things should be reported and those can stand on their own.</p>

    <p>[hGxT3FthToQ_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1767.584s">I'm</a>  just going to go in the other room while this finishes, Jay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1770.966s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1772.446s">Could</a>  we just remove the word all? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1775.748s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1777.889s">We</a>  could do that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1786.414s">Because</a>  I think we do want <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1789.0s">there</a>  to be an expectation that schools are documenting instances of unacceptable behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1793.343s">I</a>  think the two variables there is all is a really aggressive word to use when you talk about documenting things that happen in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1802.969s">And</a>  then I think the other squishy word there is unacceptable because that means very different things to very different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1811.353s">Um,</a>  but I think if you take out all, I could live with the gray area and the judgment required to say, is this like infraction, like something to document yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1828.085s">Um,</a>  and to leave that in the hands of the, of the buildings, but to set the expectation that we do expect documentation from schools to be happening on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1841.604s">because</a>  I think that part is important, that that expectation is clearly coming from the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1848.729s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1848.949s">And</a>  this has been the policy since 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1851.15s">So</a>  it's not like we're expanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1853.291s">In</a>  fact, we're sort of contracting by taking the word all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1857.594s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1861.376s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1861.797s">I</a>  mean, I think this gets back to the incident report issue that we've been talking about for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1865.979s">And</a>  so I agree that all should be taken out, but I think that we need to think about <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1871.318s">if</a>  they're documenting incidences of unacceptable student behavior and treating these instances with standard school disciplinary procedures, then I would say, one, parent caregivers need to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1884.589s">And</a>  two, with the understanding that there are unique legal requirements and procedures for students with disabilities.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1895.778s">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1896.959s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1897.56s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1901.268s">Yes,</a>  we've talked about that on the floor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1903.91s">And</a>  I think we don't want to put all that into this one bullet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1908.855s">But</a>  I think that's a really good point.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1911.437s">But</a>  I would consider that out of the scope for this policy, because there are other policies and procedures that govern all of those things that are separate and distinct from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1926.19s">policy.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1927.231s">But</a>  I actually no, I disagree because I think that it needs to be we talk about communication all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1933.534s">And</a>  I think that yes, while those other policies are there, that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1936.935s">But</a>  people who are reading these may not know that those other policies are there, whether their parents or caregivers or anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1942.638s">So</a>  I think it's really important that we reiterate things throughout our district in terms of policies and procedures and that folks are aware of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1951.923s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1952.684s">I</a>  would actually disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1953.605s">I</a>  think that there should be either if it's separate bullet items for, you know, how the incident reports are handled and or a separate bullet item for, you know, understanding legal procedure around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1967.86s">students</a>  with disability and manifestation of disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1970.864s">And</a>  then I would also say, I mean, I would go back to the to the unacceptable point I mean I hear what you're saying but I think it is a value statement and I get, you know, student some student behavior is unacceptable some student behavior is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1983.118s">anything</a>  else, but if we're trying to think about student strength based language, you know, we can just say during documenting incidences of student behavior and treating these incidents with standard school disciplinary procedures as needed or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1996.08s">So</a>  that we're, you know, I think that putting a value statement on things is not necessarily helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2001.101s">And</a>  if we want to be strength based as a district, I think we should be reconsidering those. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2004.942s">So</a>  two items I have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2006.362s">One</a>  is, you know, two distinct bullet items around, you know, or included in this bullet item, I don't care around <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2012.955s">You</a>  know incident report incidents, you know documentation of incidents are shared with you know caregivers and. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2021.325s">There</a>  is an understanding that there are unique procedures and policies for students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2028.089s">so</a>  that people can cross-reference that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2029.73s">And</a>  for more information or something, go here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2032.552s">But</a>  I think, again, some family members, caregivers who are invested in looking at the bullying policy might not know about the special education students with disabilities laws and policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2043.78s">And</a>  so having that reiterated, I think is important.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2048.043s">I</a>  would be fine with removing unacceptable, but I am absolutely against duplicating information across multiple policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2057.463s">a</a>  disastrous nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2058.604s">I</a>  think if we want to put a link that references, um, standard disciplinary procedures, uh, for students with and without disabilities, I think that's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2069.049s">As</a>  long as it's a link that sends somebody somewhere relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2072.671s">Um,</a>  but I am not in favor of replicating information into this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2076.373s">It</a>  just, it will make it unmanageable and unwieldy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2079.835s">And</a>  I don't think we, uh, as a district have a track record of <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2085.57s">maintenance</a>  of our policies and procedures, and we're just making it worse by duplicating information.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2091.957s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2092.317s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to add that not related to the content of the conversation, but certainly that good policy should not contain other policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2102.497s">other</a>  than a link to them, because if we had a high quality document management system and our policies were all up to date, I think there's a real case to be made for inclusion in other policies, language from other policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2117.327s">But</a>  that would, of course, at the same time when we change that other policy, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2122.63s">the</a>  system that we don't have would literally tell us, hey, you have to go change policy X, Y, Z, because this language is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2130.554s">At</a>  this time, it is literally a manual process or anybody who happens to remember, and we definitely cannot handle that at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2139.758s">You</a>  know, we have this problem with the handbooks, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2144.34s">We</a>  update policy, some of that policy gets stuck into the handbooks because it has to be there, but then <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2150.132s">we</a>  update the policies and the handbooks don't get updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2152.453s">Or</a>  somebody updates the handbooks as if they're not actual policy and the policy says something different than the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2157.974s">So</a>  I do think trying to make sure we provide a link to whatever other policies are relevant here is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2167.356s">And</a>  I think we've started to do that in other policies where we say something and we just literally say, see policy, whatever, so that folks can see the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2179.787s">It's</a>  not perfect, of course, but I think considering we also want to change those other policies, I think, because the law changed, we don't want that work to become this work, because in this work, we'll be meeting on this policy for the next five years straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2198.34s">And</a>  we do have to meet every two years on it as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2202.062s">So</a>  that's my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2204.364s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vincent, I see your hand's up.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2206.899s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2208.64s">I</a>  just wanted to weigh in just to say this is definitely a very rich conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2215.382s">But</a>  I also wanted to just say this is now our fourth time we have official legal counsel on the call helping us pass through this bullying document. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2229.147s">And</a>  I actually feel like even though the original document was too long, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2235.47s">We</a>  should probably really make a concerted effort to see how we could really get the document down to be a manageable size document, so that it isn't overwhelming to families and to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2249.973s">And</a>  focus on the key, the key pieces that need to be in the policy, following the law, because I think it is true, if we end up echoing what was just shared by member Graham and member was so that if we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2267.888s">We</a>  can make references to other policies, but we haven't gotten into the habit of just being able to clearly cite a policy because the policies are on, you know, that's the whole point of the subcommittee, trying to get us to a place where we're going to have <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2288.28s">clean</a>  policies that people will understand that are easy to translate, that are digestible for all stakeholders, for them to understand, okay, this is what I need to do when bullying takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2300.329s">So</a>  I almost feel like now that we have the language or we have highlights for the areas that need to stay legally because of the law, let's stick with those pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2312.398s">And</a>  then again, if it means creating a separate policy, but freestanding, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2318.082s">I</a>  would be in support of that because we're only on page five and if at this rate, we'll be lucky if we even make it to page eight by six o'clock and there are many, many, many comments that need to be adjusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2339.791s">Some</a>  of the comments I think <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2343.14s">instead</a>  of student member of the school staff, you know, like some comments might be able to just be tweaked and everyone will be able to accept those comments, but also just for us to feel like we're able to make progress because May is next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2358.931s">And</a>  to member Ruseau's point, like if, if we can't at least, you know, make a decision to get through this one policy during this school year, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2369.858s">We're</a>  going to be still working on this policy come September, so that that was just my. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2377.696s">I</a>  encourage us to kind of like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2380.914s">focus</a>  on the bullying, focus on the key pieces that we need to focus on and not mix multiple policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2391.919s">This</a>  was our attempt a few years back trying to update it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2395.381s">And</a>  as we can see, there were many flaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2397.742s">There</a>  were areas that were repeated unnecessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2402.804s">And</a>  I just feel like we should really try to get this document down to at least half its size if that's possible.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2411.244s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2412.184s">I</a>  do think it's definitely possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2414.947s">Member</a>  Graham and Member McLaughlin, if you could just try to limit your comments to another minute so we can move on.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2423.534s">I</a>  appreciate that this is incredibly painful and I wish that lots and lots of people before the people on this call had taken seriously this work in a way that would have made this easier, but we are here and we have to do this work and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2438.798s">tedious</a>  and painful, and I think we're making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2442.04s">So,</a>  um, I just want us to stay focused on that and to button it up at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2446.842s">Um,</a>  in the last meeting, I volunteered that once we had clarity from our attorney about what these, um, things were that we could or could not do, um, that I would then go through and take a cut at trying to make this digestible for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2462.831s">That's</a>  not work I can do until we get through these comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2466.143s">I'm</a>  still happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2467.285s">I'm</a>  happy to do that after this meeting, but it is not work that is productive until we have clarity from the attorney, which is I think the whole point of this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2478.097s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2478.457s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>
