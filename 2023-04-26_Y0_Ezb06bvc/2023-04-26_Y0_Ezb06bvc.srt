00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:22,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

15
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,518
[SPEAKER_06]: But it.

16
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember McLaughlin.

17
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:28,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

18
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:35,619
[SPEAKER_05]: fourth meeting.

19
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually thought this is our third, but it's our fourth meeting on this topic.

20
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:46,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to welcome everyone here, the superintendent, assistant superintendent, the director of

21
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Special Director of, what's your title, Jov?

22
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:51,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

23
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Student Services.

24
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:52,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

25
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:53,507
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the word.

26
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:54,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it.

27
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I was having a moment there.

28
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:04,754
[SPEAKER_05]: And the principal, assistant principals, I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight and for our attorney, Mr. Greenspan, for making it.

29
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are going to, in our last meeting, we

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:23,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Discussed having a lot of questions for Mr. Greenspan, and he was kind enough to provide some answers and go through the current policy, the current

31
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:30,790
[SPEAKER_05]: bullying prevention and intervention plan, it's a mouthful, and provide his feedback.

32
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:42,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless anybody has anything they wanna say, I think it makes sense to share his feedback, bring up the document, share his feedback and go through those items one at a time.

33
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if anybody has questions about what he had to say, we can then discuss those.

34
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:51,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound fine to everyone?

35
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:54,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

36
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:55,637
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, now let's see.

37
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually am sharing.

38
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:02,482
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

39
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Share is the one button that's green.

40
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:05,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

41
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,271
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

42
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:22,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those that might be joining us for the first time, we are reviewing this extensive document to try and find a way to make it more usable,

43
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:31,589
[SPEAKER_05]: and to bring it up to date, as well as identify any areas where we want to actually make policy change.

44
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,472
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a copy of the document that Mr. Green's been sent back to me.

45
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I will just start at the top.

46
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:49,575
[SPEAKER_05]: He does indicate that by law, we must biannually

47
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That's twice every two years.

48
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:58,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Every two years for regulations, we have to go through this document and.

49
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:03,214
[SPEAKER_05]: review it, revise it, or simply approve it as it is.

50
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:12,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that I'm not sure that, well, it says November 2022, I do remember doing that, but I think we just rubber stamped what was already here.

51
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:22,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a comment that we need to really get on this and make sure that it's on a schedule and that we are doing this as required.

52
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:29,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Scrolling down, some of the comments are really,

53
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:32,932
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty straightforward, remove the word new, it's not new.

54
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:39,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody can just jump in since I will not necessarily be able to see you if you raise hands.

55
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:49,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So just jump in if I say something that you do wanna talk about, I'm gonna just keep going on things where I can't imagine, well, where I don't think that anybody will have something to say.

56
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:55,640
[SPEAKER_05]: This one here, I do believe we actually had numerous conversations in previous meetings, but,

57
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:09,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now the policy is for any student, and it should say student or member of the school staff, which I think is great because we had wondered about whether we could just incorporate that.

58
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:18,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have taken these comments, the ones that are similar to this one, for instance, it should say that.

59
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:23,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a Google Doc that I have added that to, and we will look at that.

60
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:30,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, same thing, this policy is for students or member of the school staff.

61
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:47,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this gets back to, I have to mute my alerts, I'm sorry, I keep getting email notices that are really annoying and distracting.

62
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this gets back to what we, so sort of our principal

63
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:56,189
[SPEAKER_05]: point when we started going through this document, there's a lot of duplication.

64
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:04,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this case, this simply says that we will create this very document so that this is that document.

65
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:07,591
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't need to include language saying we'll create the thing that we're looking at.

66
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:10,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a point of information.

67
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:10,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my middle.

68
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

69
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:11,672
[SPEAKER_09]: McLaughlin.

70
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:16,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming that the comments on the right are from Attorney Greenspan.

71
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:17,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

72
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:18,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

73
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:21,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they yeah, just the Katie me any LT is a little.

74
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:22,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

75
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,121
[SPEAKER_09]: confusing.

76
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:27,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So just want to make sure that folks know that the comments on the right are from attorney.

77
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

78
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:31,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

79
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not even noticed it.

80
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:40,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have, this was one that I sort of a question for

81
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:55,372
[SPEAKER_05]: The educator or administrative team here and the screen span mentions this a couple of different times that this is mandatory, it is not optional and I want to make sure that.

82
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,343
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to get into whether it is happening or not right now, but it needs to be happening.

83
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:07,187
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also don't have any concept of like, do we really have false accusations happening?

84
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:10,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we talked about extensively.

85
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:17,314
[SPEAKER_05]: But when one does happen, it's required that there is an educational component to it.

86
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just like, hey, you accused somebody of bullying and you completely made it up.

87
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,966
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to just suspend you or give you detention or whatever.

88
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the end.

89
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:29,570
[SPEAKER_05]: It must include an educational component.

90
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:38,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is a comment and there's nothing to change in this document, because it does say that will be part.

91
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to highlight that.

92
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:56,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one that when we've been going through this in the last three meetings, we've done a fair bit of, well, actually, this is the current one.

93
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgive me, this is not the new one we've been working up.

94
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:05,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But the law is that this is only for students.

95
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The suggestion is to remove staff members because a student may make an anonymous complaint against a staff member.

96
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:34,098
[SPEAKER_05]: the school, this says the school can't take disciplinary action, which of course, if an anonymous report comes in about a staff member and the district does an investigation and decides that it's valid, we can't have it in our policy that the district therefore can do nothing about it.

97
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:39,560
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of a, Dr. Edward Benson?

98
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I just was going to add that if an anonymous complaint did come in, we would conduct an investigation.

99
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would be able, the district can always take an action.

100
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:06,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to provide that clarification that, so if it's, you know, if legally it's not supposed to be in there, that's fine that it's removed.

101
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

102
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a question, oh, Mayor McLaughlin.

103
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:12,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

104
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:27,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it needs to be parsed out a little bit because it's a little confusing in terms of the way I'm looking at it so if I understand it correctly, an anonymous complaint of bullying or retaliation will not result in disciplinary action taken against a student, obviously until

105
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:34,980
[SPEAKER_09]: an investigation is made, I would assume it says solely on the best on the basis of an anonymous report.

106
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:44,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, they're not going to take disciplinary action against a student, for example, suspending a student solely on the basis of an anonymous report, but I think that

107
00:10:47,092 --> 00:11:00,824
[SPEAKER_09]: should there be an investigation based on an anonymous report and the investigation shows that there was, you know, reasonable cause for bullying or whatever, that then disciplinary action should be taken, can be taken even against the student.

108
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:09,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this whole thing is a little bit confusing and I just want both Howard to clarify because obviously I think if there's a staff member

109
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,589
[SPEAKER_09]: disciplinary action can be taken.

110
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:24,897
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I would assume it wouldn't be based solely on an anonymous report, which says solely on the basis of an anonymous report, that there would be an investigation to determine that the anonymous report was accurate.

111
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:30,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Because obviously, anonymous reports, you know, could just be somebody, you know,

112
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,223
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, creating a hoax or something like that.

113
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:50,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess it's just a little bit unclear to me, and I think maybe instead of having it be like three sentences right now, which is essentially what it is in one sentence, that we might want to just break it down into individual sentences or something, because I'm not really understanding what you guys are saying.

114
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,850
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of how, I'm sorry, just to clarify, in terms of how it applies to

115
00:11:58,497 --> 00:12:14,852
[SPEAKER_09]: a student but not a staff member or a staff member but not a student based solely on the basis of an anonymous report, which I think anything based solely on the basis of anonymous report, disciplinary action wouldn't be taken because it couldn't be unless it was confirmed.

116
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:21,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think this policy only will now apply to students, correct?

117
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

118
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:32,480
[SPEAKER_05]: part, because we did add our members of the community, the school community or school staff in another spot.

119
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the I'm sorry, which section are we in?

120
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we're in the never ending section without titles.

121
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:47,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But so yeah, this first part is about false accusations.

122
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:52,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second sentence is unrelated, it seems.

123
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:52,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

124
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:59,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So as member McLaughlin said, like, you know, this should be broken, separated.

125
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:16,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably say no disciplinary action will be taken against a student on the basis of an anonymous report because, you know,

126
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:25,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, we're not gonna take any action against anybody based on an anonymous report.

127
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:27,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, based solely on an anonymous report.

128
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the solely, right?

129
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was the piece that I'm talking about.

130
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:31,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, that's correct.

131
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:50,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm trying to understand is, if there's an anonymous report against a student, we'll skip the staff and all that other stuff for now, against a student, and then our administration or the principal or whoever does an investigation and determines that there's something there, they are still allowed to

132
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:52,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

133
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

134
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:54,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

135
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

136
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

137
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:13,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you clarify when you say, when your comments say only includes a student, like, can you clarify what that like means in an overarching sense for the policy, like under the law?

138
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the law, we're talking about a,

139
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:28,951
[SPEAKER_06]: bullying report, bullying student to student, basically, I believe.

140
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:35,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, or actually raising my hand.

141
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

142
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:39,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

143
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's the impression that we've had, Howard.

144
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:48,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess maybe that begs the question if you're saying that that is what is required.

145
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:55,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that according to what I saw in the DESE bullying standards, it can be a student or a staff member.

146
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:57,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it can be a parent or community member.

147
00:14:58,473 --> 00:14:59,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're right there.

148
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:06,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I think outside of the school is a different issue, although there's some gray areas around social media and that sort of thing.

149
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:08,896
[SPEAKER_09]: particularly with student and staff members.

150
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:24,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would agree with you that I don't think it could be a parent, caregiver, or community member, but the student and staff member, I think it can be based on what I've seen in terms of my own research on DESE and bullying.

151
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:28,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would say, yeah, includes staff members.

152
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:36,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should just clarify to make sure that no action is taken based on solely on the basis of an anonymous report.

153
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,233
[SPEAKER_06]: and remove parent caregiver.

154
00:15:44,934 --> 00:16:01,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Howard, are you saying that under the law, an allegation cannot be brought against anybody but a student or a staff member?

155
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so, and I'll double check that.

156
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

157
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:23,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what I'm trying to be clear about is like, what is, what are the, like the, the actor parameters that you're saying we need to adhere to, to make sure that we actually are adhering to those.

158
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:29,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll double check that and get back to you by email.

159
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I do think, um, the.

160
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:51,621
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do wanna be clear that, and we'll get to this further on, but that the, am I correct, Howard, that the only people who can file bullying complaints are students and staff?

161
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I believe so.

162
00:16:54,562 --> 00:17:05,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So our form that is available for the community, frankly, on our website, parents, caregivers,

163
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:12,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody in the community can't just fill it out to accuse a student or staff member of bullying.

164
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: The bullying that is defined by this law, I mean, bullying has a broader meaning and set of situations, but for the purposes of our forms and our process and our authority, it's students and staff.

165
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:32,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe so, yes.

166
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I mentioned that to member Graham,

167
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:43,518
[SPEAKER_05]: in a conversation we had earlier today, you know, the question was like, well, how does a five-year-old file a bullying report?

168
00:17:45,018 --> 00:18:03,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, in my mind, like hopefully the staff member that was around would be doing it, but that sort of seemed like a pretty good example of, I mean, and maybe it's just a matter of like whose name gets listed is the student, even if they're not typing, but.

169
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:05,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

170
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

171
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:17,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's, you know, respectfully, Howard, I think that parents and caregivers and even community members can file a report of bullying.

172
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:19,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that, you know, Joan, Ms.

173
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:26,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen will have some background on this and maybe Dr. Cushing as well.

174
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:33,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that they can, in fact, in fact, I know that they have.

175
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:53,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And that they are required to be investigated because there's going to be sometimes student sometimes you can imagine all kinds of scenarios where a student may be getting bullied and not want to file a complaint and the parent does right and because it's you know an important issue and what have you so there's a whole bunch of nuance around this, but I do think that we're confusing two issues and I guess this is what.

176
00:18:54,081 --> 00:19:02,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to parse out a little bit for folks so that we're not right now, we went from talking about anonymous reports to a whole other subject.

177
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:13,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I'd like to, you know, finish up the anonymous report question comment, which I think the whole issue is that this is accurate.

178
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:18,180
[SPEAKER_09]: based solely, you know, solely on the basis of anonymous report.

179
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:25,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, that they can't be disciplined based solely on an anonymous report, which I would agree with, and I think is accurate.

180
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:32,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the question of whether a parent, caregiver, or community member can be disciplined by the school or anything else.

181
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other action can be taken against this

182
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:36,136
[SPEAKER_09]: them on the school.

183
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:46,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where the nuance around parent, caregiver or community member came in for me, not about whether or not they can file a bullying report, because I believe that they can.

184
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:49,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we're like mixing up a couple of issues here.

185
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:56,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would respectfully ask that maybe we break them down and, you know, finish one before we potentially start another.

186
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:57,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

187
00:19:58,682 --> 00:19:59,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

188
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:02,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the anonymous stuff, in my mind, we've finished that.

189
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:23,379
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think we would want to tread very carefully about like, if one of our students goes to a restaurant and bullies the staff, business owners and staff members from a restaurant showing up at Medford public schools to file a bullying report is a nightmare.

190
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:27,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't support that.

191
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:42,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And not that I don't think it should get addressed, but I mean, it does seem like an expansion that doesn't make sense in my mind.

192
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:45,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I don't know that- Sorry, just a point of information here.

193
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what you're talking about.

194
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you talking about an anonymous report or an other report?

195
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what you're saying.

196
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:58,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the only anonymous reporting can happen by people who actually have access to our anonymous reporting system, which are students and staff.

197
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're not going to take a piece of paper slipped under somebody's door and call that a report.

198
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if I'm not mistaken, it's on the website.

199
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:08,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's on the website, if I'm not mistaken.

200
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:09,926
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just... Yeah, you're right.

201
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:10,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

202
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:10,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

203
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:11,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about that.

204
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:12,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

205
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:16,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So in any case, I guess what I'm saying is, what are we talking about right here?

206
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:24,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm not talking about a student going to a business and something happening there, which obviously is another issue and is a whole other nuance.

207
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:37,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we could get into all of these various conversations and throw a million different scenarios in the pot and you know go go down that road and I don't think anybody has the time for that I think what I'm trying to say is that okay for the anonymous report.

208
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:51,302
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I believe Howard attorney Greenspan is going to check on the parent caregiver or community member issue which I don't think can be included there personally because the school is not going to take disciplinary action against parent care giver or community members.

209
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:52,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one.

210
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:56,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, I think the other issue around whether you know

211
00:21:57,873 --> 00:22:09,776
[SPEAKER_09]: caregivers, or community members for that matter, can file a bullying report, which is different than an anonymous report, which frankly they can based on the website, but a bullying report is another question altogether.

212
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:13,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly I know parent caregivers are, potentially community members can too.

213
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:18,219
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens if you have a kid in DCF custody who's only confiding in their parish member?

214
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:18,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

215
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're being bullied.

216
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:22,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would assume they would go to a staff member and have that worked out.

217
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:24,265
[SPEAKER_09]: But but we don't necessarily know.

218
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:31,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think, again, that's probably a question for Attorney Greenspan to answer in terms of who can file a bullying report.

219
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:38,000
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want to say for folks watching and others, I you know, and certainly they can look on Desi's website themselves.

220
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,180
[SPEAKER_09]: But

221
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:49,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I firmly believe that parent caregivers can and in fact have so and I would defer to Dr. Cushing and Joan Bowen and the superintendent.

222
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, thank you, everybody.

223
00:22:54,826 --> 00:23:04,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So in looking at the model forms on the state website, it does list parent as someone who can fill out a report.

224
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what it was, was a few years ago when we went through this, we basically cleaned up the formatting.

225
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:21,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And didn't really touch a lot of the substance but updated all of the forms, because the model form is a pretty abysmal form for actual practice.

226
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

227
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:30,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two sided it doesn't offer a lot of space for writing and things like that so two years ago, we didn't go through and have these great in depth conversations.

228
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:49,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what is a holdover is that parent, caregiver, or community member, what we probably did, what I probably did two years ago was put caregiver in where parent was because that's the language that Medford and other places are using.

229
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:52,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if we just said student or staff member,

230
00:23:54,498 --> 00:24:12,368
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be appropriate for whoever it be, and then remove parent, caregiver, or community member, because as people have mentioned, we don't have the capacity to get involved in that, other than say, recommend that maybe they need to file the criminal harassment complaint against those individuals with local law enforcement.

231
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:15,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

232
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. DeLava, did you want to speak?

233
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:19,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I see your hand.

234
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:20,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

235
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:25,646
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been reading this thing like four times in front of me.

236
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:35,648
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm glad, but I just want to make sure we go back to what I keep reading was this is related to the false accusation, correct?

237
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:47,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were getting confused on two different things of make a report who can't, but I keep reading this part and I'm like, okay, this is what I brought up last time.

238
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:52,990
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the false accusation part where we did sort of a bullying investigation.

239
00:24:53,030 --> 00:25:02,594
[SPEAKER_00]: The parent did not feel that the assessment of bullying was accurate and therefore felt that somebody falsely filled out this report.

240
00:25:02,654 --> 00:25:05,535
[SPEAKER_00]: So now how does that person get affected?

241
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:07,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's how I'm thinking of that.

242
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:08,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

243
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:14,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate bringing that back around because I think I got lost in this anonymous part.

244
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:14,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And

245
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:24,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, so I think we can, Dr. Cushing's hand is up still because he needs to talk.

246
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can move on from this paragraph.

247
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:30,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one thing that's very evident, there's no structure to this.

248
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,341
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a long dump.

249
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:43,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we will tease those things apart between anonymous versus filing a bullying report, which is not an anonymous report.

250
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess I will ask the question,

251
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:54,967
[SPEAKER_05]: and I forgive me for not remembering this, but is anonymous reporting even part of the law?

252
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:58,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, okay.

253
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I find sort of fascinating.

254
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, how can you have a form to fill out if it's anonymous?

255
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:07,032
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no form if it's anonymous.

256
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:12,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same as slipping a piece of paper under somebody's door and thinking that that's a report.

257
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:18,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I don't think we should have anonymous stuff, but I guess we'll have to normalize that and figure out how to bring it together.

258
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: But we should move on to the next comment.

259
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:29,105
[SPEAKER_05]: This was another one of those, make sure we're doing it, the educational parts.

260
00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:32,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually.

261
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,621
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure this is happening since it is in the plan.

262
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:39,484
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more than what is required for the regulations.

263
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:46,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a point of information.

264
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:46,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

265
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:49,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Just what is, how are we going to make sure that that is happening?

266
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,131
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it needs to be built into the school calendar.

267
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:56,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I think,

268
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:01,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that the plan gets reviewed?

269
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:02,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

270
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:09,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our policy on annual, on reports and presentations.

271
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:24,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that we might be able to slip that in there as something like, because we have things that are every couple of years or even every three years, and we can have it in there that will receive a presentation with the recommended edits and changes.

272
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:26,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sort of will work backwards from that.

273
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:27,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Graham?

274
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:37,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Howard is your point that the law requires us to do this every two years and we are saying we are going to do it every one year.

275
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:40,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And is that really a decision that we need to make?

276
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:42,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

277
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:44,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the question.

278
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

279
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

280
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I didn't quite get that.

281
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

282
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:54,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, unless anybody has any recommendations differently, I think we should switch back to doing the two years.

283
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:57,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we haven't even been keeping up with that.

284
00:27:57,795 --> 00:27:57,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

285
00:27:58,478 --> 00:27:58,798
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

286
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:00,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

287
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:02,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Good idea.

288
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to make a motion or do we just want to say yes?

289
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:08,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we need to make a motion.

290
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:09,203
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's fine.

291
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:09,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I agree.

292
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:11,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

293
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:18,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

294
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up we have

295
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:31,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Musso, can you just hover over that item so we can see the comment open?

296
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:32,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because we don't know which one.

297
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:33,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

298
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:35,009
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

299
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:37,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So this one says, this seems very broad.

300
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,250
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not be possible the way it's written.

301
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:47,893
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the document that all unacceptable student behavior and treating these incidents with standard school disciplinary procedures.

302
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:53,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, this would be,

303
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, every kindergarten teacher would spend their whole day just writing up reports.

304
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:01,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And they wouldn't actually spend time with their students.

305
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:07,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly understand that this is wildly broad as written.

306
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:16,393
[SPEAKER_05]: But perhaps we actually don't include this and and

307
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:27,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have other policies that say how things should be reported and those can stand on their own.

308
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:29,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to go in the other room while this finishes, Jay.

309
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:31,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

310
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:34,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we just remove the word all?

311
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:35,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

312
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:38,490
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do that.

313
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:47,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think we do want

314
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,323
[SPEAKER_08]: there to be an expectation that schools are documenting instances of unacceptable behavior.

315
00:29:53,343 --> 00:30:01,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the two variables there is all is a really aggressive word to use when you talk about documenting things that happen in a school.

316
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:10,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think the other squishy word there is unacceptable because that means very different things to very different people.

317
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:27,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I think if you take out all, I could live with the gray area and the judgment required to say, is this like infraction, like something to document yes or no.

318
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:40,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and to leave that in the hands of the, of the buildings, but to set the expectation that we do expect documentation from schools to be happening on a regular basis.

319
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:47,468
[SPEAKER_08]: because I think that part is important, that that expectation is clearly coming from the school committee.

320
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:48,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

321
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has been the policy since 2010.

322
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like we're expanding.

323
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:56,954
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we're sort of contracting by taking the word all out.

324
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:58,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

325
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

326
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:05,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think this gets back to the incident report issue that we've been talking about for some time.

327
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:10,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I agree that all should be taken out, but I think that we need to think about

328
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:23,608
[SPEAKER_09]: if they're documenting incidences of unacceptable student behavior and treating these instances with standard school disciplinary procedures, then I would say, one, parent caregivers need to be notified.

329
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:33,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And two, with the understanding that there are unique legal requirements and procedures for students with disabilities.

330
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:36,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

331
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:37,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

332
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,401
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

333
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:43,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we've talked about that on the floor as well.

334
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we don't want to put all that into this one bullet.

335
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:50,756
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's a really good point.

336
00:31:51,437 --> 00:32:03,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would consider that out of the scope for this policy, because there are other policies and procedures that govern all of those things that are separate and distinct from this.

337
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,830
[SPEAKER_08]: policy.

338
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:12,973
[SPEAKER_09]: But I actually no, I disagree because I think that it needs to be we talk about communication all the time.

339
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:16,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that yes, while those other policies are there, that's important.

340
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:22,578
[SPEAKER_09]: But people who are reading these may not know that those other policies are there, whether their parents or caregivers or anybody else.

341
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:31,843
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's really important that we reiterate things throughout our district in terms of policies and procedures and that folks are aware of them.

342
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:32,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So

343
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I would actually disagree.

344
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:45,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there should be either if it's separate bullet items for, you know, how the incident reports are handled and or a separate bullet item for, you know, understanding legal procedure around.

345
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,363
[SPEAKER_09]: students with disability and manifestation of disability.

346
00:32:50,864 --> 00:33:02,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I would also say, I mean, I would go back to the to the unacceptable point I mean I hear what you're saying but I think it is a value statement and I get, you know, student some student behavior is unacceptable some student behavior is, you know,

347
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:16,000
[SPEAKER_09]: anything else, but if we're trying to think about student strength based language, you know, we can just say during documenting incidences of student behavior and treating these incidents with standard school disciplinary procedures as needed or something like that.

348
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,061
[SPEAKER_09]: So that we're, you know, I think that putting a value statement on things is not necessarily helpful.

349
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:24,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we want to be strength based as a district, I think we should be reconsidering those.

350
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:26,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So two items I have there.

351
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:32,483
[SPEAKER_09]: One is, you know, two distinct bullet items around, you know, or included in this bullet item, I don't care around

352
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:39,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You know incident report incidents, you know documentation of incidents are shared with you know caregivers and.

353
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:47,392
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an understanding that there are unique procedures and policies for students with disabilities.

354
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:49,630
[SPEAKER_09]: so that people can cross-reference that.

355
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And for more information or something, go here.

356
00:33:52,552 --> 00:34:03,720
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, again, some family members, caregivers who are invested in looking at the bullying policy might not know about the special education students with disabilities laws and policies.

357
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And so having that reiterated, I think is important.

358
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:16,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be fine with removing unacceptable, but I am absolutely against duplicating information across multiple policies.

359
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:18,584
[SPEAKER_08]: a disastrous nightmare.

360
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:28,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if we want to put a link that references, um, standard disciplinary procedures, uh, for students with and without disabilities, I think that's totally fine.

361
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,871
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it's a link that sends somebody somewhere relevant.

362
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:36,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I am not in favor of replicating information into this policy.

363
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:39,095
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, it will make it unmanageable and unwieldy.

364
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:44,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we, uh, as a district have a track record of

365
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:50,495
[SPEAKER_08]: maintenance of our policies and procedures, and we're just making it worse by duplicating information.

366
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:52,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

367
00:34:52,317 --> 00:35:01,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I just wanted to add that not related to the content of the conversation, but certainly that good policy should not contain other policies.

368
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:16,926
[SPEAKER_05]: other than a link to them, because if we had a high quality document management system and our policies were all up to date, I think there's a real case to be made for inclusion in other policies, language from other policies.

369
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:21,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would, of course, at the same time when we change that other policy,

370
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:29,893
[SPEAKER_05]: the system that we don't have would literally tell us, hey, you have to go change policy X, Y, Z, because this language is in there.

371
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:39,738
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, it is literally a manual process or anybody who happens to remember, and we definitely cannot handle that at this time.

372
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:44,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have this problem with the handbooks, frankly.

373
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We update policy, some of that policy gets stuck into the handbooks because it has to be there, but then

374
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:52,333
[SPEAKER_05]: we update the policies and the handbooks don't get updated.

375
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:57,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Or somebody updates the handbooks as if they're not actual policy and the policy says something different than the handbook.

376
00:35:57,974 --> 00:36:07,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do think trying to make sure we provide a link to whatever other policies are relevant here is super important.

377
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:17,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we've started to do that in other policies where we say something and we just literally say, see policy, whatever, so that folks can see the whole thing.

378
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:38,039
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not perfect, of course, but I think considering we also want to change those other policies, I think, because the law changed, we don't want that work to become this work, because in this work, we'll be meeting on this policy for the next five years straight.

379
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have to meet every two years on it as it is.

380
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my opinion.

381
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:46,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward-Vincent, I see your hand's up.

382
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

383
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to weigh in just to say this is definitely a very rich conversation.

384
00:36:55,382 --> 00:37:09,067
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also wanted to just say this is now our fourth time we have official legal counsel on the call helping us pass through this bullying document.

385
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:13,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually feel like even though the original document was too long,

386
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:29,412
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably really make a concerted effort to see how we could really get the document down to be a manageable size document, so that it isn't overwhelming to families and to parents.

387
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:46,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And focus on the key, the key pieces that need to be in the policy, following the law, because I think it is true, if we end up echoing what was just shared by member Graham and member was so that if we have.

388
00:37:47,888 --> 00:38:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make references to other policies, but we haven't gotten into the habit of just being able to clearly cite a policy because the policies are on, you know, that's the whole point of the subcommittee, trying to get us to a place where we're going to have

389
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:19,689
[SPEAKER_01]: clean policies that people will understand that are easy to translate, that are digestible for all stakeholders, for them to understand, okay, this is what I need to do when bullying takes place.

390
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:31,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So I almost feel like now that we have the language or we have highlights for the areas that need to stay legally because of the law, let's stick with those pieces.

391
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:36,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, if it means creating a separate policy, but freestanding,

392
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:59,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be in support of that because we're only on page five and if at this rate, we'll be lucky if we even make it to page eight by six o'clock and there are many, many, many comments that need to be adjusted.

393
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the comments I think

394
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:18,251
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of student member of the school staff, you know, like some comments might be able to just be tweaked and everyone will be able to accept those comments, but also just for us to feel like we're able to make progress because May is next week.

395
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:27,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And to member Ruseau's point, like if, if we can't at least, you know, make a decision to get through this one policy during this school year, um,

396
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:35,932
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be still working on this policy come September, so that that was just my.

397
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:39,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage us to kind of like.

398
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:50,298
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on the bullying, focus on the key pieces that we need to focus on and not mix multiple policies.

399
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:55,141
[SPEAKER_01]: This was our attempt a few years back trying to update it.

400
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:57,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we can see, there were many flaws.

401
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,863
[SPEAKER_01]: There were areas that were repeated unnecessarily.

402
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:09,788
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel like we should really try to get this document down to at least half its size if that's possible.

403
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:11,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

404
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's definitely possible.

405
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:19,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham and Member McLaughlin, if you could just try to limit your comments to another minute so we can move on.

406
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:37,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that this is incredibly painful and I wish that lots and lots of people before the people on this call had taken seriously this work in a way that would have made this easier, but we are here and we have to do this work and it's

407
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:41,980
[SPEAKER_08]: tedious and painful, and I think we're making progress.

408
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I just want us to stay focused on that and to button it up at the same time.

409
00:40:46,842 --> 00:41:02,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, in the last meeting, I volunteered that once we had clarity from our attorney about what these, um, things were that we could or could not do, um, that I would then go through and take a cut at trying to make this digestible for people.

410
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:05,292
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not work I can do until we get through these comments.

411
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:07,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still happy to do that.

412
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:16,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to do that after this meeting, but it is not work that is productive until we have clarity from the attorney, which is I think the whole point of this meeting.

413
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:18,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

414
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:19,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

415
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I couldn't agree more.

416
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need to get to the attorney comments.

417
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:29,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to note for the record that there are different and very disciplinary procedures for students with disabilities.

418
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:30,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like a link there.

419
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:37,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I would also say we still haven't addressed the issue of incident reports to caregivers.

420
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to think about that at some point.

421
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:46,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just provide me those links member McLaughlin, and I'll just wrap them into the next version.

422
00:41:49,238 --> 00:41:54,001
[SPEAKER_09]: links for the disability, the protocol for students with disabilities.

423
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:54,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can do that.

424
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:58,363
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a link for an incident report because we've talked about this on the floor.

425
00:41:58,463 --> 00:41:59,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a separate issue.

426
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:04,306
[SPEAKER_09]: But the disability one, sure, Joan or I can get that to you.

427
00:42:04,706 --> 00:42:05,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

428
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:06,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then I can strap it in.

429
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:08,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.

430
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:16,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Next is, this comment is about that we have specifically named the training folks, the company.

431
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:27,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we use those folks, but even if we do, I think it makes more sense to not have it named.

432
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:33,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, do we even need to list this at all, this item?

433
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Howard?

434
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this level of detail required?

435
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:41,295
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

436
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

437
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:43,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

438
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:47,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

439
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,619
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll strike this then.

440
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:52,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just get that into my notes.

441
00:43:00,386 --> 00:43:00,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up.

442
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,972
[SPEAKER_05]: is we have several pages where there's not a lot.

443
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:05,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's wonderful.

444
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,615
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the statement which we have said multiple times.

445
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:11,437
[SPEAKER_05]: This is literally a copy of what's above.

446
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:13,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all the same thing.

447
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:19,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So that whole section gets chopped out because it is the same section duplicated.

448
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:26,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that this whole couple of pages is just gone because it's the same thing.

449
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:28,910
[SPEAKER_05]: This,

450
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,202
[SPEAKER_05]: This comment is that the public involvement section can be removed.

451
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:41,289
[SPEAKER_05]: These are really getting the policy up from the ashes or whatever the right analogy is there.

452
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,872
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is not something that needs to exist now.

453
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:46,674
[SPEAKER_05]: That was for the day one version of this.

454
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:49,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So that section can be deleted.

455
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Assessing needs, it says outdated.

456
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wonder

457
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:59,531
[SPEAKER_05]: if Mr. Green's been, can we just delete this section as well?

458
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:03,293
[SPEAKER_05]: This feels like the getting it started 2010.

459
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:05,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right, right.

460
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:06,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

461
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And then planning and oversight, same thing.

462
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure why I keep getting that little pop up.

463
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:19,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Parent and,

464
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:24,964
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, parent and community involvement.

465
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole section here, the comment is to review and make sure this is still relevant.

466
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:39,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly looks very- I mean, this particular section is about startup, isn't it?

467
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:40,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

468
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:43,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that required, Howard?

469
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's stale, right?

470
00:44:45,681 --> 00:44:51,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we've- Yeah, I mean, I think there needs to be clear comments about

471
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the role of parents, but not in how it was started.

472
00:44:56,294 --> 00:45:00,082
[SPEAKER_03]: In developing policy, because that's all ancient history.

473
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:00,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

474
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:01,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

475
00:45:01,425 --> 00:45:01,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

476
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:02,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

477
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:03,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

478
00:45:04,313 --> 00:45:07,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Howard, this one here you said, you know, you asked, does this need to be updated?

479
00:45:09,277 --> 00:45:12,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We had previously met and thought, this doesn't even belong in here.

480
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:16,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to a couple of other districts and they don't have it in here.

481
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:20,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see it, Malden does have it, but I looked at other districts and they don't have it.

482
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:28,314
[SPEAKER_05]: This feels very much, frankly, is inappropriate for policy considering our specific ban on curriculum.

483
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:34,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had talked about in previous meetings cutting this whole section out.

484
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:37,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also very much inaccurate.

485
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:38,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward Benson.

486
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:43,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I was gonna say, I was definitely in support of removing the scope and sequence.

487
00:45:44,072 --> 00:46:00,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably in 2010 or when that was added, it was appropriate, but where we're gonna be changing programs and I don't think any of this is really necessary for what we're doing right now.

488
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

489
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:04,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did notice on the,

490
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was the Lexington policy.

491
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,715
[SPEAKER_05]: At the very end of the policy, they had three or four links.

492
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:13,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them was that.

493
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:16,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that's a separate website.

494
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:20,181
[SPEAKER_05]: If we create that website, and we can add the link to it.

495
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:31,150
[SPEAKER_05]: But so this is still all, I'm sorry, these are all still the, I'm sorry, did I go too far?

496
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,271
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

497
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

498
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:35,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep going, keep going.

499
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:39,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, these are still curriculum.

500
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:49,010
[SPEAKER_05]: This one here, faculty and staff, actually, I'm just going to keep going with these comments instead of rehashing what we've already talked about, sorry.

501
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have, this says this is an old definition, needs to be updated to include school staff, which we don't have to talk about, I can just do that.

502
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:10,603
[SPEAKER_05]: This one here says retaliation language should be removed and have it stand on its own and not as part of this definition.

503
00:47:13,324 --> 00:47:17,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Howard has not seen the version of the definitions we had started working on.

504
00:47:17,425 --> 00:47:21,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that we agree that the definitions are a bit of a mess here.

505
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:27,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So this does not make any reference to anything that anybody understands.

506
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:30,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Also an asterisk, does it have a,

507
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:31,582
[SPEAKER_05]: home.

508
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:33,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so that that'll be cut.

509
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:38,024
[SPEAKER_05]: If I go too fast, just tell me to slow down.

510
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:44,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is the unacceptable language conversation we just had.

511
00:47:45,187 --> 00:47:57,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's vague, but there's that all.

512
00:47:58,332 --> 00:48:01,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get rid of the all member McLaughlin.

513
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:19,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think just using the same as you know what we've done in the previous section in terms of the value language and the and the all but I think that it also begs the question again I mean I'm seeing incident 1234 times on this page.

514
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:29,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have to put somewhere in here where the incident reports are going for family and community engagement as well.

515
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:42,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am making a motion that we include a segment on incident report, any incident reports created are also shared with caregivers and family members.

516
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, isn't that a conversation I'm having in the school committee already?

517
00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:49,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we already had it and we already agreed on it.

518
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:54,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just saying that if we're going to, I'm wondering where we're putting it because we haven't done that yet.

519
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:55,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see what you're saying.

520
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:56,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

521
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:59,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that we agreed to do that, but where?

522
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: There is just, sorry to interrupt.

523
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:08,692
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a separate policy on incident reports just under the school communities purview.

524
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:16,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that should be something that should be reviewed on incident reports as opposed to putting it here.

525
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:30,221
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have a separate policy, we should review that policy and make sure it is updated as well.

526
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:35,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll add that we need to add the links to that policy.

527
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,709
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think it was said we need to review that policy.

528
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:50,959
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I would ask that we look at that policy at the next bullying meeting that we have on this policy because the issue is and the issue that was on the floor is that we've had families historically that have not been made aware of

529
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:58,803
[SPEAKER_09]: behavior incidents and then students potentially are getting suspended or disciplined or whatever else and student and families and caregivers are not aware of this.

530
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:03,626
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe we already decided on the floor that this was going to be something that we did.

531
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:12,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we can clarify when we come back to report out on this meeting with the other members of the committee if we'd like to where that

532
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:31,519
[SPEAKER_09]: information should be, but I think it's important that the incident report information is in the bullying context, because we're now asking families to go to multiple different places to understand these policies, where on one hand, I understand what you guys are saying about wanting to narrow down the scope and making sure that it's simple and understandable.

533
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:35,262
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other hand, we're putting the burden on parents and families to find out

534
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: the other information that accompanies this.

535
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:49,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So whether it's a link, that's fine, but I don't want to wait another, you know, till again, September, October, whatever, till we're dealing with the incident report, because it is intrinsically connected to the bullying report.

536
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:54,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that it be included in the next meeting that we have on this issue.

537
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:03,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, I mean, our rules require that any policy that's going to get changed or reviewed has to be submitted

538
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:06,180
[SPEAKER_05]: through the full committee before we can review it.

539
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't review another policy here in this meeting.

540
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:10,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Not right now.

541
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:13,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, not right now.

542
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:13,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that.

543
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:14,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

544
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:15,126
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm saying.

545
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:16,668
[SPEAKER_09]: When we report out.

546
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:19,710
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, we can't have another meeting and then do it then either.

547
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:25,014
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want that to be updated, you have to submit that to the full committee to send it to subcommittee.

548
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:32,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, which we can do at the next meeting and have it combined with the bullying meeting for the next RPI meeting.

549
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:34,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

550
00:51:35,132 --> 00:51:36,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, next meeting, it doesn't matter.

551
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to have this conversation.

552
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:39,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just do it at the next school committee meeting.

553
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

554
00:51:41,422 --> 00:51:41,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

555
00:51:44,691 --> 00:52:03,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I just wanted clarification within this document it talks about incidents but are we referring to bullying incidents specifically, or all behavioral incidents so I think it's it's two separate things so I think the behavioral incidents that member McLaughlin is talking about like that is a different

556
00:52:05,074 --> 00:52:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: form or reporting that we need to provide to parents.

557
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:15,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to be clear that when we're talking about all incidents, it's about bullying incidents within this policy.

558
00:52:15,821 --> 00:52:27,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And that there is a section that the parents, I believe I read, there's a section that the parents are informed when a bullying incident is either reported

559
00:52:27,368 --> 00:52:40,011
[SPEAKER_04]: because of their student or that their student's being bullied and that the investigation happens and then they get the results of the bullying investigation.

560
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:44,372
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to make sure that I'm thinking the correct way with this.

561
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:48,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be further down under number four?

562
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:54,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

563
00:52:55,389 --> 00:53:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what I'm hearing Joan say is like, this policy is about bullying.

564
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:00,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

565
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,051
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

566
00:53:02,652 --> 00:53:04,832
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about all incidents that happen in school.

567
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:05,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

568
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:19,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that making sure we stay focused on that part seems important because as Mayor McLaughlin said, like, you know,

569
00:53:20,465 --> 00:53:31,093
[SPEAKER_05]: putting too much on a family to like come to this and see this and be like, oh my God, I need a PhD to figure out what this says, or I'm gonna need two hours to just read the table of contents.

570
00:53:32,414 --> 00:53:34,556
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a service to anybody.

571
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:44,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think that that's a very much a, you know, a hard, you know, thing to, a hard needle to thread.

572
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:49,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Too much and too little are both bad and they're bad

573
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:50,786
[SPEAKER_05]: in different ways.

574
00:53:53,347 --> 00:53:55,167
[SPEAKER_05]: The current policy is 38 pages long.

575
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:59,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go out on a limb and bet there were zero people in Medford who've read the whole thing other than us.

576
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:05,309
[SPEAKER_05]: They might've scanned it, but nobody read it for a reason.

577
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:12,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, let's move on to this.

578
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the comment is related to if the incident does not meet

579
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:19,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to click away.

580
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:21,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Does not seem to meet the definition.

581
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Continue to treat the incidents with standard school disciplinary or conflict resolution procedures.

582
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:36,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. Greenspan says this almost seems like a pre-screening process, and I'm not sure DESE would approve of this based on recent PRS findings.

583
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:40,704
[SPEAKER_05]: they may want to consider revising this procedure.

584
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:47,568
[SPEAKER_05]: It also needs to be the same as the school committee policy and student handbook procedures for everything to need to be checked for consistency.

585
00:54:47,608 --> 00:55:00,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I am understanding what is being said here is we don't wanna have it in our policy that some individual can just like look at it and decide for themselves that this is not gonna go through the process.

586
00:55:01,856 --> 00:55:02,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

587
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:03,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

588
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:06,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And so things go through the process.

589
00:55:06,996 --> 00:55:12,899
[SPEAKER_05]: The process is complete and incomplete, meaning it's got a start and an end for everything that comes in.

590
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:20,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not something that sits at the front and decides whether it gets to go into the process.

591
00:55:26,887 --> 00:55:29,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So the language, if it does not seem to meet the definition,

592
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:37,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we just strike that?

593
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:41,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably, I was just going to suggest that.

594
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:53,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

595
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:59,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, administrative investigations, um, principal or designee.

596
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to talk about that response plan.

597
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:04,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

598
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:10,812
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, we can require outside counseling.

599
00:56:10,832 --> 00:56:21,621
[SPEAKER_05]: The district would pay for it unless the student has been charged with a felony or expelled, in which case we can require parent-sponsored counseling.

600
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:25,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Greenspan says just remove it because this does not apply.

601
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to just copy that.

602
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,221
[SPEAKER_05]: The student has, okay, let's see.

603
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:45,766
[SPEAKER_05]: If a student has an IEP, work with his or her liaison to determine whether the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability.

604
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:54,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And this says, this is only required if the student is removed from school for more than 10 days.

605
00:56:54,653 --> 00:56:59,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I would advise to say to notify the liaison who may want to reconvene the team.

606
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:03,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see your hand?

607
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:05,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to defer to Joan on this too, Mr. Chairman.

608
00:57:06,442 --> 00:57:06,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

609
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I see your hands up.

610
00:57:11,251 --> 00:57:12,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

611
00:57:12,832 --> 00:57:15,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, it's IEP or 504.

612
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:18,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure where you're going.

613
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:23,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I was just looking for the title of the section we're in because I was confused slightly.

614
00:57:23,715 --> 00:57:23,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

615
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:27,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I believe it's IEP or 504.

616
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:43,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with Howard that it is 10 days but Howard it's 10 days and or a pattern of removal so it's not some people think it's 10 consecutive days.

617
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:49,308
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be 10 days or a pattern of removal.

618
00:57:49,348 --> 00:58:07,217
[SPEAKER_09]: So what some administrators do, and I'm not saying in this district, but sometimes what we see administrators might do is suspend a student for less than the 10 days and or do partial dismissal so that they're sort of underneath this law.

619
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:09,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that, again, this needs a link.

620
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:13,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also defer to Joan on the link and the specifics.

621
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:14,860
[SPEAKER_09]: It does get very nuanced.

622
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:28,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that they should be, you know, somebody else needs to be involved that understands this better, whether it's the director of student services or the attorney or somebody.

623
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:39,144
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would definitely say add 504 and then nuance around the move from school for more than 10 days, because it's a little bit more than just that.

624
00:58:41,303 --> 00:58:44,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you, unless there's an objection, and I've modified that.

625
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:54,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, notify the aggressor of his or her rights in the process to appeal your decision.

626
00:58:54,687 --> 00:58:56,567
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no appeal process in the law.

627
00:58:58,608 --> 00:59:00,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So do we just strike number 10?

628
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:05,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, just.

629
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:14,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

630
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:18,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Next step is response option.

631
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:18,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

632
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:22,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Ruseau point of information, but there's no appeals process.

633
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:27,036
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true, Howard, but there is, there are other procedural safeguards.

634
00:59:27,636 --> 00:59:29,817
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is potentially the office of civil rights.

635
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:39,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to be really clear that like, if people feel so Joan, I would ask that you maybe we have Joan answer some of this too.

636
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:45,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not really sure what the question is, if you could repeat that.

637
00:59:47,108 --> 00:59:52,473
[SPEAKER_09]: So number 10 says notify the aggressor of his or her rights in the process to appeal your decision.

638
00:59:53,133 --> 01:00:06,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So Howard saying that there's not a process to appeal the decision regarding what the school district decides on bullying, but there are other procedural safeguards such as the office for civil rights.

639
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how those would be connected.

640
01:00:09,821 --> 01:00:18,303
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a bullying incident and I guess I'm not clear of what number 10 is asking or saying.

641
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:19,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they.

642
01:00:21,944 --> 01:00:25,726
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, I think number 10 is we have done the investigation.

643
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:33,868
[SPEAKER_05]: The aggressor has been, we've identified that it was bullying and we hand out a disciplinary action.

644
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:36,289
[SPEAKER_05]: The student,

645
01:00:37,197 --> 01:00:39,599
[SPEAKER_05]: and or their family does not have the right to just appeal that.

646
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, I misunderstood.

647
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:45,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I was misunderstanding, Member Ruseau.

648
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:58,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking that this was saying that there was a finding of no bullying and the aggressor and the individual can be notified of their rights and that they could appeal if they wanted to, meaning the individual that made the bullying.

649
01:00:58,678 --> 01:01:01,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess it also begs the question, what happens if,

650
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:06,418
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no, and do we have that farther down or Howard, can you respond to that?

651
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,239
[SPEAKER_09]: What if there's a finding of no bullying?

652
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:16,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I believe that there's also no appeal process for that in terms of the school district, but there is other procedural safeguards.

653
01:01:16,182 --> 01:01:18,423
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was the sort of nuance that I was trying to tease out.

654
01:01:22,665 --> 01:01:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, there's no appeal and I mean, how far do we go in notifying people of

655
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:38,676
[SPEAKER_03]: outside agency complaints.

656
01:01:38,816 --> 01:01:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I'm saying?

657
01:01:42,897 --> 01:01:46,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're obligated to tell them that.

658
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:53,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if I may, I mean, we could, how far do we go is right.

659
01:01:53,761 --> 01:02:00,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we could go all the way to the US, the federal government civil rights division,

660
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, civil rights is the federal government.

661
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:15,779
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point is, is that we can do a link there then, because if you want, because I'm just saying from Joan's perspective too, that there are procedural safeguards and we do have to notify families of procedural safeguards.

662
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:26,326
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's a bullying incident that does involve a student with a disability, for example, and the bullying decision has been found unfounded,

663
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:40,911
[SPEAKER_09]: in the district by the district personnel to say that there's no appeal is not accurate for students with disabilities, because there is, there are procedural safeguards, which include the Office of Civil Rights or ERS.

664
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:53,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that it's getting, I don't know, Howard, I would defer to you and looking, maybe talking with some of the, you know, too many Hesse and Lehane folks and see, but I think it could be really nuanced there.

665
01:02:55,478 --> 01:03:00,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would defer to them on this, if we wanna get.

666
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:24,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe Joan, if you would, through member Ruseau, if through the chair, if we can have the director of pupil services reach out to our special education representatives to clarify this question or issue, I would ask that so that we're clear that if we're telling people that there's no right to appeal their decision, that we need to be accountable for that.

667
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:34,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is, the aggressor is being told that they have been found guilty, for lack of a better word, of bullying.

668
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:35,955
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the other stuff.

669
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:41,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand, but we are going to have to, I think, address the other stuff as well.

670
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:42,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's why I'm bringing it up.

671
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:45,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand that this is for the aggressor.

672
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that.

673
01:03:46,842 --> 01:03:51,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the other issue is that if the decision is found not bullying, then what?

674
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:53,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we haven't put that in here, number one.

675
01:03:53,768 --> 01:03:56,550
[SPEAKER_09]: And then number two is, what does that actually mean?

676
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,151
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's no appeal, what are there?

677
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:00,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think that those are the two issues that I'm

678
01:04:01,857 --> 01:04:21,183
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to respond to, because if we're saying we're notifying the aggressor of his or her rights in the process to appeal the decision, we are also at some point notifying if we find no bullying, we're notifying the families that no bullying was found, and we have to tell them what that process is after that, if there is one or not, in my opinion.

679
01:04:22,143 --> 01:04:28,865
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the next two pages down in the notification section, which I feel like that's

680
01:04:30,593 --> 01:04:32,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's fine.

681
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:45,901
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just saying that if it's as it relates to the appeal, I want to look at that when we're looking at it two pages down specific to the no bullying, because it is it's very legally complicated.

682
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:50,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, has he to me and Lehane do need to look at this to some degree.

683
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:56,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And there there's special education representation legal team.

684
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:58,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

685
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:00,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

686
01:05:02,683 --> 01:05:11,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Howard, are you saying the law does not require an appeals process or are you saying the law prohibits an appeals process?

687
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:19,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what I'm saying is there is no appeal process within the district to this finding.

688
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:24,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But could, what does the law say we have, does the law say we can't have one?

689
01:05:28,186 --> 01:05:32,629
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but if we're going through all these steps, what is it gonna be?

690
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:35,191
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the appeal going to be?

691
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: To who?

692
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:43,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, most of these issues are all being arbitrated by the principal, right?

693
01:05:43,817 --> 01:05:46,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the assistant principal in the building.

694
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:55,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I have heard from countless parents who have just vehemently disagreed with the process

695
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:59,998
[SPEAKER_08]: that they have gone through as they have filed bullying complaints.

696
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:17,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have huge hesitation to say that like, there is no process beyond what the principal like may find or not find to be having a continuing conversation with the superintendent.

697
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:22,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I know she is the, she is the like appeals officer in all kinds of places.

698
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:25,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I am wildly uncomfortable that

699
01:06:25,433 --> 01:06:29,215
[SPEAKER_08]: we're gonna take something as serious as bullying and say there's no appeals process.

700
01:06:29,595 --> 01:06:41,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I have just heard, I have heard so many stories that just give me huge pause at the consistency and the efficacy of the decision-making happening over time.

701
01:06:42,683 --> 01:06:50,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there needs to be a pathway that rises to the level of the superintendent.

702
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:53,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Graham,

703
01:06:54,955 --> 01:07:00,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly agree with everything has just been said about no appeals process.

704
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:08,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of this is education and communication, because, you know, the law is clear.

705
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:12,392
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no such thing as a one time incident that is bullying.

706
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,112
[SPEAKER_05]: that does not exist.

707
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It does exist to the parent and it does exist to the student and to anybody with a rational brain, it's obviously a real thing.

708
01:07:23,395 --> 01:07:29,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But the law has the word repeated and without repeated, it is not bullying and not part of this policy.

709
01:07:30,038 --> 01:07:36,800
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that incidents resulting in disciplinary action can't happen still.

710
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:39,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That can still happen.

711
01:07:39,565 --> 01:07:44,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't fill out a bullying form and think that you're going to get a determination of bullying when it's a one-time thing.

712
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:55,514
[SPEAKER_08]: The stories that I hear are repeated, consistent, persistent issues where still no bullying finding has been issued.

713
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:02,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That's obviously a problem.

714
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:03,799
[SPEAKER_08]: That is our reality.

715
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:07,421
[SPEAKER_08]: We have students unenrolling from the district because of the

716
01:08:07,854 --> 01:08:12,296
[SPEAKER_08]: because of how their bullying incidents were handled or not handled.

717
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:15,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, in the eyes of the parent, I understand there's a lot of moving parts here.

718
01:08:15,638 --> 01:08:17,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally get it.

719
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:37,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying like with all of those moving parts, I would like to see there be some sort of centralized accountability path that gives us a feeling of reassurance and consistency that we can't have

720
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:48,161
[SPEAKER_08]: seven plus people being like the kings of their kingdoms and interpreting this policy any which way that they might.

721
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:56,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there has to be some pathway that drives to consistency on this decision-making.

722
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:02,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Greenspan, I saw you picking something up.

723
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:02,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you wanna?

724
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:05,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't wanna just

725
01:09:07,592 --> 01:09:12,557
[SPEAKER_03]: make an off-the-cuff decision on the appeal process?

726
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:16,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a de novo appeal?

727
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:21,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Is whoever gonna review this gonna go through everything again?

728
01:09:21,726 --> 01:09:26,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hesitant to just give an off-the-cuff response.

729
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:45,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like this is a different conversation that we do have to have, or at least the superintendent has to have, because I understand and agree that there's repeated incidents that are continuously determined to not be bullying.

730
01:09:45,497 --> 01:09:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: That should cause incredible alarms, frankly.

731
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But those alarms are not school committee alarms.

732
01:09:55,621 --> 01:09:57,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are supervision alarms

733
01:09:58,514 --> 01:10:01,156
[SPEAKER_05]: from the superintendent to the principals.

734
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:11,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and is there a way to put this into policy so that we can make sure those alarms can go off is totally something I would be up for.

735
01:10:11,142 --> 01:10:16,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, um, never Graham, did you want to say something?

736
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:23,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no, that's just something that I think is still very much an open item for me.

737
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think it is too for me as well, but Dr. Edward-Vincent?

738
01:10:30,285 --> 01:10:50,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I just wanted to comment because when the bullying investigation takes place and you follow the flowchart, there are pieces that you have to look for to make the differentiation between is it truly bullying or is it a disciplinary incident?

739
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes

740
01:10:52,783 --> 01:10:58,408
[SPEAKER_01]: In some people's interpretation, it could be defined or interpreted to be bullying.

741
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:02,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some situations, it's a disciplinary incident.

742
01:11:03,633 --> 01:11:15,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say that we do have some students within the district that may need additional supports

743
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:19,719
[SPEAKER_01]: based on their specific learning needs.

744
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:28,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes in those areas, we might have higher incidents or higher occurrences of certain things that take place.

745
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:45,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of the IEP, for example, and we realize that it might be identified as part of a child's disability, we're not going to be identifying every single incident as bullying.

746
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:46,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just,

747
01:11:48,268 --> 01:12:04,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a problem with greater accountability, but I also just want to say that sometimes we're dealing with situations that there's an area of gray that has to be taken into consideration.

748
01:12:05,815 --> 01:12:10,077
[SPEAKER_01]: We had specialized training with all of the administrators around bullying.

749
01:12:10,657 --> 01:12:13,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with Murphy, Hesse, Toomey, and Lehane to really

750
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:18,962
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what is it that administrators legally can do.

751
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:36,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a problem with having them come back to redo the training, but I do feel that they, you know, they clearly explained to all the administrators, you know, what was acceptable and kind of helping us really parse out the law.

752
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:42,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are other situations that, you know,

753
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:52,183
[SPEAKER_01]: family members have a concern about maybe how something was handled, they can always bring it to the superintendent's attention.

754
01:12:53,404 --> 01:13:09,617
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just don't want to have like blanket statements written into a policy and then there are other documents or other pieces of information that we have access to that, you know, aren't going to be,

755
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:13,503
[SPEAKER_01]: taken into consideration the same way.

756
01:13:15,005 --> 01:13:22,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want us to be careful that we're not trying to over legislate this bullying policy.

757
01:13:23,055 --> 01:13:29,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to be clear that this particular document is specifically about bullying and what the law says.

758
01:13:30,544 --> 01:13:33,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And we truly are trying our best to follow the law.

759
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:43,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are disciplinary incidents which don't rise to the level of bullying, then they're going to be handled as a disciplinary offense.

760
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:45,963
[SPEAKER_01]: a disciplinary incident.

761
01:13:46,643 --> 01:13:55,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say that because, you know, there are limitations when we're dealing with discipline.

762
01:13:55,689 --> 01:14:05,456
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some things that we have to keep in mind, and I know it might not be the answer that everyone wants to hear, but we do have to follow the law for all students.

763
01:14:06,236 --> 01:14:08,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to- I just want to be clear.

764
01:14:08,498 --> 01:14:14,402
[SPEAKER_08]: The situations that I'm referring to, to my knowledge, have nothing to do with students on IEPs or special needs.

765
01:14:15,296 --> 01:14:28,199
[SPEAKER_08]: They are situations where based on all these references we're putting in about the rights of students that are very important for students with IEPs, there are at least as many students who don't have any of those rights.

766
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:36,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And they deserve a pathway just like everybody else.

767
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our students who are going through this process deserve a pathway.

768
01:14:44,888 --> 01:14:55,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that we have to comply with the law, but this is the school committee's policy, which has to comply with the law, but it does not have to be narrowly defined by the law.

769
01:14:55,997 --> 01:15:03,403
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do, I am of the opinion that we do have the authority to say that there needs to be a pathway.

770
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:10,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're saying you can call the superintendent anytime about these things, that is essentially

771
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:17,164
[SPEAKER_08]: an appeal pathway, and all we're saying is we should make it clear to parents that they can do that.

772
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:24,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be as simple as if you disagree with these findings, please email the superintendent and set up time to discuss.

773
01:15:24,346 --> 01:15:36,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be as simple as that, but parents who are left in these situations do need to know what their pathway is, and in both cases particularly,

774
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:42,954
[SPEAKER_08]: For those students who don't have additional rights because they don't have an IEP, they need to know.

775
01:15:43,114 --> 01:15:47,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And for students who have additional rights because they have IEPs, they need to know too.

776
01:15:48,017 --> 01:15:52,420
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, to me, it's our job to set policy that does protect all students.

777
01:15:53,601 --> 01:16:06,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do, I feel very strongly that consistency, accountability, and supervision of this stuff is not something that we can do on the school committee, but what we can do is outline what we think is effective from a policy perspective.

778
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe we have the right to do that.

779
01:16:10,273 --> 01:16:10,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

780
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, could you mute and unmute just to see if there's something going on with your audio?

781
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:21,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just unmute, unmute and then say hello.

782
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me now?

783
01:16:24,741 --> 01:16:27,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're getting you as a stadium kind of version of you.

784
01:16:28,824 --> 01:16:30,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It is understandable.

785
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:33,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just suddenly weird and it happened while you were speaking.

786
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:34,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

787
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:39,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I just was going to say, I concur with member Graham.

788
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:41,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important that we lay out a process.

789
01:16:43,444 --> 01:16:43,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

790
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:46,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put that into the notes.

791
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:55,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

792
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up is disciplinary actions.

793
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:02,668
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be removed, expulsion or termination.

794
01:17:02,688 --> 01:17:04,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that word, termination.

795
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sounds like, what else?

796
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,571
[SPEAKER_05]: How is expulsion, what's more than expulsion?

797
01:17:11,391 --> 01:17:18,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I'm sorry, that's a strange word there, but Mr. Greenspan says we cannot expel for bullying.

798
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:22,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that's, if we cannot, we cannot.

799
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:26,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see any reason to talk about it.

800
01:17:30,622 --> 01:17:37,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Referral to, under remediation actions, referral to special education for repeat offenders who fail to respond to individual behavior plans.

801
01:17:38,589 --> 01:17:40,910
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not standard for special ed referral.

802
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:46,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I would advise us to say, consider referral to special education if you suspect the student has a disability.

803
01:17:46,615 --> 01:17:48,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that sounds good.

804
01:17:48,957 --> 01:17:49,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody?

805
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:50,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

806
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:51,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

807
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:56,563
[SPEAKER_05]: We are gonna finish this thing and we're gonna end at least one minute early, I promise.

808
01:17:58,485 --> 01:17:59,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Notifications.

809
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,182
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, the comment is, and the other way around.

810
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:14,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can do that, just that we, the who's who in all of this remains confidential in both directions.

811
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Administrators may only share information with the permission of the student's family.

812
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,193
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not accurate or moved.

813
01:18:22,313 --> 01:18:28,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We can share information with school staff who have educational interests.

814
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:30,018
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually makes complete sense.

815
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:35,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be very strange, frankly.

816
01:18:35,171 --> 01:18:40,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you could operate a district, each other in meetings, stuff.

817
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:41,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Documentation.

818
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:51,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Personal notes can be kept confidential as long as you don't share with or consult them with the presence of parents or students.

819
01:18:52,717 --> 01:18:55,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Greenspan says this is not correct.

820
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:56,678
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I will,

821
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:06,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody, one of us, will get the language for what the current school student records regulations are and replace that.

822
01:19:07,627 --> 01:19:10,249
[SPEAKER_05]: This did also raise an eyebrow to me.

823
01:19:13,412 --> 01:19:20,599
[SPEAKER_05]: The section here, I'm clear what this chart is, which is great because it is very unclear to me too, so delete that.

824
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,542
[SPEAKER_05]: This one says that it's called the PQA now.

825
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:28,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the website and it was still called PRS.

826
01:19:28,885 --> 01:19:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if it's more than one thing.

827
01:19:32,488 --> 01:19:34,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's the same.

828
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,871
[SPEAKER_05]: PRS, okay, good.

829
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:38,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

830
01:19:38,713 --> 01:19:39,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we just look at that?

831
01:19:39,694 --> 01:19:40,274
[SPEAKER_09]: What did it say?

832
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:43,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

833
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It said that there's no longer PQA.

834
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:48,304
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same thing.

835
01:19:48,344 --> 01:19:52,309
[SPEAKER_09]: You might just want to put slash program quality assurance because people see it as both.

836
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:59,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I would just recommend the PRS in parentheses and PQA in parentheses just so folks know.

837
01:19:59,977 --> 01:20:01,499
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I will update that.

838
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:04,122
[SPEAKER_06]: What page is that?

839
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:21,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So this just to that just to that point this is similar to the appeals process, what I was discussing earlier so just to remember grams point earlier so this is an example, so seeking assistance outside of the district you may do so through PRS this is what we were asking that be put in.

840
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:27,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I was asking to be sure that it was put in PRS and or OCR, which is the Office of Civil Rights.

841
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:31,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is the procedural safeguards that we were talking about earlier.

842
01:20:32,026 --> 01:20:33,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have part of it in there.

843
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:37,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I would ask that we add the civil rights.

844
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And also people are talking about students on IEPs.

845
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:43,693
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, students with disabilities are not just students on IEPs.

846
01:20:43,733 --> 01:20:47,836
[SPEAKER_09]: There are students that have disabilities that don't have IEPs or 504s.

847
01:20:48,496 --> 01:20:50,297
[SPEAKER_09]: There are students who have disabilities that are on 504s.

848
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:59,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we need to be clear, like we can't say that just because a student has an IEP, there aren't students with disabilities that don't have IEPs.

849
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:11,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we might just want to say students with disabilities and get rid of IEP and 504 altogether, because I think that that is confusing and not everybody that has a disability has an IEP or 504.

850
01:21:16,558 --> 01:21:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will flush out this whole section.

851
01:21:19,301 --> 01:21:23,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would appreciate any emails with recommended additional language.

852
01:21:23,387 --> 01:21:23,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Robinson?

853
01:21:40,043 --> 01:21:50,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say that the language that Member Graham just, not Member Graham, Member McLaughlin just added about, you said students with disabilities.

854
01:21:50,932 --> 01:22:04,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we leave, if we add that language, I still do feel that we should leave the IEP and 504 language in there because there are students that are on maybe an IEP or a 504 where

855
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:15,325
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, self regulation may be listed as an official disability.

856
01:22:16,086 --> 01:22:19,152
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those students are entitled to

857
01:22:22,326 --> 01:22:26,207
[SPEAKER_01]: additional protections according to their IEP.

858
01:22:26,267 --> 01:22:42,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just didn't want to remove the words IEP and or 504 from the bullying report and add what member McLaughlin said to include students with disabilities that may not have an IEP or a 504.

859
01:22:43,151 --> 01:22:48,653
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want people to know that there are some things legally that

860
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:51,694
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to take into consideration.

861
01:22:51,834 --> 01:23:02,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't take into consideration, then once again, the district is liable and the district is at fault for not following the IEP or 504 plan.

862
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:14,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to add that piece so that those who may come back and watch later understand that there are some other things that we do need to keep in mind.

863
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:16,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

864
01:23:17,745 --> 01:23:18,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

865
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:21,192
[SPEAKER_05]: The next section is a bunch of pages down.

866
01:23:24,775 --> 01:23:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Just need to update the definition to match the definition.

867
01:23:29,698 --> 01:23:35,843
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not part of the definition, involves an imbalance of perceived or real physical or social power between target and aggressors.

868
01:23:35,963 --> 01:23:37,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will remove that.

869
01:23:38,165 --> 01:23:43,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Retaliation should be separated, which we have separated in our other definitions.

870
01:23:51,395 --> 01:23:52,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

871
01:23:54,999 --> 01:23:56,500
[SPEAKER_06]: This is to just remove.

872
01:23:57,341 --> 01:24:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Howard, should I remove the four repeat offenders?

873
01:24:02,486 --> 01:24:03,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the special education?

874
01:24:04,147 --> 01:24:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

875
01:24:05,368 --> 01:24:06,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Just repeat offenders.

876
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:08,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

877
01:24:10,053 --> 01:24:11,835
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's the end.

878
01:24:12,155 --> 01:24:12,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 5.56.

879
01:24:12,555 --> 01:24:12,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel

880
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:21,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I lied to several people about how early we were going to end, which is okay.

881
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:21,641
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to do the work.

882
01:24:23,203 --> 01:24:34,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So this, I will, I have my notes and I have a version of the document which I will share with everybody and which has

883
01:24:35,649 --> 01:24:39,730
[SPEAKER_05]: these notes made real, like remove this section, et cetera.

884
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:47,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will get that version to the members as well as for the purposes of minutes as soon as possible.

885
01:24:48,492 --> 01:24:49,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.

886
01:24:49,192 --> 01:24:51,372
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna have to have one more meeting to review.

887
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:55,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully a document we can send to the full committee.

888
01:24:55,453 --> 01:24:57,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do a doodle poll shortly.

889
01:24:57,254 --> 01:25:02,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's no other final words, is there a motion to adjourn?

890
01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:03,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

891
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:12,923
[SPEAKER_08]: The committee wants me to go through this version that you're going to send and presented cleaned up document at the next meeting.

892
01:25:12,943 --> 01:25:16,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what everyone wants to do?

893
01:25:16,224 --> 01:25:16,684
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

894
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:17,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we voted.

895
01:25:17,505 --> 01:25:20,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I think we decided that in our previous meeting, but that's my understanding.

896
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:21,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

897
01:25:22,546 --> 01:25:23,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

898
01:25:23,027 --> 01:25:25,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

899
01:25:25,307 --> 01:25:25,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

900
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:34,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

901
01:25:34,057 --> 01:25:38,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, on the motion to adjourn, remember Graham?

902
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:38,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
