    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5660.814s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5662.135s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5662.716s">I</a>  also want to just also say a thank you to you, Vice Chair Graham and Member Ruseau for your leadership in this negotiation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5673.584s">There</a>  was a true partnership for the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5677.187s">as</a>  well as our work with you on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5680.69s">It</a>  was a very collaborative collegial process that we had with Medford Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5686.434s">You</a>  spoke about all the highlights, I thank you very much, but I want to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5692.618s">We</a>  do have a lot of work ahead but it is a very exciting time for the students of the Medford Public Schools and we are excited to get that work done with teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5702.306s">There'll</a>  be a lot to do the rest of this school year as well as throughout the summer to make sure that we are prepared with new schedules at all the levels and a lot of increased opportunity and access for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5717.738s">We</a>  did put something out <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5719.659s">to</a>  the greater community in terms of a press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5724.462s">For</a>  families to have a little bit more detail, they can kind of search their emails and also look at the Medford Public Schools website for a little bit more information if so needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5735.188s">But</a>  just wanted to also extend that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5739.03s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5739.731s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Glucy. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5740.972s">Member</a>  Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5742.276s">Yep,</a>  I echo all of the thanks and appreciation for the work that's happening and I want to extend it to the members of the community, students, teachers, parents, voters, who allowed us to have these conversations about what we can do for students and with students, rather than what we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5762.839s">a</a>  much more encouraging budget process and negotiation that we were able to do this quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5770.643s">And</a>  that is because people in the community put their trust in our schools, our administration, our teachers, just everyone involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5781.468s">So</a>  I just wanted to thank the members of the community and the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5785.17s">This</a>  couldn't have been possible without the override funds and a commitment to putting students first. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5791.113s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5793.981s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5798.763s">Give</a>  me one second while I figure out who's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5801.785s">Member</a>  Ruseau, you're the next button. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5804.166s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5804.806s">I</a>  don't want to repeat everything, but I also want to say that I'm grateful for what the override has offered us as a community, but I think also as a community, it's worth noting that we will not be like <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5820.647s">virtually</a>  every other community right now, which is going through a torturous experience of there'll be strikes and there'll be cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5830.772s">And</a>  this is sort of the year when the hammer came down on COVID and now we'll get tariffs and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5838.536s">So</a>  I feel very fortunate to be in a community where instead of having a packed room of people screaming at us to not cut this and not cut that, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5849.883s">we're</a>  instead giving our kids more, which is a wonderful experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5856.307s">I</a>  do find that the negotiations were, they were a lot of long nights, but I felt like I certainly also felt like I had a lot of good relationships building up with the MTA team, as well as of course the administration and vice chair Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5874.171s">I</a>  appreciate all the work that has gone in. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5876.632s">I</a>  know that there's much more to do and I look forward to making sure all of our other contracts are also buttoned up nicely. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5884.117s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5886.378s">Thank</a>  you members. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5887.279s">So</a>  are there any other questions, comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5892.447s">Okay,</a>  congratulations, teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5897.889s">And</a>  we're excited to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5899.289s">So</a>  thank you all for those of you who are on joining us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5903.29s">Really</a>  exciting stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5904.23s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5906.451s">It's</a>  a really big deal what we just accomplished together. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5910.335s">Um,</a>  so the thing that everyone has been waiting for item number two is the approval of the 2526 school year calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5919.0s">And</a>  before I turn it over to Dr. Lucy, you know the the calendar is largely governed by the teachers contract here and in most communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5928.986s">And</a>  there are certain things that never change, and then there are things that are up for discussion, particularly when it is a contract renewal year, and the reason for the delay this year has been that there were in fact things that we were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5946.401s">with</a>  the MTA in terms of how to chart a different course forward for our students, that did have a material impact on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5953.866s">And</a>  so the two noteworthy items there are the elimination of six half days. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5962.672s">Those</a>  days will now be full days for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5966.015s">And</a>  the addition of two additional professional days for staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5971.978s">And</a>  so all of those things matter when you talk about what's the first day of school and how does the whole calendar look? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5978.241s">And</a>  I will turn it over to Dr. Galussi and Dr. Cushing at this point, but I just wanted to thank the community for their patience because I know August is right around the corner and I know people have been very eager to sort of start planning for their families for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5994.788s">So</a>  thank you for your patience and hopefully we will approve a calendar tonight.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5998.97s">Turn</a>  it over to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6000.03s">You</a>  literally took the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6004.112s">Thank</a>  you for framing that so nicely. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6007.134s">I'm</a>  going to turn it over to Dr. Cushing now that that kind of foundation has been set. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6011.196s">That's</a>  exactly what I was going to say just to frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6014.358s">He's</a>  going to walk through the school calendar and the work that he did in collaboration with our communications director, Will Papaselli. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6024.383s">But</a>  Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6027.193s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6027.733s">I</a>  do want to thank the entire community for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6030.314s">I</a>  know that the school calendar is something that the committee has a policy to deliver in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6037.177s">That</a>  simply just was not able to happen this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6039.337s">I</a>  do want to thank Dr. Galussi. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6042.238s">I</a>  do want to thank Joanne Allen, Lisa Malone, our two executive assistants, Will Pippicelli, and anyone else I may be forgetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6050.481s">Putting</a>  the calendar together, believe it or not, is a significantly challenging exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6055.663s">just</a>  because of making sure that we have 180 school days and making sure that the various holidays, professional development days, half days, and everything else that goes into it are carefully considered and calculated. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6069.178s">So</a>  I will share my screen now, just one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6073.823s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6076.381s">All</a>  right, so we developed two calendars this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6079.523s">One</a>  of the things with adding the professional development days and the number of holidays, as well as where the winter break falls around New Year's this year, posed some unique challenges to also meeting state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6094.393s">So</a>  we proposed option square and option triangle. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6099.136s">And</a>  those were simply because we don't want anyone to have a preference with whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6105.275s">Both</a>  calendars have identical dates for the first day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6107.936s">The</a>  first day of school will be on Wednesday, August 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6114.198s">New</a>  teachers will report the week of August 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6118.219s">And</a>  all teachers will report for two days in advance, what we call district launch day and the first professional development day on August 25th and August 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6130.082s">Kindergarten</a>  students will start on September 3rd, which is the following Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6136.988s">So</a>  those are unique across the board, as are the professional development days, the no students for the August 25th, August 26th, November 4th, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6152.601s">January</a>  20th, sorry, January 20th, I'm gonna blame lack of sleep, and then March 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6159.723s">That</a>  is correct on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6160.944s">I'll</a>  make sure it's correct in this before we publicize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6163.865s">Early</a>  release days that are the same across the calendar, both calendars, these change for the last day of schools on the calendars, but the early release days that are consistent on both calendars are the Thanksgiving holiday, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6177.992s">And</a>  then what we've been able to do this year is add caregiver conferences for all levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6184.099s">Those</a>  will take place on December 10th and February 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6189.025s">The</a>  New Year holiday will start on December 23rd with a half day on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6194.312s">And</a>  then the district is closed on the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6200.163s">So</a>  option square strictly adheres to policy I see ICA and honors all religious holidays, as expected, across the religions option square without snow days has us releasing on June 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6216.422s">Schools</a>  will not close for city elections on September 16 for the last two years, we have been able to operate with city elections in our buildings, and we have opera really operationalize that with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6228.67s">I</a>  want to thank Nina Nazarian and members of the Election Commission for that, and literally taking a tour of the district to go around and make sure that that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6238.097s">So</a>  per 603 CMR 27, Massachusetts school districts must schedule 185 days of school while only being required to be in session for a minimum of 180 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6249.948s">This</a>  is to make sure that if snow happens or other weather events, you have scheduled the days and you won't lose them to the new fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6260.358s">Graduation</a>  in this calendar will be held on June 11th, 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6265.964s">The</a>  high school principal has requested a break from Medford tradition of a Wednesday graduation day to move to a Thursday graduation day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6275.433s">Central</a>  leadership, district leadership has respected that because she has presented valid reasons in the preparation to move that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6284.462s">date.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6285.744s">So</a>  graduation per 603 CMR 27.05 subsection two requires that committees basically hold seniors for as long as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6297.776s">However,</a>  they say you can dismiss them up to 12 days ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6303.582s">So</a>  given the timing of the New Year holiday and the placement of religious holidays, scheduling 185 days is not feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6310.293s">We</a>  are able to schedule 184 days, but we are missing that one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6316.545s">Option</a>  Triangle seeks relief and advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6319.866s">The</a>  policy says that we are to seek advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6322.627s">So</a>  we seek relief and advice from the committee, but we wanted to pose Option Triangle as this option. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6329.609s">So</a>  schools will not close for city elections again on 9-16. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6332.91s">We</a>  will be open for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6335.331s">District</a>  leadership is proposing reducing one Christian, Jewish, and Islamic holiday <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6341.553s">And</a>  those would be, we would be in school on Rosh Hashanah, students who observe that would be able to take it off under the EB provisions of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6352.896s">Good</a>  Friday, students who observe that would be able to not be in school, and then Eid al-Adha <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6359.458s">was</a>  selected to, the other Eid represents the end of Ramadan, the highest holy season in the Islamic faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6368.245s">So</a>  we took these three and maintained the highest holy days as seen in those faiths. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6377.192s">Option</a>  Triangle, without snow days, has school releasing on June 18th, one day before another federally mandated holiday, Juneteenth. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6387.521s">Graduation</a>  day under this calendar, because of this shift, would be on June 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6393.51s">And</a>  again, graduate, I don't need to repeat that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6395.894s">And</a>  this calendar allows us to fulfill DESE requirements under 603 CMR 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6403.04s">I</a>  do have two policy recommendations to update this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6407.844s">I</a>  apologize to the committee that the second one was not in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6412.308s">The</a>  other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6413.709s">First,</a>  Indigenous Peoples Day is not listed, it is only listed as Columbus Day, we have for the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6422.256s">I</a>  think at least the last five listed them both listed both as Columbus slash Indigenous Peoples Day as Columbus Day is still the federally recognized name. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6432.347s">Sadly,</a>  that might not change for the next three and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6435.571s">The</a>  district calendar does recognize this annually, we do have Indigenous Peoples Day on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6443.464s">Presently,</a>  also policy state specifically this list does not include election days when the school buildings must close to provide polling places. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6453.528s">So</a>  as mentioned earlier in this presentation, we do not have the need to close on those days presently, while it is best, we are able to manage it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6463.532s">And</a>  district leadership is recommending a language adjustment to recognize that school buildings may have to close for those polling places. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6471.798s">But</a>  I would recommend that either that goes to the subcommittee or for future consideration on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6478.263s">I'm</a>  happy to share either of the two options visually with the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6485.888s">Just</a>  give me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6486.749s">The</a>  Zoom bar needs to be moved on my end here.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6504.124s">Oh,</a>  there it is, perfect.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6505.945s">So</a>  this is option square. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6511.149s">The</a>  calendars on the reverse or page two are fully updated and compliant with both the square and the triangle options because there is a slight modification on the days as contemplated. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6530.402s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6532.57s">This</a>  is the Medford Public Schools Square option that you can see gets us out on the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6539.172s">We</a>  have four days after, and then the triangle with one major removed for Christianity, Judaism, and Islam there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6556.896s">And</a>  I'm happy to take any advice the committee has.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6562.567s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6563.007s">Appreciate</a>  the heads up this was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6567.208s">And</a>  when we did the policy we also had not contemplated the additional two PD days, which are new, starting in this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6576.311s">So</a>  when we made these changes to the policy we had played them out I believe through 2030 or 2029 and things would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6585.073s">Um,</a>  but something else changed that I don't think we had anticipated at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6590.216s">So,</a>  um, I have two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6593.037s">Um,</a>  one is to send the recommendations here as well as, um, a discussion about the religious holidays in the context of how many school days we actually have staff work days there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6610.199s">Um</a>  and then the other one is a motion to approve Option triangle. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6616.704s">And</a>  now let me write those down.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6623.629s">Thank</a>  you, members. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6624.229s">So</a>  I think we have a few other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6629.232s">Maybe,</a>  um, do we want to take those before we <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6637.26s">No,</a>  I see a couple of mics here. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6639.161s">So</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6640.581s">Mike</a>  seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6641.501s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6642.402s">That's</a>  Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6643.582s">Never</a>  mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6644.883s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6646.803s">Never</a>  mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6647.523s">Oh,</a>  hold on.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6651.204s">Member</a>  Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6654.625s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, I'm hoping you can tell us a little bit about the consultation. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6658.367s">I</a>  know a lot of thought went into designating holidays and <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6663.937s">I'm</a>  hoping you can talk about how communities were consulted about the possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6669.764s">I</a>  had a lot of conversations with people when we were reviewing last year's calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6677.064s">I</a>  can speak to one religion more than others, as I imagine many people here can.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6682.808s">And</a>  so I actually used past years consultation in speaking with various communities about this in past years, about which holidays were considered more the holiest. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6697.259s">Interestingly</a>  enough, if I were to have made a consideration, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6703.429s">Unfortunately,</a>  Christmas is also a state holiday, but you know, and I'm sure this will be open to wide debate but Good Friday in the faith is a significantly more higher holiday, I know that that's definitely open for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6719.592s">23</a>  years of Catholic school, people can argue with me, but, and so in previous conversations, I have spoken to faith leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6731.877s">And</a>  what we did was we went, I went on that previous experience as to understand which were the holidays that were, for lack of a better term, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6744.242s">the</a>  higher holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6746.603s">I</a>  think for this district, one of the most significant shifts is going to be Good Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6752.586s">But</a>  I do believe that it's something that many other districts are also considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6759.728s">And</a>  in this unique situation, I don't I don't consider that this is something that we should do every year to ask for alleviation from the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6769.752s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6771.933s">you</a>  know, we still have the opportunity for staff to take these as religious holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6776.934s">We</a>  still have for students.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6777.754s">Not</a>  counting against their bank?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6780.595s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6781.415s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6782.675s">And</a>  I only I only defer to the superintendent just because I should defer to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6788.036s">So</a>  I want to make sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6789.037s">But</a>  no, it won't count against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6791.357s">And</a>  I think that in all honesty, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6797.532s">the</a>  professional development days are gonna help our district grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6800.014s">And</a>  in the future, these holidays, we're not requesting that they are removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6806.277s">There'll</a>  be a larger policy discussion, but at this point right now, this is a one-time request.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6814.162s">Hence</a>  the motion to discuss further. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6817.064s">I</a>  also support triangle and I'd be interested to see how that goes to inform future. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6825.569s">I'll</a>  defer to colleagues.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6829.927s">Member</a>  Olapade.</p>

    <p>[Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6831.469s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6833.492s">In</a>  both cases, like in the examples of students that do take these holidays off as their faith practice, is there an expectation that them or their families have to denote that somewhere, that this is a holiday they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6845.417s">recognize</a>  or is that just scouts honor?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6849.322s">I</a>  mean it should be scouts honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6851.384s">We</a>  should not be probing into students personal lives on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6855.99s">It</a>  should be their own personal faith-based decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6859.353s">What</a>  I would say though is that we as a district and many other districts probably have to do a better job of reminding all of our staff <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6865.901s">that</a>  on these holidays, major assignments should not be assigned or due per the policy, and to also make sure that we're continually communicating that out, that if a student observes these holidays, it's not a LARC, it is, or a staff member, it is something that is important to them, and for lack of, speaks to their soul as to who they are.</p>

    <p>[Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6889.279s">Definitely,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6892.782s">Member</a>  Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6896.107s">Yep,</a>  I was just going to say, I know that we in our schools do need to really make sure that those major assignments and tests are not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6906.571s">And</a>  to be aware of the burden that can be on students to notify teachers that this is a holiday for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6914.195s">It</a>  is sometimes challenging for students, not all students, but those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6922.758s">who</a>  are not comfortable putting themselves out there in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6926.461s">I</a>  certainly hear from people that having teachers be ready and aware and not making it a big deal will be really important, as well as the other student acceptance of marginalized religions in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6945.537s">And</a>  I think in terms of choosing which holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6947.418s">The</a>  other piece here is what actually happens during the observance right the observance of Yom Kippur is a fast based fasting holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6954.203s">It's</a>  very different than Rosh Hashanah. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6956.505s">So</a>  I appreciate that consideration in this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6961.228s">Or</a>  this request.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6966.492s">Member</a>  Ntaba.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6967.617s">Sure,</a>  I just have a motion to sever the motion and the two separate motions, one for the approval to send it to discussion and then the other one to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6976.684s">They</a>  are two already? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6977.885s">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6978.426s">I</a>  couldn't hear that well, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6980.207s">I</a>  rescind.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6983.289s">Okay,</a>  so member Ruseau, do you wanna read your first motion?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6988.534s">First</a>  motion is to approve the triangle option.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6992.236s">Okay,</a>  so motion to approve the triangle option calendar by member Ruseau, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6998.383s">Member</a>  Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6999.764s">Is</a>  there anybody on Zoom who wishes to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7009.852s">Okay,</a>  roll call.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7012.093s">If</a>  I may, through the chair, before the roll is called, I too think triangle option is best. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7019.979s">I</a>  just wanna make sure that our superintendent just plans accordingly in case <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7026.113s">we</a>  have a great number of teachers who take off on Good Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7030.154s">I</a>  know that's happened in local community near ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7034.195s">And</a>  so I just want to make sure we can still have class for the students that are able to come to school.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7045.158s">So</a>  heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7045.918s">I</a>  think this <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7047.918s">will</a>  require a lot of kind of conversation and planning, both with our teachers union and with school leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7056.684s">So</a>  we will ensure that we have those conversations around planning moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7062.467s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7064.905s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7066.285s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7066.725s">I</a>  think the other thing worth mentioning is that during negotiations, the topic of the number of religious holidays that we do have in our calendar did come up and there seemed like there was broad interest and being more dialed into like what those options might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7082.509s">So</a>  we can, you know, when we talk about the subcommittee, we can talk about inviting them, but I'm hopeful that some of the changes that are proposed in this calendar will be met with favor and participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7095.552s">I'm</a>  excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7096.513s">So,</a>  member Rousseau, if you can call the roll, please.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7098.714s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7099.335s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7100.095s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7100.555s">Member</a>  Intoppa? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7101.076s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7104.718s">Member</a>  Olapade? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7105.579s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7106.119s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7107.52s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7108.1s">Member</a>  Ruseau, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7108.921s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7110.321s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7112.363s">Five</a>  in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7115.885s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7118.086s">Member</a>  Ruseau, would you call your next motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7120.448s">Certainly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7121.308s">The</a>  motion is to send the calendar policy ICICA. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7125.09s">recommendations</a>  to the Policy Subcommittee for review and consideration of policy changes.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7131.392s">Motion</a>  by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7137.275s">Are</a>  there any questions on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7143.017s">Member</a>  Lopate. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7143.717s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7147.938s">Let's</a>  see, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7150.973s">Um,</a>  this to clarify, I just seconded this. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7154.555s">I</a>  should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7155.055s">This</a>  is to discuss both the changes recommended by Dr Cushing and the holidays in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7160.758s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7161.218s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7161.839s">Um,</a>  in that case, I would want to make sure that we invited, um, faith leaders and representatives from to attend this meeting, explicitly inviting them, not just making it known that this policy, the subcommittee is meeting chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7179.101s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7179.901s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7180.762s">You</a>  had asked Dr. Cushing earlier about this when we created this policy, and we did invite all of the faith leaders.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7188.845s">I</a>  watched that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7189.725s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7190.305s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7190.525s">I</a>  did watch it.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7191.866s">So</a>  yeah, we will certainly do that again, because I think we're in a different situation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7197.468s">We</a>  also didn't, I don't believe we even had Juneteenth at that time either.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7200.749s">We</a>  didn't.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7202.59s">I</a>  do think there might be a conversation to be had with our state delegation, at least on the eastern part of the state, where we haven't had five snow days in so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7210.652s">It's</a>  questionable whether we'll ever have five snow days again, but that's outside the scope, I think, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7218.894s">So</a>  shall I do that?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7220.975s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7222.395s">Anybody</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7228.017s">Member</a>  Ruseau, will you call the roll, please?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7229.658s">Certainly</a>  memorandum. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7230.739s">Yes,</a>  remember on top of all the potty memory and fell. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7234.803s">Yes,</a>  remember so yes Marilyn go current.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7237.105s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7239.468s">Six</a>  in the affirmative one absent motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7245.834s">Okay,</a>  item number three we have our rate card for after school meet and kids corner by Dr. Lucy interim superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7255.069s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7257.73s">So</a>  this evening, we're here for an approval request from the Medford School Committee, as Vice Chair Member Graham mentioned, for the before and after school care, the MEEP, which is our preschool program, and Kids' Corner, which is our municipal daycare program. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7278.192s">Um,</a>  during an annual review of all of our care programs throughout Metro Public Schools, we've observed rise in expenses, salaries and operational costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7289.857s">And</a>  so in order to maintain the quality of the education that we pride ourselves on, we're here to request a very modest adjustment to tuition in <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7299.681s">the</a>  three programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7301.644s">I'll</a>  talk through those in a brief moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7303.887s">This</a>  is going to allow us to strengthen our investment in staff and resources and in accessibility that is currently there, which will ultimately enhance the educational programming and experience for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7316.908s">So</a>  the first one that I'd like to discuss this kids corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7320.271s">So,</a>  last year the families that use kids corner, as our municipal daycare did receive a memo highlighting the three years of a kind of tiered increase to the tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7335.944s">But</a>  unfortunately, I don't think it went before this board in a formal manner as part of the rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7343.629s">So</a>  you will see here what the current increases for this school year as well as the next two school years. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7353.026s">this</a>  accounts for an increase in tuition and a reflection of the increase that was given to the salaries of the employees of Kids Corner so that we're giving them an increase that's more of a living wage for what they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7372.657s">And</a>  so that was done last year through the bargaining team and the ratified contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7379.661s">And</a>  so we adjusted the tuition <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7382.663s">as</a>  you see here in the charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7384.025s">I</a>  don't know if you want to ask questions for each program as we go.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7388.151s">We</a>  can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7389.453s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7390.815s">Are</a>  there any questions about Kids' Corner? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7397.327s">I</a>  just had a brief question. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7399.108s">So</a>  the 24, 24, 25 rates are on page one and then 25, 26 are on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7407.693s">And</a>  also 26, 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7408.493s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7409.194s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7410.874s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7411.535s">And</a>  just for your, the, I also linked the memo that went to families for your, you know, reference.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7419.899s">Are</a>  there other questions about Kids Corner before we go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7426.037s">We</a>  can take motions about each one. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7431.742s">So</a>  motion to approve Kids' Corner rates for the 25-26 and 26-27 school year by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Wapate. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7442.512s">Are</a>  there any questions online? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7456.003s">No</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7456.403s">I'm</a>  not seeing any. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7458.004s">Member</a>  Ruseau, can you call the roll, please?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7461.306s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7462.246s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7462.666s">Member</a>  Intoppa? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7463.227s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7464.067s">Member</a>  Olapade? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7464.847s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7465.328s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7466.888s">Member</a>  Ruseau, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7467.629s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7468.99s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7470.951s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7473.432s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7474.973s">Kids</a>  Corner rates are approved for 2025-26 and 26-27. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7480.127s">On</a>  to MEEP.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7481.328s">On</a>  to MEEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7482.549s">So</a>  similar with MEEP and maybe some of the talking points I'll also be giving for before and after school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7490.377s">The</a>  consideration for MEEP, so the increase in tuition also will allow us to <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7501.272s">look</a>  at our resources in terms of staffing needs that are needed for the program at each of the schools, as well as increase some access opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7512.561s">For</a>  MEEP, some of the uncertainty that's in the world today, where it's hard to necessarily determine where we'll be with some of the grant funding that is also used for <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7528.052s">for</a>  MEEP purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7529.113s">So</a>  what you have here, you have the current tuition rates for 24-25 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7537.622s">And</a>  then for next year, 25-26, we have shown an increase of what a 2% tuition increase would be and what a 3% tuition increase would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7547.852s">We</a>  are here tonight requesting the 3% based on some of the uncertainty and the coverage that we want to have for resource staff as well as increasing access for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7563.702s">So</a>  that would be the second number that's listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7566.904s">Happy</a>  to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7569.245s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7571.566s">Member</a>  Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7573.207s">Oh,</a>  Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7574.78s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7575.32s">Is</a>  there an error in the meet tuition charts across the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7580.784s">There's</a>  five days and four days for Brooks, five days and four days for Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7585.107s">And</a>  then there's two five days and a four day for Missittook. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7588.569s">And</a>  that second five day one is hugely more expensive than all the other programs.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7596.878s">So</a>  I'll, yes, I'm going to ask our Director of Student Services, Joan Bowen, to come and answer some of the specific questions regarding each individual school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7606.121s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7607.641s">Because</a>  in each of the, there's three MISUTA programs for each of the MEAPs, and there's this one five-day one, which is dramatically more expensive.</p>

    <p>[0FSPW3s1sRE_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7620.486s">That's</a>  COVID, so that's how it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7621.466s">Oh,</a>  hold on.</p>

    <p>[Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7623.282s">Is</a>  it working? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7624.523s">So</a>  that's our full day program. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7626.685s">That's</a>  more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7628.227s">The</a>  other programs that are four and five that are lesser money are the half day programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7633.572s">So</a>  students either come in the morning or in the afternoon and then there's several programs that are full day.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7639.037s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7639.478s">I</a>  just, when we send this out, we might want to make sure to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7643.181s">Clarify</a>  that for anybody else reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7645.363s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7645.964s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7651.872s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7652.393s">Member</a>  Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7653.794s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7654.334s">On</a>  the same aspect of Missitook, for that second five day, according to this, the price goes down by $2. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7661.82s">Is</a>  that the correct rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7664.061s">Because</a>  it goes from $5.52 to $5.50? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7665.522s">Or</a>  am I just reading this wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7672.793s">For</a>  MEEP for the second five day, MISTITUC for monthly is 552, yearly 5525. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7677.294s">And</a>  then on MEEP 2025 to 2026, that second five day is 550 and then 550.04, so it's less. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7680.896s">Is</a>  that the actual rate or?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7695.891s">I'm</a>  gonna have to double check those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7698.492s">I</a>  think the yearly may be an error that we can look into.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7702.514s">Because</a>  the monthly and yearly are both, both options are less than what is the 2024 and 2025 number. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7710.478s">So</a>  I'm not sure what the actual 25 and 26 number is, if that is the actual number, but all of them go up except for that one.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7718.257s">Well,</a>  so the 3% is 550, which is an increase right now from what it is, which is 525. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7724.581s">Oh,</a>  I see what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7727.383s">So</a>  it says 552.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7728.404s">I</a>  think these didn't get updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7730.945s">The</a>  new rates did not be.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7732.646s">It's</a>  more of a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7735.208s">What</a>  is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7735.828s">Is</a>  the 2526 number correct, or is the 2425 number correct?</p>

    <p>[Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7741.717s">So</a>  the 24-25 number is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7744.438s">We</a>  have to adjust the 25-26 number for that particular program.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7749.699s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7750.279s">I</a>  think that's the only one I've noticed so far.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7753.82s">And</a>  the proposal is that your request is that they all increase by 3% across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7762.321s">So</a>  those numbers would change for the five-day full class. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7765.982s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7766.402s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7769.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7770.35s">Thank</a>  you, Member Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7773.612s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7774.813s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7776.574s">For</a>  Kids Corner, we approved the next two school years, but for me, for only approving the next school year, is there a reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7786.82s">Just</a>  didn't get to it.</p>

    <p>[Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7789.292s">we</a>  wanted to see what the results would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7792.054s">And</a>  then, I mean, I might be back here next year asking for another rate increase because it is, we have 80 spots for our community students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7802.281s">So</a>  we wanted to see what the increase, the impact would have if people would be more apt to sign up because it's, you know, half day, like what the impact is gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7813.108s">So</a>  we'd like to do 3% now and then increase, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7817.915s">possibly</a>  and then have a two or three year plan.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7824.199s">I</a>  also think it's important to note that Joan, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7829.302s">Bowen</a>  and her department has also done a lot of comparison research data and our prices for MEEP are quite affordable and lower than the surrounding preschool programs within the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7851.57s">Member</a>  Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7852.431s">So</a>  you answered my first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7853.792s">My</a>  second one was what was the previous, what have the increases been like previous, what's the history?</p>

    <p>[Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7860.596s">So</a>  there has not been a history of increases in probably the last three or four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7864.919s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7865.5s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7866.18s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7981.337s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7981.897s">Next</a>  up, we have the before and after school program.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7985.179s">OK,</a>  so similarly to what we've been discussing for the other two programs, we would like to make a modest increase to the tuition for the before school and the after school programs to increase the accessibility that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8004.572s">And</a>  with the uncertainty of not totally knowing, we've already seen <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8010.315s">some</a>  increases in the materials and the supplies in order to run after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8016.281s">And</a>  so without really knowing what's fully ahead, we're asking again, similarly, you will see on these charts, you will see the rates for this current year for before school and after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8028.832s">And</a>  then you will see for next year, what 2% looks like versus a 3% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8036.659s">you</a>  know, we defer and welcome any questions of conversation from the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8042.162s">I</a>  think we would like to see 3%, but happy to discuss what that would look like in order to cover the increase in cost and, you know, access for our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8058.152s">I</a>  do have Megan Fiddler-Carrie on the call if there are also some specific questions for her.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8068.543s">Member</a>  Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8070.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8071.124s">Similar</a>  point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8073.806s">I'm</a>  assuming it's just another clerical issue of if you're looking at the before care program, the 3% increase is less than the 2% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8083.413s">It's</a>  more of an ask that I'm assuming it's my math is not awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8088.696s">It's</a>  probably 122.57 instead of 112.57. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8094.58s">So</a>  if that could just be corrected for our families at home, if they're using this as a point of reference, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8102.382s">On</a>  the back page, before care programs, school year 2025 to 2026, the number for 3% is less than the number for 2%.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8114.226s">For</a>  which?</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8114.866s">On</a>  monthly, for day three.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8116.806s">For</a>  the three-day option?</p>

    <p>[Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8120.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8120.788s">Right,</a>  yeah, I should say one, two, <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8124.906s">$122.57.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8125.246s">It's</a>  the inverses.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8131.512s">So</a>  what I think what?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8136.336s">Sorry,</a>  could we take a five minute recess to figure out Zoom?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8140.079s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8141.441s">Let's</a>  take a five minute recess while we figure out our Zoom access so people can listen in. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8146.505s">We'll</a>  be right back, folks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8161.648s">So</a>  standby.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8177.055s">While</a>  we're in recess, what I'll do is I will stop this zoom and go check the settings and relaunch in about two minutes for anyone who is on, you'll be able to use the same exact link. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8187.965s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8188.345s">But</a>  in approximately two minutes, um, I'll see if there's a setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8192.709s">Uh,</a>  it's working now.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8195.331s">It's</a>  work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8195.871s">It's</a>  working now. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8196.932s">It</a>  looks like it just hasn't worked until now.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8260.046s">Thanks</a>  for your patience, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8261.448s">We're</a>  going to disconnect this Zoom and restart it in two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8267.416s">And</a>  everyone on the call will have to dial in our apologies, or you can keep watching on YouTube.</p>
