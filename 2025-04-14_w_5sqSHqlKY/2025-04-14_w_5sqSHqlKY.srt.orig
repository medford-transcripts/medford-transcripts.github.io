[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ntapa?

108
01:32:29,828 --> 01:32:30,669

[SPEAKER_02]: Our contract with the Medford Teachers Association is ratified for the next three years.

110
01:32:37,003 --> 01:32:40,824
[SPEAKER_02]: The crowd goes wild here in chambers if you can't see them.

111
01:32:43,005 --> 01:32:49,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say thank you to the bargaining team of the MTA led by President Guillen and Vice President Regano.

112
01:32:50,407 --> 01:32:52,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked really hard to make this happen.

113
01:32:52,648 --> 01:32:54,008
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked really hard to bring

114
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: the promises of the override to life in a real way for students.

115
01:32:59,189 --> 01:33:23,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will mean things like 15 more minutes in the school day, increased dedication to professional development with two additional professional development days, a reduction of half days, which are hard for students and families, improvements to our grading policies, alignment of the high school schedule to move to a seven block

116
01:33:24,795 --> 01:33:30,717
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule, which will create opportunity for further integration between the vocational school and the academic side.

117
01:33:31,737 --> 01:33:37,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope my daughter never personally has to do online Spanish ever again, as I'm sure many students do.

118
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:52,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And a whole host of other things in terms of opening up access to academic support and electives at the high school level, creating challenge classes at the middle school level, and giving our littlest learners more time with their teachers.

119
01:33:53,143 --> 01:33:54,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge deal.

120
01:33:54,664 --> 01:33:55,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an important contract.

121
01:33:57,325 --> 01:34:04,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to say thank you for all the people who helped us get here as quickly as we did because this was fast.

122
01:34:05,628 --> 01:34:16,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you in advance for the work that is to come because this is just the beginning of what will be a really big transformation between now and the start of the school year next year.

123
01:34:20,814 --> 01:34:21,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

124
01:34:22,135 --> 01:34:22,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.

125
01:34:22,716 --> 01:34:33,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to just also say a thank you to you, Vice Chair Graham and Member Rousseau for your leadership in this negotiation process.

126
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:36,507
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a true partnership for the Medford Public Schools.

127
01:34:37,187 --> 01:34:39,769
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as our work with you on the school committee.

128
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:46,414
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very collaborative collegial process that we had with Medford Teachers Association.

129
01:34:46,434 --> 01:34:51,537
[SPEAKER_00]: You spoke about all the highlights, I thank you very much, but I want to say that

130
01:34:52,618 --> 01:35:02,246
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a lot of work ahead but it is a very exciting time for the students of the Medford Public Schools and we are excited to get that work done with teachers.

131
01:35:02,306 --> 01:35:16,337
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a lot to do the rest of this school year as well as throughout the summer to make sure that we are prepared with new schedules at all the levels and a lot of increased opportunity and access for our students.

132
01:35:17,738 --> 01:35:19,279
[SPEAKER_00]: We did put something out

133
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:23,801
[SPEAKER_00]: to the greater community in terms of a press release.

134
01:35:24,462 --> 01:35:34,928
[SPEAKER_00]: For families to have a little bit more detail, they can kind of search their emails and also look at the Medford Public Schools website for a little bit more information if so needed.

135
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:37,450
[SPEAKER_00]: But just wanted to also extend that.

136
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:39,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

137
01:35:39,731 --> 01:35:40,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Glucy.

138
01:35:40,972 --> 01:35:41,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld.

139
01:35:42,276 --> 01:36:00,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, I echo all of the thanks and appreciation for the work that's happening and I want to extend it to the members of the community, students, teachers, parents, voters, who allowed us to have these conversations about what we can do for students and with students, rather than what we can't.

140
01:36:02,839 --> 01:36:10,143
[SPEAKER_12]: a much more encouraging budget process and negotiation that we were able to do this quickly.

141
01:36:10,643 --> 01:36:21,288
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is because people in the community put their trust in our schools, our administration, our teachers, just everyone involved in this.

142
01:36:21,468 --> 01:36:24,890
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to thank the members of the community and the voters.

143
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:30,872
[SPEAKER_12]: This couldn't have been possible without the override funds and a commitment to putting students first.

144
01:36:31,113 --> 01:36:31,613
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

145
01:36:33,981 --> 01:36:34,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

146
01:36:38,763 --> 01:36:40,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one second while I figure out who's next.

147
01:36:41,785 --> 01:36:43,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau, you're the next button.

148
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:44,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

149
01:36:44,806 --> 01:36:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to repeat everything, but I also want to say that I'm grateful for what the override has offered us as a community, but I think also as a community, it's worth noting that we will not be like

150
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:10,432
[SPEAKER_01]: virtually every other community right now, which is going through a torturous experience of there'll be strikes and there'll be cuts.

151
01:37:10,772 --> 01:37:18,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is sort of the year when the hammer came down on COVID and now we'll get tariffs and other things.

152
01:37:18,536 --> 01:37:28,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel very fortunate to be in a community where instead of having a packed room of people screaming at us to not cut this and not cut that,

153
01:37:29,883 --> 01:37:35,686
[SPEAKER_01]: we're instead giving our kids more, which is a wonderful experience.

154
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:53,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I do find that the negotiations were, they were a lot of long nights, but I felt like I certainly also felt like I had a lot of good relationships building up with the MTA team, as well as of course the administration and vice chair Graham.

155
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:56,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the work that has gone in.

156
01:37:56,632 --> 01:38:03,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's much more to do and I look forward to making sure all of our other contracts are also buttoned up nicely.

157
01:38:04,117 --> 01:38:04,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

158
01:38:06,378 --> 01:38:07,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you members.

159
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any other questions, comments?

160
01:38:12,447 --> 01:38:15,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, congratulations, teachers.

161
01:38:17,889 --> 01:38:18,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're excited to get to work.

162
01:38:19,289 --> 01:38:22,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you all for those of you who are on joining us tonight.

163
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:24,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Really exciting stuff.

164
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:26,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

165
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:29,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really big deal what we just accomplished together.

166
01:38:30,335 --> 01:38:36,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the thing that everyone has been waiting for item number two is the approval of the 2526 school year calendar.

167
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:48,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I turn it over to Dr. Lucy, you know the the calendar is largely governed by the teachers contract here and in most communities.

168
01:38:48,986 --> 01:39:04,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are certain things that never change, and then there are things that are up for discussion, particularly when it is a contract renewal year, and the reason for the delay this year has been that there were in fact things that we were discussing.

169
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:13,806
[SPEAKER_02]: with the MTA in terms of how to chart a different course forward for our students, that did have a material impact on the calendar.

170
01:39:13,866 --> 01:39:21,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the two noteworthy items there are the elimination of six half days.

171
01:39:22,672 --> 01:39:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Those days will now be full days for students.

172
01:39:26,015 --> 01:39:30,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And the addition of two additional professional days for staff.

173
01:39:31,978 --> 01:39:37,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of those things matter when you talk about what's the first day of school and how does the whole calendar look?

174
01:39:38,241 --> 01:39:54,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will turn it over to Dr. Galussi and Dr. Cushing at this point, but I just wanted to thank the community for their patience because I know August is right around the corner and I know people have been very eager to sort of start planning for their families for next year.

175
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:58,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for your patience and hopefully we will approve a calendar tonight.

176
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it over to you.

177
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,091
[SPEAKER_00]: You literally took the words out of my mouth.

178
01:40:04,112 --> 01:40:05,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for framing that so nicely.

179
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:11,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Cushing now that that kind of foundation has been set.

180
01:40:11,196 --> 01:40:13,497
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I was going to say just to frame.

181
01:40:14,358 --> 01:40:23,062
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to walk through the school calendar and the work that he did in collaboration with our communications director, Will Papaselli.

182
01:40:24,383 --> 01:40:25,944
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dr. Cushing.

183
01:40:27,193 --> 01:40:27,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

184
01:40:27,733 --> 01:40:30,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to thank the entire community for your patience.

185
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:36,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the school calendar is something that the committee has a policy to deliver in November.

186
01:40:37,177 --> 01:40:39,317
[SPEAKER_08]: That simply just was not able to happen this year.

187
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:41,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to thank Dr. Galussi.

188
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:49,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to thank Joanne Allen, Lisa Malone, our two executive assistants, Will Pippicelli, and anyone else I may be forgetting.

189
01:40:50,481 --> 01:40:54,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Putting the calendar together, believe it or not, is a significantly challenging exercise.

190
01:40:55,663 --> 01:41:08,437
[SPEAKER_08]: just because of making sure that we have 180 school days and making sure that the various holidays, professional development days, half days, and everything else that goes into it are carefully considered and calculated.

191
01:41:09,178 --> 01:41:11,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will share my screen now, just one moment.

192
01:41:13,823 --> 01:41:14,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And

193
01:41:16,381 --> 01:41:18,502
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we developed two calendars this year.

194
01:41:19,523 --> 01:41:34,133
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things with adding the professional development days and the number of holidays, as well as where the winter break falls around New Year's this year, posed some unique challenges to also meeting state statute.

195
01:41:34,393 --> 01:41:38,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So we proposed option square and option triangle.

196
01:41:39,136 --> 01:41:43,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And those were simply because we don't want anyone to have a preference with whatever it may be.

197
01:41:45,275 --> 01:41:47,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Both calendars have identical dates for the first day of school.

198
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:53,217
[SPEAKER_08]: The first day of school will be on Wednesday, August 27th.

199
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:57,138
[SPEAKER_08]: New teachers will report the week of August 18th.

200
01:41:58,219 --> 01:42:07,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And all teachers will report for two days in advance, what we call district launch day and the first professional development day on August 25th and August 26th.

201
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:15,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Kindergarten students will start on September 3rd, which is the following Wednesday.

202
01:42:16,988 --> 01:42:29,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are unique across the board, as are the professional development days, the no students for the August 25th, August 26th, November 4th,

203
01:42:32,601 --> 01:42:39,563
[SPEAKER_08]: January 20th, sorry, January 20th, I'm gonna blame lack of sleep, and then March 3rd.

204
01:42:39,723 --> 01:42:40,924
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct on the calendar.

205
01:42:40,944 --> 01:42:43,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make sure it's correct in this before we publicize it.

206
01:42:43,865 --> 01:42:57,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Early release days that are the same across the calendar, both calendars, these change for the last day of schools on the calendars, but the early release days that are consistent on both calendars are the Thanksgiving holiday,

207
01:42:57,992 --> 01:43:03,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what we've been able to do this year is add caregiver conferences for all levels.

208
01:43:04,099 --> 01:43:08,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Those will take place on December 10th and February 4th.

209
01:43:09,025 --> 01:43:13,831
[SPEAKER_08]: The New Year holiday will start on December 23rd with a half day on that day.

210
01:43:14,312 --> 01:43:16,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the district is closed on the 24th.

211
01:43:20,163 --> 01:43:34,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So option square strictly adheres to policy I see ICA and honors all religious holidays, as expected, across the religions option square without snow days has us releasing on June 24.

212
01:43:36,422 --> 01:43:48,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Schools will not close for city elections on September 16 for the last two years, we have been able to operate with city elections in our buildings, and we have opera really operationalize that with the city.

213
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:56,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Nina Nazarian and members of the Election Commission for that, and literally taking a tour of the district to go around and make sure that that would work.

214
01:43:58,097 --> 01:44:09,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So per 603 CMR 27, Massachusetts school districts must schedule 185 days of school while only being required to be in session for a minimum of 180 days.

215
01:44:09,948 --> 01:44:19,397
[SPEAKER_08]: This is to make sure that if snow happens or other weather events, you have scheduled the days and you won't lose them to the new fiscal year.

216
01:44:20,358 --> 01:44:24,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Graduation in this calendar will be held on June 11th, 2026.

217
01:44:25,964 --> 01:44:35,313
[SPEAKER_08]: The high school principal has requested a break from Medford tradition of a Wednesday graduation day to move to a Thursday graduation day.

218
01:44:35,433 --> 01:44:43,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Central leadership, district leadership has respected that because she has presented valid reasons in the preparation to move that.

219
01:44:44,462 --> 01:44:44,743
[SPEAKER_08]: date.

220
01:44:45,744 --> 01:44:57,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So graduation per 603 CMR 27.05 subsection two requires that committees basically hold seniors for as long as possible.

221
01:44:57,776 --> 01:45:02,842
[SPEAKER_08]: However, they say you can dismiss them up to 12 days ahead of time.

222
01:45:03,582 --> 01:45:09,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So given the timing of the New Year holiday and the placement of religious holidays, scheduling 185 days is not feasible.

223
01:45:10,293 --> 01:45:12,657
[SPEAKER_08]: We are able to schedule 184 days, but we are missing that one day.

224
01:45:16,545 --> 01:45:19,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Option Triangle seeks relief and advice.

225
01:45:19,866 --> 01:45:22,167
[SPEAKER_08]: The policy says that we are to seek advice.

226
01:45:22,627 --> 01:45:28,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So we seek relief and advice from the committee, but we wanted to pose Option Triangle as this option.

227
01:45:29,609 --> 01:45:32,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So schools will not close for city elections again on 9-16.

228
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,731
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be open for those.

229
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:40,493
[SPEAKER_08]: District leadership is proposing reducing one Christian, Jewish, and Islamic holiday

230
01:45:41,553 --> 01:45:52,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And those would be, we would be in school on Rosh Hashanah, students who observe that would be able to take it off under the EB provisions of the policy.

231
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:58,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Good Friday, students who observe that would be able to not be in school, and then Eid al-Adha

232
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:07,585
[SPEAKER_08]: was selected to, the other Eid represents the end of Ramadan, the highest holy season in the Islamic faith.

233
01:46:08,245 --> 01:46:16,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So we took these three and maintained the highest holy days as seen in those faiths.

234
01:46:17,192 --> 01:46:26,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Option Triangle, without snow days, has school releasing on June 18th, one day before another federally mandated holiday, Juneteenth.

235
01:46:27,521 --> 01:46:32,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Graduation day under this calendar, because of this shift, would be on June 4th.

236
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, graduate, I don't need to repeat that.

237
01:46:35,894 --> 01:46:40,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And this calendar allows us to fulfill DESE requirements under 603 CMR 27.

238
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:47,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have two policy recommendations to update this policy.

239
01:46:47,844 --> 01:46:51,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize to the committee that the second one was not in the packet.

240
01:46:52,308 --> 01:46:52,788
[SPEAKER_08]: The other day.

241
01:46:53,709 --> 01:47:00,335
[SPEAKER_08]: First, Indigenous Peoples Day is not listed, it is only listed as Columbus Day, we have for the past several years.

242
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:11,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at least the last five listed them both listed both as Columbus slash Indigenous Peoples Day as Columbus Day is still the federally recognized name.

243
01:47:12,347 --> 01:47:14,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, that might not change for the next three and a half years.

244
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:22,219
[SPEAKER_08]: The district calendar does recognize this annually, we do have Indigenous Peoples Day on the calendar.

245
01:47:23,464 --> 01:47:32,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Presently, also policy state specifically this list does not include election days when the school buildings must close to provide polling places.

246
01:47:33,528 --> 01:47:42,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So as mentioned earlier in this presentation, we do not have the need to close on those days presently, while it is best, we are able to manage it.

247
01:47:43,532 --> 01:47:51,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And district leadership is recommending a language adjustment to recognize that school buildings may have to close for those polling places.

248
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:57,842
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would recommend that either that goes to the subcommittee or for future consideration on the floor.

249
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:05,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to share either of the two options visually with the committee.

250
01:48:05,888 --> 01:48:06,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give me one second.

251
01:48:06,749 --> 01:48:11,212
[SPEAKER_08]: The Zoom bar needs to be moved on my end here.

252
01:48:24,124 --> 01:48:25,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there it is, perfect.

253
01:48:25,945 --> 01:48:29,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is option square.

254
01:48:31,149 --> 01:48:49,802
[SPEAKER_08]: The calendars on the reverse or page two are fully updated and compliant with both the square and the triangle options because there is a slight modification on the days as contemplated.

255
01:48:50,402 --> 01:48:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

256
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:58,512
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Medford Public Schools Square option that you can see gets us out on the 24th.

257
01:48:59,172 --> 01:49:15,816
[SPEAKER_08]: We have four days after, and then the triangle with one major removed for Christianity, Judaism, and Islam there as well.

258
01:49:16,896 --> 01:49:18,856
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy to take any advice the committee has.

259
01:49:22,567 --> 01:49:22,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

260
01:49:23,007 --> 01:49:25,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate the heads up this was coming.

261
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:35,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did the policy we also had not contemplated the additional two PD days, which are new, starting in this year.

262
01:49:36,311 --> 01:49:42,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we made these changes to the policy we had played them out I believe through 2030 or 2029 and things would work.

263
01:49:45,073 --> 01:49:49,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but something else changed that I don't think we had anticipated at that time.

264
01:49:50,216 --> 01:49:52,637
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I have two motions.

265
01:49:53,037 --> 01:50:09,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one is to send the recommendations here as well as, um, a discussion about the religious holidays in the context of how many school days we actually have staff work days there are.

266
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:15,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Um and then the other one is a motion to approve Option triangle.

267
01:50:16,704 --> 01:50:17,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And now let me write those down.

268
01:50:23,629 --> 01:50:24,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, members.

269
01:50:24,229 --> 01:50:29,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we have a few other questions.

270
01:50:29,232 --> 01:50:32,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, um, do we want to take those before we

271
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,061
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I see a couple of mics here.

272
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:40,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.

273
01:50:40,581 --> 01:50:41,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike seven.

274
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:42,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

275
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:43,202
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Dr. Cushing.

276
01:50:43,582 --> 01:50:43,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

277
01:50:44,883 --> 01:50:45,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

278
01:50:46,803 --> 01:50:47,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

279
01:50:47,523 --> 01:50:48,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hold on.

280
01:50:51,204 --> 01:50:54,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Reinfeldt.

281
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:58,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Cushing, I'm hoping you can tell us a little bit about the consultation.

282
01:50:58,367 --> 01:51:02,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of thought went into designating holidays and

283
01:51:03,937 --> 01:51:09,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hoping you can talk about how communities were consulted about the possibility.

284
01:51:09,764 --> 01:51:14,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a lot of conversations with people when we were reviewing last year's calendar.

285
01:51:17,064 --> 01:51:22,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I can speak to one religion more than others, as I imagine many people here can.

286
01:51:22,808 --> 01:51:35,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I actually used past years consultation in speaking with various communities about this in past years, about which holidays were considered more the holiest.

287
01:51:37,259 --> 01:51:41,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Interestingly enough, if I were to have made a consideration,

288
01:51:43,429 --> 01:51:58,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, Christmas is also a state holiday, but you know, and I'm sure this will be open to wide debate but Good Friday in the faith is a significantly more higher holiday, I know that that's definitely open for debate.

289
01:51:59,592 --> 01:52:10,317
[SPEAKER_08]: 23 years of Catholic school, people can argue with me, but, and so in previous conversations, I have spoken to faith leaders.

290
01:52:11,877 --> 01:52:22,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we did was we went, I went on that previous experience as to understand which were the holidays that were, for lack of a better term,

291
01:52:24,242 --> 01:52:25,343
[SPEAKER_08]: the higher holidays.

292
01:52:26,603 --> 01:52:31,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for this district, one of the most significant shifts is going to be Good Friday.

293
01:52:32,586 --> 01:52:39,308
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do believe that it's something that many other districts are also considering.

294
01:52:39,728 --> 01:52:49,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this unique situation, I don't I don't consider that this is something that we should do every year to ask for alleviation from the policy.

295
01:52:49,752 --> 01:52:50,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But

296
01:52:51,933 --> 01:52:55,934
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we still have the opportunity for staff to take these as religious holidays.

297
01:52:56,934 --> 01:52:57,734
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have for students.

298
01:52:57,754 --> 01:52:59,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Not counting against their bank?

299
01:53:00,595 --> 01:53:00,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

300
01:53:01,415 --> 01:53:01,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

301
01:53:01,975 --> 01:53:02,135
Yeah.

302
01:53:02,675 --> 01:53:07,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And I only I only defer to the superintendent just because I should defer to the superintendent.

303
01:53:08,036 --> 01:53:08,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to make sure of that.

304
01:53:09,037 --> 01:53:10,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, it won't count against them.

305
01:53:11,357 --> 01:53:15,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that in all honesty,

306
01:53:17,532 --> 01:53:19,994
[SPEAKER_08]: the professional development days are gonna help our district grow.

307
01:53:20,014 --> 01:53:25,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the future, these holidays, we're not requesting that they are removed.

308
01:53:26,277 --> 01:53:32,681
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be a larger policy discussion, but at this point right now, this is a one-time request.

309
01:53:34,162 --> 01:53:37,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Hence the motion to discuss further.

310
01:53:37,064 --> 01:53:44,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I also support triangle and I'd be interested to see how that goes to inform future.

311
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:46,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll defer to colleagues.

312
01:53:49,927 --> 01:53:50,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olopade.

313
01:53:51,469 --> 01:53:51,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

314
01:53:53,492 --> 01:54:04,346
[SPEAKER_06]: In both cases, like in the examples of students that do take these holidays off as their faith practice, is there an expectation that them or their families have to denote that somewhere, that this is a holiday they do?

315
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:08,621
[SPEAKER_06]: recognize or is that just scouts honor?

316
01:54:09,322 --> 01:54:11,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean it should be scouts honor.

317
01:54:11,384 --> 01:54:15,929
[SPEAKER_08]: We should not be probing into students personal lives on this.

318
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:18,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be their own personal faith-based decision.

319
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:25,340
[SPEAKER_08]: What I would say though is that we as a district and many other districts probably have to do a better job of reminding all of our staff

320
01:54:25,901 --> 01:54:48,459
[SPEAKER_08]: that on these holidays, major assignments should not be assigned or due per the policy, and to also make sure that we're continually communicating that out, that if a student observes these holidays, it's not a LARC, it is, or a staff member, it is something that is important to them, and for lack of, speaks to their soul as to who they are.

321
01:54:49,279 --> 01:54:50,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, thank you so much.

322
01:54:52,782 --> 01:54:53,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Reinfeldt.

323
01:54:56,107 --> 01:55:05,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, I was just going to say, I know that we in our schools do need to really make sure that those major assignments and tests are not happening.

324
01:55:06,571 --> 01:55:13,314
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be aware of the burden that can be on students to notify teachers that this is a holiday for me.

325
01:55:14,195 --> 01:55:21,798
[SPEAKER_12]: It is sometimes challenging for students, not all students, but those students.

326
01:55:22,758 --> 01:55:26,441
[SPEAKER_12]: who are not comfortable putting themselves out there in this way.

327
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:42,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly hear from people that having teachers be ready and aware and not making it a big deal will be really important, as well as the other student acceptance of marginalized religions in particular.

328
01:55:45,537 --> 01:55:47,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think in terms of choosing which holiday.

329
01:55:47,418 --> 01:55:54,143
[SPEAKER_12]: The other piece here is what actually happens during the observance right the observance of Yom Kippur is a fast based fasting holiday.

330
01:55:54,203 --> 01:55:55,884
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very different than Rosh Hashanah.

331
01:55:56,505 --> 01:55:59,487
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate that consideration in this decision.

332
01:56:01,228 --> 01:56:01,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Or this request.

333
01:56:06,492 --> 01:56:07,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntaba.

334
01:56:07,617 --> 01:56:16,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, I just have a motion to sever the motion and the two separate motions, one for the approval to send it to discussion and then the other one to approve.

335
01:56:16,684 --> 01:56:17,565
[SPEAKER_10]: They are two already?

336
01:56:17,885 --> 01:56:18,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

337
01:56:18,426 --> 01:56:20,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't hear that well, thank you.

338
01:56:20,207 --> 01:56:20,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I rescind.

339
01:56:23,289 --> 01:56:25,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so member Russo, do you wanna read your first motion?

340
01:56:28,534 --> 01:56:30,495
[SPEAKER_01]: First motion is to approve the triangle option.

341
01:56:32,236 --> 01:56:36,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so motion to approve the triangle option calendar by member Russo, seconded by?

342
01:56:38,383 --> 01:56:39,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olopade.

343
01:56:39,764 --> 01:56:42,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody on Zoom who wishes to speak?

344
01:56:49,852 --> 01:56:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, roll call.

345
01:56:52,093 --> 01:56:59,939
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, through the chair, before the roll is called, I too think triangle option is best.

346
01:56:59,979 --> 01:57:04,723
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanna make sure that our superintendent just plans accordingly in case

347
01:57:06,113 --> 01:57:10,134
[SPEAKER_13]: we have a great number of teachers who take off on Good Friday.

348
01:57:10,154 --> 01:57:13,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that's happened in local community near ours.

349
01:57:14,195 --> 01:57:20,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just want to make sure we can still have class for the students that are able to come to school.

350
01:57:25,158 --> 01:57:25,698
[SPEAKER_00]: So heard.

351
01:57:25,918 --> 01:57:26,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this

352
01:57:27,918 --> 01:57:35,463
[SPEAKER_00]: will require a lot of kind of conversation and planning, both with our teachers union and with school leaders.

353
01:57:36,684 --> 01:57:41,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will ensure that we have those conversations around planning moving forward.

354
01:57:42,467 --> 01:57:42,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

355
01:57:44,905 --> 01:57:45,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

356
01:57:46,285 --> 01:57:46,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

357
01:57:46,725 --> 01:58:02,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other thing worth mentioning is that during negotiations, the topic of the number of religious holidays that we do have in our calendar did come up and there seemed like there was broad interest and being more dialed into like what those options might be.

358
01:58:02,509 --> 01:58:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can, you know, when we talk about the subcommittee, we can talk about inviting them, but I'm hopeful that some of the changes that are proposed in this calendar will be met with favor and participation.

359
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that.

360
01:58:16,513 --> 01:58:18,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So, member Rousseau, if you can call the roll, please.

361
01:58:18,714 --> 01:58:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.

362
01:58:19,335 --> 01:58:19,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

363
01:58:20,095 --> 01:58:20,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

364
01:58:20,555 --> 01:58:21,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ntapa?

365
01:58:21,076 --> 01:58:21,176
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

366
01:58:24,718 --> 01:58:25,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olopade?

367
01:58:25,579 --> 01:58:25,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

368
01:58:26,119 --> 01:58:26,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Rheinfeld?

369
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:28,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

370
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:28,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Rousseau, yes.

371
01:58:28,921 --> 01:58:29,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Lungo-Kern?

372
01:58:30,321 --> 01:58:30,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

373
01:58:32,363 --> 01:58:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent.

374
01:58:35,885 --> 01:58:36,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

375
01:58:38,086 --> 01:58:40,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau, would you call your next motion?

376
01:58:40,448 --> 01:58:40,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

377
01:58:41,308 --> 01:58:43,529
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion is to send the calendar policy ICICA.

378
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:50,032
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations to the Policy Subcommittee for review and consideration of policy changes.

379
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:56,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

380
01:58:57,275 --> 01:58:58,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions on Zoom?

381
01:59:03,017 --> 01:59:03,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Lopate.

382
01:59:03,717 --> 01:59:07,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

383
01:59:07,938 --> 01:59:09,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, Member Reinfeldt.

384
01:59:10,973 --> 01:59:14,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, this to clarify, I just seconded this.

385
01:59:14,555 --> 01:59:14,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I should have.

386
01:59:15,055 --> 01:59:20,598
[SPEAKER_12]: This is to discuss both the changes recommended by Dr Cushing and the holidays in general.

387
01:59:20,758 --> 01:59:20,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

388
01:59:21,218 --> 01:59:21,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

389
01:59:21,839 --> 01:59:37,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, in that case, I would want to make sure that we invited, um, faith leaders and representatives from to attend this meeting, explicitly inviting them, not just making it known that this policy, the subcommittee is meeting chair.

390
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:39,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau?

391
01:59:39,901 --> 01:59:40,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

392
01:59:40,762 --> 01:59:48,825
[SPEAKER_01]: You had asked Dr. Cushing earlier about this when we created this policy, and we did invite all of the faith leaders.

393
01:59:48,845 --> 01:59:49,665
[SPEAKER_12]: I watched that meeting.

394
01:59:49,725 --> 01:59:50,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

395
01:59:50,305 --> 01:59:50,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

396
01:59:50,525 --> 01:59:51,206
[SPEAKER_12]: I did watch it.

397
01:59:51,866 --> 01:59:56,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we will certainly do that again, because I think we're in a different situation now.

398
01:59:57,468 --> 02:00:00,729
[SPEAKER_01]: We also didn't, I don't believe we even had Juneteenth at that time either.

399
02:00:00,749 --> 02:00:01,310
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't.

400
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:10,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there might be a conversation to be had with our state delegation, at least on the eastern part of the state, where we haven't had five snow days in so long.

401
02:00:10,652 --> 02:00:18,734
[SPEAKER_01]: It's questionable whether we'll ever have five snow days again, but that's outside the scope, I think, right now.

402
02:00:18,894 --> 02:00:20,955
[SPEAKER_01]: So shall I do that?

403
02:00:20,975 --> 02:00:21,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

404
02:00:22,395 --> 02:00:27,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?

405
02:00:28,017 --> 02:00:29,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo, will you call the roll, please?

406
02:00:29,658 --> 02:00:30,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly memorandum.

407
02:00:30,739 --> 02:00:34,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, remember on top of all the potty memory and fell.

408
02:00:34,803 --> 02:00:36,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, remember so yes Marilyn go current.

409
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:37,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

410
02:00:39,468 --> 02:00:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Six in the affirmative one absent motion passes.

411
02:00:45,834 --> 02:00:53,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, item number three we have our rate card for after school meet and kids corner by Dr. Lucy interim superintendent.

412
02:00:55,069 --> 02:00:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

413
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:17,018
[SPEAKER_00]: So this evening, we're here for an approval request from the Medford School Committee, as Vice Chair Member Graham mentioned, for the before and after school care, the MEEP, which is our preschool program, and Kids' Corner, which is our municipal daycare program.

414
02:01:18,192 --> 02:01:29,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, during an annual review of all of our care programs throughout Metro Public Schools, we've observed rise in expenses, salaries and operational costs.

415
02:01:29,857 --> 02:01:38,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to maintain the quality of the education that we pride ourselves on, we're here to request a very modest adjustment to tuition in

416
02:01:39,681 --> 02:01:40,643
[SPEAKER_00]: the three programs.

417
02:01:41,644 --> 02:01:43,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk through those in a brief moment.

418
02:01:43,887 --> 02:01:55,424
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to allow us to strengthen our investment in staff and resources and in accessibility that is currently there, which will ultimately enhance the educational programming and experience for our students.

419
02:01:56,908 --> 02:01:59,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one that I'd like to discuss this kids corner.

420
02:02:00,271 --> 02:02:14,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So, last year the families that use kids corner, as our municipal daycare did receive a memo highlighting the three years of a kind of tiered increase to the tuition.

421
02:02:15,944 --> 02:02:23,129
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, I don't think it went before this board in a formal manner as part of the rate increases.

422
02:02:23,629 --> 02:02:30,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will see here what the current increases for this school year as well as the next two school years.

423
02:02:33,026 --> 02:02:52,277
[SPEAKER_00]: this accounts for an increase in tuition and a reflection of the increase that was given to the salaries of the employees of Kids Corner so that we're giving them an increase that's more of a living wage for what they deserve.

424
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:59,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was done last year through the bargaining team and the ratified contract.

425
02:02:59,661 --> 02:03:01,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we adjusted the tuition

426
02:03:02,663 --> 02:03:04,005
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see here in the charts.

427
02:03:04,025 --> 02:03:08,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to ask questions for each program as we go.

428
02:03:08,151 --> 02:03:09,233
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.

429
02:03:09,453 --> 02:03:09,693
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

430
02:03:10,815 --> 02:03:12,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions about Kids' Corner?

431
02:03:17,327 --> 02:03:18,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a brief question.

432
02:03:19,108 --> 02:03:25,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 24, 24, 25 rates are on page one and then 25, 26 are on page two.

433
02:03:27,693 --> 02:03:28,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And also 26, 27.

434
02:03:28,493 --> 02:03:28,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

435
02:03:29,194 --> 02:03:29,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

436
02:03:30,874 --> 02:03:31,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

437
02:03:31,535 --> 02:03:37,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for your, the, I also linked the memo that went to families for your, you know, reference.

438
02:03:39,899 --> 02:03:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other questions about Kids Corner before we go on?

439
02:03:46,037 --> 02:03:48,139
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take motions about each one.

440
02:03:51,742 --> 02:04:02,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So motion to approve Kids' Corner rates for the 25-26 and 26-27 school year by member Reinfeld, seconded by member Wapate.

441
02:04:02,512 --> 02:04:06,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions online?

442
02:04:16,003 --> 02:04:16,383
[SPEAKER_02]: No question.

443
02:04:16,403 --> 02:04:17,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing any.

444
02:04:18,004 --> 02:04:19,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau, can you call the roll, please?

445
02:04:21,306 --> 02:04:21,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

446
02:04:22,246 --> 02:04:22,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

447
02:04:22,666 --> 02:04:23,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ntapa?

448
02:04:23,227 --> 02:04:23,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

449
02:04:24,067 --> 02:04:24,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olopade?

450
02:04:24,847 --> 02:04:25,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

451
02:04:25,328 --> 02:04:26,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Rheinfeld?

452
02:04:26,168 --> 02:04:26,328
Yes.

453
02:04:26,888 --> 02:04:27,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Rousseau, yes.

454
02:04:27,629 --> 02:04:28,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Lungo-Kern?

455
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:29,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

456
02:04:30,951 --> 02:04:33,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

457
02:04:33,432 --> 02:04:34,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

458
02:04:34,973 --> 02:04:36,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids Corner rates are approved for 2025-26 and 26-27.

459
02:04:40,127 --> 02:04:40,487
[SPEAKER_02]: On to MEEP.

460
02:04:41,328 --> 02:04:41,829
[SPEAKER_00]: On to MEEP.

461
02:04:42,549 --> 02:04:48,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar with MEEP and maybe some of the talking points I'll also be giving for before and after school care.

462
02:04:50,377 --> 02:04:57,284
[SPEAKER_00]: The consideration for MEEP, so the increase in tuition also will allow us to

463
02:05:01,272 --> 02:05:10,459
[SPEAKER_00]: look at our resources in terms of staffing needs that are needed for the program at each of the schools, as well as increase some access opportunities.

464
02:05:12,561 --> 02:05:27,031
[SPEAKER_00]: For MEEP, some of the uncertainty that's in the world today, where it's hard to necessarily determine where we'll be with some of the grant funding that is also used for

465
02:05:28,052 --> 02:05:29,073
[SPEAKER_00]: for MEEP purposes.

466
02:05:29,113 --> 02:05:37,041
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have here, you have the current tuition rates for 24-25 this year.

467
02:05:37,622 --> 02:05:44,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for next year, 25-26, we have shown an increase of what a 2% tuition increase would be and what a 3% tuition increase would be.

468
02:05:47,852 --> 02:06:02,581
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here tonight requesting the 3% based on some of the uncertainty and the coverage that we want to have for resource staff as well as increasing access for families.

469
02:06:03,702 --> 02:06:05,843
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be the second number that's listed.

470
02:06:06,904 --> 02:06:09,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to answer any questions.

471
02:06:09,245 --> 02:06:09,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

472
02:06:11,566 --> 02:06:12,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntapa.

473
02:06:13,207 --> 02:06:14,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Member Russo.

474
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

475
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:19,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an error in the meet tuition charts across the board?

476
02:06:20,784 --> 02:06:25,067
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five days and four days for Brooks, five days and four days for Roberts.

477
02:06:25,107 --> 02:06:28,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's two five days and a four day for Missittook.

478
02:06:28,569 --> 02:06:34,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And that second five day one is hugely more expensive than all the other programs.

479
02:06:36,878 --> 02:06:46,101
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, yes, I'm going to ask our Director of Student Services, Joan Bowen, to come and answer some of the specific questions regarding each individual school.

480
02:06:46,121 --> 02:06:47,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

481
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:57,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in each of the, there's three MISUTA programs for each of the MEAPs, and there's this one five-day one, which is dramatically more expensive.

482
02:07:00,486 --> 02:07:01,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's COVID, so that's how it would be.

483
02:07:01,466 --> 02:07:01,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hold on.

484
02:07:03,282 --> 02:07:03,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it working?

485
02:07:04,523 --> 02:07:06,205
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's our full day program.

486
02:07:06,685 --> 02:07:07,746
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more expensive.

487
02:07:08,227 --> 02:07:13,011
[SPEAKER_11]: The other programs that are four and five that are lesser money are the half day programs.

488
02:07:13,572 --> 02:07:18,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So students either come in the morning or in the afternoon and then there's several programs that are full day.

489
02:07:19,037 --> 02:07:19,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

490
02:07:19,478 --> 02:07:23,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, when we send this out, we might want to make sure to clarify that.

491
02:07:23,181 --> 02:07:25,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Clarify that for anybody else reading it.

492
02:07:25,363 --> 02:07:25,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

493
02:07:25,964 --> 02:07:26,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

494
02:07:31,872 --> 02:07:32,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

495
02:07:32,393 --> 02:07:33,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntapa.

496
02:07:33,794 --> 02:07:34,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

497
02:07:34,334 --> 02:07:41,520
[SPEAKER_10]: On the same aspect of Missitook, for that second five day, according to this, the price goes down by $2.

498
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the correct rate?

499
02:07:44,061 --> 02:07:45,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it goes from $5.52 to $5.50?

500
02:07:45,522 --> 02:07:48,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Or am I just reading this wrong?

501
02:07:52,793 --> 02:07:57,254
[SPEAKER_10]: For MEEP for the second five day, MISTITUC for monthly is 552, yearly 5525.

502
02:07:57,294 --> 02:08:00,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on MEEP 2025 to 2026, that second five day is 550 and then 550.04, so it's less.

503
02:08:00,896 --> 02:08:01,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the actual rate or?

504
02:08:15,891 --> 02:08:17,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to double check those numbers.

505
02:08:18,492 --> 02:08:22,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the yearly may be an error that we can look into.

506
02:08:22,514 --> 02:08:29,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the monthly and yearly are both, both options are less than what is the 2024 and 2025 number.

507
02:08:30,478 --> 02:08:37,602
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not sure what the actual 25 and 26 number is, if that is the actual number, but all of them go up except for that one.

508
02:08:38,257 --> 02:08:44,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the 3% is 550, which is an increase right now from what it is, which is 525.

509
02:08:44,581 --> 02:08:47,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see what you're saying.

510
02:08:47,383 --> 02:08:48,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says 552.

511
02:08:48,404 --> 02:08:50,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these didn't get updated.

512
02:08:50,945 --> 02:08:52,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The new rates did not be.

513
02:08:52,646 --> 02:08:54,507
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of a point of clarification.

514
02:08:55,208 --> 02:08:55,808
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?

515
02:08:55,828 --> 02:08:58,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the 2526 number correct, or is the 2425 number correct?

516
02:09:01,717 --> 02:09:04,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So the 24-25 number is correct.

517
02:09:04,438 --> 02:09:09,559
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to adjust the 25-26 number for that particular program.

518
02:09:09,699 --> 02:09:10,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

519
02:09:10,279 --> 02:09:12,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the only one I've noticed so far.

520
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:22,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And the proposal is that your request is that they all increase by 3% across the board.

521
02:09:22,321 --> 02:09:25,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So those numbers would change for the five-day full class.

522
02:09:25,982 --> 02:09:26,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

523
02:09:26,402 --> 02:09:27,002
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

524
02:09:29,083 --> 02:09:29,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

525
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:31,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Ntapa.

526
02:09:33,612 --> 02:09:34,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau?

527
02:09:34,813 --> 02:09:35,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

528
02:09:36,574 --> 02:09:45,659
[SPEAKER_01]: For Kids Corner, we approved the next two school years, but for me, for only approving the next school year, is there a reason?

529
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Just didn't get to it.

530
02:09:49,292 --> 02:09:51,414
[SPEAKER_11]: we wanted to see what the results would be.

531
02:09:52,054 --> 02:10:01,741
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, I mean, I might be back here next year asking for another rate increase because it is, we have 80 spots for our community students.

532
02:10:02,281 --> 02:10:13,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So we wanted to see what the increase, the impact would have if people would be more apt to sign up because it's, you know, half day, like what the impact is gonna be.

533
02:10:13,108 --> 02:10:16,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd like to do 3% now and then increase,

534
02:10:17,915 --> 02:10:20,176
[SPEAKER_11]: possibly and then have a two or three year plan.

535
02:10:21,077 --> 02:10:21,817
Perfect, thank you.

536
02:10:21,937 --> 02:10:22,097
Yep.

537
02:10:24,199 --> 02:10:29,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think it's important to note that Joan, Ms.

538
02:10:29,302 --> 02:10:47,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen and her department has also done a lot of comparison research data and our prices for MEEP are quite affordable and lower than the surrounding preschool programs within the city of Medford.

539
02:10:51,570 --> 02:10:52,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rheinfeld.

540
02:10:52,431 --> 02:10:53,752
[SPEAKER_12]: So you answered my first question.

541
02:10:53,792 --> 02:11:00,536
[SPEAKER_12]: My second one was what was the previous, what have the increases been like previous, what's the history?

542
02:11:00,596 --> 02:11:04,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So there has not been a history of increases in probably the last three or four years.

543
02:11:04,919 --> 02:11:05,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

544
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:05,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

545
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:06,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

546
02:11:09,803 --> 02:11:10,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

547
02:11:11,844 --> 02:11:12,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau.

548
02:11:13,906 --> 02:11:17,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve the MEEP rates at 3% for the next school year.

549
02:11:18,361 --> 02:11:24,122
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a motion to approve the MEEP rates at 3% for the next school year by member Rousseau.

550
02:11:24,202 --> 02:11:25,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second?

551
02:11:29,844 --> 02:11:31,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by member Reinfeld.

552
02:11:33,365 --> 02:11:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions from the folks online?

553
02:11:36,785 --> 02:11:46,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we?

554
02:11:46,608 --> 02:11:46,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we?

555
02:11:49,019 --> 02:11:49,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see.

556
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:53,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you shouldn't have to have any.

557
02:12:19,413 --> 02:12:19,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

558
02:12:21,174 --> 02:12:21,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

559
02:12:23,095 --> 02:12:30,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are listening, you can join us on Zoom or on YouTube for the live action.

560
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:32,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Play by play.

561
02:12:32,859 --> 02:12:35,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Play by play.

562
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:40,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we have a motion on the floor by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

563
02:12:40,302 --> 02:12:41,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you call the roll, please?

564
02:12:42,143 --> 02:12:42,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

565
02:12:42,963 --> 02:12:43,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

566
02:12:43,363 --> 02:12:44,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Antapa?

567
02:12:44,404 --> 02:12:44,564
Yes.

568
02:12:44,824 --> 02:12:45,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olopade?

569
02:12:45,564 --> 02:12:45,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

570
02:12:46,245 --> 02:12:47,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeldt?

571
02:12:47,615 --> 02:12:49,416
[SPEAKER_01]: never so yes Maryland go current.

572
02:12:49,896 --> 02:12:50,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

573
02:12:51,637 --> 02:12:57,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Six in the affirmative one absent me rates for 2526 will increase by 3% and that is approved.

574
02:13:01,337 --> 02:13:01,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

575
02:13:01,897 --> 02:13:04,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, we have the before and after school program.

576
02:13:05,179 --> 02:13:24,331
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so similarly to what we've been discussing for the other two programs, we would like to make a modest increase to the tuition for the before school and the after school programs to increase the accessibility that we have.

577
02:13:24,572 --> 02:13:29,294
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the uncertainty of not totally knowing, we've already seen

578
02:13:30,315 --> 02:13:35,940
[SPEAKER_00]: some increases in the materials and the supplies in order to run after school.

579
02:13:36,281 --> 02:13:48,732
[SPEAKER_00]: And so without really knowing what's fully ahead, we're asking again, similarly, you will see on these charts, you will see the rates for this current year for before school and after school.

580
02:13:48,832 --> 02:13:53,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will see for next year, what 2% looks like versus a 3% increase.

581
02:13:56,659 --> 02:14:01,182
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we defer and welcome any questions of conversation from the committee.

582
02:14:02,162 --> 02:14:15,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we would like to see 3%, but happy to discuss what that would look like in order to cover the increase in cost and, you know, access for our families.

583
02:14:18,152 --> 02:14:25,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have Megan Fiddler-Carrie on the call if there are also some specific questions for her.

584
02:14:28,543 --> 02:14:29,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntapa.

585
02:14:30,544 --> 02:14:31,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

586
02:14:31,124 --> 02:14:33,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Similar point of clarification.

587
02:14:33,806 --> 02:14:41,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming it's just another clerical issue of if you're looking at the before care program, the 3% increase is less than the 2% increase.

588
02:14:43,413 --> 02:14:48,096
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of an ask that I'm assuming it's my math is not awful.

589
02:14:48,696 --> 02:14:49,517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably 122.57 instead of 112.57.

590
02:14:54,580 --> 02:15:00,722
[SPEAKER_10]: So if that could just be corrected for our families at home, if they're using this as a point of reference, that would be great.

591
02:15:02,382 --> 02:15:12,585
[SPEAKER_10]: On the back page, before care programs, school year 2025 to 2026, the number for 3% is less than the number for 2%.

592
02:15:14,226 --> 02:15:14,726
[SPEAKER_02]: For which?

593
02:15:14,866 --> 02:15:16,366
[SPEAKER_10]: On monthly, for day three.

594
02:15:16,806 --> 02:15:18,347
[SPEAKER_02]: For the three-day option?

595
02:15:20,567 --> 02:15:20,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

596
02:15:20,788 --> 02:15:22,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, yeah, I should say one, two,

597
02:15:24,906 --> 02:15:27,869
[SPEAKER_11]: $122.57.

598
02:15:25,246 --> 02:15:27,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the inverses.

599
02:15:31,512 --> 02:15:34,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think what?

600
02:15:36,336 --> 02:15:39,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, could we take a five minute recess to figure out Zoom?

601
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:40,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

602
02:15:41,441 --> 02:15:45,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a five minute recess while we figure out our Zoom access so people can listen in.

603
02:15:46,505 --> 02:15:47,546
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back, folks.

604
02:16:01,648 --> 02:16:03,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So standby.

605
02:16:17,055 --> 02:16:27,344
[SPEAKER_08]: While we're in recess, what I'll do is I will stop this zoom and go check the settings and relaunch in about two minutes for anyone who is on, you'll be able to use the same exact link.

606
02:16:27,965 --> 02:16:28,265
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

607
02:16:28,345 --> 02:16:32,689
[SPEAKER_08]: But in approximately two minutes, um, I'll see if there's a setting.

608
02:16:32,709 --> 02:16:34,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's working now.

609
02:16:35,331 --> 02:16:35,731
[SPEAKER_13]: It's work.

610
02:16:35,871 --> 02:16:36,592
[SPEAKER_13]: It's working now.

611
02:16:36,932 --> 02:16:39,855
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like it just hasn't worked until now.

612
02:17:40,046 --> 02:17:41,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your patience, everyone.

613
02:17:41,448 --> 02:17:45,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to disconnect this Zoom and restart it in two minutes.

614
02:17:47,416 --> 02:17:51,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone on the call will have to dial in our apologies, or you can keep watching on YouTube.
