00:00:01,857 --> 00:00:02,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday, November 14, 2023 at 6 p.m.

2
00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:03,558
[SPEAKER_04]: This meeting is called to order.

3
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:04,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Councilor Scarpelli.

5
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're having some speaker issues, yeah.

6
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:38,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, present or absent?

7
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:40,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Present, four present, three absent.

8
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:43,287
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting is called to order.

9
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:49,791
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Tuesday, November 14th, 2023 at 6 p.m.

10
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,414
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Medford City Council Chambers on the second floor of Medford City Hall and via Zoom.

11
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:58,001
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss proposed food truck ordinance per paper 20-020.

12
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:06,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee has invited Interim Economic Development Director Victor Schrader and Attorney Robert Stein of KP Law to attend this meeting.

13
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:09,950
[SPEAKER_04]: For further information, aids, and accommodations, contact the city clerk.

14
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,050
[SPEAKER_04]: at 781-393-2425.

15
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely yours, Nicole Morel, Council President.

16
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:19,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an ordinance that we last visited in February of this year.

17
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:34,040
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that has been a policy that was put into place, I believe, in 2016 by then-Mayor Burke, and this whole process has been essentially streamlining that policy and really just bringing it into ordinance form, so there's no questions as far as how these permits are

18
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,021
[SPEAKER_04]: quite forgotten and things like that.

19
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:48,505
[SPEAKER_04]: At our last meeting we left it and that we wanted to pass this on through Interim Director Schrader to get additional feedback from the Board of Health as well as Fire and Police and Engineering, I believe.

20
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have Interim Director Schrader here tonight.

21
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:58,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pass things off to him for an update on that process and then we can open it up for discussion with Councilors but also vice president Bears.

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a reverberating sound.

23
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:04,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys hear us on Zoom?

24
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:05,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a thumbs up.

25
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:06,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

26
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:06,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

27
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:07,063
[SPEAKER_04]: They can hear us.

28
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,664
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

29
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:13,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I'll pass it over to Victor Schrader.

30
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:16,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everyone.

31
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Morell.

32
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,929
[SPEAKER_09]: After our last committee of the whole meeting on this topic.

33
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:32,618
[SPEAKER_09]: We have reviewed it with other departments and in the city, and we have a director of the health department Marianne O'Connor here.

34
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,501
[SPEAKER_09]: She's going to be an important part of rolling this out.

35
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:37,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we, we have it.

36
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:40,185
[SPEAKER_09]: in order to inform.

37
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:45,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So we also asked Robin Stein of KP Law to review the latest draft.

38
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And she has some suggestions related to structure and mechanics that we felt were important to share with you for consideration.

39
00:02:55,513 --> 00:03:00,975
[SPEAKER_09]: No surprise after the pandemic, there are many communities that are considering food truck ordinances.

40
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:08,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some best practices that are kind of rising to the top and KP law has been working with many of these communities.

41
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:14,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So we felt that they had some great ideas that we should consider.

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we wanted to bring them to you.

43
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the draft

44
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:21,725
[SPEAKER_09]: ordinance in PDF form that I'm happy to share if that'd be helpful.

45
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Just let me know and I'll share screen.

46
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:29,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, I'll turn it over to Robin Stein from KP law to walk us through.

47
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

48
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:35,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having us tonight.

49
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:58,195
[SPEAKER_05]: As Victor said, we've been looking at the ordinance and did want to talk, I think more generally without really getting necessarily into the specific sections of the ordinance about the approach that the city is taking for this regulation and to just talk through kind of our recommendations for how the different components of food trucks will be regulated by the city.

50
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can come back to you with

51
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:03,099
[SPEAKER_05]: more specific draft in the future.

52
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:17,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our recommendation for this is somewhat rooted in general law chapter 111, section 31, which is the existing statute that allows the Board of Health to adopt regulations for public health.

53
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:33,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we would expect to see for something like food trucks is that the board of health acting under that statute and consistent with 105 CMR 590, which is the food restaurant sanitary code would be able as a board of health.

54
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:42,549
[SPEAKER_05]: to put a regulation in place for food trucks to obtain permits to operate in the city and for the operational components of the food truck.

55
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,114
[SPEAKER_05]: So the food safety, you know, inspections, hoods, heating, all of that kind of stuff.

56
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:56,562
[SPEAKER_05]: The how the food trucks operate part would be accomplished through a regulation by the Board of Health under the existing Board of Health statute and sanitary code.

57
00:04:57,082 --> 00:05:01,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's another component of food trucks, which is kind of the land use component.

58
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:02,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do they go in the city?

59
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:03,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do they have a right to be?

60
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And that implicates both the council as far as public ways, and it would implicate zoning when it comes to anything that's not a public street.

61
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:19,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for municipal property, it may implicate other municipal departments as well.

62
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we are hoping to be able to discuss with you tonight are

63
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:34,936
[SPEAKER_05]: some of those components so that we can have a better understanding from a policy perspective and help draft this in a way that suits the council's goals are those components.

64
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:39,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, I would anticipate that if somebody wanted to operate a food truck in the city,

65
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:46,573
[SPEAKER_05]: They would need both a permit from the board of health, which is required by the regulation.

66
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:51,774
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't operate without a permit and you need 1 from each of the communities that you're going to operate in.

67
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that you need the permission to place that food truck.

68
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:02,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody wanted to put the food truck in a public way, it would be up to the council to grant that permission.

69
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:11,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, for example, if you look in your current ordinances, section 74.2, it already talks about the uses of streets.

70
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:16,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe there's a reference in there that prohibits anybody from placing a cart for the sale of fruits.

71
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: in the street without the council's permission.

72
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:34,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would make sense to amend and update that section of the city's ordinances to talk about the fact that no one can put a food truck generally on a city street without the council's permission.

73
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:43,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can work with the council either through amending that section of the ordinances or regulations promulgated under that section

74
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:52,649
[SPEAKER_05]: to then put in place the guidelines by which the council would give somebody permission to actually have a food truck on a city street, if you're inclined to allow that.

75
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as private property or even municipal property that's not a street goes, that would be governed by your zoning bylaw.

76
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a land use issue.

77
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, the only place that food trucks are referenced in the city zoning ordinance is in the definition of breweries in section 94.12.

78
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:12,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And it talks about the fact that a brewery can have a food truck on site.

79
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:17,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, my reading of that is it's more referencing a permanent food truck.

80
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:23,777
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have a brewery that doesn't serve food, doesn't have a kitchen, but they have one or more food trucks that's regularly on their property.

81
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:29,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I could conceive from a land use perspective that there may be a food truck that would come to town.

82
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:40,952
[SPEAKER_05]: accessory to an existing, say, exempt or municipal use for an event or a festival or something that might need a one day or weekend type permit from the Board of Health, but isn't going to be there permanently.

83
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:47,880
[SPEAKER_05]: If the city was interested in expanding the land use provisions for food trucks, then we could look at

84
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,122
[SPEAKER_05]: amending the zoning ordinance.

85
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:55,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those are some of the concepts and the areas that we were hoping to get direction from the council tonight.

86
00:07:56,388 --> 00:08:00,171
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, generally speaking, how do you envision the food truck program working?

87
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,293
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, where do you want to see food trucks?

88
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:12,264
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the way the ordinance that I saw is currently drafted, it really only accounts for one day and, you know, kind of short term permits.

89
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:28,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to account for the ability to have longer term permits, some of those policy decisions, and then we can help work those into both a recommended regulation for the board of health, as well as potential ordinance and or regulation for the city council when it comes to streets.

90
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of like high level,

91
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:36,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where we are happy to answer any questions, discuss any component of it.

92
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:41,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, with the feedback we get from you, we can work that into an updated document and come back.

93
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

94
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go by some bears.

95
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, madam president.

96
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, attorney Stein.

97
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:53,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think to me, I feel like we've answered a lot of these questions already.

98
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we came up with this ordinance.

99
00:08:55,967 --> 00:09:03,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, to me, the goal of this ordinance is to say in the city right now, we feel comfortable allowing one day licenses and special event licenses.

100
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want that to have to come before the council every time we're being those are being asked for.

101
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's basically the policy we're trying to implement.

102
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And then beyond that, I don't think we wanted to make any changes beyond that.

103
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, just to say,

104
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:19,658
[SPEAKER_02]: food trucks are welcome for events.

105
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:21,780
[SPEAKER_02]: They're welcome for single day activities.

106
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to go through the Board of Health to ask for those, and that's essentially the city's policy on food trucks.

107
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:33,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to speak for my other colleagues, although I'm seeing some nodding heads.

108
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's essentially the spirit of what we have put forward, and that's what this draft reflects.

109
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:39,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess my question

110
00:09:40,213 --> 00:10:00,500
[SPEAKER_02]: and feel free to answer after other colleagues have spoken, is just how do we take what we have drafted here, which I think we all believe reflected that general consensus, and turn that into something that fits the framework that you outlined where some of that, basically what I'm hearing is some of what's in this ordinance should be in the Board of Health Regulation.

111
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have a problem with that, but that's basically my understanding of the scope, and I personally didn't want to go beyond

112
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:11,387
[SPEAKER_02]: the scope of that general kind of those boundaries.

113
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:12,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll leave it there.

114
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

115
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

116
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

117
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:15,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council.

118
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what my sentiments were.

119
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:35,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the biggest concern we had when this came in front of this body is that, especially at the time during the pandemic, we were seeing the effects, the negative effects with what was happening in our country affecting our brick and mortar businesses.

120
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:43,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we continue to work out of the pandemic, and here we are, we're finally safe, hopefully,

121
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,674
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing businesses thriving, especially in the square.

122
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:52,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the number one goal is not to allow

123
00:10:54,497 --> 00:11:04,539
[SPEAKER_00]: the food trucks other than what we stipulated in the guidelines that Council Bears expressed that it was for special events.

124
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:14,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, but the concern was that there are special events that come up and sometimes the council won't meet and it leaves organizations in limbo.

125
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:17,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's giving the right to city administration

126
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:27,046
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Board of Health to give that permission and take it off the City Council plate for those purposes.

127
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:42,212
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want anybody to miss out on an opportunity, but at the same time, my number one goal from the beginning was protecting our brick and mortar businesses, especially in the climate that we're in right now here in Medford, where

128
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:49,950
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have, we need to keep and what we need to grow on the brick and mortar businesses.

129
00:11:50,491 --> 00:12:06,565
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're bringing in food trucks from outside the city and allowing these organizations to roll up, we're going to really taint what we're looking for, and especially most of our squares and

130
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:14,006
[SPEAKER_00]: and bringing more solid businesses to the city of Medford.

131
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:16,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with Councilor Bears.

132
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:19,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we agreed on a good plan.

133
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:35,066
[SPEAKER_00]: for their purposes of making sure that no one is left behind, but at the same time, still protecting the brick and mortar businesses and not allowing the full-time or a specialized area that some communities do have that maybe their businesses thrive.

134
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:44,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I see our brick and mortar businesses thriving and people rushing to come to Medford and opening restaurants, I would hate to give a

135
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:54,627
[SPEAKER_00]: a food truck provision to come and go as they may please and take business away from what we need to grow in this community.

136
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Madam President.

137
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

138
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:01,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah, just to build on, I don't see any councilors talking at the moment.

139
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: To build on what Vice Mayor Bears and Councilor Scarpelli said, yeah, I think our intent was very much to just take the policy that was in place, make sure it's streamlined, and make sure it's very explicit in an ordinance, the steps that need to be gone through.

140
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course deferring to the Board of Health for those approvals because as Councilor Scarpelli said, sometimes these come before us, they might come before us late, someone might realize they need it for an event on Wednesday, we don't need it again until the next week, so I think it's just taking this and moving it to the Board of Health which already sees these permits and just making them the deciding authority on it.

141
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:37,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think, or I know, based on past conversations, we weren't looking to go into

142
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:43,212
[SPEAKER_04]: zoning and all this stuff and multi-day permits, I think, by design.

143
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We really wanted to focus on special permits at this time because that's what we felt comfortable about.

144
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,414
[SPEAKER_04]: We added the provision as far as how far away from a brick and mortar.

145
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,475
[SPEAKER_04]: These food trucks need to be parked and things like that, but it really was to simplify it.

146
00:13:56,175 --> 00:14:06,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And Attorney Stein, some of what you said, I absolutely understand where you're coming from, but some of what you said sounds like this is just making it a little bit more involved than was our original intent.

147
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,721
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can kick it back to you.

148
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:13,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any other councilors who want to speak at this time if you're able to respond to that.

149
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:19,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the biggest issue we probably need to, oh, I'm sorry.

150
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to, I thought you were done.

151
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:23,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I am, yeah, go ahead.

152
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:24,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

153
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that sounds a little bad.

154
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't mean to be speaking over you.

155
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:39,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the biggest issue that we probably need to address in this and I'm very sympathetic to the fact that you're trying to streamline this is that it would be unusual for the Board of Health to be vested with the authority of deciding

156
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,057
[SPEAKER_05]: the location that a food truck could be in.

157
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:46,578
[SPEAKER_05]: The city council by ordinance controls your streets in ways.

158
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:54,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, we could certainly look into the possibility of the council delegating who can make that decision.

159
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think the board of health deciding where the food truck goes would be unusual.

160
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:05,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And you may wanna think about, is there, you know, a different,

161
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:13,490
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe municipal person who could be even responsible for that.

162
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,052
[SPEAKER_05]: The board of health could have theoretically the same concern.

163
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:27,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody might come in and get the operational license under the code, but they're not necessarily getting from the board of health permission to put the food truck in a particular place.

164
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that normally would be a council response authority.

165
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:38,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you may want to think about if it's not the council, who should be making that decision?

166
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, Attorney Stein, I have a question for Councilor Scarpelli.

167
00:15:42,400 --> 00:16:00,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know other communities use, I can understand that too, but so leaving the permitting process with the health department to make sure that we follow those guidelines, but taking it away from the council to make sure that it's a more streamlined process.

168
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I know other,

169
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:21,749
[SPEAKER_00]: communities use the communications department that does all the special events for the city, or even the parks and recreations director, and allowing that purview under the guidelines that we've given them, that's pretty simple.

170
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if the

171
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:26,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Board of Health doesn't want to do that because it's out of their purview.

172
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,958
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.

173
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:38,828
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have other departments in the city that perform permitting processes that, given the guidelines of our ordinance, I think this shouldn't be a heavy lift.

174
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:44,634
[SPEAKER_00]: You have multiple departments here that we can delegate that.

175
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:53,386
[SPEAKER_00]: the permanent process to if that's the only issue, I don't see why we can't just put that on the city administration to appoint.

176
00:16:55,413 --> 00:17:04,035
[SPEAKER_00]: the best practice that they follow, because they run road races, they run special events, they do parades, they do walks around City Hall.

177
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:08,356
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't perform those permits, someone that does that in the city.

178
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:20,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend, Madam President, that this question be given to the administration to pinpoint the department and

179
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:23,615
[SPEAKER_00]: allow that department to follow through with the permitting process.

180
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:25,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very simple.

181
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:25,917
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

182
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:55,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will definitely be helpful in helping us to make the recommended changes to the ordinance to have the council identify who's responsible for giving permission for a food truck to be in a public way that may also address some city property, depending on who the custodian of that property is.

183
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:57,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other issue is that.

184
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:17,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Food trucks largely won't be able to go on private property, which is governed by zoning in the city or even municipal property, unless they're associated with a brewery or they fall within some other use because your zoning ordinance doesn't allow for it.

185
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:18,006
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

186
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:18,967
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it can stay.

187
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make sure to raise that issue.

188
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:35,893
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing and I completely understand obviously wanted to protect your brick and mortar businesses and the motivation just to have the single day or kind of event permit is whether or not you want to consider.

189
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:41,742
[SPEAKER_05]: if there's anywhere in the city where you may want longer permits.

190
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:48,484
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, is there a park or a field or something where, for example, breweries by your zoning are permitted.

191
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:56,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so I can clarify though, the definition of brewery in your zoning bylaw allows for a food truck.

192
00:18:57,107 --> 00:19:03,609
[SPEAKER_05]: If a food truck wants to go there under what you're proposing, will they get multiple one-day licenses?

193
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:07,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how is it that contemplated to be implemented?

194
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, George.

195
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me finish.

196
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:18,219
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can this, we're making this very difficult.

197
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one day special permits for special events.

198
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:22,702
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very simple.

199
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:25,764
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not special events four days in a row, unless

200
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:32,891
[SPEAKER_00]: the city that allows a permit if they had, let's say per se, a carnival in the city that lasted two or three days.

201
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:40,859
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just protecting the long-term permitting process of a food truck anywhere in the city.

202
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:44,922
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already decided we're against that.

203
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,044
[SPEAKER_00]: We're protecting our brick and mortar businesses.

204
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:49,827
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, this isn't a heavy lift.

205
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:51,708
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's very simple.

206
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:56,389
[SPEAKER_00]: The permitting process goes to the administration to assign someone to do that process.

207
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Health department assigns that.

208
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:08,651
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something that we didn't put in the ordinance that says that it has to be in a private, in a public way, then we can adjust that, correct?

209
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I think it's that simple.

210
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:16,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want food trucks in a designated area anywhere, at least for now.

211
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:31,018
[SPEAKER_00]: at least this council does, I'm speaking for myself, but until we have security and growth in our business community, allowing food trucks is only gonna hurt that process.

212
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:34,499
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my philosophy, so thank you.

213
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

214
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

215
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

216
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these food trucks gonna pay a meals tax like the brick and mortar pay?

217
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:50,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see anything in there, maybe I missed it.

218
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they just gonna pay a license fee for the day?

219
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:04,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a license fee, no meals tax?

220
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:09,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see anything in there, so that's why I'm just questioning that.

221
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the attorney, maybe I missed it.

222
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:16,268
[SPEAKER_04]: speak to that as far as others.

223
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:19,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you have anything in your ordinance about that.

224
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,510
[SPEAKER_05]: We can certainly clarify that for you when we get our comments back.

225
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:27,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what is common practice in other communities?

226
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:31,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to take a look at that for you.

227
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I've had the question come up to me directly, but we can certainly take a look at that and we can respond when we send you updated language, how that would work.

228
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:44,993
Thank you.

229
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:46,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you could let us know.

230
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:46,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

231
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:47,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Paris.

232
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

233
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

234
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Turnstein, through you, Madam President.

235
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess just, I'm just a little confused as to what our next steps are here.

236
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:12,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we have a draft that we believe generally reflects the policies that we want to have for a food truck ordinance right now.

237
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:27,992
[SPEAKER_02]: how much, I guess my question is to you just based on your review of this draft, how much of this needs to be changed or what sections need to be moved out into the Board of Health regulations for us to move forward?

238
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'll be honest, I thought we were basically gonna do some light legal review and then approve this ordinance.

239
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:38,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think we were going back and diving in really to any major questions at this stage.

240
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:43,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess just where are we going?

241
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:59,015
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to me, I mean, if the question is that we don't feel like the Board of Health should be off, should be picking the location, I mean, I think that the applicants are picking the location and the Board of Health is saying yes or no.

242
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:14,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have this section nine here, which is all mobile food vendors wishing to sell food from public property, including any public street, sidewalk, playground or park must obtain permission to do so from the city department having jurisdiction over that property.

243
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:17,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, that makes it pretty clear.

244
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:25,037
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it in a park, you have to go to the Parks Commission, or at least the Parks Department.

245
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:29,660
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it on a public way, that would probably be the DPW.

246
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:34,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I'm just not clear here.

247
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:42,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me that the two outstanding things are there's a question over how much of what's currently in this ordinance should instead be part of

248
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:47,893
[SPEAKER_02]: a Board of Health regulation, and the section should point towards that.

249
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing that's maybe most of Section 6.

250
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:59,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it sounds like, I don't know if Director O'Connor has an opinion on it, or if you do, Attorney Stein.

251
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:09,745
[SPEAKER_02]: that some other entity within the city administration should be involved in the siting of the location of these food trucks.

252
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:15,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, are there other issues with this current ordinance that I'm missing so far from our discussion?

253
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:28,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to summarize, I don't think that the city should be adopting a wholesale ordinance on food trucks, because I think the vast majority of it should be regulated through a board of health regulation.

254
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:37,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of what's in here can just be moved over to a board of health regulation, but it needs additional review at a minimum for compliance with state.

255
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:41,118
[SPEAKER_05]: food sanitary code, which is the local CMR.

256
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have quite a few questions and clarifications that we can get back over to you, or frankly, we'll just review through the Board of Health if we're going to go in the direction of having the Board of Health do a regulation.

257
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,174
[SPEAKER_05]: As you point out, there is a section here that talks about the use of city property.

258
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:00,336
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there's no process for obtaining that

259
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:01,356
[SPEAKER_05]: permission.

260
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:07,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of our comments is you do need a process for somebody to be able to get that permission.

261
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:17,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as I said before, the city council controls the use of the public streets and ways we can make a recommendation for an amendment to section 74 two of the ordinances.

262
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:27,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we have direction from us to who the right person will be to make those decisions to add the language necessary to allow a different city official or department to it

263
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:31,910
[SPEAKER_05]: allow the placement of the food truck, to grant the location of the food truck.

264
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,091
[SPEAKER_05]: As you point out, there are different custodians of city property.

265
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:47,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's a public park versus school or some other particular land, an applicant might need to get permission from a different custodian depending on who controls that property for the city.

266
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:51,397
[SPEAKER_05]: But there needs to be a process for obtaining that, some directions for folks.

267
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't need to be in an ordinance, it can be in a guideline or a regulation.

268
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,326
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a lot of, in my opinion, there's some details in here that need to be worked out.

269
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:09,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely helpful to have the clarification tonight that the focus of this really is on protecting those brick and mortar businesses and we can.

270
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:27,926
[SPEAKER_05]: review it with an eye to that a lot of the operation of food truck is governed by state law and so it may be that a much more streamlined board of health regulation in conjunction with just some updating to the ordinances as to the use of the streets is all that is necessary.

271
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:32,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is some work to do on this.

272
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:41,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you ask about next steps, what I envision the next step being would be that we would work with Mary Ann through the Board of Health to get an operational regulation in place.

273
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:50,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would just make some recommendations for minor amendments to the existing city ordinances to account for the grant of location concerns.

274
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

275
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:55,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two things.

276
00:26:55,187 --> 00:27:08,479
[SPEAKER_02]: First, on the subject at hand, I think my motion would be to take this draft and put it in whatever form you believe is necessary to best affect its passage.

277
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to say beyond that.

278
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:18,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had we had a draft, we thought we were going down the path that we should be going down best practice.

279
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:22,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're kind of at the moment where we thought we were pretty much done with this.

280
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:29,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're being kind of told that the form and legal compliance of what has been drafted is not accurate.

281
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, really, it would just be to me.

282
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:40,918
[SPEAKER_02]: for council and relevant departments to sit down and take this draft and reformulate it, package it into whatever it needs to be packaged into so that we can pass it.

283
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:48,943
[SPEAKER_02]: My second question in terms of streetways may go a little bit outside this, but I'm just a little bit surprised.

284
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:57,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it your opinion that whenever the city is hosting any sort of event using the public ways that the city council should give permission for that event to occur?

285
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:08,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will tell you that if you look at article 1, section 74, 2 of your existing city ordinances, it says.

286
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:15,123
[SPEAKER_05]: No person shall expose in or upon any street, common or.

287
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:23,086
[SPEAKER_05]: any public or other public place, any table or device of any kind upon which any game of hazard or chance can be played.

288
00:28:23,526 --> 00:28:30,769
[SPEAKER_05]: No person shall play any such game at any such table or device in upon any street, common, or other public place in the city.

289
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:41,673
[SPEAKER_05]: No person shall place or keep any table, stall, booth, or other item in the street in the city for the sale of fruit or other items without permission of the city council.

290
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:52,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that if we're talking about food trucks, you're talking about a table stall booth or other item in the street for the sale of fruit or other items.

291
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It falls within 74.2.

292
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:08,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we could recommend changes to that section that would allow for either the city council or the city council's designee to authorize the placement of food trucks in city streets.

293
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:15,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's pretty simple change that we can suggest, but you have an existing ordinance that touches on this area.

294
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,615
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you have one, our recommendation is usually to work within that.

295
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,937
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to add something that would be inconsistent.

296
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:37,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, I don't think that you need an extensive ordinance on food trucks, because I think that you have an ability through the sanitary code and the board of health statute to regulate food trucks consistent with state law.

297
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:45,331
[SPEAKER_05]: The benefit of doing that is it just makes it much easier over time to make amendments and regulations because you can do it through the Board of Health regulatory process.

298
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:57,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if the CMR changes, if state law changes as this evolves, it's a lot easier to update things and be malleable on how you deal with it when you're working the operations through a regulation as opposed to through an ordinance.

299
00:29:58,337 --> 00:30:01,139
[SPEAKER_05]: The ordinance part for me is really the location.

300
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,604
[SPEAKER_05]: is really who has the ability to give permission for somebody to use your streets.

301
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:09,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the council until you say otherwise.

302
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:12,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

303
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:12,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

304
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:28,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just when we were talking earlier about the public way, it's because we feel like food trucks fall into the archaic kind of language that some council passed many years ago around not having like fruit sellers on sidewalks.

305
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:39,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's that specifically, but it's also generally that the city council generally is in control of the city's public streets, the use of those streets.

306
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:40,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

307
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are other articles.

308
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, go ahead.

309
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:46,249
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go ahead.

310
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:46,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

311
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:46,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut you off.

312
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,450
[SPEAKER_02]: My apologies.

313
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:53,726
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the general legal default is that the city council will control the streets and ways.

314
00:30:54,366 --> 00:31:11,255
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other aspects of your ordinances that deal with work that's done in the streets and ways, street openings and road improvements and such things where other activities have already been delegated to the director of public works and what have you.

315
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:17,138
[SPEAKER_05]: But that has more to do with if you needed to open up a street or do work in a street,

316
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:21,582
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's in 74, 61, 62, 63, things like that.

317
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:38,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's other parts of the city's ordinances that already deal with other parts of public streets, but the ability for a private say company, a food truck to just come and use your roads should be your decision, or at least the decision of whomever you've delegated that to.

318
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, no, and that makes sense.

319
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:43,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's certainly what we want this to be.

320
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:55,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was, I was, you know, we often close public ways for events that are city hosted and the city council does not vote on the closing of those public ways.

321
00:31:55,711 --> 00:32:04,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to make sure that those acts were not in conflict with our city ordinances separate from this discussion specifically around food trucks.

322
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:14,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be different because there are, like I said, aspects in here that empower the DPW to do certain things.

323
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:25,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if there was an individual question, we could look at it, but there's other parts in here about how the DPW regulates your public streets as well, but it's all in the ordinances.

324
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

325
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:34,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would make the motion at this time that legal counsel

326
00:32:35,541 --> 00:33:04,275
[SPEAKER_02]: and the board, the health director, the interim economic development director, and any other relevant parties that the administration sees necessary to be part of this process, essentially take this draft ordinance that we've written and come back to us with their recommendations for amendments to the city ordinances, as well as the draft board of health regulation based on this, based on this document, because that sounds like it'll solve all our problems.

327
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:08,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not 100% sure, but it sounds like that would address the issues.

328
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:11,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'll get you there.

329
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam President, if I can.

330
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:30,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a resolution, I think, can we, I'll be asking this moving forward, that can we also have a report of the billable hours from KP Law to address situations like this to the council?

331
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:41,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be asking that moving forward until we have a city solicitor.

332
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:51,041
[SPEAKER_00]: This this is a type of ordinance that is done within days in the in city halls all over this Commonwealth with the city solicitor.

333
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:51,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um.

334
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:55,986
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing personal, I just need to move forward.

335
00:33:56,247 --> 00:34:09,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, this is gonna be a common cry from Councilor Scarpelli till we see a city solicitor, that we get a report back of how many billable hours it'll take KP Law to address these concerns.

336
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:09,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

337
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:10,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

338
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:13,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm gonna go to Director O'Connor, set her hand up.

339
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need me to repeat the motion first?

340
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:17,886
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just get Madam President.

341
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:18,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

342
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:26,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry, Marianne, I just muted you again.

343
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna wait for the clerk to get that language, then I'll go right to you.

344
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:33,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, here's what I've got.

345
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:44,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, the council, the health director, the interim economic development director, any departments, the administration, if necessary, come back.

346
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, make recommendations to amend the ordinance and to create a board of health regulation

347
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:06,512
[SPEAKER_02]: that reflects the content of this current draft or the content or intent.

348
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:15,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just to that point, Vice President Bears, that's kind of similar to what we did with outdoor dining.

349
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,967
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an update to our ordinances, and then we had a number of recommendations and policy things that fell under the building commissioner.

350
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,290
[SPEAKER_02]: To be finished solid waste as well, that's basically what we did with solid waste.

351
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:27,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

352
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:28,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

353
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:29,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

354
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:31,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

355
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:32,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I do so much, I lose track sometimes.

356
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:35,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, we're constantly doing things, all these things that we do all the time.

357
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Director O'Connor, I'm gonna go to you, then I'm gonna have Councilor Tseng.

358
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm gonna push unmute, and then I'm gonna not touch anything.

359
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:55,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President, I just wanted to make sure that in conversation my only concern is what attorney Stein brought up regarding the breweries.

360
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:10,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And if in fact they are allowed on the property the breweries property, long term, that will need a process or a permit in addition to the one or two day special event, we will need a special

361
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:22,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess long-term, I don't know what that term is, but if that's what the zoning allows for the breweries, then I'm not sure, you know, what that would look like.

362
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,049
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my only concern.

363
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:25,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

364
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a clarifying, in case folks don't know what I'm talking about, the current definition of brewery in your zoning ordinance says that a facility may also provide food that is produced on site.

365
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:43,894
[SPEAKER_05]: just orders with food trucks that are located on site.

366
00:36:44,695 --> 00:37:01,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I question I had in our review of this is, did you want the board of health regulation to include some ability for the board of health to grant those permits when it is a food truck located on site at a brewery, because that is already contemplated by your existing zoning ordinance.

367
00:37:05,896 --> 00:37:16,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're asking if within this language, we want the board of health, some specific language as far as regulating those food trucks, which are ran into the zoning as being allowed on site at breweries.

368
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:17,505
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the question?

369
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:29,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because again, and I totally understand the motivation of where you're coming from, but all that this draft contemplates is a one day or special event permit.

370
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:32,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't contemplate the granting of anything else.

371
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:33,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, do you want,

372
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:43,903
[SPEAKER_05]: to work something in there that allows for the permitting that would be necessary for a brewery to have an onsite food truck for a longer period of time since zoning contemplates it.

373
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I think, yeah, I think we're probably, we're looking at two issues now.

374
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:56,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at what we were talking about with the special event, and then I think you've raised an issue that we hadn't considered, I don't think, since that was passed.

375
00:37:56,346 --> 00:37:58,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously that's something that needs to be addressed.

376
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:02,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're also just trying to address the special event permits, so.

377
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

378
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:20,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just specifically on this topic, I mean, I would think that if a food truck wanted to come for a day to a brewery and put their truck there, that's one thing.

379
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,361
[SPEAKER_02]: If they wanted to come 180 days or 365 days,

380
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:27,093
[SPEAKER_02]: That would not be something that we were interested in.

381
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:29,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I think it was to me.

382
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:34,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It would still fall under this kind of concept of the one day or special event permit license.

383
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:34,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

384
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:35,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

385
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I don't think we want we're not in the business of drafting legislation for specific businesses, but we do have.

386
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:46,189
[SPEAKER_04]: are one brewery, and I think they've mostly or exclusively been relying on area restaurants.

387
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So they haven't asked for a food truck there to my remembering.

388
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:53,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've been open however long now, and that has not been an issue.

389
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:58,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that it's not something that could be addressed in our zoning, but I just want to raise that for background.

390
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:58,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

391
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:06,543
[SPEAKER_10]: On a slightly different topic, but going back to what was mentioned, I know folks here mentioned the meals tax, the local meals tax.

392
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:18,466
[SPEAKER_10]: In looking at the Massachusetts state government website on meals taxes, it does seem like food trucks are included or local excise taxes on meals are included in what food trucks should be paying.

393
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's something that we should confirm.

394
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:38,834
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's what I read from these documents, from the Massachusetts state government website and the Harvard Law School think tank document on food trucks in the greater Boston area.

395
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:46,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be open to asking for language about that in this ordinance or in the regulations, just to make that clear.

396
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:47,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

397
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:48,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

398
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:51,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to Director Schrader.

399
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:53,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks President Morell.

400
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,970
[SPEAKER_09]: To Councilor Tseng's point, that's what I recall.

401
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll follow up with additional information on that.

402
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:07,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I had done some research in the past on it and we're kind of more involved in these conversations, but I just don't recall at this point.

403
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll get the facts for you.

404
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:11,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

405
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:15,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have two motions on the floor.

406
00:40:17,563 --> 00:40:20,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions just so I can get a complete draft back to you.

407
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:35,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a provision in the draft section 12 that talks about the city council being able to issue a special permit to anyone that wants to operate in a manner that's inconsistent with these regulations.

408
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:41,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wouldn't recommend calling him a special permit just because I think it'll be confusing from a zoning perspective.

409
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:49,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly think the city council could have some kind of oversight or waiver or appeal authority, but you would need a process for that.

410
00:40:50,238 --> 00:41:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do recommend, you know, just giving some thought to, you know, there should be standards and a process and, you know, how it would come that somebody would seek permission to do something different than what the board of health is going to let them do.

411
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:12,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's fair point.

412
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:24,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another question would just be on enforcement, but I think we're going to put that in the board of health for now.

413
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the council thinks that it needs to move, we can, we can attract that as well.

414
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:35,758
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we do need processes in here for those special permits for how somebody acquires the right to use city property.

415
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:37,740
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that.

416
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I believe at the beginning of the meeting, there was just a reference to maybe having received comments back from police, fire and building.

417
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:47,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have, I haven't seen those comments.

418
00:41:47,065 --> 00:41:52,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's any written comments that you want to send to me that aren't already incorporated in the draft, that would be great.

419
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Robin, they are incorporated in the draft that you have.

420
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:02,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

421
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

422
00:42:04,474 --> 00:42:04,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

423
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to clarify that.

424
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, we can work back basically documents.

425
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: 1 will be a recommendation on regulations and 1 will be a recommendation on ordinance amendments.

426
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:19,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

427
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:22,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have 2 motions on the floor.

428
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:27,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So, 1st, for racism bears, Mr. clerk, if you can read that back and still needs a 2nd.

429
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:37,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bears.

430
00:42:38,995 --> 00:42:52,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bears has moved that legal counsel, the health director, the interim economic development director, and any departments the administration deems necessary make recommendations to amend the ordinance and to create a Board of Health regulation that reflects the content or intent of this current draft.

431
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:52,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

432
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:53,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

433
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,640
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion of Vice President Bears is seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

434
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,400
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

435
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:57,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

436
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

438
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:08,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to get the total billable hours that KP Law has worked on this issue, I guess, to date, or do you want it at the end?

439
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,323
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end.

440
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:12,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, at the completion of the ordinance.

441
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:14,814
[SPEAKER_04]: have to meet again on this.

442
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will, we'll make sure we get that at the end.

443
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

444
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:23,622
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?
