00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,850
Welcome to the Medford Bytes podcast.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,733
We're thrilled to have you again for season three.

11
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,215
Some exciting news.

12
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,844
The Medford Bytes podcast is now brought to you by myself, Danielle Belacca, and Shelly Kashevan.

13
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:58,025
After participating in the spring of 2022, I jumped at Danielle's invitation to co-host.

14
00:00:58,765 --> 00:00:59,806
I'm so happy that you did.

15
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:07,331
This podcast was created during lockdown from Lockdown Energy, but a little bit like lockdown, it was beginning to feel kind of lonely.

16
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:12,695
So I'm really looking forward to how we can combine our ideas with the knowledge of our guests this season.

17
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:20,000
As am I. Speaking of guests, in today's episode, we talked with City Council Vice President Zach Behrs,

18
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:25,686
about what we can expect on the ballot tomorrow and in November for our local and state elections.

19
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,709
Tomorrow is a big day for our local elections.

20
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,454
And one thing I'm really grateful for that Shelly's brought to the podcast is her knowledge of social media.

21
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:36,836
Shelly, can you remind folks where they can follow us?

22
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:38,983

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,982
All right, thanks so much for joining us today.

31
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:13,805
First episode of season three, we're getting ready for.

32
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:23,494
So I'm here today with my co-host, Shelly, and I'll ask our guests just if you could introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and just who you are.

33
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,377
Sure, hi, good to be here.

34
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:28,939
Excited to be here for season three.

35
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:34,584
I'm Zach Bares, he, him pronouns, and I'm the vice president of the Medford City Council.

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:35,940
Thanks, Zach.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,341
It's been a while since we've talked to you.

38
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:46,065
So I'm going to ask you the same question that we asked you before and that we ask every other guest, which is just your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

39
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:49,227
I've got to be consistent.

40
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:51,027
I'm going to stick with Colleen's.

41
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:59,011
And I love a BLT and a raspberry lime Rickey, maybe ice cream.

42
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,092
They've got great choices, great options.

43
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:04,434
And it's summer, so I can't not highlight Colleen's in the summer.

44
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,284
That sounds great.

45
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:07,024
I'll have to try.

46
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:10,407
I haven't tried the raspberry lime Rickey since you talked about it, but I'm missing out.

47
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:23,096
Well, we, you know, invited you on for a bunch of reasons, but one of them I think was to talk about, you know, the two elections that we have coming up in September and November.

48
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,059
And I think this episode should come out the day before that September election.

49
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,022
So I'm wondering if you could kind of walk us through what to expect from those two ballots.

50
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:37,945
Yeah, so it's the 2022 elections already.

51
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:41,726
I mean, you know, there's an election every year.

52
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,347
So it's not that big a surprise.

53
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:47,148
But this year, it is an even year.

54
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,089
And it's not a presidential year.

55
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:52,490
So it's our state elections here in Massachusetts.

56
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,152
There's a primary on Tuesday, September 6.

57
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:04,235
which is the day after Labor Day, and there's a general election on Tuesday, November 8th.

58
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:19,389
similar to other elections, you have a primary election where you kind of selecting candidates for different offices, and then a general election, which will be kind of between the candidates selected for each party.

59
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,193
In Massachusetts, it's usually Democrats and Republicans, that's pretty common everywhere.

60
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:29,957
But you know, something that's interesting about Massachusetts, I think, as a lot of people know,

61
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:36,826
is that Democrats are a very strong majority in terms of being elected.

62
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:41,487
They control the Senate seats and all of the House seats and super majorities in the state legislature.

63
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:46,169
Right now, not the governorship, but that also may change this year.

64
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,170
We're electing a new governor, which is a big deal.

65
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:56,153
So the primary elections are really important because that's where you select the Democratic candidate who will be running in the November election.

66
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,294
And in many cases,

67
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:06,217
It's actually the September election that is the most competitive and will determine who will end up being the person in office and not the November election.

68
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:13,623
But as usual, you know, the way that our system works more people vote in November than September so.

69
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:21,760
Um, you know, really voted getting out to vote in September, Tuesday, September six is important.

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,683
And here in our area in Medford.

71
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:31,829
There's going to be a lot of a lot of races on the ballot so you know it can be tough to figure out exactly.

72
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:38,033
You know, who you're supporting, definitely important to try to do some research beforehand if possible.

73
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,916
By the time this comes out, there will also have been early voting and mail voting.

74
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:46,559
So that's another change in Massachusetts that's similar to two years ago.

75
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:51,202
There's just a lot more ways that you can go out and vote, which I think is great.

76
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:55,765
And that'll be true in November as well, where there will be even more opportunities for that.

77
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,808
But so for the primary election, again, it's focused on the

78
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:04,971
parties selecting their nominees, their candidates for the general election in November.

79
00:06:05,592 --> 00:06:09,434
And the offices that are on the ballot are our statewide offices.

80
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:10,775
We have Governor's Race.

81
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:13,617
It's on the Democratic ballot.

82
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,580
It's Maura Healey and Sonia Chang-Diaz.

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,262
Sonia Chang-Diaz has dropped out, but her name is still on the ballot.

84
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:25,546
There's also a Republican primary, Jeff Diehl and Chris Doty.

85
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:43,084
For Lieutenant Governor, there is a Democratic primary between a number of candidates, Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll, State Representative Tammy Govea, Dr. Tammy Govea, and State Senator Eric Lesser.

86
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:47,825
And so, you know, I'm just going to list them out here.

87
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:50,946
You know, I'm not going to get into who's who because we'd be here forever.

88
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:54,487
But those are the three candidates who are running on the Democratic side.

89
00:06:55,312 --> 00:07:01,173
And then there's two candidates running on the Republican side, Leah Cole-Allen and Kate Campanelli.

90
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:06,615
And then there's the kind of quote unquote down ballot statewide races.

91
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:07,755
We have attorney general.

92
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:09,755
So Maura Healey is running for governor.

93
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,816
So she's the current attorney general.

94
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:14,356
So we have an open race for attorney general.

95
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:21,938
And we also have an open race for governor, which I didn't mention as Charlie Baker's leaving and you didn't hear me list his name as a candidate.

96
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:36,402
So Open Race for Attorney General, Andrea Campbell, former Boston City Councilor, Quentin Palfrey, who was a lawyer in the Obama and Biden administrations and was the Democratic Party nominee for Lieutenant Governor in 2018.

97
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:37,383
And then we have also

98
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:47,706
Shannon Liss-Riordan, I'm trying to remember everybody who's been a longtime labor lawyer.

99
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:53,488
You may have seen her advertising so far, and I think I've gotten a couple pieces of mail from her.

100
00:07:54,528 --> 00:08:10,693
Secretary of State, you have seven-term incumbent Bill Galvin running against Tanisha Sullivan, who is the longtime president of the Boston NAACP, and a well-established lawyer in her own right who has done a lot of work around voting rights.

101
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:23,661
Also an open race, you have former Assistant Secretary of Transportation Chris Dempsey, who's facing off against State Senator Diana DiZaglio.

102
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,143
And so those are all the Democratic primaries.

103
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:32,248
I can't remember all the Republican candidates for the down-ballot statewide races, so I apologize for that.

104
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:44,840
But right now, Democrats hold Secretary of State, Auditor, Attorney General, and do not hold Governor, Lieutenant Governor, which are currently Republican held.

105
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,082
And then in Medford, the other piece of this, you have the statewide races.

106
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:54,144
And then every two years, we also elect our state representatives and state senators.

107
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:58,466
For Medford, I don't believe Senator Jalen has a primary.

108
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:02,488
So very likely that she is running again, very likely

109
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,645
You know, I haven't heard about any write in campaigns, but very likely that she will be the nominee for state senator for the Democratic Party.

110
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:18,676
I don't believe that representative Barbara or representative Garber Lee have primary challenges either, but there is, you know, a very, I think, exciting and.

111
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:31,447
uh you know looks like it's going to be close race in the kind of north and east sides of Medford between representative Paul Donato and Nicole Maslam.

112
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:49,362
It's a rematch of 2020 where that was also a very close race and I know there's been a ton of campaigning, signs, lots of door knocking, mail so that I happen to live in that district so I will be able to vote in that primary.

113
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,415
Not everyone in Medford does.

114
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:55,596
It's only about half the city, again, on the north and east sides of the city.

115
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,957
But, you know, so that's kind of the ballot for September.

116
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:15,239
And again, really, you know, given where Massachusetts is at, you know, and where Medford is as well, it's very likely that whoever wins the state representative primary will win this election in November and become our state representative for the next two years.

117
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,820
And the same goes for all of the other races that I mentioned.

118
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,176
September is the big one.

119
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:21,936
It's exciting.

120
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:32,020
And, and, you know, a lot to think about a lot of research to make sure you know who you think best represents you of the candidates who you have a choice to vote for.

121
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:37,223
You're looking into those numbers from that state race from two years ago and it

122
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:44,264
I didn't realize that Nicole Messam had won the Malden part of that election by like 100 votes.

123
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:45,345
It was very close.

124
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,748
So that'll be an exciting one to pay attention to this year.

125
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,511
Yeah, I also live in that part of Medford.

126
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,093
So I'm excited to vote.

127
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,074
Absolutely.

128
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:54,394
Yeah.

129
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:55,365
Great.

130
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:02,587
So we're voting mostly on those people's positions for that September primary.

131
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:10,169
And then whoever wins on the Democratic and Republican side will vote on for those offices in November.

132
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,290
But then I also understand there's some different ballot questions in November as well.

133
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:29,036
Yes, so November 8th, and again, I don't want to discount the importance of voting in any situation, but you know, most likely, you know, you're going to end up with the candidates from the primary for Democrats and Republicans.

134
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:30,957
They're going to go head to head against each other.

135
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:36,820
Right now, looking at the polling, it's looking like a Democratic sweep, you know, across the state.

136
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,062
Very likely, you know, we'll see if that changes.

137
00:11:41,183 --> 00:12:00,505
So the really big thing to focus on in November, though, is ballot questions and what these are essentially we have a process either of gathering signatures or going through the legislature where we can as voters be allowed to directly vote on laws and changes to the laws and in this case.

138
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:03,406
even changes to the state constitution.

139
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:07,210
So there are three questions this year.

140
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:14,078
The first one question one is a constitutional amendment called the fair share amendment, and that would create.

141
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:20,666
It's also known as the millionaires tax, it would create a new tax rate for people who make more than a million dollars a year.

142
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,309
only on the money that they make over $1,000,000 a year.

143
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:26,631
So it's a new 4% tax.

144
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:33,958
If you make $1,001,000, you would pay 4 cents more on that extra dollar that you made over $1,000,000.

145
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:39,643
It would affect less than 1% of Massachusetts households.

146
00:12:40,510 --> 00:13:02,294
And the other piece of that is that the amendment would go directly to fund our public K-12 schools, public colleges and university system, as well as our transportation system, which I think anyone these days, you know, even if you don't take public transit every day, knows is in big trouble.

147
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,715
So needs this funding to really move forward into the future.

148
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:13,512
This would be the first time right now Massachusetts has a flat income tax, which means that the less money you make.

149
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:16,363
essentially the more of your income you pay.

150
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:26,405
So, you know, if I make a million dollars and I pay 5%, that's very different than if I make $10,000 and pay 5% because I really need that money to survive.

151
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:36,887
It's very different than like the federal income tax, which is progressive, graduated, where, you know, if I make a million dollars, I pay a higher percentage than if I make $50,000.

152
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:37,048
So,

153
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:53,134
This would bring a piece of that kind of equity and fairness to the tax structure in Massachusetts, and it would also go towards funding really essential public goods, like our education system and our transportation system.

154
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,818
So that's question one, and it's a really important question.

155
00:13:57,258 --> 00:14:13,931
Yeah, before we move on to the other two, if I have a couple of follow-ups and Shelley, you might as well, but I know like that there's been some big budget questions in Medford as specifically around like our schools, our school budget, and also transportation.

156
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:23,077
So I guess I'm wondering like how this might, how we hope this would impact Medford or how it could impact?

157
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:23,578
Yeah, so

158
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:27,204
I've been working on this for almost eight years.

159
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:35,370
There is, if you remember in 2018, this was going to be headed to the ballot four years ago in 2018.

160
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:45,318
And basically the high-end corporations in Boston filed a lawsuit and were able to get it thrown off the ballot on a technicality.

161
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,902
That's why it's now coming back four years later under a different process.

162
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:53,665
The first time we gathered signatures to get it on the ballot.

163
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:57,426
And then the court said that you can't use that process to do this.

164
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:02,148
So we had to go through the legislature for the last two terms to get it on the ballot this time.

165
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:09,931
And something we've been talking about this whole eight year period is there's first, you know, getting it on the ballot.

166
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:13,612
Second is making sure that people vote for it and approve it.

167
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:17,514
And then the third piece is actually how it will be allocated.

168
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:30,781
So right, it's dedicated to these important buckets, education, public colleges, transportation, but there's still the process that has to happen of where exactly in those areas is this money going to go?

169
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:34,263
And that may even change year to year as budgets change.

170
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:37,005
So there's kind of two things ahead of us.

171
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,786
One is just, yes, voting for,

172
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:43,969
the fair share amendment so that we, you know, can get that on the books of the state constitution.

173
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,473
And then the second piece is going to be talking about how do we want this money allocated for our communities.

174
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:53,717
And so that's how it could really impact a place like Medford.

175
00:15:54,117 --> 00:16:06,646
You know, for example, if one of our, you know, big issues is spending on roads and sidewalk maintenance, which I'm sure is if you walk around Medford or bike around Medford or drive around Medford, you know, is a major issue.

176
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:17,134
the state could invest more into the state program for funding cities and towns, basically send state money to cities and towns to fix our roads and sidewalks.

177
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:24,449
Another major thing that's been talked about is changing how we fund public transportation.

178
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,790
You know, right now, cities pay an assessment.

179
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,870
It's pretty significant.

180
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:34,171
I think ours is almost $9 million last year, which is almost 5% of our budget as a city.

181
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,212
Now, it doesn't exactly work out that way.

182
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:40,873
But if, you know, because we get more state money than we pay out, right, so it's a little different.

183
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,873
But if that, you know, for example, if we said,

184
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:51,150
you know, we're gonna use this funding stream to fund the T instead of charging municipalities, that could be a significant boost to our city budget.

185
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,712
Funding for public schools, you know, we get a significant amount of state funding for public schools.

186
00:16:56,772 --> 00:17:01,915
It's not near, you know, I think over 85% of what we pay for schools is paid for by the city.

187
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:07,357
So we're not one of those communities where the state is really funding a huge chunk of our budget.

188
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:10,839
But as we know, when we're in the situations that we're in,

189
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:14,349
$500,000 and a million dollars really can go a long way.

190
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:17,940
So changes or additions to that funding would be helpful.

191
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:24,091
And then, you know, public colleges and universities is actually where that's where my organizing around this started.

192
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:34,635
It would impact the city differently because we don't, you know, as a city and a community pay for those services, like the city doesn't pay Bunker Hill Community College for any reason.

193
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:43,219
But, you know, there's a huge affordability and student debt crisis for people who are trying to access the college education.

194
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,741
public colleges and universities really are the bedrock of that.

195
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:54,625
And, you know, increasing funding for those institutions would help a lot of families and students here in Medford as well.

196
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:55,746
So it's a little bit different.

197
00:17:55,766 --> 00:18:03,130
It wouldn't impact us, you know, the budget, but it would certainly impact our community by increasing access to public colleges.

198
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:13,411
And it's striking that sort of figure that you gave around how many people would be impacted by the increase in taxes versus how many people would benefit from that increased revenue.

199
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:19,516
And you also mentioned, I'm going to get this question in here now, but about the MBTA.

200
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:24,740
And we know that there's two major bus routes that are being eliminated in Medford.

201
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,966
And so I wonder if you could speak to that impact or how that relates to this question of the fair share amendment.

202
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:39,622
Yeah, I mean, I think public transportation in general really needs more support.

203
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:55,032
During the pandemic, Governor Baker, well, the MBTA and under Governor Baker eliminated the express buses in Medford, the 325 and 326 buses, which got you from certain parts of Medford to Haymarket.

204
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:06,197
And I think that to me is an example of kind of the zero sum thinking that we have right now when we are fighting for scarce resources and not talking about making investments.

205
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:15,162
You know, it was basically said, well, we need to eliminate these now because the ridership is low because of the pandemic and we'll move those resources elsewhere.

206
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,604
But now they don't want to move the resources back.

207
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,746
This is part of also a larger project that's going on.

208
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,947
It's called the Bus Redesign Project.

209
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:32,908
which is impacting all the bus routes in the MBTA from every single MBTA community, there are really drastic proposed changes.

210
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:36,709
Some of them I think are smart and right on.

211
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:50,971
You know, Medford would see under the current draft proposal, you know, a 96 bus that would come every 15 minutes, a 101 bus that would come every 15 minutes and some changed routes that really will help a lot of people who use those buses.

212
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:53,892
But instead of thinking in an additive way,

213
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:04,707
It's been kind of in a in a zero sum balancing way where we may be gaining some great things but there's parts of the community that are really going to lose out with reduced buses reduced frequency.

214
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:11,411
And, you know, and and as part of this whole project we're not getting back the express buses 325 and 326 that were

215
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:16,293
eliminated a couple years ago.

216
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:24,501
And also, I'll make a plug for the 710 bus through the Fulton Heights was also eliminated and it's not going to be coming back under this proposal.

217
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:37,273
So I would say like an investment like the fair share amendment, seeing how that money could be appropriated really could go a long way towards not just having a reliable and you know,

218
00:20:38,573 --> 00:21:05,349
sustainable public transit system that's not catching on fire and you're not jumping off of the Mystic River Bridge, but actually thinking about expanding and making sure that when we're redesigning the bus system, it doesn't mean we are adding service in one place and removing service in another place, but really trying to expand that public service as much as we can for everybody.

219
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:08,964
So that's one way this could play into it.

220
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,865
The T's problems are huge.

221
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,807
I would not say the fair share amendment is going to solve all of them.

222
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:17,888
Medford's problems are huge.

223
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:20,009
The fair share amendment is not going to solve all of them.

224
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:28,453
We all know the issues in education, but it is a tool that will help us really make some huge advancements and provide reliable sources of revenue.

225
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,334
That is much needed.

226
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,376
And I think you made a really good point.

227
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:45,791
We're talking about something that benefits everybody in Massachusetts, even the people who are paying a little bit more, who make millions and millions of dollars, you know, the 0.5% and up.

228
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:50,774
They want, you know, to live in, there's a reason they're here in Massachusetts.

229
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:54,816
And one of those reasons is that it's a great place to live and good education.

230
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:59,399
And, um, you know, transportation used to be really good.

231
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:07,457
And those are things that I think we want to keep and maintain just to have a healthy society, healthy and fair communities.

232
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:11,501
So I think this to me is a no brainer.

233
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:22,812
That may not be true for every voter, but I hope that a huge majority will be supportive of this because I think it really will make some big differences in people's lives.

234
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:27,567
Yeah, I'm excited to see how it all pans out for sure.

235
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,369
Yeah, I want to let you continue those two other ballot measures as well.

236
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,391
Yeah, there's two more.

237
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:36,752
I don't know a ton about them.

238
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:39,693
One is about dental insurance.

239
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:40,934
It's question two.

240
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:49,058
It's been proposed by, I think, a dentist who has issues with how insurance companies are reimbursing

241
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:51,959
their expenses.

242
00:22:52,079 --> 00:23:05,809
So basically, my understanding of is it would set a certain floor for basically 85% or more of a bill would have to be for for your dental care and not for the administrative costs.

243
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,511
I don't know the facts and specifics behind it.

244
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:09,892
That's just kind of my quick read.

245
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:13,935
Certainly not sure exactly how I'm going to vote on it without more research.

246
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,800
But that's question two.

247
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:29,969
And then question three is part of a longstanding debate in Massachusetts between package stores and grocery stores and convenience stores about the sale of alcohol.

248
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:35,973
Right now, you probably know that a lot of, if you go to the grocery store, most grocery stores don't sell alcohol.

249
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:39,075
Most convenience stores don't sell alcohol.

250
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:42,858
And there's kind of very specific beer, wine, and liquor stores.

251
00:23:45,037 --> 00:24:00,968
and this I believe is reflective of kind of a compromise approach which would expand like the number of say you're like a Cumberland Farms or 7-Eleven you can only sell alcohol I think in like 12 stores in the whole state right now.

252
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:10,555
I think this would expand that up to 18 stores so would like give a little bit more for the chains to sell alcohol but without necessarily out competing

253
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:17,040
the smaller, I don't know if they're locally owned or not, but the non-chain stores.

254
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:26,323
And I think it also would allow for, I think some changes to how you can check out alcohol.

255
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:28,683
I'm not really sure exactly on the specifics there either.

256
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,644
So definitely one to do more research on.

257
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:39,666
But I think the general gist of that one is that if there's a yes vote, a few more stores around the state would be able to sell alcohol.

258
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:46,827
That's a, you know, kind of those second two are really nitty gritty things.

259
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:55,613
And I think one of the reasons that they're on the ballot is kind of one of the reasons this whole process exists is sometimes the legislature just doesn't want to take something up on its own.

260
00:24:56,494 --> 00:25:01,477
For the fair share amendment, they can you can only pass a constitutional amendment through a referendum vote.

261
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:03,599
So that has to be voted on.

262
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:11,601
But these kind of reflect a couple of issues, you know, the sale of alcohol in certain convenience stores and the reimbursement rate of dental insurance.

263
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:14,284
You know, those are pretty specific items.

264
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:24,993
And for whatever reason, the folks who want the law changed weren't getting their way in the legislature and decided to ask the voters to make the call.

265
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:30,298
And Medford won't be voting on any kind of tax override this year.

266
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:31,799
Is that also true?

267
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:36,260
There's no local referendums for Medford, as far as I'm aware.

268
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,621
Certainly none initiated by the city council.

269
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:41,202
No tax override.

270
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:48,744
So we still could have a vote on something like that before the next fiscal year.

271
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,585
It would likely be in a special election.

272
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:57,547
So, you know, one of the reasons to do it the way that we were thinking about it was we already have an election.

273
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:01,930
Let's just do it instead of having to schedule a whole other election and pay for that.

274
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:09,074
You know, I won't get into the super details, but Medford has a pretty big structural budget deficit.

275
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:20,081
And unless either magical new revenues come in or, you know, some other special circumstances happen next year, we're going to be looking at, you know,

276
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:26,153
cuts across the city budget, cuts to the level of services that the city is providing.

277
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:31,316
Um, that's not something that I think is sustainable.

278
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:40,164
I think given the situations that we see across the city, um, but you know, it didn't, didn't make it through the process time to be considered on the ballot this November.

279
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:54,517
So, um, we're going to have to have conversations and think about what the city council, the mayor, um, can do to hopefully find an answer that isn't just cutting more from the city budget and the school budget.

280
00:26:55,632 --> 00:27:02,994
Oh, so yeah, it sounds like it's not going to be something that we'll be able to vote on in either of these elections that potentially in the fiscal year as in a special election.

281
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,995
And you've already given us a lot of really valuable information.

282
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:14,697
I have tried to understand what a tax override like prop, what is it two and a half does or means and in my brain really, really doesn't work that way.

283
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:20,239
Is there like a simple way of explaining it that like, might help us understand like how we're currently taxed?

284
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:23,840
What this would change about taxes if it were something that we considered?

285
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,144
I will try my best.

286
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:37,716
Proposition two and a half is a very convoluted law, because all that it basically is grounded in is that people like the idea of the number two and a half, 45 years ago, so they picked two and a half.

287
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:43,902
But essentially, the law says two things.

288
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:47,366
One, it says that no community can have

289
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:56,432
basically no community can tax more than 2.5% of the total value of all the taxable property in their community.

290
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:59,713
That doesn't apply to Medford.

291
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:01,374
We tax much below that.

292
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:07,416
Essentially what it means is your maximum tax rate would be $25 per $1,000 of value.

293
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,796
Right now Medford's is $9.

294
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,797
So we're very far away from that maximum of $25 or 2.5%.

295
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:26,923
The other thing it says that's much more impactful and this affects every community is what we think about when we think about two and a half, which is it says that the city's total tax property tax amount.

296
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:35,749
So the amount that everybody pays, residential, commercial, add it all up, that amount can only go up 2.5% per year from the previous year.

297
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,413
There's kind of an exception, which is that if there's something new, that gets added on as well.

298
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,216
So a new building, that's value gets added on above the 2.5%.

299
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:48,899
But basically, it says that our tax levy can only go up 2.5% per year.

300
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,247
at an aggregate.

301
00:28:55,447 --> 00:29:00,690
So it doesn't mean that each individual house can only go up 2.5% per year or each individual property.

302
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:04,353
It's actually about the whole property tax levy that we pay.

303
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:11,938
And an override would mean that we could increase that amount more than 2.5% per year.

304
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:15,100
So I don't know if that's exactly a simple explanation.

305
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:17,442
I think to kind of put it in context,

306
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:40,056
2.5% per year is generally below the amount of inflation and the amount of the costs of the city are growing every year, which means that, you know, if health insurance is about 5% per year for the city, but the city can only raise the revenue 2.5%, maybe a little more than that with new growth, then you're spending more next year on health insurance and less on something else.

307
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:43,497
So you're crowding out the important investments that we need to make.

308
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:54,479
An override would be for one year, just for a single year, instead of going up 2.5%, you would go up 5%, right?

309
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:58,181
Or some amount, or it's really in the amount of dollars, right?

310
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:00,402
So we were talking about $12 million and $3 million, things like that.

311
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:03,464
$12 million would have been going up about 10% more.

312
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,184
So instead of 2.5%, you'd be going up about 10%.

313
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:26,738
There's a lot of reasons to have a different number, but essentially for 40 years or more, we've been crowding out the important investments that we need to make in our city budget because we've been restricted by this 2.5% cap.

314
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,202
Really the only ways, and then maybe this adds a little more context too, right?

315
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:38,508
There's cities like Cambridge and Somerville, they focused a lot on new growth.

316
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:40,804
which means like Kendall Square.

317
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:44,825
So they've built this whole Kendall Square that didn't exist 30 or 40 years ago.

318
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:53,308
So they've been able to have a higher property tax levy and almost all of it's been coming because they've just really grown a lot.

319
00:30:54,709 --> 00:31:00,551
Somerville has been a little less than that, but like Assembly Row and Union Square, they've had a new growth strategy as well.

320
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:03,972
Menford has had a very, very slow rate of new growth.

321
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:08,014
I mean, I know people see a new apartment building or they see the Wegmans and they think, oh, you know,

322
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:15,475
But compare that to Kendall Square, you know, you're talking about a few million dollars versus hundreds of millions and billions of dollars.

323
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:23,859
So, you know, and then, so that's one route to fund your budget under this, you know, arbitrary cap.

324
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,301
And the other route is an override.

325
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:32,604
So if you go to a place like Westin, they've done 80 overrides in the last 40 years.

326
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,145
Now Westin's a very rich community,

327
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:44,453
But they basically, you know, essentially what this has done, Medford has not only done zero overrides in 40 years, we've never even had one on the ballot in the last 40 years.

328
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:57,145
So you can kind of see that the way that this law was set up, and this law was, you know, came up in the late 1970s, early 1980s, the Reagan era, very much an anti-tax movement.

329
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,187
No one expected it to pass in the ballot when it passed.

330
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:05,249
So it kind of came as a huge shock to everybody that this was even happening.

331
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:09,631
In the 80s and 90s, you saw huge cuts to municipal budgets.

332
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:14,493
That's something I've been looking at recently is trying to analyze the impact of it on Medford's budget.

333
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:32,525
So I've been in the library history room like copying print budgets into Excel and trying to figure out that those figures but really, you know, unless you're a rich town that does overrides all the time, or you're in a city where you've had a lot of new growth.

334
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:47,153
It's really just stagnated the resources that cities, governments have for public schools, DPW, you know, all of the social services, health departments, housing support, affordable housing.

335
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,575
I mean, you could go down the list of all the things that we need.

336
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:53,494
but aren't able to do right now because of our limited resources.

337
00:32:53,895 --> 00:32:57,077
And you can really trace a lot of that back to Proposition 2.5.

338
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:05,302
One anecdote I'll give and then I'll, you know, I know you asked for a simple explanation and I gave a long contextualized one.

339
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:13,048
But an anecdote that I've heard is that in the 70s, we had almost 150 people working at the Department of Public Works.

340
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:16,210
And we only have about 50 people there today.

341
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:19,112
So that is an example of kind of

342
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:29,193
You know now maybe machines are better that has may have had an impact, but I don't think you can say that there was no funding impact that led to that kind of drastic result.

343
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:33,715
And I certainly don't think you can say that not having more people there you know if we had more people there.

344
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:41,458
we'd have more sidewalk crews we'd have more road repair we'd have more more support for that kind of basic infrastructure work as well, so.

345
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,047
Again, it's not simple.

346
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:57,822
And one of the reasons this is such a difficult conversation is that the law is really complicated and the law is designed to be complicated because it's designed by people who never wanted taxes to go up and didn't believe that government services were important.

347
00:33:58,543 --> 00:34:01,787
So that's kind of the environment that we're existing under.

348
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:13,712
And I think that, I think I will say in a positive sense that I think Medford is just seeing the conversation around it and also people living and experiencing the lack of services that we have.

349
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:21,834
I think people are really ready to have a conversation about raising the revenue we need to invest in improving the city.

350
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:23,075
Yeah.

351
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:25,255
So it sounds like two and a half comes up kind of like twice.

352
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:30,297
Like you can't have a tax rate that's higher than two and a half and you can't raise revenue by more than two and a half percent.

353
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:30,817
Is that right?

354
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,190
Right.

355
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:32,571
Okay.

356
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:33,871
Correct.

357
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:40,336
And so those, yeah, I mean, but the funny part of that is that those two concepts aren't really linked.

358
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:47,140
And the idea that they'd both be two and a half is just because the people who wrote it were like two and a half, we'll cap it at two and a half.

359
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:55,426
And you can't grow by more than two and a half, not based on any sort of economic concept other than we don't like taxes.

360
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,548
So it's hard to understand because it doesn't make a lot of sense.

361
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:00,409
Yeah.

362
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:00,789
Yeah.

363
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,410
Yeah.

364
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,581
That's really helpful.

365
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:15,085
And it also like that in relationship to how you explained like growth in other cities and how that's able to sort of offset maybe the impact on like individual families is helpful to understand as well.

366
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:19,846
So thank you for that and for the extra time spent in explaining that to us, I appreciate.

367
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:23,128
Totally, happy to talk about it.

368
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:26,489
I think if more people knew about it, we'd be in a better place.

369
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:28,017
Very cool.

370
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:28,878
Thank you.

371
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,900
And this was a lot of really helpful information.

372
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,622
I want to see, Chelly, if you have any thoughts.

373
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:40,328
I know we're having a little bit of a technical issue on your end, but if there's anything you want to add or ask Zach while we have him, I'd love to hear it.

374
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:43,150
Yeah, I mean, I should have been taking notes.

375
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,111
I learned so much.

376
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:45,332
Thank you so much.

377
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:51,497
I think maybe in closing, what might you say to get folks out on the 6th when I hear a number like 100 votes?

378
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:53,138
meaning change.

379
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,000
In my mind that means grow, vote now.

380
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,201
So my thought would be how do we get people out?

381
00:35:59,241 --> 00:35:59,981
What would your guidance be?

382
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:07,845
Yeah, I mean, you know, in the first place, I would just say that

383
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:12,107
The primary is really such an important election in Massachusetts.

384
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:15,968
I know everyone thinks, oh, I have to go vote again, or I'm going to have another chance in November.

385
00:36:16,368 --> 00:36:17,568
You don't have another chance.

386
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:23,350
You know, this is the time that you're picking the people that you're going to have options for in November.

387
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:30,512
So, and again, you know, in most of the races, the September vote is going to decide the race, not the November vote.

388
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:42,517
It's really important to get out in September to vote in the primary, to pick the candidate that you think best represents you, that should best represent the Democratic Party or Republican Party.

389
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:50,183
You know, because that's in Massachusetts, again, it's for better or worse, one party state.

390
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:51,904
It's the Democratic Party.

391
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:54,646
And this is the Democratic primary.

392
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:56,908
So that's where that decision is going to be made.

393
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,490
I think that's the most important thing I can say.

394
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,631
You don't have that opportunity in November.

395
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:08,932
The people voting in September are making the choices for the people who vote in November.

396
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:18,055
So if you want to be part of making that decision and not just be handed other people's choices in November, it's important to get out and vote in September.

397
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:28,548
And I think there's like those two, like I said, there's two really interesting races to me that like secretary of state, who's that, you said it's like his seventh or so term.

398
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:33,511
Also the state rep in our area, like has been in several terms.

399
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:39,334
And when we talk about like Democrats and Republicans, I think there is like a real range within those two parties, right?

400
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:46,418
And like thinking about people that were elected 20 plus years ago versus some of the newer candidates, it sounds like September really is the opportunity

401
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,881
to use your vote in some way to impact those two races.

402
00:37:51,482 --> 00:38:05,453
And I think also looking at the diversity of people running for some of those more open races, I think that's a real chance to use your vote in that way to, as you're saying, help us decide for November.

403
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:20,722
Yes, I'd absolutely say that the Secretary of State race, the State Representative race for North and East Medford and West Malden, which is Paul Donato and Nicole Muslam.

404
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:28,344
And then I would also highlight, it's a little less exciting and it's less exciting of an office, but I would also highlight the State Auditors race.

405
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:30,825
That one right now is the tightest race of all of them.

406
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:37,107
Um, it's basically 50-50 right now between Chris Dempsey and Diana DiZaglio.

407
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:48,474
Um, so that's, uh, you know, of all of the races, that may be the one where, you know, like in 2019, when Julia Mejia won the Boston City Council at-large seat by one vote.

408
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:56,859
Um, you know, maybe that's the one-vote race, or maybe the state rep race is the one-vote race where your vote really could be the deciding factor.

409
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:00,401
Um, I mean, every vote matters in every race, but, you know,

410
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:09,852
those exciting, close, competitive races really are somewhere where your vote matters even a little bit more than every other race.

411
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:12,413
Thanks for the question, Chilean.

412
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:17,295
Yeah, so yeah, anything else that you either of you want to make sure we mention before we wrap up?

413
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:21,697
Yeah, I think we'll just vote.

414
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:24,166
Yeah.

415
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:24,426
Yeah.

416
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:28,648
And it was like, think about that idea of making a plan to vote.

417
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:38,753
Like if you're going to vote by mail, if you're going to go in person, when you're going to do it, when the, like, you know, reminding yourself where you're pulling places, I've gotten some stuff in the mail to make, like, you know, make sure that you're registered to vote.

418
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:42,055
Um, I know last year, some of the polling places changed a little bit.

419
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:45,516
So like making sure, you know, how you're going to do that, I think is always a good idea.

420
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,118
And it's like a Tuesday after a holiday weekend.

421
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,419
Kids are going back to school, all that stuff.

422
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:55,903
So I think I can never take for granted the importance of a plan.

423
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:57,344
So yeah.

424
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:58,485
Yeah.

425
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,027
And I'll say one more thing.

426
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:09,773
I do think that having the day after Labor Day being Election Day is a disservice to voters.

427
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:14,336
I think it should be a little bit later if you're going to do that and give people a little more time.

428
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:23,569
That being said, we're not going to have it for this episode, but there will be a lot of early voting and mail voting for that.

429
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:33,772
And then for November, there will be mail voting, and I think at least 10 days of early voting, which in Manfred will be at City Hall.

430
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:39,458
And the registration deadline has been shortened a little bit as well.

431
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:43,820
So I think you can register up to 10 days in advance of the election to be eligible.

432
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,400
I think it used to be 20.

433
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,781
So that's another change that happened recently.

434
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:48,861
We were shooting for zero.

435
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:54,303
We really wanted to go to same day registration, but there was some improvement there as well.

436
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:57,924
So there's a lot of ways to get out in November and September.

437
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:04,609
And I'll just say the only thing, you know, I haven't given my opinion on anything I think except the fair share amendment.

438
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,490
So I'll give it again.

439
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:09,033
Yes on one, yes on one for the fair share amendment.

440
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:14,078
And that's something the city council has like voted to support as well as the school committee in Medford, right?

441
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,318
Yeah.

442
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:15,519
Yes.

443
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:24,267
City council and school committee have voted to support the fair share amendment along with I think over a hundred other city councils and school committees across the state.

444
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:35,244
Um, and the state legislature, uh, voted, um, I think over 75% in the House and the Senate as well in support of it to get it on the ballot.

445
00:41:35,344 --> 00:41:40,368
So, um, really some universal, uh, agreement that this is something that we need.

446
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:44,151
Close to universal as you get.

447
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:47,574
Awesome.

448
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:52,919
Well, thank you so much for spending time with us today and hopefully we'll, um, have some exciting results from the election.

449
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,167
Thank you, Zach.

450
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,150
Thank you, Danielle.

451
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:57,891
