55
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:34,225
Yeah, so we've been open for the last month and we've noticed until 11, we've noticed that on the weekend days, so Thursday through Friday, there's been a demand for late night food and there's not many places open.

56
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:38,046
So we wanna offer our customers a healthy food choice.

57
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:44,447
So most likely we would only be open past 11 on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:46,148
Thank you.

59
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,431

182
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,594
Does anyone have anything else this evening?

183
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:04,835
Records.

184
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:05,475

00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,636
One barn burner, John, give us a barn burner.

187
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:17,158
Oh, we didn't receive them, right.

188
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:21,141
Mr. President, I did not receive the records in my package.

189
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,542
I checked with a couple of my colleagues, they didn't either.

190
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:26,264
Okay, so the records will be tabled for the next meeting.

191
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:32,647
You get tabled for one week until I receive a hard copy, then at that point, I'd be able to- Thank you.

192
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,589
We didn't receive a hard or soft copy of the records.

193
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:35,929
Thank you.

194
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:41,618
Before we adjourn, anyone have anything else to for this evening?

195
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,939
Chair awaits a motion.

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,360
