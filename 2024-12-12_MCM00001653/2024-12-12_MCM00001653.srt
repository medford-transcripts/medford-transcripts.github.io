00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:50,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see, and the Director of Traffic and Parking, Todd Blake is here, and if I missed anyone, I'm just on a foreign computer, so I'm getting used to this.

00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:56,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So the minutes, minutes have been submitted, Alba, to the commissioners.

00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:57,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Have they been reviewed?

18
00:00:57,963 --> 00:01:03,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they have been reviewed, I will take a motion to accept and approve the minutes from the November 12th, 2024 meeting.

19
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:04,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

20
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:12,494
[SPEAKER_05]: on the motion of Commissioner McGiven.

21
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:15,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by?

22
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:16,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

23
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:24,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt to approve the minutes of the November 12th, 2024 meeting.

24
00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:25,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Alba, roll call.

25
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

26
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:27,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

27
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:29,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

28
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:30,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

29
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:36,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

30
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:42,320
[SPEAKER_04]: One point of order, since I was not here for that meeting, can I even vote on them?

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, do we have enough approval votes for them?

32
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we would have enough if you abstained, which is probably- I just feel bad I wasn't there, so I feel bad voting for them.

33
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:55,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So as long as we have enough to approve them, I'll abstain.

34
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:56,888
[SPEAKER_04]: We do, yes.

35
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, can I actually- Go ahead.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,414
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was checking the notes against mine and I realized that I, yeah, they look right.

37
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I misunderstood something, I saw something.

38
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,329
[SPEAKER_05]: No worries.

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And the vote is to me, so I am a yes.

40
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:20,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a vote of three to nothing, to one abstain.

41
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:23,857
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes, the minutes have been approved.

42
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:33,384
[SPEAKER_05]: New business, 2024-68, request from Blue Fuji Restaurant, 38 Salem Street, for 15 minute parking zone.

43
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:37,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's look and see if the petitioner is present.

44
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:43,779
[SPEAKER_05]: If they are, can you just wave your hand or indicate?

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, my question is whether this was already approved or not.

46
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked that, I couldn't find anything.

47
00:02:54,365 --> 00:03:00,929
[SPEAKER_10]: So Chief, I think Jim Silva was going to be here to speak on this matter and he mentioned he couldn't make it tonight.

48
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Sergeant Rogers' comment was that

49
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe we have addressed this issue in the past.

50
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:16,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know you looked at it, but we had a discussion as to whether or not we've done this.

51
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I could not find anything.

52
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:35,637
[SPEAKER_05]: In what the petitioner, at least my understanding of the petitioner's request is, there was a 15-minute parking that existed, and the city has done, well, there's some private construction, and the city did some reconstruction of Sale Street in that area with a bump out, and at some point during all of that, they lost their 15-minute parking zone.

53
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Director Blake's putting it up right here.

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: See the bump out, and it was there, I believe.

55
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

56
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:45,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Used to be right here.

57
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,253
[SPEAKER_06]: The hydrant's new.

58
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:48,574
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been 15 minutes.

59
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,315
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go back to our earlier view.

60
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:53,757
[SPEAKER_10]: True.

62
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

63
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:13,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not seeing a 15-minute sign, but they used to have a parking directly in front.

64
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Director Blake, can you go up Ashland?

65
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:18,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was on the corner there.

66
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't up there, was it?

67
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,380
[SPEAKER_10]: This was permit.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,644
[SPEAKER_10]: So it used to be permit.

69
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:26,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

70
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:28,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if we gave that.

71
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:44,311
[SPEAKER_10]: So at one point when this permit went up, as we all know, when permit Parkins approved on the residential side street, it usually does not include next to the business, but the sign didn't have an arrow, so it was unclear.

72
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:48,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had remedied that piece of it in the past.

73
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,474
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be what people are remembering.

74
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,937
[SPEAKER_10]: So we, I'm trying to find the,

75
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,539
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, that would be a difficult spot, right?

76
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:04,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you're driving through the square to stop and pick up a meal at Blue Fuji, that's a one-way street, it would be kind of.

77
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here's the old one right there.

78
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:08,685
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

79
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So at some point in time, we can make the assumption that the Traffic Commission approved that sign, even though we didn't find it yet.

80
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:21,572
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to, logic suggests that we have approved it in the past.

81
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the petitioner not present, I'm wondering if we should just continue

82
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:30,167
[SPEAKER_05]: If we should just.

83
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,372
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're asking for it here now is from the pool to the stop sign.

84
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:42,919
[SPEAKER_09]: They're asking to move it Todd didn't we just move the 15 minute parking when we reconfigure those spaces.

85
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:47,483
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to move the handicap spot and we had to move the 15 minute parking spot.

86
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:50,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought they just move it further than they wanted.

87
00:05:52,862 --> 00:06:09,256
[SPEAKER_10]: So the petitioner of the restaurant reached out to the mayor's office, and Jim Silva and some others were involved in the conversations back and forth, and it was decided that they would come to the meeting and request 15-minute on Ashland from the telephone pole to the stop sign.

88
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:15,241
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did point out, yes, that there's a 15-minute, a couple 15-minute spots here,

89
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:22,669
[SPEAKER_10]: near the modern pastry in the church and then there's a 15-minute spot near at the end near Dunkin Donuts.

90
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,894
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are two other 15-minute areas other than the former Blue Fuji there.

91
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:33,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important because we didn't remove any 15-minute spot.

92
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we moved it as opposed to removed it.

93
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Commissioner McGibbon, you are right.

94
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: When we talked about moving the hydrant, there was some construction that had to do dealing with moving the hydrant, etc.

95
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:49,579
[SPEAKER_05]: That was probably the petition where we had agreed to move that 15 minutes on.

96
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're specifically not finding that done.

97
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe you're right now that you've said that.

98
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so these two are 15 minute, this car and this car.

99
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:06,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a sign that's missing back here, delineating, but the front is clearly marked out.

100
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,068
[SPEAKER_05]: But that... There are some on the other side of the street also.

101
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:14,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

102
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:22,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's the... So knowing all that, they still wanted to request this 15 minute space on Ashland.

103
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:24,993
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted on Ashland?

104
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:53,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, so so they had reached out to the mayor's office About the loss of the 15 minute in front of the building They got at least one ticket or more on ashland or their customers have So it was already explained to them that these other 15 minute are available on salem and they're available to everyone But they still wanted to request the 15 minute beside blue fuji on ashland Did we have so?

105
00:07:54,767 --> 00:08:16,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I could imagine that if they have some regular Uber Eats type drivers or Dash or whoever, sorry, I sound like a Neanderthal, I don't know if they're all called, that drive at stop there, that they would perhaps know that coming up on Ashland Street would be a great place to stop, grab the 15 minute and run in there.

106
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:23,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know if that spot, as in that photo you were just showing us, it looks occupied.

107
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:27,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it frequently used by permit-only permit holders?

108
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:33,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So the permit piece has already been rectified with an arrow.

109
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:40,101
[SPEAKER_10]: So from that sign up the street is permit, and from that telephone pole, the stop sign is unrestricted right now.

110
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:45,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So someone right now could park in those spaces next to Blue Fuji all day long for 12 hours.

111
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no turnover.

112
00:08:48,288 --> 00:09:02,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So by asking for the 15 minute in that area during their business hours or maybe replicate what was on the sign before in the front, it keeps it the turnover of that space and someone won't fill it all day long.

113
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:12,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm very much in favor of our public spots should either be resident permit parking in our business district or should have some sort of turnover, right?

114
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,691
[SPEAKER_01]: This shouldn't be an all day spot.

115
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:31,396
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a meter two hour spot, but if the business is asking for a 15 minute pickup spot, like I would strongly prefer that than having it just be something where the one lucky person knows that they can park there and then hop a bus to Boston for the day.

116
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:32,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

117
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:42,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if it was ever needed for business employees and there's the business parent parking program with, and they could park in several lots throughout the square if they want that.

118
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:47,679
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is purely for turnover of, um, customers or like Uber eats or whatnot.

119
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:47,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

120
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:56,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm always in favor of additional 15 minutes spots in a place like, uh, Medford square, because I do think it has to turn over and increase business.

121
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and that is a,

122
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:03,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free spot for us to kind of designate if we felt like we should do it.

123
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Understanding the petitioner isn't here, do any of the commissioners feel obligated to move forward on this and grant it?

124
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:14,030
[SPEAKER_05]: We certainly have spoken with the petitioner enough to understand their request.

125
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments from the commissioners?

126
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:22,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd knows a lot about this already and has spoken, or he and Jim has spoken with them.

127
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,795
[SPEAKER_10]: They made a statement for the record too.

128
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:28,836
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nina has coordinated with them as well.

129
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Jim apologized that he couldn't make it.

130
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:37,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he was gonna speak for that.

131
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:37,608
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

132
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:41,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me do this because I think it's probably good protocol.

133
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:45,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone in the public here wishing to speak in favor of this?

134
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:51,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Just on some way, raise your hand or put something in the chat.

135
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:56,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, is anyone here in the public wishing to speak against this petition?

136
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:02,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, also seeing none, I'll go back to the commissioners.

137
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, I think we have enough information to act if the commissioner would like to.

138
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:15,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So I throw it back to either a motion or a discussion.

139
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's pretty short, Chief.

140
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,982
[SPEAKER_09]: If you'll allow, I'll just read the couple of sentences that the petitioner submitted for this, and I think that covers it.

141
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, please.

142
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:30,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, dear Alva, follow the advice of Chief of Staff.

143
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:39,305
[SPEAKER_09]: See below, I'm writing to request the reinstallation of a 15-minute parking zone along Ashton Street adjacent to Blue Fuji Restaurant at Salem Street.

144
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:47,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Previously, there was a 15-minute parking zone in front of the restaurant, but its removal has caused significant inconvenience for our customers and staff.

145
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:53,816
[SPEAKER_09]: This change has led to parking infractions, including tickets issued to deliver drivers and customers while attempting quick pickups.

146
00:11:54,276 --> 00:12:00,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Restoring this parking zone would provide much-needed accessibility for our patrons and staff while reducing these avoidable issues.

147
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Please let me know if additional details or steps are required to process this request.

148
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for your time and consideration.

149
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Best regards, Julie Blue Fuji.

150
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,830
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, I'll move to approve.

151
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

152
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,158
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Commissioner McGibbon, do I have a second?

153
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

154
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:21,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

155
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,476
[SPEAKER_05]: A roll call, please.

156
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:26,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

157
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to interject.

158
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:37,410
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably, unless you're assuming it's going to be 24, 7, 15 minute, is there any times or days?

159
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:41,575
[SPEAKER_10]: The former one was 8am to 9pm in front.

160
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:55,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I would, well, I'll put it back to the... I had suggested to the proponent and to Chief of Staff, but I don't know what they officially are requesting.

161
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:59,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I was moving on the request to reinstate what was there, just in a different spot.

162
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, sorry.

163
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,377
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I understood at all.

164
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:08,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so on the motion of Commissioner McGibbon, seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2024-68, 15-minute parking

165
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:17,200
[SPEAKER_05]: on Ashland Street, but in the same manner and form as had previously been granted.

166
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:18,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Alvaroco.

167
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:19,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon.

168
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:20,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

169
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:22,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt.

170
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:24,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

171
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski.

172
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

173
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley.

174
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:29,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

175
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:33,317
[SPEAKER_05]: On the vote of four to none, the motion approved.

176
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:38,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make some notes.

177
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: 2024-69, no parking anytime in the area on Brookside Parkway.

178
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner McGiven and Engineer George Connolly have presented this.

179
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:48,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner McGiven, the floor is yours.

180
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:49,737
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thanks.

181
00:13:50,698 --> 00:14:00,843
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is an area of the city that receives a lot of dumping and sort of vehicles that just park there for long periods of time.

182
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:08,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a place that my permit officer is constantly seeing.

183
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:12,589
[SPEAKER_09]: trash build up there between the vehicles and the fence.

184
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:18,691
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other side of the fence is MassDOT property and they maintain it maybe twice a year.

185
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:26,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be to a benefit to limit parking or just have no parking along the stretch.

186
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:32,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if someone's got, I can either pull it up or if someone can help me out and just pull it up and we can look at the stretch.

187
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:37,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's the stretch that is abutting the MassDOT right of way on Brookside Parkway.

188
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, is someone gonna pull it up?

189
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:45,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I am curious as to the length of distances.

190
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Which which is which plot starting at Westfield?

191
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:54,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm starting.

192
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's Water a Webster.

193
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry a Webster.

194
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:05,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, not Valley Okay

195
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,703
[SPEAKER_09]: double checking here too.

196
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:19,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're looking at from between Webster and water.

197
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:21,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

198
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,950
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the view from Webster looking down.

199
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So now it's traveling towards water with my cursor.

200
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the stretch.

201
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we'll look back from water.

202
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:37,236
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

203
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

204
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:45,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially from the Salem Street Rotary to Water Street, is that what we're requesting?

205
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:51,954
[SPEAKER_09]: If I... It could be.

206
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:56,135
[SPEAKER_09]: The worst of it is down closer to Webster Street.

207
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:00,016
[SPEAKER_09]: This area?

208
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:02,217
[SPEAKER_09]: That area there, yeah.

209
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:02,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

210
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim, are you looking for both sides of the street or just the left?

211
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:17,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the left side of the street, just the non-stop property.

212
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:27,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the church parks its bus, the church on Salem Street, I think they park their bus down there.

213
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of the larger vehicles park there.

214
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:35,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there is a bus there that is just there.

215
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:41,953
[SPEAKER_05]: My recommendation would be no parking because of the winter.

216
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:43,234
[SPEAKER_05]: It's extremely tight.

217
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:46,216
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

218
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Sergeant.

219
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,500
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

220
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me do this, commissioners, if you'll allow me.

221
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone in the public here wishing to speak in favor of this petition?

222
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:08,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyone here wishing to speak against the petition?

223
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:24,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, seeing none, just want to make sure the public had a right to chime in on this and let's go back to the commissioners.

224
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:25,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Todd, do you have a question?

225
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:27,930
[SPEAKER_10]: The lights are shutting off.

226
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just moving.

227
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:32,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

228
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:37,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be positive that I understood what area it was.

229
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:42,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I understand it's coming from DPW and its functional needs and stuff, which is great.

230
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:48,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I just... Was it in the supporting documents that I didn't get to today?

231
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:49,549
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.

232
00:17:51,583 --> 00:18:04,224
[SPEAKER_09]: The extent or the area yeah, just what well, we can, I feel like we can decide that here because we may want to leave some parking between these 2 roads Webster and water.

233
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:15,437
[SPEAKER_09]: It was going to leave some if you're going to leave some, it should be up closer to the rotary as you're seeing here because that apartment building is sometimes use it.

234
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really the stretch in between the parking lot.

235
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And the parking lot across the street and Webster.

236
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:32,584
[SPEAKER_09]: That we see the dumping, we see the cars just parked there for weeks at a time.

237
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:43,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we do something about no overnight parking and stuff like that?

238
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:58,522
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are parking there and commuting to Boston or they're working their jobs in the squares, I'm not okay with dumping vehicles, but would this be better served for the public by just saying no overnight parking?

239
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,623
[SPEAKER_09]: That could work.

240
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:02,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want

241
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:07,625
[SPEAKER_09]: to minimize the amount of dumping that is happening there.

242
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:08,945
[SPEAKER_09]: We did something similar.

243
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:16,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I should actually be hesitant before I say that'll work, because I think we did something similar over on Commercial Street, where we said no overnight parking.

244
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:18,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're still getting dumping there.

245
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:23,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And by dumping, you mean vehicles are getting dumped?

246
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,510
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just trash.

247
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:32,866
[SPEAKER_09]: between the cars and the fence or just right over the fence, the cars that make it kind of hidden.

248
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,708
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a really good opportunity for dumping.

249
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:44,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we own up to a certain extent and then mass dot owns the rest, but they don't clean it all that often.

250
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:47,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So we ended up cleaning it and sending volunteers in there to clean it.

251
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:51,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a, it makes me nervous to doing, doing that.

252
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

253
00:19:55,125 --> 00:20:03,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So ultimately, I mean, ideally, I'd like to just restrict the parking on that end of it from the parking lot across the street to Webster and just say no parking.

254
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,452
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would settle with no overnight parking.

255
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be an improvement.

256
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:21,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tim, for who makes this motion, can you give us, can you try to describe the area you want in words so we can make sure the petition,

257
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:29,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, maybe we can do it in terms of... I'm measuring it for you, Tim, right now.

258
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:33,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like about 200 feet from Webster to that parking lot.

259
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:36,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, then let's make it 200 feet.

260
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:40,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that to... See, Webster's here, the parking lot's here.

261
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,671
[SPEAKER_10]: It's showing us about 200 feet.

262
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you want?

263
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I see where there's the west side, right?

264
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,632
[SPEAKER_10]: East side.

265
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:49,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

266
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:52,033
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was looking at right there.

267
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,376
[SPEAKER_10]: This stretch for now and then see how it goes.

268
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,458
[SPEAKER_05]: East side, Webster 200.

269
00:20:58,778 --> 00:20:59,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

270
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,762
[SPEAKER_10]: East side from Webster extending 200 feet southward.

271
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:07,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds about right.

272
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:11,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you got it.

273
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:12,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

274
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:12,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

275
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:14,068
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

276
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:24,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is the petition of commission of McGivern, so I would look to another commissioner for a proposed motion on this, which would exist.

277
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd motion for that.

278
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:32,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tim, though, I would be interested, just keep us apprised as to like, if it gets any better.

279
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:37,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to, I'm sure it's on your list of things to do, but I like the phased in approach.

280
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So a motion, Chief.

281
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:57,177
[SPEAKER_05]: to approve 2024-69, no parking any time on Brookside Parkway, east side, extending 200 feet southward.

282
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

283
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

284
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Alba, can you give us a roll call, please?

285
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

286
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:11,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

287
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

288
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

289
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:20,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

290
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:21,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

291
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:23,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley?

292
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:23,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

293
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:30,833
[SPEAKER_05]: On a vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved and the petition passes.

294
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:38,760
[SPEAKER_05]: 2024-70, New England Portuguese Seventh-day Adventist Church, 62 Dexter Street, with a petition regarding church parking.

295
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:41,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have the petitioner present?

296
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,558
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can, we could ask you to unmute yourself.

297
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a name for it.

298
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wave your hand or something.

299
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,732
[SPEAKER_05]: We could ask you to unmute.

300
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:58,834
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

301
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:02,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you unmute yourself?

302
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,170
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, Mr. Gouveia.

303
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Traffic Commission meeting.

304
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:13,846
[SPEAKER_05]: We see your petition, but could you present it to us and explain as best you can what you're looking for from the Traffic Commission?

305
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:15,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Chief.

306
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:20,263
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, thanks for being here, Chief and all the members.

307
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a good night.

308
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:25,148
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a small church in Medford.

309
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,912
[SPEAKER_03]: We are at 62 Dexter Street.

310
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:32,376
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought the building around seven years ago.

311
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a previous church in there.

312
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:46,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So the previous church was getting a larger congregation, so they moved away from Medford, and then we bought the building.

313
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:54,255
[SPEAKER_03]: When we bought the building, there were no permit parkings on the area, so everything was fine.

314
00:23:55,636 --> 00:24:02,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the city put a permit parking on Edward, and then I think also on Dexter.

315
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:19,654
[SPEAKER_03]: We do had a petition that was approved by the parking commission, and we are allowed to park on Baxter using this warnings on our windshields during our church service.

316
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:33,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, like six years back, I mean, not that much, four years back to today, the city has grown.

317
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:39,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The residents are much more right now, and they have more cars.

318
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, we can't park on Dexter.

319
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:52,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't find an available spot Saturday morning or other church service hours because all the residents, they are parking on the street.

320
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no problem for us with that.

321
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:59,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're residents, we're not complaining about that.

322
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:05,187
[SPEAKER_03]: But just for the commission to know that we are having some struggles to find some spots.

323
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,748
[SPEAKER_03]: during our church service hours.

324
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:18,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what our church members, what they've been doing is they've been parking on Edward Street.

325
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:27,475
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, we can't park there because we're not allowed to park on Edward Street, only on Dexter Street.

326
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:31,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been getting some tickets once in a while.

327
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not every Saturday, but

328
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:49,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And then because we don't want to break any laws or any rules, we're doing this, moving this petition to you guys so you could analyze and see if it is possible for us to allow us to park on Edward Street.

329
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:54,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on Dexter, there is like a three blocks area.

330
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:57,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I sent a map.

331
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:03,594
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be between Edward, between Dexter and Henry Street.

332
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:04,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

333
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

334
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I showed you, I sent that.

335
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:12,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have this map.

336
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:13,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

337
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:14,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

338
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would help us a lot.

339
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not a big, a large church right now.

340
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:28,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say last Saturday, I counted 68 members on Saturday morning, on an average of three members per car.

341
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say maybe 20 cars on our busiest like Saturday morning service.

342
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's the average.

343
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's our story.

344
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:51,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask a question, not to interrupt, but can you tell me a little bit about, is Saturday mornings the only day for services or do you, how many days a week do you have services and what's your population?

345
00:26:52,748 --> 00:26:58,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we do have our main service hours on Saturday morning, okay, from 8.30 to

346
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:03,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually stay until 3, 3.30 at church.

347
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:11,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all the members, but we do have some kids activities after sermon.

348
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:12,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on Saturdays morning.

349
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we do also have what we call like

350
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:46,757
[SPEAKER_03]: a preach service like a like a prayer service it's on Wednesday night and Sunday's night that would start at 7 30 to 9 and Wednesday night and Sunday nights are like a very few members they go last last Wednesday we had like six or seven at the most and also the same thing on Sundays okay so

351
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:51,548
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the three days that we have service in church.

352
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:53,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

353
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:58,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And the piece of paper you showed me that parking for the Adventist Church, do you know when you got that?

354
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,874
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not the map, the other one that tells you that you're in church.

355
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know when you got that from the parking lot?

356
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:04,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief.

357
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:21,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on the New England Portuguese chart since 2021 earlier, and we also have been doing this since then.

358
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,601
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you have that?

359
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,660
[SPEAKER_03]: No issues at all.

360
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:38,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly I had one ticket, like back maybe one and a half year ago, because I did park on Edward, but we paid the ticket.

361
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had one, all right?

362
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:50,949
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do know that this, we've been doing, the church has been doing that like at least for three years before 2021, okay?

363
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:52,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes a way back.

364
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly the year.

365
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:04,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner, any questions for the petitioner?

366
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:11,047
[SPEAKER_10]: So Chief, I have some info I could share a screen with.

367
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:27,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like they used to have, possibly still now, I haven't gone out there, but as of 2022 on Street View, it shows they had some space directly in front, maybe like 70 feet or so, restricted to church use only.

368
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:32,327
[SPEAKER_10]: which I know is not necessarily exactly what the petition is wanting.

369
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:36,833
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants, you know, something else, but I just want to highlight that to folks.

370
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:37,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

371
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

372
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:40,136
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have like two spots in front of church.

373
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:41,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

374
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:46,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you see there's like a, yes.

375
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:48,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Until there.

376
00:29:48,516 --> 00:29:48,957
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

377
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:52,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Like from this telephone pole to the wheelchair and back here.

378
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's in front of the church and then like front next to this blue house.

379
00:29:57,181 --> 00:30:00,203
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's maybe, maybe three spaces.

380
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:01,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

381
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually use like two from this pole.

382
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:11,290
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the, yeah, this pole, this, the, the pole until the next sign to, there you go.

383
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:11,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

384
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here on the beam and trash bins.

385
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

386
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:14,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

387
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:27,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also, just a point of information in the when people for a completely different matter asked about current park in this area and where they could park.

388
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:33,297
[SPEAKER_10]: We did point out to others that main street right here is currently unrestricted.

389
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:44,411
[SPEAKER_10]: So Main Street, which is four or five buildings away, is unrestricted, so that's an option, not knowing what's gonna come out of this meeting, just pointing that out that that's an option.

390
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:51,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other point was some resident-parent parking streets exclude Sunday and holiday.

391
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure of these individual streets around here, but we could probably get a list.

392
00:30:57,714 --> 00:31:00,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are just some things that might help the discussion.

393
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:05,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my traffic size is believed that that is seven days a week up there, so.

394
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:10,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know when we made it Edward Street permit parking?

395
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,416
[SPEAKER_05]: When we did?

396
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:15,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

397
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:19,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably tell you it's not my office though.

398
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhat recent?

399
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably been a while.

400
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:34,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that document that you made, I can take a look.

401
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:40,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

402
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:54,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though, you know, we're looking right now to see if we can tell when it was made.

403
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think it sort of creates a little problem, right?

404
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,702
[SPEAKER_05]: We got 60 cars on a Saturday morning.

405
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,624
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be able to extend the area.

406
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:03,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Pastor, can I ask you a question?

407
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Have your members tried to park up on Main Street?

408
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's probably this equidistance with some of the streets that you're outlining.

409
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've got Edwards you've used and

410
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:21,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You're indicating saying Main Street is unrestricted parking.

411
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:23,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

412
00:32:25,932 --> 00:32:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried and sometimes we use, but the thing is, Chief, it's really hard to find a spot on Main Street on Saturday morning.

413
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:43,501
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go there to Main Street and Dexter, let's see, go to the corner of Main Street and Dexter, there you go.

414
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,983
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, oops, you see the mailbox?

415
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:48,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

416
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:49,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there.

417
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:49,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You see?

418
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:50,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

419
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,140
[SPEAKER_03]: In front of this house right there.

420
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

421
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:58,583
[SPEAKER_03]: We can usually find like one or two parking spots.

422
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've guidance my members to park there on Main Street.

423
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:08,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I've been telling you, it's really hard to find a spot.

424
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:31,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of parking restrictions like the sign that's in front of the church there that says no parking for church only and then you put signs and you're, this is the first I'm actually hearing that that exists anywhere in Medford.

425
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:32,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

426
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for the commission to know, we do have two spots in front of church, but it's very common to find residents parking there.

427
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we never complain about that.

428
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Two spots is not going to make any difference to us.

429
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We never complain.

430
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

431
00:33:55,673 --> 00:34:00,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Your members put signs in their cars and then just park on Dexter Street.

432
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

433
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:03,480
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get ticketed.

434
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:05,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of that before.

435
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:11,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, we put this inside the windshield.

436
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:11,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

437
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:18,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But at some point, we do have like a note on the parking.

438
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: The parking officers, they knew that we usually do that.

439
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like members attending church.

440
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:31,692
[SPEAKER_03]: They never ticket us.

441
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:32,873
[SPEAKER_03]: They never gave us a ticket.

442
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:45,960
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do know the commission back then, they approved a note for if there was this sign inside the windshield, the parking officers, they wouldn't give any tickets.

443
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:50,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a point of information, I did look it up.

444
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:53,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Edward Street was approved for resident parking in 2017.

445
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:57,326
[SPEAKER_10]: With an exception to Edward place.

446
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:08,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I think that's the same list that you're looking at, but I'm probably looking at that says Dexter street, bow street to Broadway in front of homes only.

447
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:15,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Permit type resident and that's it because this would be the, this, this, you're looking at the sheet that.

448
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,825
[SPEAKER_01]: That Jim shared to us and correct the spreadsheet.

449
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:19,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

450
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:24,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dexter, that's that's what I know to Dexter is only permit from boat to Broadway.

451
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:25,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So the rest of Dexter.

452
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Is not in the records as permit.

453
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, at least in that spreadsheet, right?

454
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:38,399
[SPEAKER_10]: It just says Bow to Broadway, which is only one block closest to Magoon Square.

455
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing else on Dexter.

456
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:44,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically this street isn't permit parking.

457
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:48,347
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not appear to be.

458
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:50,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they haven't been getting tickets to Dexter.

459
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,751
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dexter and Maine are not.

460
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Dexter and Maine are not, yeah.

461
00:35:57,653 --> 00:35:58,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Edwards is.

462
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:03,497
[SPEAKER_09]: How many spaces short does the petitioner feel like he's short?

463
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:07,161
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, how many tickets are happening on Edwards?

464
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: How many cars are not parking on Dexter or Main?

465
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on church attendance.

466
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some Saturdays we don't have issues at all.

467
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:32,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But then other days when most of the residents on Dexter Street, they park on the street and then we can't just find a place.

468
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:41,535
[SPEAKER_03]: We maybe can find like three or four spots on Dexter and then maybe three spots on Main Street.

469
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:45,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been counting the spots.

470
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, usually I'm the one that's trying to help members to park.

471
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:52,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any off-street parking at the church?

472
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:54,708
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we don't.

473
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Any room for off-street parking?

474
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:00,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?

475
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Any room on the parcel for off-street parking?

476
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:18,830
[SPEAKER_03]: On the lot, we think we can park like three cars if we put like a street access, like right there on the trash bins.

477
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, on our lot, we can use like three spots right there.

478
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd have to make some changes and some improvements.

479
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:28,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do.

480
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:32,512
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to change the curb and we'd probably lose one spot, but that's fine.

481
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:35,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We could use like three more spots there.

482
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just trying to understand the context of the situation.

483
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:42,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Not with this fence here, I'm not sure if that would end up being approved.

484
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a zoning issue.

485
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:55,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And are those church parking only signs, are those official regulatory signs voted by this commission?

486
00:37:55,604 --> 00:38:02,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have to look it up, unless Alvin knows.

487
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:10,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I did Google, like I went back in the dates, 2014 it wasn't there, and then I think like 2017 it was.

488
00:38:11,828 --> 00:38:14,248
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have to do a little bit of research on that to find out.

489
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:16,169
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like in the same thing, but we can't get it done.

490
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:24,634
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were just looking to figure out when, and the 2018 image has them, the 2014 image doesn't.

491
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:27,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives you a window of what we're looking at.

492
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been here since 2018, and I do not recall us putting them up, so probably right in that timeframe, end of 2018 and 2017.

493
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:50,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how one, so I would actually just sort of play this out, right?

494
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:58,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Say we said, oh, they should be allowed to park on Edward Street and the church members should during church services.

495
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:02,739
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you program that into our parking system, right?

496
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:04,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to have a plate

497
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:19,454
[SPEAKER_01]: and the plate is in a registration, it has to be registered, and then it has to be in the system, and then we don't have a way to say these plates are allowed on this street during this window of time.

498
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:26,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know I was told in the past that if the street, the car wasn't registered to the street, it was going to be a problem, right?

499
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you need a whole other class of permits.

500
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:34,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this seems like this seems like something Park Medford did to manage the situation with placards.

501
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:39,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did find the parking restriction directly out front was from June 2018.

502
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:40,182
[SPEAKER_10]: That is real?

503
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:40,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

504
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:56,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that, you know, the Edward Street petition for permit parking, you know, we require signatures from residents.

505
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,096
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a big deal.

506
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:02,139
[SPEAKER_09]: They have one permit parking for Edward Street.

507
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel it's a little bit disingenuous if we were to go back on that.

508
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:14,725
[SPEAKER_09]: approval and say, you know, well, yeah, we're going to reserve a block, though, during these times for the church.

509
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:17,085
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already done that on Dexter.

510
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Dexter's unrestricted and Main Street's unrestricted.

511
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:29,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it could be seen as an operational problem for the church that they have more demand than parking available for them, unfortunately.

512
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:33,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

513
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:41,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a couple of blocks away, but can they park it like the Columbus, the school in Columbus Park, like, Columbus Park has a lot.

514
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:55,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the walking path is.

515
00:40:56,035 --> 00:41:02,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's not actually an easy walk because of the grade differential and all.

516
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:11,587
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things other organizations do and institutions do will provide shuttle services from remote lots for services.

517
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:16,591
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just an option on the table if you can't find any local solutions.

518
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:24,274
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what one of the Medford Square churches do is that they have buses and they bring people over.

519
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:24,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

520
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:26,937
[SPEAKER_09]: All institutions basically do it.

521
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:29,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Tufts does it if they're going to have a large event.

522
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:37,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody who's going to have an event that they need to have parking for and maybe can't supply it locally.

523
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:52,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not necessarily, I'm not even sure that if we, even if we wanted to do it, I don't think we could pass it tonight, because I think we would need to talk to people in the parking office to find out what literally they're even capable of.

524
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would get messy really fast.

525
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,291
[SPEAKER_01]: It has, our system is based on license plates.

526
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:00,912
[SPEAKER_03]: May I speak?

527
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, just so the commission know, I do record my pastor saying like the parking commission, they do have like a note on the street on the parking restriction about this.

528
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:20,170
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a warning.

529
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,612
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so they do have that.

530
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:24,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they call the book.

531
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:40,324
[SPEAKER_03]: okay i don't know i'm just saying what i heard so they have like a note on the book saying that if there is this warning on the windshield don't like give tickets okay and i heard i heard that from uh

532
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:43,967
[SPEAKER_03]: a parking officer too, all right?

533
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't seen the book, so I mean, they called the book of parking.

534
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:54,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so Mr. Gouveia, that's, I don't think anyone's saying that you're incorrect or disingenuous.

535
00:42:55,295 --> 00:43:05,342
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a change though in the time period between 1718 and now, where the parking enforcement used to be by a private entity called Park Medford, which was right at Dexter at Maine.

536
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:14,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And they might have had that policy, and that's where the placard came from, so it's not discounting that or not believing it.

537
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:23,821
[SPEAKER_10]: But when the parking department came in-house, that's what Alicia's explaining, that system has reverted to license plates and not done any of the placard system.

538
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:34,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's less about if you had it or not, it's more about that change between the private parking enforcement and the public and how they go about enforcing those.

539
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:44,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the newer system, in the newer department, that hasn't been the practice of the newer department to give placards, even for our city hall employees, unfortunately.

540
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:52,108
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was a change that occurred that was unrelated to what you all were doing, Mr. Grubea.

541
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:53,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't anything.

542
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that.

543
00:43:55,451 --> 00:43:55,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

544
00:43:57,252 --> 00:44:01,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think if the situation, if the resolution was easy, we probably would all vote it.

545
00:44:01,756 --> 00:44:13,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just very tricky with not just the spacing we have up there and the approvals, but the technical aspect of what the parking department can handle and how they can account for this.

546
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:42,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think, well, I'm gonna leave it to the commissioners, but I'm not sure we can vote on this today, and I dislike tabling things, but for whatever time period it does take, I would like you to try Main Street, Dexter Street, the few spots that you have, and see what the impact is, and report back to us.

547
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:44,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, I think we can,

548
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:50,320
[SPEAKER_05]: try to find some solutions working with the parking department ourselves to see what they can do.

549
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we can't pass something that they can't enforce or handle.

550
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:59,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to just create a problem for them.

551
00:45:00,085 --> 00:45:04,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been cognizant of that for a while now.

552
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner's thoughts on that?

553
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:19,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was just looking at what some of the other streets in the area to see what permit parking, you know what.

554
00:45:20,972 --> 00:45:25,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't find Sanger Street, S-A-N-G-E-R, on our list at all.

555
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:26,656
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the block.

556
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:27,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

557
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:28,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, I found the same.

558
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:37,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I found that Joseph has permit, Edward Layden, but Sanger doesn't appear to, and Dexter does not, and Maine does not.

559
00:45:38,504 --> 00:45:40,225
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was thinking the same thing, Alicia.

560
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:42,706
[SPEAKER_10]: In the general vicinity, what is permit, what isn't?

561
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:55,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to caution that things that are not permit parking in this area, like, I'm expecting more and more streets to want to go permit parking as density and vehicle density increases.

562
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:02,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do think that it's useful for us to be aware that there's a situation like this.

563
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:04,038
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not the only one.

564
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:13,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Do most of the church, every church I can think of has a lot, like this church is small.

565
00:46:13,992 --> 00:46:18,074
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one up in Fulton Heights that doesn't have a lot.

566
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:20,295
[SPEAKER_01]: They just use street parking.

567
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:34,622
[SPEAKER_10]: For the other streets that don't have any, this part of Bow has permit, the G zone, but this part of Bow does not.

568
00:46:36,082 --> 00:46:39,003
[SPEAKER_10]: which is, you know, not too far away either.

569
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:43,324
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go by Maine and Dexter and can't find any, you could go over here.

570
00:46:44,164 --> 00:46:47,845
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like less than a quarter mile away, which is a five-minute walk.

571
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:56,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Just trying to help point out locations if you need to, sir.

572
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:59,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I appreciate that.

573
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so for the commissioners, instead of dragging this time, it looks like there's going to be some research done.

574
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:09,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to spend some time on this.

575
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:15,006
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly, we need to put this on the plate of the parking department to see what they may have a solution for us.

576
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:16,606
[SPEAKER_05]: They may say, we can do this, this, and this.

577
00:47:16,946 --> 00:47:18,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they can do.

578
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:23,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to find out in order for us to move forward on the petition.

579
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:31,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It may also beg the question as to, should we look at all the other churches in the city, or whether or not a special permit could be presented?

580
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:34,097
[SPEAKER_05]: across the city.

581
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:41,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this an issue where we have to table an event or do some research?

582
00:47:42,403 --> 00:47:43,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can approve it.

583
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:46,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Our choices are to table it and deny it.

584
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:55,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want the petitioner to think we're just, unless we refer it to somebody else to figure it, try and figure it out.

585
00:48:00,237 --> 00:48:00,958
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my question.

586
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:05,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to lead the charge on researching it to help find a solution?

587
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:13,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I did think in something, I don't know, I'm just going to give an idea.

588
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:19,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the commission can think about it, see if it's even doable or not.

589
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:28,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't mind paying like permit parkings for the church members.

590
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:45,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if you look at this, all the churching parking in Medford, if you figure out a way, okay, give me all your members license plates and pay a permit for the city.

591
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a great idea.

592
00:48:47,496 --> 00:48:56,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we would be really forward to that, too, if there is a thing like that possible, okay?

593
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an idea, all right?

594
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:00,781
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, we just want to go to church.

595
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:01,362
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

596
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,003
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys find us a way,

597
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll more than appreciate it.

598
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:07,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

599
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:12,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do understand, even if you deny, I know it's not personal.

600
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:13,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

601
00:49:13,637 --> 00:49:15,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like city policy.

602
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:21,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just open my heart for you guys to know that we just wanna go to church.

603
00:49:22,472 --> 00:49:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And be at peace when we are in service, okay?

604
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:36,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes we do have like some traveling time, like, well, maybe the parking officer is passing that time.

605
00:49:36,936 --> 00:49:38,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we gonna get a ticket or not?

606
00:49:39,236 --> 00:49:43,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyways, just a thought for the commission, okay?

607
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I do appreciate you putting that forward.

608
00:49:45,879 --> 00:49:57,915
[SPEAKER_05]: And in answer to Commissioner Bozinski's question, I think I will take up the charge of this to kind of do the research in defining the term I. But we will take a look.

609
00:49:57,975 --> 00:49:58,476
[SPEAKER_05]: We will take a

610
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:01,219
[SPEAKER_05]: a good hard look at this.

611
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll work with Jim Sulver and Todd and see if we can come up with some solutions.

612
00:50:05,522 --> 00:50:10,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the first stop has to be with the parking department to see what technically they're capable of doing.

613
00:50:10,386 --> 00:50:13,908
[SPEAKER_05]: They may have a solution for us, or at least guide us down a path.

614
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I'm

615
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:21,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Gilbay, I really appreciate you presenting this tonight, and you did a really good job.

616
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, we're stuck in a little place.

617
00:50:23,218 --> 00:50:25,199
[SPEAKER_05]: It has nothing to do with your petition or what you requested.

618
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It just puts us in a tough spot, so we have to figure some things out.

619
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:34,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Would there be a commissioner who wishes to table this, and for what period of time would you give us the research?

620
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:38,667
[SPEAKER_04]: How much time do you need?

621
00:50:40,423 --> 00:50:42,224
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't a reference to the people behind you.

622
00:50:42,244 --> 00:50:44,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, January.

623
00:50:45,105 --> 00:50:47,467
[SPEAKER_05]: My sergeants are confident they can do it by the January meeting.

624
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:52,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So a motion to table for 30 days while we find a solution.

625
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:53,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

626
00:50:53,430 --> 00:51:06,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Baczynski to table the petition for 30 days while the Medford Police Department researches with the parking department to come up with a solution, seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

627
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:08,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Albert, can we get a roll call vote?

628
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

629
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:11,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

630
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:13,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

631
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:14,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

632
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:17,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

633
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:17,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

634
00:51:19,381 --> 00:51:20,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley?

635
00:51:20,282 --> 00:51:20,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

636
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:23,505
[SPEAKER_05]: On the vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved.

637
00:51:23,545 --> 00:51:28,389
[SPEAKER_05]: The item has been tabled for the January Traffic Commission meeting.

638
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:29,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Gobert?

639
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:31,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to reach out to you.

640
00:51:31,473 --> 00:51:32,754
[SPEAKER_05]: We have your contact information.

641
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:36,738
[SPEAKER_05]: My tribe will work with you and kind of keep you up to date and keep you posted.

642
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:39,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really appreciate you coming tonight and presenting this situation.

643
00:51:40,021 --> 00:51:44,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we can come to an expeditious solution to this for you.

644
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:44,725
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

645
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:46,066
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Chief.

646
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:47,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

647
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:48,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate your thoughts.

648
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

649
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys have a wonderful night.

650
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:52,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

651
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:58,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very, very much.

652
00:51:58,237 --> 00:52:07,485
[SPEAKER_05]: 2024-71, request from Justin Gallo, 118 Warren Street, for stop signs on Warren Street at Cooley Road to make it a four-way stop intersection.

653
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:10,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Gallo, we're going to ask you to unmute.

654
00:52:11,768 --> 00:52:12,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

655
00:52:12,388 --> 00:52:12,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?

656
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can hear you.

657
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:16,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

658
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your patience, although I think tonight is really short one.

659
00:52:19,588 --> 00:52:22,110
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some lights you would be still sitting out there.

660
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But please go ahead and present your petition for us.

661
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:25,912
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

662
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:28,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me and Alvo for helping me with the request.

663
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:43,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I had made a request in the initially CClickFix platform to help make this a safer intersection, which is Warren Street at the intersection with Clulee Road.

664
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:45,888
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a four-way intersection.

665
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:52,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there are stop signs on Clulee Road, both sides, west and east-facing.

666
00:52:54,877 --> 00:53:06,247
[SPEAKER_00]: The Clulee Road stop sign that is facing west, which if you're familiar with that area, is facing towards Playstead Park, is not effective.

667
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:09,930
[SPEAKER_00]: it's obstructed by a tree when approaching it.

668
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:15,633
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it until you're about maybe 20, possibly less feet away from it.

669
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:28,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I initially, last year, made a C-click fix about this concern for safety, and they did add a stop-ahead sign, and the stop-ahead sign is roughly 100 yards.

670
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:29,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right there, exactly.

671
00:53:31,606 --> 00:53:32,467
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it right there.

672
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,691
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the tree that obstructs it.

673
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:42,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are on that side of the road, it is obstructed.

674
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:49,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a stop ahead side and added about 100 yards before that, somewhere in that area that you're going there.

675
00:53:50,722 --> 00:53:53,403
[SPEAKER_00]: That was added, I believe, in October of 2023.

676
00:53:54,244 --> 00:54:06,630
[SPEAKER_00]: But even since there remains a safety issue where people are not stopping at all at this intersection, they're just going straight through it, which I believe that is because people don't see it and they're

677
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,422
[SPEAKER_00]: ignoring the stop ahead or ignoring that sign as well.

678
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:31,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you are stopped at that West facing sign, the large bush there in your view on the right-hand side, the other stop sign when you're, yeah, not that one, but when you're facing West, the original one that we were looking at.

679
00:54:32,582 --> 00:54:39,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that Bush makes it pretty tough to actually see cars coming from Warren Street.

680
00:54:39,285 --> 00:54:45,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason to make this a safer intersection even when cars are stopped stopped at the stop sign.

681
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:50,611
[SPEAKER_00]: They naturally expect cars on Warren Street to stop as well.

682
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:57,835
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it would be a four-way stop, but it's not because cars don't stop on Warren Street.

683
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:59,116
[SPEAKER_00]: They, of course, have the right-of-way.

684
00:54:59,557 --> 00:55:02,318
[SPEAKER_00]: There are road rage incidents here and whatnot.

685
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:05,861
[SPEAKER_00]: But major thing is that it's a safety concern here.

686
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:10,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Chopping down that tree might fix it and make it a more visible stop sign.

687
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:14,266
[SPEAKER_00]: They did trim the tree a bit when they added that stop ahead sign last year.

688
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:19,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the city probably doesn't want to chop that tree down either.

689
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:31,235
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's the concern is in a way to make this safer, add stop signs to the Warren Street side, so this intersection to slow down traffic entirely.

690
00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:36,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might be muted there.

691
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:40,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I am getting used to this.

692
00:55:40,993 --> 00:55:42,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the presentation.

693
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:43,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty clear.

694
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:47,635
[SPEAKER_05]: We've dealt with this, at least on the police side, in the past.

695
00:55:47,855 --> 00:55:50,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested in Director Blake, your comments.

696
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:56,698
[SPEAKER_05]: You pretty much have control of stop signs and your thoughts are

697
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:14,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this one I do support because Cooley acts as a pair with Century Street, which lead to and from Wildwood, which is near the high school, so I think Cooley gets more activity than

698
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:23,836
[SPEAKER_10]: A typical size street might, so it might be somewhat equivalent to warrant and when it's equivalent or roughly equivalent, then it's unclear which side is right away.

699
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:24,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

700
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:30,083
[SPEAKER_10]: It does seem like it always stop would improve as well as maybe we could reach out to some of the.

701
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:34,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Corner houses with build into potentially trim some of the site line issues to.

702
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:41,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is a side street, of course, so it's usually not busy.

703
00:56:42,127 --> 00:56:44,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the weekends, the park is right there.

704
00:56:44,169 --> 00:56:50,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is busy on Saturday, Sunday mornings, not currently in the winter, of course, but, um, yeah.

705
00:56:51,294 --> 00:56:51,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

706
00:56:51,635 --> 00:56:56,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Century street being a one way, clearly access the pair to that, even though it's two way.

707
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:02,323
[SPEAKER_10]: So it does probably receive more volume than what you would expect typically.

708
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:11,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how the traffic sergeants feel about this one, but I'm supportive.

709
00:57:11,854 --> 00:57:31,361
[SPEAKER_06]: The data that we had driven, it doesn't mean that there aren't collisions at this intersection, but it depends how it gets coded into our CAD, but the numbers were... I think there was four noted collisions this year from January 1st.

710
00:57:33,121 --> 00:57:34,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and in traffic engineering,

711
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:40,996
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean that these numbers are truly accurate.

712
00:57:41,116 --> 00:57:42,938
[SPEAKER_06]: They could be categorized in a different location.

713
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:49,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we're looking at Warren or Cooley, if they're not categorized that way, we may not see other ones.

714
00:57:49,442 --> 00:57:50,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that that's the exact number.

715
00:57:50,923 --> 00:57:55,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying that's the number we found with the data that we had from those locations.

716
00:57:57,467 --> 00:58:01,630
[SPEAKER_05]: As to the petition for the both of you, is there any reason to not support this?

717
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a reason not to support it.

718
00:58:04,171 --> 00:58:05,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that

719
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:07,564
[SPEAKER_06]: adding the stop sign in this location.

720
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:11,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see how it could not benefit us.

721
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:12,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sergeants.

722
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioners, any questions for either the petitioner, Director Blake, or the traffic sergeants related to this?

723
00:58:23,537 --> 00:58:27,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just to clarify, Todd, so is the four-way stop warranted here?

724
00:58:29,365 --> 00:58:32,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I didn't do official warrants, but.

725
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:38,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally speaking, in comparison, some other requests we've received, we have.

726
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:43,394
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of precedence, the traffic commission been approving.

727
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Somewhat similar situations where it's.

728
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:54,041
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, not a collector with a local road, arterial with a local road, it's like two local roads, and it's unclear which one is the major and which one's minor.

729
00:58:54,582 --> 00:59:04,248
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the warrants is the volume should be roughly equal on the two roads, and that makes it unclear, whereas if it's clearly one road's more volume than the other, then it's not unclear.

730
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:10,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Crash history's another, volume's another, but I didn't do an official warrant analysis, no.

731
00:59:10,753 --> 00:59:13,615
[SPEAKER_10]: But generally speaking, it seems like it would meet

732
00:59:15,057 --> 00:59:18,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It would likely meet them, but I haven't ran the numbers, no.

733
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:21,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you consider this a recommendation?

734
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:26,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would consider recommending approval, yep.

735
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:31,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's good enough for me, fellow commissioners.

736
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:49,682
[SPEAKER_09]: If our engineering division through Todd is recommending a four-way stop here, then I would motion to approve, and I would motion that included in that motion would be a direction to DPW to trim the tree, make sure the sign is visible.

737
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:53,397
[SPEAKER_04]: One question, I guess more for Tim.

738
00:59:53,517 --> 00:59:57,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you convert the current stop signs to like a stop always?

739
00:59:58,538 --> 01:00:01,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we, something like that to let- An always tab?

740
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can do an always tab.

741
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:13,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, Steve, once this commission, if they approve, if you approve the always stop, that's the requirement now for any always stop that it has the always tab underneath.

742
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:14,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

743
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:15,922
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been ordering more of those.

744
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:19,883
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to catch up on any that we, if you see any that don't have that, let us know.

745
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:23,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something to let people know that the change is coming.

746
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So just something to alert people that the change is coming.

747
01:00:28,116 --> 01:00:33,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did notice, too, at this intersection that stop lines are not painted.

748
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So or they're faded out.

749
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:37,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like some older ones that are painted.

750
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:44,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, I'm getting mixed results here on Google Earth as far as the paint goes.

751
01:00:44,547 --> 01:00:45,788
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it is faded.

752
01:00:49,327 --> 01:00:50,168
[SPEAKER_08]: take care of the paint.

753
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:54,631
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll freshen up the paint, we'll trim the tree, and we'll do a forward stop.

754
01:00:55,471 --> 01:01:03,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the tree, I think it might be a tough one to trim because it's like the trunk of it that's blocking the sign, which makes it difficult.

755
01:01:03,857 --> 01:01:07,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we might move the sign then.

756
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:09,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we'll go.

757
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:13,863
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, on the motion of Commissioner McGibbon to approve 2024-71,

758
01:01:16,727 --> 01:01:25,729
[SPEAKER_05]: for a four-way stop with the caveat DPW will trim the tree and look at the painting of the stop lines.

759
01:01:26,189 --> 01:01:27,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

760
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:29,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second it.

761
01:01:29,629 --> 01:01:30,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go ahead.

762
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

763
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Albert, could I get a roll call vote, please?

764
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:39,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

765
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:40,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

766
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:42,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

767
01:01:43,052 --> 01:01:43,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

768
01:01:44,332 --> 01:01:45,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

769
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:46,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

770
01:01:47,406 --> 01:01:48,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chief Buckley?

771
01:01:48,587 --> 01:01:48,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

772
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:53,451
[SPEAKER_05]: On the vote of four to nothing, the petition is approved.

773
01:01:54,228 --> 01:01:59,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Gallo, thank you for your concerns and your presentation and your patience to see it.

774
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks for having me.

775
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:06,570
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can't move the stop sign and we can't trim the tree, the stop line that's painted will help a lot, so just so you know.

776
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:13,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, also, Tim, if we have resources, we could consider a flashing stop there, which then would be a little more visible behind the tree.

777
01:02:14,172 --> 01:02:14,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that'll help too.

778
01:02:15,472 --> 01:02:16,032
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

779
01:02:16,052 --> 01:02:17,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

780
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:17,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

781
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:21,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that concludes real business.

782
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying I want to rush out of anywhere, but this would be like a record time.

783
01:02:28,802 --> 01:02:34,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to listen to my traffic side just tell me that the last time I wasn't here, they almost beat a record time.

784
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:43,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a holiday present, unless we want to talk about any of the things that we need to talk about.

785
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

786
01:02:46,649 --> 01:02:50,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this, as we enter the new year, we started it a little bit.

787
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:56,853
[SPEAKER_05]: start working on some of these table defense and kind of clear up, that will be our new year's resolution.

788
01:02:56,893 --> 01:03:04,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief, if I may, I just glanced at the old and there's one really easy one, if you do want to feel accomplished to strike one off.

789
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: That's up to the commissioners, but you would have to point out which one you're referencing.

790
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:10,936
[SPEAKER_10]: 2021-20 and 2021-19 have already been resolved.

791
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's up to the commissioners.

792
01:03:21,877 --> 01:03:24,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You're killing me because I thought we were going to beat them out of it.

793
01:03:24,419 --> 01:03:25,921
[SPEAKER_05]: But do the commissioners have an interest in this?

794
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:32,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would need a motion to remove 2021-19 and 2021-20 from the table list and then a motion to deny those as having already been resolved.

795
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:43,309
[SPEAKER_05]: probably shouldn't be too long.

796
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:52,833
[SPEAKER_10]: The Winthrop Street markings that we did as part of the Eversource already took care of this whole block, so it's already done all the things that we're requesting.

797
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:55,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the right turn only lane exists?

798
01:03:56,454 --> 01:03:56,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

799
01:03:57,495 --> 01:03:59,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this commission approved that plan.

800
01:03:59,956 --> 01:04:04,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, when we approved the plan, we approved these things.

801
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:05,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

802
01:04:05,878 --> 01:04:08,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't think to remove these from the list.

803
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were actually approved, not even denied.

804
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:16,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they were covered by another item that was already approved.

805
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,571
[SPEAKER_10]: So now that it renders them irrelevant.

806
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:29,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I request that they motion to remove them from the, just remove them from our agenda as no longer relevant?

807
01:04:30,654 --> 01:04:31,094
[SPEAKER_01]: No longer.

808
01:04:32,778 --> 01:04:44,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, again, my understanding is first we have to remove vote to remove them from the table to take them up and then you can make whatever motion you feel that would be appropriate to remove them from our agenda.

809
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:50,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So first I would need a motion to take up items 2021-19 and 2021-20 from the table to present for the commission.

810
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:56,856
[SPEAKER_01]: So motion.

811
01:04:56,876 --> 01:05:05,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So the motion of Commissioner Hunt, seconded by Commissioner McGiven to take up 2021-19 and 2021-20 from tables.

812
01:05:05,606 --> 01:05:06,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get a quick roll call, Alba?

813
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:08,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

814
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:09,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

815
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:10,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

816
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:11,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

817
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:13,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Pozanski?

818
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:13,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

819
01:05:14,987 --> 01:05:15,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley?

820
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:19,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I vote for it and that the motion is approved.

821
01:05:19,572 --> 01:05:26,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Item 2021-19 and 2021-20 both relate to Winthrop Street and parking restrictions and long turning lanes.

822
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:34,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the Commissioner have a motion to resolve these issues since they have already been adopted through another petition?

823
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:37,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to remove them from our agenda.

824
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:45,002
[SPEAKER_05]: as having been resolved.

825
01:05:45,602 --> 01:05:48,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as having been resolved through another petition.

826
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:50,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like that to be clear.

827
01:05:50,944 --> 01:06:03,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner McGiven to remove 2021-19 and 2021-20 from the agenda with the understanding that they have been resolved through another petition.

828
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

829
01:06:09,572 --> 01:06:11,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

830
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:13,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have a roll call, please.

831
01:06:13,779 --> 01:06:14,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

832
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:15,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

833
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:17,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

834
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:18,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

835
01:06:19,124 --> 01:06:20,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

836
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

837
01:06:22,086 --> 01:06:22,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

838
01:06:23,067 --> 01:06:23,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

839
01:06:23,467 --> 01:06:30,973
[SPEAKER_05]: On the vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved in 2021-19 and 2021-20 are removed from the agenda.

840
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:33,496
[SPEAKER_05]: No more time.

841
01:06:33,596 --> 01:06:34,296
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just kidding.

842
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So at least that clears up.

843
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:40,121
[SPEAKER_05]: But we really should look at 2025 as a means of clearing up some of these

844
01:06:42,017 --> 01:06:54,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things were table to date certain or dates for us to review and I'm wondering if that's something we can ask over the next two months for reviews to be provided.

845
01:06:54,745 --> 01:07:07,333
[SPEAKER_01]: One caught my eyes, like we put in a handicap sign at West Bedford Community Center and we said we'd review in 2022 to see if that made sense and if a change was needed and we never heard anything.

846
01:07:07,353 --> 01:07:08,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

847
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:17,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have a question about 2024-55 from Tim that was tabled.

848
01:07:17,758 --> 01:07:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that still need to be tabled, Tim?

849
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I presume that was in the last meeting.

850
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington Street parking lot.

851
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:33,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Amanda was interested in doing outreach and now Tim and I have had a couple of discussions on that offline.

852
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:40,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it should stay on the table because yeah, we'll have to rule on something.

853
01:07:41,752 --> 01:07:44,793
[SPEAKER_09]: In the future, I believe, because with the off street parking authority.

854
01:07:45,673 --> 01:07:49,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, there's some, there's some irons in the fire for that lot.

855
01:07:53,981 --> 01:08:04,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one on there, 2023-51, which I think Todd was not on that, which was no parking hillside at High Street.

856
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was supposed to be referred to Todd.

857
01:08:07,352 --> 01:08:08,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay to remove that.

858
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:13,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 2023-51.

859
01:08:17,715 --> 01:08:27,157
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were, can you pull it back as the applicant?

860
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever's correct and easiest, I will do.

861
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you, I don't know the correct answer.

862
01:08:35,059 --> 01:08:44,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would just be safer for us to take a motion, bring it up, and then the motion from Commissioner Brzezinski is remove it as the petitioner.

863
01:08:46,214 --> 01:08:49,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is kind of tedious, but it just makes me feel a little bit better.

864
01:08:49,035 --> 01:08:50,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I move to take it off the table.

865
01:08:51,276 --> 01:09:06,322
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, motion by Commissioner Hunt, seconded by Commissioner McGiven to take up 2023-51, no parking, any time, tow zone on High Street.

866
01:09:06,402 --> 01:09:07,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say it over real quick.

867
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:09,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

868
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:10,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

869
01:09:11,124 --> 01:09:11,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

870
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:12,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

871
01:09:13,805 --> 01:09:14,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

872
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:15,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

873
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:17,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley.

874
01:09:17,466 --> 01:09:18,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a vote of four to nothing.

875
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:21,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That motion is approved.

876
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:24,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner Brzezinski, you are the petitioner for 2023-51.

877
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:32,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you making a motion to remove that from, we would just list it as removed by petitioner?

878
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:35,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, motion to remove by me, the petitioner.

879
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:44,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the motion by Commissioner Brzezinski to remove by petitioner, seconded.

880
01:09:45,884 --> 01:09:46,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, second.

881
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:48,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

882
01:09:48,765 --> 01:09:49,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have a roll call vote.

883
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

884
01:09:51,805 --> 01:09:52,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

885
01:09:52,085 --> 01:09:53,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

886
01:09:54,026 --> 01:09:54,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

887
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:56,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

888
01:09:57,006 --> 01:09:57,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

889
01:09:58,266 --> 01:09:58,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

890
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and we'll afford nothing.

891
01:10:00,647 --> 01:10:06,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That 2023-51 has been removed from the agenda, request of the petitioner.

892
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:10,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are in the 24 strong.

893
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:17,199
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's a conspiracy because I think they're making you stay later.

894
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they do.

895
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:30,545
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think like if we spend a little bit of time each week, each month looking at some of these and doing a little bit of research, we probably resolve a lot of them fairly quickly.

896
01:10:31,926 --> 01:10:33,566
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what may be helpful?

897
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:41,390
[SPEAKER_04]: What may be helpful is to try to get an idea of like who we're expecting to kind of chime in on some of these things because I can't really tell.

898
01:10:42,628 --> 01:10:45,170
[SPEAKER_04]: like why they were tabled, who's supposed to be looking at them.

899
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:51,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I do note the one that Alicia pointed out about that should have been looked at at the 2022 meeting.

900
01:10:52,315 --> 01:10:57,639
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of these things like referred to engineering, like I don't know who's supposed to be looking in on that.

901
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be helpful to know who we're expecting comments from.

902
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:08,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have to take a look at the petition, the original full petition should exist and then the notes of those meetings, which we can do.

903
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:10,968
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all readily available for us.

904
01:11:12,818 --> 01:11:18,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I think we can see anything that's referred to engineering or referred to law department, whatever.

905
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:34,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I know engineering Todd is here, so we can, I think if chief, the chair wants to, you know, put an email together to say Todd or even Owen, but one of them to say, hey, these are all items in your court.

906
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:36,572
[SPEAKER_09]: We're expecting the report back.

907
01:11:37,032 --> 01:11:39,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Same with law department and Janice can help with that.

908
01:11:42,527 --> 01:11:49,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way we'll know they'll be on the agenda to remove them and then we can put a lot quicker than procedurally we're doing here, so.

909
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:53,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that most of the referred engineering are advisements.

910
01:11:53,052 --> 01:11:56,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that'll work.

911
01:11:59,235 --> 01:11:59,516
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

912
01:12:00,176 --> 01:12:00,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

913
01:12:01,336 --> 01:12:01,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

914
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:06,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn, a motion that you all have happy holidays that are coming up.

915
01:12:07,179 --> 01:12:12,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say that as commissioner, but on the motion to adjourn, do I have a second?

916
01:12:13,721 --> 01:12:14,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

917
01:12:15,101 --> 01:12:16,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

918
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:18,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Alma, can we do one more roll call with you?

919
01:12:18,822 --> 01:12:20,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like to keep you busy.

920
01:12:20,682 --> 01:12:21,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

921
01:12:22,683 --> 01:12:24,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, happy holidays.

922
01:12:25,984 --> 01:12:26,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

923
01:12:27,304 --> 01:12:27,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

924
01:12:28,684 --> 01:12:29,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

925
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:30,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

926
01:12:31,509 --> 01:12:32,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Buckley.

927
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the vote of 4-0, we are adjourned.

928
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:36,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Sergeant, is that the fastest meeting?

929
01:12:36,997 --> 01:12:37,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

930
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:38,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

931
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:43,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I win.

932
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:43,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 621.

933
01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:45,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I did beat it.

934
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,273
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you all.

935
01:12:47,373 --> 01:12:47,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

936
01:12:47,954 --> 01:12:53,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I'll see most of you, but if not, have great holidays and go slow and enjoy it.

937
01:12:53,442 --> 01:12:53,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

938
01:12:53,963 --> 01:12:54,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, everybody.
