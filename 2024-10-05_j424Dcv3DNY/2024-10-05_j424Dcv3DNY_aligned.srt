We reviewed an amended version of the draft budget ordinance presented by the administration.

30
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,922
There'll be a follow-up meeting.

31

38
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:49,337
So this was really a Q&A with counselors and any members of the public who wish to take part about the proposed zoning changes before us that are actually on the agenda tonight.

39
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:50,818
Do I have a motion?

40
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,660
Madam President, point of personal privilege.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,661
On this specific favor?

42
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,661
No, Madam President.

43
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:58,043
Can we just pass this and then we'll go to you?

44
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:58,303
So do.

45
00:01:58,363 --> 00:01:58,663
Thank you.

00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:03,807

00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:07,228
Councilor Night, point of personal privilege.

48
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,009
We can dispose of the paper first.

49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,630
You want to go through the rest?

50
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:13,931
Okay.

51
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:17,612
23-314, December 5th, 2023, Committee of the Whole on Private Ways report to follow.

52
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:27,436
This was with our DPW commissioner, as well as two land use attorneys from KP Law to answer resident questions and frequently asked questions about the private ways in Medford.

53
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:28,788
I have a motion.

54
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:29,449
Move approval.

55
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,732

56
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,452

58
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:34,634

00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:35,314
Motion passes.

60
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:40,559
22-533, December 6, 2023, the whole zoning RFP report to follow.

61
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,806
This was to discuss the long-awaited proposals on our next step in the zoning process, building on our recodification work.

62
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:54,030
We had two proposals and we left it that Vice of Affairs and I were gonna follow up on those references.

63
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,051
We had a pre,

64
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:00,060
I think we all agreed on where we wanted to go to next, and hopefully we'll have a decision on that soon.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Do I have a motion?

66
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,381
Motion.

67
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:02,881
Second.

68
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:06,402
On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Vice Chair Behrs.

69
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:07,062
All those in favor?

70
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:07,222
Aye.

71
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:08,123
All those opposed?

72
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:08,823
Motion passes.

73
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:10,143
Councilor Knight.

74
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,304
Madam President, thank you very much.

75
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:22,487
Shortly after the budget debates in late June, following 16 weeks of pregnancy, my brother and his wife gave birth to their second child, Amira.

76
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,388
And after several months of hospitalization,

77
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:32,357
She was unable to withstand the college medical procedures and was laid to rest in mid-October.

78
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:36,919
I've served on this council for a decade now.

79
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:47,783
I think my record will reflect that my first eight years of service, I missed one regular city council meeting, and that was for the birth of my second child, Brandon.

80
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:54,766
I don't think anybody in this room can say that I haven't come to these meetings prepared, ready, or able to do the work.

81
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:09,907
When I first decided to run for elected office, it was with the support of my family and the understanding that they were always going to come first.

82
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,488
That's what needed to happen during this time.

83
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:18,311
So I do regret my absence from the council during this period of time.

84
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,712
It's a very private and personal matter to both me and my family.

85
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:26,615
But quite frankly, it was something I felt like I needed to share this evening, albeit reluctantly.

86
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:34,748
I offer this not specifically of a justification for my absences, but for an explanation to the voters here in this community.

87
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:46,857
You know, I've heard the conspiracy theories and underfunded criticisms and comments made by many people in this community, and I find it necessary that I address the situation.

88
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,018
So I thank you, Madam President, for entertaining me at this time.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,280
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

90
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,021
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

91
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:54,142
Vice President Behrs.

92
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:55,703
Thank you, Madam President.

93
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:59,697
My thoughts are with you, Councillor Knight.

94
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:01,858
Motion to suspend the rules to take papers.

95
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:01,898
23-412.

96
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:02,699
Yeah.

97
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:02,739
23-464.

98
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:02,779
23-468.

99
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:02,819
23-469.

100
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:02,859
23-463.

101
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,059
And 23-467.

102
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:33,571
All right, on the motion, vices and bears suspend the rules to take those papers in that order, seconded by Councilor Carviello, I'm sorry, Councilor Scarpelli.

103
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,172
All those in favor?

104
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:34,352
Aye.

105
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:35,273
All those opposed?

106
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:36,014
Motion passes.

107
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:42,421
Okay, so 23-412 is a paper that has come before us a number of times before.

108
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,384
23-412, Adam Dash, Associates, Attorneys at Law.

109
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:51,700
regarding 12 Dell Avenue, a petition to amend deed restriction petitioners and owners, Gerald L. Alves and Janet R. Alves.

110
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:55,963
I think we've read this paper a number of times, unless council would want me to read it again.

111
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:59,806
I think we're happy to hear from the petitioner as to where we are and what's before us tonight.

112
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,069
Madam President, I'm Adam Dash 48 Grove Street.

113
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,971
Some of those with me are Gerald and Janet Alves, the petitioners.

114
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,495
I'll give you a brief update as to where we are, and then I'll ask you to bump it to the next time.

115
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:22,847
Since we last saw you, we've been working on the terms for an agreement with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability so the Council can amend the existing development restriction on the 12 Dell Avenue property.

116
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:36,959
We have the framework of an agreement whereby the Alvarez's will make a payment in lieu of providing affordable housing on site, and this will avoid all the complications we've been encountering in having an affordable unit and having the disabled son and the other family members in there.

117
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:40,529
and whether they qualify, and having to go through a lottery system.

118
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,871
And it's sort of complicated this entire situation.

119
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:55,663
And working with staff, it seems everyone's in agreement that a payment in lieu of providing the unit on site so that an affordable unit could be built somewhere else solves the Alva's problem and the city's problem all at the same time.

120
00:06:56,344 --> 00:07:01,389
So what we're working on now is two formulas which one to use to come up with the number.

121
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,641
And then secondly, when would the payments be made?

122
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,722
Because obviously, Alvarez's aren't wealthy people.

123
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,904
They would have to get these out of the sale of the units.

124
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:12,226
So those are the two bits that are still outstanding.

125
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:14,387
I think staff and I have been working on that.

126
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,030
We fully expect we'll have an actual written agreement to come with you on the 19th.

127
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:27,876
So in staff's preference was rather than have you vote at contention on coming up with an agreement tonight to go forward and just come with the agreement next time.

128
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:31,618
I just wanted to make sure that all of you got to vote on this because you've all spent time on it.

129
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:33,840
And I know not all of you will be here after the 19th.

130
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,162
So nice to have met you, although not for very long.

131
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:38,303
Thank you for your service.

132
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,844
I spent two terms on the select board at the helm.

133
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:42,485
I understand.

134
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:49,730
So with that, we would like to continue this to the 19th so we can complete the agreement with staff and then wrap this entire thing up.

135
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:54,438
Thank you, Attorney Dash, and thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Helms, for coming up to so many meetings at this point.

136
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,439
Do I have a motion?

137
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:57,962
Motion to continue to the 19th.

138
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:58,883
Thank you.

139
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,044
Seconded by Councilor Carviello.

140
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,366
Did you have something to add, Councilor?

141
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:01,866
No, no, no.

142
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:06,031
So on the motion by Supervisor Behrs to continue to the 19th, our next regular meeting, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

143
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:06,752
All those in favor?

144
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:07,192
Aye.

145
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:07,913
All those opposed?

146
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:08,654
Motion passes.

147
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:09,694
Thank you.

148
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:09,994
Thank you.

149
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:11,895
Good evening by some bears.

150
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:12,435
What?

151
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:13,756
So it's 464 next.

152
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,116
What?

153
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,516
Yeah, that's right above.

154
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,577
It's the raising canes page.

155
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:18,957
That's a little all over.

156
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:19,117
Yep.

157
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:19,297
Wait.

158
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:19,758
Oh, thank you.

159
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:29,445
Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

160
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:42,918
23464 petition to reverse sign denial for Raising Cane's LLC at premises formerly known as 760 Felsway, Medford, Mass, 02155, and now known as 519 Riverside Ave, Medford, Mass, 02155, signed permit S23000036.

161
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:48,703
I will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli, the chair of the signed subcommittee.

162
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,155
Thank you, Madam President.

163
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,816
I talked to the petitioner.

164
00:08:52,477 --> 00:09:00,043
I think that what we'll do to speed things along is we'll call for a subcommittee on a state-specific.

165
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:09,470
We're looking at January 19th at 6 o'clock prior to our 7 o'clock meeting, and we'll ask for legal representation to be present.

166

I'm just realizing that I left out of that list 23-462, which is just accepting a grant agreement.

237
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,380
Could we just add that?

238
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,481

244
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,332
23462, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding grant agreement with The Trees Medford.

00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:38,034
Dear Madam President and councillors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following order.

246
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:40,915
Order is sponsored by Burano-Window-Current Mayor.

In order authorizing a grant agreement between the city and Trees Medford.

00:13:45,195 --> 00:14:01,671
Summary, the order will authorize the mayor to enter into a grant agreement with Trees Medford in accordance with the provisions of General Law Chapter 44, Section 53A, pursuant to which Trees Medford will provide a grant of funds towards continuing efforts to create and maintain a public tree inventory for the city in consultation with the tree warden.

249
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:15,472

252
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:47,678
with respect to a public tree inventory for the city and authorizes the mayor to execute the grant agreement as attached to and incorporated in this order.

253
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:49,779
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lungocard, Mayor.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,364
Do we have a member of the trees, Medford or the commissioner, the DPW commissioners on the call?

255
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:57,544
Sorry.

256
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:11,021
Sorry.

257
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:13,944
Oh, he's in traffic.

258
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,465
We were told that meeting was over.

259
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,826
Yeah.

260
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,788
Oh, he's in the traffic meeting, not in traffic.

261
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,610
Got it.

262
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,993
Commissioner McGibbon, are you here?

263
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,221
Oh, I think he's on.

264
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:36,001
Do you see him, Mr. Clerk?

265
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:36,942
He's on the phone.

266
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:41,680
some of the participants, and then he disappeared.

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,461
Madam President, it appears to be rather self-explanatory.

268
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:50,563
I'm comfortable moving forward, absent the presentation from the administration.

269
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,144
I think we do have Commissioner McGovern.

270
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:58,606
Commissioner McGovern, is there anything you'd like to add with regards to this paper as far as the grant agreement?

271
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,168
I missed that.

272
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:03,048
I apologize.

273
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,689
I just was able to get on.

274
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,249
Can you hear me?

275
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:08,130
The sound's not coming through the speakers.

276
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:11,974
So is that a yes?

277
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:12,454
You can hear me?

278
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:13,575
Yeah, we can hear you.

279
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:14,975
Yeah.

280
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,255
OK, good.

281
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:15,956
Yep.

282
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:23,999
So this is a joint effort between the city, who won some grant money, $12,500, and Trees Medford, a nonprofit organization.

283
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,920
And they are donating $12,500 to the effort.

284
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,901
It's a tree inventory program.

285
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:38,324
It's one of the pieces of the puzzle that we need for a lot of the planning work that we're doing for our canopy.

286
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:40,245
So this is a piece of that.

287
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,393
bigger picture, tree inventory.

288
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:50,194
Hopefully that provides a little bit more background, yeah.

289
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:51,694
Thank you.

290
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,115
Any questions or discussion from the council?

291
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:02,097
On the motion of Councilor Carvillo to approve a secondary by Crisis Affairs.

292
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:05,498

294

304
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:16,553
Motion passes.

305
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:18,475

330
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,938
So unfortunately, we can't waive the three readings.

331
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,881
I think we could talk to the clerk about if there's funds to get it posted and advertised faster.

332
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,022
Thank you.

333
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,343
Any questions or discussion from the council?

334
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,600
And do I have a motion?

335
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,981
Motion to approve for first reading.

336
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:01,821
Second.

337
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:06,043
I have a motion from Vice President Behrs to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

338
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,283
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

339
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:16,507
Thank you, see you.

340
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,187
Vice President Behrs?

341
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:17,527
Yes.

342
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:18,748
Councilor Carviello?

343
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:19,028
Yes.

344
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,128
Councilor Collins?

345
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:20,508
Yes.

346
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:21,529
Councilor Knight?

347
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:21,609
Yes.

348
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,309
Councilor Scarpelli?

349
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:23,389
Yes.

350
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,990
Councilor Singh?

351
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,734
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, you're in the negative, the motion passes for first reading.

352
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:39,779
23467, I believe that's my paper, so I will go in first to the chair, so vice president Behrs.

353
00:20:56,826 --> 00:21:03,658
to 3-467 offered by President Morrell, whereas Mass General Lodge, excuse me, Chapter 71, Section 52,

354
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:27,047
places the authority for school committee compensation with the City Council and whereas the Medford School Committee is a duly elected body of at-large members elected every two years with members being paid a yearly salary of $12,000 and whereas the majority of elected members of the Medford School Committee have historically been and continue to be women and whereas the Medford City Council is a duly elected body

355
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:44,343
of at-large members elected every two years with members being paid a yearly salary of $29,359.80, and whereas the majority of elected members of the City Council have historically been and continue to be men, and whereas the ideal of equal pay for equal work

356
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:58,683
is a long-established and accepted principle in our nation, and, whereas, this ordinance would establish pay parity for all members of duly elected legislative bodies in the city, now therefore, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford

357
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:17,071
In Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved, the City's Classification and Compensation Plan, formerly included as Article 2, Section 66-31 to 66-40, be updated with the following titles and wages, effective January 1, 2024.

358
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:19,791
School committee member, $29,359.80.

359
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:26,683
School committee chair, $32,550.

360
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,485
School committee vice chair, $30,640.

361
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,526
School committee secretary, $31,760.

362
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:41,169
Further, in keeping with past practice, these wages will be paid from the Medford Schools budget and paid by the Medford Schools payroll department.

363
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,071
All right, so we're going to not do that.

364
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:45,611
Thank you.

365
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:47,452
Hold on a minute.

366
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:48,012
All right.

367
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:49,673
Are we?

368
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:50,753
Are we?

369
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:51,694
OK, thank you.

370
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:57,100
Well, all right, if we're going to disrupt, we're going to have to call a recess.

371
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,184
So I'm going to read some stuff, and then I'm going to turn it over, and we're going to have a respectful conversation.

372
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:06,748
This is an initial proposal placed on the agenda by a single member for the first time.

373
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:14,954
How this is going to go is we're going to hear from the proponent, then I will recognize the other councillors, and then we will hear from members of the public.

374
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:18,017
For the public, each person is going to have two minutes.

375
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:20,399
We have a lot of interest in this, and we need to hear from everybody.

376
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,614
And I want to make sure everybody can be heard in a reasonable amount of time.

377
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:28,197
Each person will address their comments towards me as the chair, per the rules.

378
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:32,980
As I said, there's a lot of interest, and we need to make sure everyone can be heard in a timely way.

379
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,863
I will do my best to give a 30-second warning to the two-minute time limit.

380
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,746
And your comments, again, should be directed at me.

381
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,027
This is not a back and forth.

382
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:44,528
This is not a debate with individual people.

383
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,170
We want to hear everyone's comments.

384
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,971
We want to hear them in a timely way.

385
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:53,850
I want to state I'm, as the chair, not going to issue my opinion on this.

386
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,052
I'm sure everyone here knows that they can find it somewhere else.

387
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:04,639
I do want to say, before we start, that the purview of the chair is to state facts and to address motions of order.

388
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,183
I want to put a number of three facts out there.

389
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:13,908
School committee in Medford has not received a compensation adjustment since fiscal year 2000.

390
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:17,708
In fiscal year 2000, school committee pay was $12,000 and city council pay was $13,500.

391
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,550
24 years later, school committee pay is still $12,000 and council pay is $29,359.

392
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:32,856
Those are the facts I'm going to put out.

393
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:37,779
The rest of this meeting, I'm just going to organize and make sure we have a respectful discussion.

394
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,345
I ask that we all keep the facts in mind, that we be respectful, that we don't interrupt each other, and that people please only speak when recognized by the chair.

395
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:52,530
And with that, I will go- Mr. President, I just want to reiterate the fact that- Councilor Knight, I haven't recognized you.

396
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:54,231
Do you have a motion?

397
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:54,731
I do.

398
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,293
I'd like to fact check.

399
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,574
I would like to go to-

400
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:04,805
I would like to go to the proponent, and then I will recognize counselors in order that they raise their hands and indicate to me that they would like to speak.

401
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:05,865
President Morrell.

402
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:06,926
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

403
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:11,027
So first, I'd like to amend my letter if I could, Mr. Clerk, for the record.

404
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,268
My language was not clear.

405
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:17,989
Though the school committee has largely been women for the better part of a decade, it was more evenly split before that.

406
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,711
However, my statement stands about the makeup of the city council and how hard it is for women to break in there.

407
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:28,433
Only a small number of women have ever served on the city council in Medford's history, with two more joining in January.

408
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:33,380
I would have meant to strike both references from the whereas if I could, thank you.

409
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,403
Historically, the school committee has been the only elected body where women could serve while city council remains majority men to this day.

410
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:48,626
Going back more than a hundred years ago, there've been multiple women on school committee in Medford, whereas the city council has been almost exclusively men until more recent history.

411
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:55,769
Historically, school committees have been paid less and valued less than that of city council statewide, countrywide as an accepted fact.

412
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:59,554
One reason I brought forth this resolution is to interrogate that fact.

413
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,158
School committee has many statutory powers outlined at the state level.

414
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:08,903
They play an essential role in the city, a role that's getting more involved and more complicated in the current political climate.

415
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:12,506
And like many city counselors, they're on call essentially 24 seven.

416
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:16,529
But yet this body has always been seen and continues to be seen as less than.

417
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:23,896
One reason to me comes from a conversation I've had many times with my mother, a 35 year public school teacher.

418
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:27,050
is that the school committee is an extension of the schools.

419
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,672
Schools and teaching are seen as women's work, largely because it's one of the few ways women could gain employment.

420
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:46,797
In a country where we undervalue or often do not value women's work, be it caregiving roles, aides, paras, teachers, social workers, nurses, and the like, regardless of who is serving in these roles, men or women, we do not value them in the way that we should.

421
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:50,738
This is not to equate any of these positions as they are very different.

422
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:52,659
I absolutely understand that and believe that.

423
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:59,430
But it is to note that when we undervalue work for a long time, changing the financials and the mindset around it becomes hard.

424
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,992
Simply reaching for equity of pay seems like an overreach.

425
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:07,696
Equity of opportunity is another important reason I brought this forward.

426
00:27:08,396 --> 00:27:10,237
This resolution is about who's not in the room.

427
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:17,703
I've been to many trainings and brainstorms where folks struggle with how to bring diversity of experiences and voices to the table in many, many spaces.

428
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,766
Diversity, which has been proven to make boards and organizations more successful.

429
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:25,148
It's something we struggle with here, but it's not unique to Medford.

430
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:31,814
The one answer that always comes back in these brainstorms and these thought projects is paying folks for their time.

431
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:50,869
I've spoken with many folks in Medford who want to be more involved, but it doesn't make financial sense for them to get a babysitter to attend a school committee meeting, let alone commit to multiple years of pay that barely covers the cost of childcare or loss of learnings they would need to cover regular meetings, negotiating meetings, grievances, executive sessions, and the day-to-day essential role of responding to residents.

432
00:27:51,957 --> 00:28:00,962
By saying we don't value this position, we say we don't value the insight, experiences, and representation of folks who do not have the financial support and caregiver support that is needed to give to these roles.

433
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:07,265
This excludes folks doing shift work, folks who need two jobs to get by, people without free or low cost childcare.

434
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:16,350
No one does these jobs, these elected jobs for the pay, but the lack of it certainly keeps many folks from seeking them and having a representative body.

435
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:23,084
I've been having these conversations long before I even ran for council, so I wanted to bring this forward before the end of my term.

436
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:27,292
This equity discussion is important to me, and equity delayed is equity denied.

437
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:28,455
However,

438
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:33,806
I absolutely do hear you, and I really want to thank the folks who have reached out to me on email over the past few days.

439
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:38,009
I appreciate those just willing to hear what I have to say.

440
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,050
I understand your feelings, absolutely.

441
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,772
And I know there are many folks eager to talk tonight, and I'm eager to hear from you.

442
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:57,679
So reflecting on this, I would further amend this paper that I would hope for a phase-in over time to either these amounts or amounts that reflect similar cost of living increases to the council or other city employees over the past 24 years.

443
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:02,274
nearly two and a half decades where there were no such adjustments for the school committee.

444
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:10,302
Also understanding it's the end of my term, as I did not seek reelection to spend more time with my almost two year old, a testament to the trade offs of these types of jobs.

445
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:22,053
My motion is to send this to the committee the whole so that the incoming council may consider it if they so choose and explore what they would like based on the conversations we have here tonight and ongoing conversations.

446
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:23,429
So I thank you for your time.

447
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:25,691
I thank you for your respect as I share this tonight.

448
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:30,195
I know it's a topic that people feel very, very strongly about, and I absolutely understand.

449
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:31,977
And I thank you, Mr. President.

450
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:33,759
Thank you, Madam President.

451
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:41,506
I'm gonna go just address the motion, and then I'll call Councilor Knight, Councilor Collins, and then if I see another hand, they'll go next.

452
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:45,790
But just before we get there, on the motion of President Morrell- Second.

453
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,732
To amend the

454
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:55,162
The motion, I think there were three amendments, two strikings to whereas, and then- Yeah, that has to be an amendment, yeah.

455
00:29:55,543 --> 00:30:10,010
Okay, amendments to strike whereas, two of the whereas clauses referencing majority membership based on gender, and also an amendment to consider phasing this in at a different pay amount, and to refer to Committee of the Whole.

456
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,371
Is there a second on that motion?

457
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:12,651
I think Councilor Collins.

458
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:14,392
Councilor Collins, is there a debate on that motion?

459
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:18,014
I heard Councilor Knight, and I recognize Councilor Knight at this time.

460
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:28,419
Mr. President, just on the facts, I believe you stated the school committee's salary has not increased from a figure of $12,000 per annual.

461
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:40,952
Mr. President, you did mention that the school committee's

462
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:50,714
Monetary figure may not have changed since the year 2000, but I do believe that their compensation structure has changed, which is something that's important to point out.

463
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:57,418
Previously, their compensation structure was that of a stipend, which made the position a line item budget item.

464
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:05,804
And now it's turned into a pension eligible health insurance eligible benefited position, which therefore can become

465
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,847
what would be called an unfunded pension liability.

466
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:11,349
So that's something that we also have to take a look at as we move forward.

467
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:26,283
But the pay structure did change from the way that the committee was compensated to the way they are currently compensated previously, where stipends were added and included into their salaries to raise that pay and reflect pensionable monetary gain.

468
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,607
I'm not aware of health insurance's eligibility.

469
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:34,469
I know that we were not eligible, and I don't believe that's true for the school committee either.

470
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:41,694
Point of information on that, I do believe if the mayor's in the room, she can tell us when she was on the council how she collected health insurance.

471
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,816
I'm aware that the council used to be health insurance eligible, but that changed.

472
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,757
When she became mayor and didn't need it anymore?

473
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:48,839
Well, I won't speak to that.

474
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,682
Councillor Collins.

475
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:56,978
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

476
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:03,121
Thank you, President Morrell, sorry, to the chair you're sitting in, for introducing this paper.

477
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:07,264
I thank you to everybody who's reached out over the past several days and took the time to be here tonight.

478
00:32:07,284 --> 00:32:11,426
I want to acknowledge, I know that there's a lot of engagement around this issue.

479
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,467
I know there's a lot of strong feelings about this proposal.

480
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:17,769
And I just, before I state my own thoughts, I just want to acknowledge that and thank you for being here.

481
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,370
Thank you for engaging in this process.

482
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,851
As Councilor Behrs said, this is a process.

483
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,012
This is the initial introduction.

484
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:28,660
This is what this process looks like coming up and sharing opinions and working through things together.

485
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Thank you for being here.

486
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:43,585
Want to use my time to explain my support for looking into this proposal, my support for achieving pay equity between the city council and school committee, my view on what this proposal is and what it isn't.

487
00:32:45,956 --> 00:33:05,348
I do not believe that this is in any way incompatible with what I think has been a core and shared goal of the City Council, at least in the one term that I've been a part of it, which is supporting all of our public school employees, supporting Medford Public Schools, and trying to ever improve the conditions of everybody that touches our public school systems.

488
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:08,209
The students, their families, the teachers, the paras.

489
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:15,140
all of the workers in our schools that help students and students' families thrive.

490
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,866
I do not believe that this proposal is incompatible with that shared goal whatsoever.

491
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:21,429
I think that this

492
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:31,197
the equity between the school committee and the city council is something that I've wanted to, that I've hoped to have the opportunity to vote on ever since I first took office.

493
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,638
These are two elected bodies.

494
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,998
I know how hard we work.

495
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:39,819
I have some glimmer of perspective of how hard the school committee works.

496
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:41,660
They have responsibilities that we don't.

497
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,380
I think it is outdated that our bodies are paid differently.

498
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,641
That is the core reason for my support for this proposal.

499
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:53,822
And even if it were to stop right there, that would be enough for me.

500
00:33:54,802 --> 00:34:06,407
But I see that this draws in a larger conversation about what we can and can't do in Medford, what we have and haven't done in Medford so far, especially every June during budget cycle and really all year round.

501
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:18,032
If you watch the city council meetings, if you watch the school committee meetings, we are constantly talking about the resources that are afforded to Medford public schools, the people that work in them and everybody that experiences the work that is done in those buildings.

502
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:24,155
And we are constantly in this conversation about why aren't we doing better and how can we continue to do better

503
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,824
to better value and better resource what goes on in the schools, and better value and better resource the people that do the work of the schools.

504
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:40,171
This proposal, I think, has brought up those values and those feelings and that imperative that we have to keep doing better.

505
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:46,576
What I don't believe is that this is an either-or, and what I don't believe is that this is a zero-sum game.

506
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:53,141
I know that if this proposal were to go forward even as written before amendments,

507
00:34:54,221 --> 00:35:03,488
This is not, this would not take from the same bucket of money that would otherwise go to the workers that contribute to MPS students experience.

508
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:06,290
Hang on, please.

509
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:09,832
Thank you, thank you for letting me speak.

510
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:20,540
This year, we found out that we had a 25 million sum of certified free cash, $25 million.

511
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:37,061
When we talk about what we can and can't do in Medford and what we have and haven't done, I think that we need to stay, I try to stay, laser focused on what our real opponent is.

512
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:40,204
Our real opponent is austerity budgeting.

513
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:50,533
I believe that we have the money to value the people who choose to nominate themselves for school committee and go through the process of running and seek election and serve in that role.

514
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:58,897
that we have the resources, that we can marshal the resources to do better by everybody who contributes to the Medford public school system.

515
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:01,218
We talk about it all year long.

516
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:12,363
We talk about how little authority the school committee, sorry, we talk about where the city council's authority lies and doesn't lie when it comes to making direct appropriations to our budgets, including the school budgets.

517
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:13,003
We talk about this.

518
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,524
all the time, often in great frustration.

519
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:19,806
We don't have the power to influence bargaining units here in the city council.

520
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:24,548
We don't have the authority to make appropriations whatsoever that is out of our purview.

521
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:36,194
I know, speaking for myself, there's been countless times when I wished it was in our purview, because I'm so frustrated by what I see in the line items in the budgets that we have to vote yes or no on, because that's all that we can do on those budgets.

522
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:38,935
So when it comes back to this proposal,

523
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:45,807
Due to the constraints of our jurisdiction here, this is something that we are legally allowed to vote on.

524
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:51,331
And there are many things that we will never have the opportunity to vote on, because that is not within our purview.

525
00:36:52,072 --> 00:36:58,617
When something comes in front of me that is an opportunity to discuss and interrogate, is this an opportunity to do a good thing?

526
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:00,779
I want to take that opportunity.

527
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,702
And I do not think it is in any way incompatible with continuing to do better.

528
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:09,297
in the many areas, the many school-related areas where we need to keep doing better.

529
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:11,699
It's not a zero-sum, and it's not an either-or.

530
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:26,270
I look forward to hearing the discussion tonight, and I look forward to continuing to hold ourselves accountable to do this right, and to do right by all of our public employees, and to do as many things right as we can, all at the same time.

531
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,332
And I don't think that we have to choose between one or the other.

532
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:29,112
Thank you.

533
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,474
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

534
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:32,455
Councilor Scarpelli.

535
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:34,337
Thank you.

536
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,321
Council Vice President.

537
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:46,148
I'm gonna speak as someone who no one else in this council had the opportunity to do.

538
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:51,032
That's someone that both sat on the school committee seat and in the city council seat.

539
00:37:51,833 --> 00:38:00,780
And understanding, I'll give you my opinion, then I'm gonna share a lot of emails, phone calls, conversations I've had in the last few days.

540
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,002
And I think they're very telling.

541
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:12,682
When you decide to take the chance and the responsibility of becoming an elected official, it's being elected official.

542
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,664
It's truly a position of service.

543
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:22,526
You're doing it for a reason other than the paycheck.

544
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:23,947
I've never looked at it.

545
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,872
Now, as I grew up in this city,

546
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:38,978
I took it upon myself to watch people that led the way for us.

547
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:57,288
And they gave back in service, whether it's coaching little league teams, whether it's volunteering at the food bank, whether it's joining a school committee that didn't make any money, or whether it's taking the leap to the city council, because you think you could make more of a difference.

548
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:11,455
So I generally, personally feel that understanding the process of a pay structure being a major issue, I think it's sad.

549
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:13,097
I think it's sad to look at it that way.

550
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:23,966
To think that I had one phone call that said that understanding that we can get better candidates if we pay, that's sad even to think of.

551
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:29,959
Imagine, imagine voting in people that are there for the money.

552
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,144
That's horrifically frightening to me.

553
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:42,612
As we move forward, what I found very, very glaring in this situation, the issue of gender equity in pay.

554
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:59,822
And we received a dialogue from three female school kid members that knew nothing about this, that didn't want anything to do with this vote and think that they're totally against it on the record.

555
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:03,084
There were two members that didn't reach out to me.

556
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:05,539
two members that didn't reach out.

557
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:14,282
And there were two members that I find it, it's very frightening that these two members are the catalyst behind this motion.

558
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:24,807
So let me share a few things.

559
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:31,670
As a member of the council, we had an opportunity to stand up at budget time, didn't we?

560
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,019
Didn't we?

561
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,580
We did.

562
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,062
And three of us stood up and said no.

563
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,825
But some others didn't.

564
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:52,277
I'll revert to most important thing that bothers me more than anything are the phone calls that I got from the people that work the hardest in our school district.

565
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:55,420
By the way, majority of them are women.

566
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,352
they're getting their butts kicked.

567
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:05,817
And what's glaring to this, it's something that we need to turn to our school committee members that's more important than a pay structure.

568
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:24,373
From what I've heard, and I'm sure we'll hear it tonight, that the possible legalities of lack of coverage in special needs classrooms, lack of coverage with teachers absences, lack of coverage in severely disabled classrooms, that's a problem.

569
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:34,501
So I'm glad this came up in the sense that this brings something forward.

570
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:44,407
I think the city council does more, and I think its responsibilities are far more succeeding.

571
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,350
Doesn't mean I'm better than a school kid member at all.

572
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:57,597
But our responsibilities, our charter, give us the responsibility far greater than our colleagues on the school committee.

573
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:17,705
And to be honest with you, I'll make a motion later on, whether it's tonight or another night, that since we've cut our time, I'll make the motion if equity, financial equity is serious to the issue, then I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have to.

574
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:41,617
because Mr. President, Mr. President, again, this city councilor didn't join or didn't ask their constituents to hire, to vote for me so I can make a paycheck.

575
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,558
We're not rich, we're not gonna get rich.

576
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:51,963
And when everybody ran for their office, when our school committee ran for their office, you're gonna have some candidates that are gonna be stepping in seats that are in the audience tonight.

577
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:57,207
I'm sure if you ask them, if this was a big concern in their eyes,

578
00:42:58,308 --> 00:43:02,310
they would absolutely flat say, no way, that was not the intention at all.

579
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:26,084
So I just think that this seems like there's fingerprints with only two spooky members that are pushing an agenda, and I think that this is a sad, sad day when we have unions that don't have contracts, when we have teachers that don't have coverage, and more importantly, please, more importantly, that I find frightening as a former teacher,

580
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:46,638
that I've talked to a few paraprofessionals, I have two teachers that told me straight out that we have classes, high level, low leveling functioning classes, with special need classrooms, with lack of aids, with lack of certified teachers, and they're just covering them just to have a body in the room, and that's against the law, and that our kids, they don't deserve that.

581
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:47,939
So that's the biggest issue.

582
00:43:55,919 --> 00:44:01,381
So I know this is going to be left on the next council in January.

583
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:05,203
But I think it's important that this happens.

584
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:13,087
These phone calls, these conversations, I think it's great, because I think that's the dialogue we need to move the needle where we need to move it to.

585
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,008
And I'm not going to be critical, but I will to all of you.

586
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,669
Get involved.

587
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:23,391
Don't come out just when it involves your issue, because that's what we're seeing.

588
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:24,912
And we can't do that anymore.

589
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:27,656
So thank you, Mr. President.

590
00:44:28,677 --> 00:44:30,418
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

591
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:33,701
I do want to say in 2021, we had 85 meetings.

592
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,062
That's when we had weekly meetings.

593
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:39,185
This year we had 79 meetings, so we have not cut the meetings in half.

594
00:44:39,865 --> 00:44:42,027
I will go to Councilor Seng, Councilor Carvilla.

595
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:44,789
Okay.

596
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,692
I know many of you all taught me just a few years ago.

597
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:56,486
I'm sure you'll know that I'm a fan of nuance, but that not everyone's a fan of nuance.

598
00:44:58,088 --> 00:45:00,950
And so I just wanted to preface my remarks with that.

599
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:07,056
I do actually agree with the principles of this resolution.

600
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,319
I think in execution, we need to tailor it.

601
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,400
We need to improve it.

602
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:14,843
But I do appreciate that President Morrell has

603
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:24,926
put out a proposal to address a problem that we have in our city, a can that's been kicked down the road since the year I was born.

604
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:36,127
And I understand how politically difficult it is for the president to introduce this motion and to take so much flack on it.

605
00:45:37,948 --> 00:45:41,048
It's never easy to discuss the salaries of elected officials.

606
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:44,909
And whether you agree or disagree with it,

607
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:54,472
we were always bound to have this conversation at some point, and so I do have to give President Morrell props for having the courage to bring this out.

608
00:45:55,632 --> 00:46:04,495
I also need to note that procedurally, I've heard a lot about, you know, why haven't you talked to other members of the council or other members of the school committee about it?

609
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:04,935
We do have

610
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:15,067
laws that govern how we introduce ideas, and the most transparent way to introduce an idea is to put it on the City Council agenda.

611
00:46:15,787 --> 00:46:22,235
It doesn't mean it's going to be passed tonight and it's an ordinance, so it would require three readings anyways.

612
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:32,288
But usually it's the most transparent approach because we can hear from you, we can hear whether you agree or disagree, we can send it to subcommittee and work on it even more.

613
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:35,853
And so that's procedurally how it usually works.

614
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:50,704
I did say I support the principles of this, especially given the fact that school committees being paid a wage or a salary that few in the private sector would ever pay for any job, really.

615
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:58,749
I'm sympathetic to the argument that school committees and schools in general are seen as female institutions and treated accordingly.

616
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:03,132
And in other words, there's societal expectations to lower pay outcomes.

617
00:47:03,832 --> 00:47:07,595
And this is really what the crux of the gender pay gap is.

618
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:15,558
I will say my first reaction to this resolution was, why is the school committee being paid the same as city council?

619
00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:32,125
But I had to reconsider why I even asked that question in the first place, especially given what we know as people who engage with the law, that school committee exercises, you know, city council exercises purview over city hall, which is about

620
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:37,849
two-thirds of the budget, and the school committee exercises authority over one-third of the city budget.

621
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:44,454
And in addition, state law does give the school committees many more powers and authorities that we don't have as a city council.

622
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:52,200
I do know from personal experience, whether you like the job that they're doing or you dislike the job that they're doing, they do spend a lot of hours on their job.

623
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:13,119
I think in addition to that, as a young person, as a person of color, and as a recent student of social sciences, I know from both my personal experience and from the numerous studies from top researchers that better pay for public officials does increase the quality, diversity, and experience of candidates who run for public office.

624
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:27,155
Too often, low pay doesn't justify the time that we spend being public officials, and the negativity and hostility of politics in recent years only exacerbates that problem.

625
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:35,049
Those, you know, we can, I do agree in principle that people running for office should run out of service.

626
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:53,493
And I, you know, everyone who runs does run out of service, but we can't ignore the economic reality that for people who aren't as economically well off, like students or people of color, we can't just take time out of our days to do political stuff like this instead of working another part-time job.

627
00:48:54,073 --> 00:48:56,454
It's just, it's just economic reality.

628
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:08,261
We, you know, there are experienced folks who can't justify taking on higher paying projects and research after research shows that government that pays better moves more efficiently.

629
00:49:10,968 --> 00:49:21,990
I hear a lot, and I totally agree with teachers generally, about wanting more young people to run for office, because we have more, especially for school community, because we have more recent experience at the schools.

630
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:29,232
And it's a reason why I ran for this office in the first place, because the schools, I believe, should be the number one budget issue.

631
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:35,393
And in the last few budgets, I've sat down with the mayor to negotiate millions more for our schools, successfully.

632
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:39,674
It's been the number one conversation when I walked into the office.

633
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,228
I just want to know when these discussions happen.

634
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,812
I'll recognize you after Councilor Carvio.

635
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:46,133
Thank you.

636
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:57,375
Now, okay, that being said, I am sympathetic to all the ideas in opposition to this.

637
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:09,404
I've spent a good amount of time these last few days talking to teachers, and I agree in principle that the school committee should pay, should reflect pay increases that teachers get.

638
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:21,252
Now, we should also keep in mind that the committee hasn't had an increase since 2000, and using a salary calculator, if we compare the percentage increases, this proposal is somewhere in the ballpark of

639
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:24,814
where that pay has grown in the last 25 years.

640
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,477
But, you know, that's all details.

641
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:33,641
And I think we need to have, again, nuance matters.

642
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:37,925
I think we need to have a conversation about what that looks like.

643
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:48,211
We should also keep in mind that we do face large structural challenges when it comes to problems in the city and in our schools.

644
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:54,996
I think that's obvious to everyone who goes into the schools, and I have been into the schools.

645
00:50:56,517 --> 00:51:01,821
But we have to consider amounts, and we have to consider percentages.

646
00:51:02,922 --> 00:51:04,423
This proposal takes up

647
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:13,405
0.05% of the city budget, and we have $25 million in free cash that we keep pressuring the mayor to use and spend, and she has.

648
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,725
She has spent that.

649
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:27,368
We've talked to the CFO about this, and the money does exist for it without pulling out of the budget for schools.

650
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:33,166
I think the logical trap here isn't that this isn't an either or situation, it's a yes and.

651
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:40,409
I think this brings me to maybe the most pressing point for me, why I would be amenable to an idea like this.

652
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:47,433
And it's not really any of the reasons listed in the whereas section of this resolution.

653
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:54,756
It's because I'm a strong believer that government should push ourselves to make better decisions in the future.

654
00:51:55,917 --> 00:52:04,244
make decisions now that put us in tougher positions in the future, that force our hand and make us, that force us to make better decisions.

655
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:18,436
I think when we send this to committee, I think we can craft a good deal that's better in execution, but also pushes us in a political direction where we have to accept demands for better for our teachers in Paris.

656
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:22,249
It's a little bit different thinking.

657
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:26,253
It's not a reason I've heard online or from anyone in the last few days.

658
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:34,661
But that's how I see the political picture of this, is this forces the city government to be more accountable to our teachers and paraprofessionals.

659
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:49,999
I think, again, considering all these principles makes me sympathetic to this resolution, but I do think that there can be tinkering done in committee, and that's why I'm particularly grateful.

660
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:53,722
that President Morrell amended her paper before introducing it to us.

661
00:52:55,123 --> 00:53:08,873
I think it would be especially reasonable to discuss changes in timing or phasing in, even though, again, the money that we need to solve large structural challenges citywide in our schools far exceeds the amount that's proposed.

662
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:18,640
Do you think it would be prudent to phase this in as we get more information about the greater financial picture with the FY25 budget and with the new budget ordinance that we're

663
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,161
intent on passing soon.

664
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:24,842
That way, we can make sure that this is additive and not subtractive.

665
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:25,463
Thank you.

666
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:27,863
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

667
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:28,724
Councilor Carviello.

668
00:53:29,264 --> 00:53:29,984
Thank you, Mr. President.

669
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:33,085
I, for one, never ran for this job for the money.

670
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,306
I never considered it a part-time job.

671
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:39,808
I think considering this, running for this as a job, is insulting to me.

672
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:48,602
Because I ran for the last 12 years for community service and for the goodness of the community, not for the money.

673
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:03,931
For those who don't know, when I first got elected to the council, former councilor Pintus here, the pay was $22,000.

674
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:07,193
And we used to get a stipend for expenses.

675
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:09,314
And somewhere along the line,

676
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:13,551
They changed the stipend and they ran it into the pay.

677
00:54:13,692 --> 00:54:17,254
That's what brought the pay up to the $28,000.

678
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:20,317
But the original salary when I ran was $22,000.

679
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:25,881
So let people know, we didn't get a raise.

680
00:54:25,941 --> 00:54:29,404
No one voted us a raise of that money to get us up to that amount.

681
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:33,908
So I think that was maybe eight, nine years ago when that happened.

682
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:40,969
I'm here because I sat here for the last 12 years because I wanted to be here.

683
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:42,489
I'm not here for the money.

684
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,691
Most of the money that I make, I donate back to the community.

685
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:47,132
I'm involved in the community.

686
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:52,896
I'm involved in a small community, then everybody in this whole council together on different boards, commissions, and groups.

687
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:59,240
So if anyone that ever sat here for the money, sadly mistaken.

688
00:55:01,192 --> 00:55:09,796
I'm gonna support Councilor Scott Pelly's motion to drop our pay down to the pay of the school committee.

689
00:55:10,537 --> 00:55:25,524
If everybody wants to be fair and equitable, and I was one of the votes when we changed to the twice a month meetings, I supported cutting our pay in half also then, and I'm gonna support it again tonight.

690
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:29,586
That's where this councilor stands and will always stand.

691
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:39,750
Mr. President, thank you very much.

692
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:44,194
Must have some English teachers in the room today.

693
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:45,815
Fiction, maybe a little fiction.

694
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,316
There's some fiction going on here tonight.

695
00:55:48,197 --> 00:55:50,018
You know, it's a good story.

696
00:55:51,319 --> 00:56:00,507
But to me, being the cynic that I am, it does somewhat sound like a money grab for the faces that I share in campaign literature.

697
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:05,579
You run as a slate, and then the first thing you do is move to give raises.

698
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:17,382
I think that presents a questionable standard of ethics that the next council is going to have to deal with.

699
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:20,463
And I don't think it's fair to them that they're going to be put in that position.

700
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:26,145
When looking at the paper on face value, the paper is contrary to law.

701
00:56:27,643 --> 00:56:38,971
Um, you know, we look at MGL section 71 chapter 71 section 53 as the enabling language to give the city council the authority to issue raises.

702
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:54,601
But if you look what that section of the general law says, um, in its first line, it says the school committee shall serve without compensation, but they may be compensated for this services by a majority vote of the city council.

703
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:56,963
This has already been done.

704
00:56:58,851 --> 00:56:59,792
This has already been done.

705
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:12,583
The language in the general laws that speaks to salary adjustments is governed under Chapter 44, Section 33A.

706
00:57:14,284 --> 00:57:23,752
And this section clearly reads that the annual budget shall include the sum sufficient to pay the salaries of all officers and employees, fixed by law or witness.

707
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:27,275
Our budget's passed, and these figures are not included in that budget.

708
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:50,152
The section also reads, no new position shall be created or an increase in any rate made by ordinance, vote, or appointment during the financial year subsequent to the submission of the annual budget, unless provision, therefore, has been made by means of a supplemental appropriation.

709
00:57:51,392 --> 00:57:59,655
Without a money paper, we can't change the ordinance based on state law in my reading, which is a question for

710
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:03,445
the ever so invisible and elusive city solicitor.

711
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,330
I thank the council president for entertaining me.

712
00:58:14,832 --> 00:58:17,873
Included in our packets this evening were a series of amendments that I have offered.

713
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:24,317
In response to this paper, I would spare the chairman the

714
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:43,726
long duration of having to read through it and motion that it be included as part of this paper going forward and hope that the new city council and their divine wisdom acts in the best interest of this community.

715
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:53,751
We hear a lot of talk about a revenue crisis, the need for the city of Medford to raise more revenue

716
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,752
the need for a Proposition 2.5 override.

717
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:07,554
And when this issue came up previously, there was some discussion about whether or not it was really a revenue crisis or a spending problem.

718
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:17,057
And I think that when we look at a paper like this, I think that it shows that we do have a little bit of a spending problem.

719
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:22,898
And a solution to hard decisions a lot of the time is to throw money at it.

720
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:28,415
And that does not fix systemic problems and issues.

721
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:40,186
So with that being said, I do thank my council colleague for the time and do ask that the paper be included by way of a motion to waive the reading and include.

722
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:45,371
Is the proponent of the paper amenable to including those questions as an amendment?

723
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:45,511
Sure.

724
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:46,953
Great.

725
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,155
So Councillor Knight's papers will be referred

726
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:51,253
under the motion to Committee of the Whole.

727
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:54,516
If it passes, to the Committee of the Whole for further discussion along with the paper.

728
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:56,718
Any further discussion by members of the Council?

729
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,822
Seeing none, we will go to members of the public.

730
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:02,063
I will alternate between

731
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:05,078
in person, in public, and Zoom.

732
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:08,121
If you are on Zoom, please raise your hand.

733
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:10,723
If you are a member of the public, please stand in line.

734
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:13,765
If you do not want to stand in line, try to grab a seat.

735
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:16,707
I think we all will respect not cutting or cutting.

736
01:00:17,307 --> 01:00:19,629
Again, we're going to do two minutes per person.

737
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:23,492
I would like everyone to please provide their name and address for the record.

738
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:25,634
And we will start with the person at the chair.

739
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:27,175
Please provide your name and address for the record.

740
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:28,916
And I will give you a 30-second warning.

741
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,537
My name is Maureen Lavin.

742
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:31,598
I live in Stoneham.

743
01:00:32,381 --> 01:00:33,962
I was born and raised in Medford.

744
01:00:34,742 --> 01:00:37,423
I am a Medford public school teacher.

745
01:00:38,603 --> 01:00:40,844
And I had no intention of speaking this evening.

746
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:48,047
I'm going to just give you a few bullet points of things to consider.

747
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:55,529
One, our paraprofessionals make $17,000 a year.

748
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:56,610
They work full time.

749
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,958
with our most at need students full time.

750
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:13,448
Some of their pay is beyond that, but there are some people that are trying to make a living off of making $17,000 a year.

751
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:17,352
That is ridiculous to me, okay?

752
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:22,798
The teachers have been without a contract

753
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:26,945
How long did we go, a year and a half or so without a contract?

754
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:42,089
So if the school committee would like a raise, maybe they should hold signs out front during city council meetings.

755
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:44,430
And beg for a 3% raise.

756
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,771
It's ridiculous to me that we're having this conversation.

757
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:51,652
We have been threatened

758
01:01:52,768 --> 01:02:01,531
by our current central administration of job cuts, upward of 30 teaching positions are at risk of being cut.

759
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,051
30 seconds left.

760
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:05,012
Well, you guys had more than two minutes, so.

761
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:08,093
I just ask you to respect the rules.

762
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:08,473
Thank you.

763
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:13,775
And my position at the high school got cut.

764
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:18,497
I am the only female physical education teacher at Medford High School.

765
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:21,207
So you want to talk about gender issues.

766
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:29,797
There's not a co-ed public high school in the universe that doesn't have a male and a female physical education teacher.

767
01:02:30,657 --> 01:02:32,540
I got moved down to the middle school, which is great.

768
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,861
I love the Andrews Middle School.

769
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:39,828
But we have left our high school without a female physical education teacher, which means

770
01:02:41,055 --> 01:02:44,378
There's no one to oversee the locker room, the safety of the locker room.

771
01:02:44,418 --> 01:02:47,420
We know bathrooms have violence in them.

772
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,422
We have it documented in the high school.

773
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:55,706
If you've been into the women's locker room in Bedford High School, it's bigger than I don't know.

774
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,508
It's probably three times the size of this room.

775
01:02:58,829 --> 01:03:00,190
So gender equity.

776
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,411
Yeah, I have an issue with that.

777
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,593
This is, I believe, is a Title nine violation.

778
01:03:03,633 --> 01:03:06,495
So I don't know how to register that, but that needs to be brought up.

779
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:12,537
boys and girls should both have equal access to locker rooms, right?

780
01:03:12,637 --> 01:03:14,037
It's just no brainer.

781
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:22,481
But if the school committee would like a raise, then maybe three, let's start with 3%.

782
01:03:22,521 --> 01:03:24,901
140% seems mind blowing to me.

783
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:28,303
Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.

784
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:39,260
I'm going to Anne-Marie Cuneo on Zoom.

785
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:40,781
Say it again?

786
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:42,482
I'm going to Zoom, Anne-Marie Cuneo.

787
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:43,542
You can unmute.

788
01:03:43,562 --> 01:03:51,026
I'm going to ask you to unmute again.

789
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:13,417
just waiting on unmute.

790
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,279
All I can do is ask you to unmute.

791
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:16,460
I can't unmute you myself.

792
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:26,248
Okay.

793
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:29,151
Name and address for the record, please.

794
01:04:30,092 --> 01:04:30,432
Thank you.

795
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:31,373
So we can hear from everyone.

796
01:04:31,393 --> 01:04:32,013
There's a long line.

797
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:32,254
Okay.

798
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:36,844
So I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha.

799
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:44,547
I'm a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

800
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:53,831
I'm going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caviello and Councilor Knight have said.

801
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:56,792
But let's call this what it is.

802
01:04:56,812 --> 01:05:01,275
I am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest.

803
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:05,257
And that is, this is not a gender issue.

804
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:07,359
This is a power issue.

805
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:19,646
And the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what

806
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:41,989
You know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget?

807
01:05:43,075 --> 01:05:48,344
No, I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million.

808
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:52,190
$25 million could be used and utilized in so many more things.

809
01:05:53,226 --> 01:05:58,709
than just the school committee increase or a school committee increase.

810
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:13,758
And again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind

811
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:25,609
the chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary.

812
01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:28,692
They're also the same people that said.

813
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:36,971
They are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs.

814
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:44,358
We had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall.

815
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:45,659
This is the same.

816
01:06:47,071 --> 01:07:16,831
Board committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their

817
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:20,414
opportunity to speak what they want.

818
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:25,019
Point of information, it's the way Zoom works, there's like a lot of sound, it cuts out.

819
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,164
Zoom prevents loud disruptions so that people's speakers don't get blown out on their computers or their phones.

820
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:32,526
So when you clap, it stops it.

821
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,189
Silence is the whole thing.

822
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:37,371
That's not a Zach against George thing.

823
01:07:41,694 --> 01:07:51,322
Okay, I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person.

824
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:52,743
I would definitely want to be there but

825
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:57,186
I have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half.

826
01:07:57,746 --> 01:08:03,830
So with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise.

827
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,692
And if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%.

828
01:08:08,913 --> 01:08:14,516
Give them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for.

829
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:19,759
If we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.

830
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,201
Thank you, Anne-Marie.

831
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:28,610
I'm going to go to the podium.

832
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,651
Mr. Penta, name and address for the record, please.

833
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:31,251
You have two minutes.

834
01:08:31,271 --> 01:08:33,112
I have a two-page statement.

835
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:33,872
Okay.

836
01:08:33,992 --> 01:08:39,555
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this August party on the City Council.

837
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:51,220
Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, does grant to the City Council, by a majority vote and by the city charter, the responsibility of how much members of the school committee get paid.

838
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:59,165
But historically, the city council has paid more than the city school committee because the council's responsibilities exceed those of the school committee.

839
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:13,214
The city council responsibilities include, but are not limited to enacting ordinances, zoning, fire and police, public safety requirements, setting the city's tax rate, and has the final authority over the city and school department budget.

840
01:09:13,895 --> 01:09:21,540
As examples of major differences between one challenging equal pay for equal work between the city council and the school committee.

841
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:27,603
Further, just as in any business, job responsibilities and pay are what one is applying for.

842
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:35,268
Under this proposal, it is a gender attack being disguised as pay parity, for equal pay for equal work, for which it is not.

843
01:09:36,008 --> 01:09:41,371
The proposed school department 100% plus pay increase will be paid from the Meffitt Public Schools.

844
01:09:41,952 --> 01:09:43,333
Let's take a look at what that means.

845
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:49,541
Annually, we are barely able to meet the resources we have now at our school's disposal.

846
01:09:50,282 --> 01:10:00,596
If we cut further any of our school resources by not funding them, and instead giving them 100% plus salary increase for school committee members, we should be concerned as to where we are heading.

847
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:10,485
If we are to cut some $90,000, because that's what it'll come to, plus each year from going forward from the school department budget, the results can possibly affect the following.

848
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:13,167
Fewer instructional hours for students.

849
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:15,329
Elimination of AP classes.

850
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,091
Increased class sizes.

851
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:19,433
Elimination of some athletic programming.

852
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:22,235
Elimination of support for some school activities.

853
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,257
Elimination of school librarians.

854
01:10:24,297 --> 01:10:25,398
Mr. Penty, you have 30 seconds.

855
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:28,929
I think the rules say five minutes if you check the council rules.

856
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:44,243
Reductions in council services, school security being at risk, reduced custodial cleaning and maintenance, after school programming, migrant student education support, and unbeing prepared for migrant student educational support.

857
01:10:44,904 --> 01:10:48,826
I meant the public schools short and long range term should not be subject to this.

858
01:10:49,387 --> 01:10:56,491
And if the school committee pay increase does go through, what do you say about the salary for the everyday school paraprofessionals?

859
01:10:57,051 --> 01:11:00,973
As example, every class assistant under five years would finally earn $30,000.

860
01:11:01,593 --> 01:11:05,716
And everyday kindergarten teachers after five years would only earn $25,980.

861
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:20,132
This after five years, while the school committee would receive $29,000 annually for a part time job with no everyday reporting requirements and responsibilities is at best.

862
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:35,124
If the city council is to accept this ridiculous proposal, maybe the council should then set a pay scale standard for both the city council and the school committee for years of service as compared to pay scales a standard for just every other municipal employee.

863
01:11:36,577 --> 01:11:49,784
Using the presently proposed gender issue of females being more in number who are elected to serve is not only discriminatory, but a sexist allegation that has no merit.

864
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:53,165
And what about a person who claims to be other?

865
01:11:53,525 --> 01:11:58,328
And what about when trends tend to go back to when men become more elected than women?

866
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:06,195
Being elected is a gender neutral opportunity, not to be disguised as pay parity for equal pay for equal work.

867
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:12,100
As I said in the beginning, job responsibilities and pay are the guidelines for which one is applying for.

868
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:20,347
As of this meeting, there has been no input from community members on the Memphis School Committee regarding this 100 plus salary increase.

869
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:43,126
As a thought, and this flows right into what you said Councilor Scarpelli, if the council is so inclined to accept this measure of allowing this red herring issue of more females than males being elected officials, then maybe in the spirit of physical conservatism and the council being magnanimous, the council should entertain

870
01:12:43,806 --> 01:12:49,887
being paid the same $12,000, as we said before, annual salary that the school committee is currently paid.

871
01:12:50,447 --> 01:13:07,691
Therefore, on the city side, if the city can save $90,000 annually from their city council salary, which can be used for municipal needs, the school department, one sentence, the school department will not lose the $90,000 annually that can go to public school education.

872
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:08,171
Thank you.

873
01:13:11,072 --> 01:13:11,512
One sentence.

874
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:15,587
Mr. Penta, I just gave you an incredible deference, thank you for your time.

875
01:13:15,627 --> 01:13:17,448
I wanna close by saying my following sentence.

876
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:19,908
Mr. Penta, Mr. Penta.

877
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:20,288
What?

878
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:21,169
Please.

879
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:22,529
Why, hey, wait a minute.

880
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,430
I'm asking you to respect everybody's time here.

881
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,910
Okay, so if you have to- We have rules.

882
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,671
Why are you exempt from the rules, Mr. Penta?

883
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:31,012
Let me ask you a serious question.

884
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:39,954
I served on this board for 36 years, and we stayed here sometimes till 12 and one o'clock in the morning to let everybody speak, not to be shut off.

885
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:41,395
I'm letting everybody speak, thank you.

886
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:43,439
I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

887
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:44,561
Eileen, you're recognized.

888
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:45,864
Mr. Penza, please, thank you.

889
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:46,726
Thank you for your time.

890
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:49,151
I want to make my last sentence.

891
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:49,532
Do you mind?

892
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:50,093
Save the sentence.

893
01:13:50,414 --> 01:13:50,995
No, I might.

894
01:13:51,075 --> 01:13:51,156
OK.

895
01:13:52,355 --> 01:14:01,140
I shall close by saying, why did the city council president put this controversial proposal on the agenda now?

896
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,822
Was it because of the busy Christmas season and it being at the end of the year?

897
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,924
With the hopes that nobody would observe it and find out.

898
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:09,785
But they did.

899
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:10,385
But they did.

900
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:12,646
It was not, but thank you.

901
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:15,388
Eileen, name and address for the record, please.

902
01:14:17,188 --> 01:14:25,036
Okay, so my name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, Mass., and I support the proposal.

903
01:14:26,037 --> 01:14:30,702
I think that $29,000 is a part-time salary.

904
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:36,167
How could anyone survive on $29,000 in Medford?

905
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:39,330
It just doesn't make sense to me.

906
01:14:40,131 --> 01:14:46,754
And I do recognize that we need to pay so many people in our school system more money.

907
01:14:47,535 --> 01:14:53,958
It's absolutely clear that we need more employees and we need to pay the ones that are there more.

908
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:58,360
And it's an injustice that they're not getting what they deserve.

909
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:04,263
But I don't think that creating more injustice makes for justice.

910
01:15:04,863 --> 01:15:07,485
Two injustices doesn't make justice.

911
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:08,885
And I think that

912
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:18,343
you know, to say that anybody is working for the money, just because they're going to get $29,000 is ridiculous.

913
01:15:18,443 --> 01:15:20,204
That's such a little sum of money.

914
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:27,289
And we've just found out this lot of money that can pay for it and hopefully for more than that.

915
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,712
And I'd like to see everybody.

916
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:33,213
Thank you.

917
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:36,776
Thank you.

918
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:38,077
Thank you for your time.

919
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,088
Again, I would just ask everyone to respect everyone who's speaking.

920
01:15:43,108 --> 01:15:44,088
We're hearing from everyone.

921
01:15:44,688 --> 01:15:48,229
As I noted, there are a lot of people who want to speak, and that's the reason there's a time limit.

922
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:50,669
I ask everyone to respect it, regardless of who they are.

923
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:51,709
Ms.

924
01:15:51,729 --> 01:15:52,149
Brandly.

925
01:15:52,169 --> 01:15:53,690
Hello.

926
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,750
Please name and address for the record.

927
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,350
Two minutes.

928
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:58,291
I'll give you a warning, and I'm giving a little leeway here.

929
01:15:58,331 --> 01:15:58,671
Thank you.

930
01:15:59,011 --> 01:15:59,391
All right.

931
01:15:59,471 --> 01:15:59,751
Got it.

932
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:02,351
So you put me in a tricky position.

933
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:03,872
I'm Nicole Brandly.

934
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:05,412
I'm at 54 Norwich Circle.

935
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:10,666
And as a newly elected school committee member, I questioned if I should speak tonight.

936
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:13,807
I feel like I'm torn between everybody, right?

937
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:17,868
So as always, I also know I couldn't stay quiet.

938
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:23,470
So I look over the agendas for both our city council and our school committee as they become available.

939
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:30,172
And when I read the city council agenda last week, I was shocked at the pay increase.

940
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,413
There's been a lot of accusation on social media that

941
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:36,009
newly elected members are somehow pushing for this.

942
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:37,049
I had no idea.

943
01:16:39,231 --> 01:16:43,794
I actually had to read the proposal twice.

944
01:16:44,794 --> 01:16:46,495
And then I asked someone else to read it for me.

945
01:16:47,996 --> 01:16:51,759
I did not run for the school committee seat for the salary.

946
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:54,320
Although I do appreciate the salary.

947
01:16:55,441 --> 01:17:01,725
But if you've seen me up at this podium over the last year, you know my motivation and surely where my heart is.

948
01:17:02,987 --> 01:17:07,090
I'm the only person in this city, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, I'm sure they will somewhere.

949
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:16,396
I'm the only person in this city who can say that I've been elected to a school committee seat, but have also worked at the city of Medford as a kindergarten aide.

950
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:28,189
So I held that beloved position for six years, and according to my W-2s, because I'm a good record keeper, in 2020, for my 180-day full-time position, I earned $17,642.93.

951
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,070
I left that position.

952
01:17:39,895 --> 01:17:43,437
because it is a not fair living wage, and it's still not.

953
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:48,160
And like too many unions in this city, we also had no contract at the time.

954
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:56,746
I've sat at most of these meetings, whether it's for good reason or bad, and George's, Mr. Scarpelli's right, we have to come all the time.

955
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:07,873
I've sat here and watched all of these unions sit here in solidarity with each other, asking for contracts, asking for a fair living wage, for their rightfully earned COVID pay,

956
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:13,489
There are still unions in this city negotiating their contracts, most namely the police.

957
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:20,775
As a newly elected official, I believe the $17,359.80 pay increase for us on this school committee is fiscally irresponsible.

958
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,262
our current 30 more seconds.

959
01:18:29,342 --> 01:18:31,423
Okay, our start our current stipend is fair.

960
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:35,966
And although not equivalent to you on the city council, I'm not sure it really should be.

961
01:18:35,986 --> 01:18:43,631
I don't think anyone would begrudge the school committee a fair living wage increase like other unions in the city have agreed on.

962
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,933
But this proposed increase is exorbitant.

963
01:18:46,113 --> 01:18:48,875
It's not in line with the increases anybody else has gotten in the city.

964
01:18:49,736 --> 01:18:57,301
And I have sat right here in this room listening to the budget hearings and never once have I heard that we have any extra money, especially in our school budget.

965
01:18:58,221 --> 01:19:08,307
I also think this proposal itself causes even more animosity between elected officials, like all of us, and the same people that voted us in to do the right thing.

966
01:19:09,348 --> 01:19:10,549
So let's do the right thing.

967
01:19:10,569 --> 01:19:11,589
Thank you.

968
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:12,090
Thank you, Ms.

969
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,350
Framley.

970
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:18,333
And thank you for your respect for the rules.

971
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:22,596
I'm going to go to Christina McGordy on Zoom, and then I'll come back to you, Mr. D'Antonio.

972
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:29,124
Hi, I'm Christina McGordy, 24 North Street.

973
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:33,246
I just wanted to say, and I'll try and keep it brief.

974
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:39,209
Since I learned about this proposal, I've kind of had a lot of back and forth emotions.

975
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:45,952
My first initial reaction was just sort of like, well, we don't have the money for that.

976
01:19:46,693 --> 01:19:53,076
But after hearing the thoughtful discussion behind where it came from, I definitely

977
01:19:54,406 --> 01:19:58,490
I definitely appreciate and agree with the spirit behind this.

978
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:09,179
And for the people who say that being an elected official is, you do it, you don't do it for the money, you do it because you want to provide service, like, of course.

979
01:20:09,339 --> 01:20:14,904
But it also comes from a place of privilege because you are able to do it.

980
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:20,669
And I say that as someone who is able to not work and pretty much volunteers 100% of my time.

981
01:20:22,811 --> 01:20:30,399
I do it because I want to do it, but I also know that I'm in a unique position from a lot of other people who can't do it.

982
01:20:31,401 --> 01:20:42,353
So I think it is important to think about increasing the pay because like as people have stated, it will help us to get more diversity and we need that on our

983
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:44,535
representative bodies.

984
01:20:45,136 --> 01:21:01,793
But I also want to say that as a parent of two kids, as someone who started subbing because there were zero subs at our school, I just, I want to obviously make sure everyone is thinking about

985
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:06,898
you know, equal, fair pay for everyone.

986
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,661
We pay our subs $90 a day.

987
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:13,606
That is much less than they pay in surrounding communities.

988
01:21:14,106 --> 01:21:22,395
I know there's shortages everywhere, but how can we get people to come work and cover when, you know, we don't pay as much.

989
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:24,957
So it's just sort of like, I just want to say that.

990
01:21:26,118 --> 01:21:27,178
just to put out there.

991
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:32,680
I like the idea where it was, you know, Nicole mentioned doing it in, or Ms.

992
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:36,301
Morrell said something about doing it in a phased approach.

993
01:21:37,001 --> 01:21:43,063
And if we have this like extra free money, I would love to hear that.

994
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:53,106
Okay, they're able to increase the paraprofessional pay and the sub pay so that everyone feels like they're getting compensation for their work.

995
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,547
But okay, thank you.

996
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:55,027
That's all.

997
01:21:56,305 --> 01:21:57,147
Thank you for your time.

998
01:21:57,327 --> 01:21:58,128
I'll go to the podium.

999
01:21:58,168 --> 01:21:59,170
Mr. D'Antonio.

1000
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,471
Thank you.

1001
01:21:59,691 --> 01:22:00,713
Name and address for the record, please.

1002
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:03,618
My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue in Medford.

1003
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,803
I brought the wrong damn glasses today.

1004
01:22:07,145 --> 01:22:09,269
Anyway, here's my take on this whole thing.

1005
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:15,989
Financial integrity in politics, especially within the role of a city councilor, stands as a cornerstone of ethical governance.

1006
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:26,056
The significance of maintaining an unwavering financial integrity cannot be overstated as it forms the bedrock of trust, transparency, and accountability within the realm of public service.

1007
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:35,043
At its core, financial integrity in politics embodies a commitment to honesty, responsibility, and ethical behavior in handling public funds and resources.

1008
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:43,483
As a city councilor, one assumes the crucial responsibility of managing taxpayer money and making decisions that directly impact the community's well-being.

1009
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:52,415
This trust bestowed upon the Council necessitates the highest level of ethical conduct, particularly in financial matters.

1010
01:22:52,915 --> 01:22:56,438
The ramifications of financial impropriety can be severe and far-reaching.

1011
01:22:57,018 --> 01:23:05,464
Misuse or mismanagement of public funds not only undermines the public's confidence in their elected official, but also erodes the foundations of democracy itself.

1012
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:14,510
It jeopardizes the credibility of the Council and the entire institution of governance, casting doubt on the motives and intentions behind policy decisions.

1013
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:20,312
Maintaining financial integrity as a city councilor goes beyond adhering to legal statutes.

1014
01:23:20,472 --> 01:23:22,633
It embodies a commitment to ethical leadership.

1015
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:30,116
Transparency in financial dealings, proper allocation of resources, and rigorous accountability measures are imperative.

1016
01:23:30,656 --> 01:23:39,240
Striving for transparency ensures that constituents are aware of how their tax dollars are utilized, fostering trust and credibility in the council's decisions.

1017
01:23:42,128 --> 01:23:46,411
Integrity in financial matters also extends to ethical fundraising and campaign finance.

1018
01:23:46,951 --> 01:23:51,714
Ultimately, financial integrity is the linchpin that upholds a councilor's ethical compass.

1019
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:58,358
It forms the basis for sound decision-making, fosters public trust, and strengthens the democratic process.

1020
01:23:58,878 --> 01:24:08,644
As a city councilor, embracing and championing financial integrity isn't just a duty, it's a commitment to serve the public interest with honor, honesty, and unwavering ethical standards.

1021
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:09,084
Thank you.

1022
01:24:09,977 --> 01:24:11,058
Thank you, Mr. D'Antonio.

1023
01:24:11,078 --> 01:24:11,538
Mr. President.

1024
01:24:11,598 --> 01:24:13,419
Mr. President, if I can.

1025
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,060
Just one second.

1026
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,840
Mr. Sharpell.

1027
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,181
Just a point of information.

1028
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:22,084
There's a comment that's out that there's $25 million we can spend.

1029
01:24:22,965 --> 01:24:23,585
That's not true.

1030
01:24:23,745 --> 01:24:24,066
It's not.

1031
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,467
There isn't $25 million.

1032
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:27,648
I'm not trying to debate.

1033
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,670
It was something that was in our free cash.

1034
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,011
It's not like it's still there and that we have to use it.

1035
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:33,571
It's not.

1036
01:24:34,012 --> 01:24:34,452
That's not.

1037
01:24:34,672 --> 01:24:36,633
Just a point of clarification.

1038
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:39,115
The free cash reserves are currently at $25 million.

1039
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:41,536
Until they're certified, they can't even be appropriated.

1040
01:24:42,137 --> 01:24:44,378
Just one moment, we have someone on Zoom, and then I'll come back to the podium.

1041
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:54,004
Kathy Kretz, school committee member on Zoom, I just asked you to unmute, and I'll just ask for your name and address, and then you'll have two minutes.

1042
01:24:56,277 --> 01:24:57,318
Yes.

1043
01:24:57,338 --> 01:24:59,642
Hi, my name is Kathy Kretz.

1044
01:24:59,822 --> 01:25:02,405
I live at 391 Fulton Street, Medford.

1045
01:25:03,387 --> 01:25:04,808
Sorry, I can't be there tonight.

1046
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:07,132
I had something going on here at the house.

1047
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:11,237
Yep, so I just wanted to, you know, kind

1048
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:22,783
to set something clear is, you know, the first time as a school committee member that I heard about this raise was by reading it on the city council agenda.

1049
01:25:23,303 --> 01:25:32,308
This was not something that the school committee discussed or even received any communications from the city council on.

1050
01:25:33,289 --> 01:25:36,450
We were, you know, in my own personal opinion,

1051
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:39,413
We're not even thinking about a raise.

1052
01:25:40,013 --> 01:25:41,955
This wasn't even something we were discussing.

1053
01:25:43,516 --> 01:25:50,542
In eight years that I've been on school committee, at one point, there was a raise discussed years ago.

1054
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,103
This was before COVID.

1055
01:25:52,704 --> 01:26:05,655
And we declined, voted it down, because we wanted to make sure that if there was any additional funds, it went to the school budget, to the teachers, to the students, and the needs of the schools.

1056
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:12,780
And if there's any additional money, which there isn't, it should go directly to the schools.

1057
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,762
It should go to the needs of the students and the teachers.

1058
01:26:17,763 --> 01:26:23,467
You know, I've heard from, you know, a lot of the members that have spoken tonight and the community has come out.

1059
01:26:24,147 --> 01:26:35,935
And, you know, I totally agree that if there's extra money, this extra money for salaries should go to the parents to raise their salaries, not the school committee members.

1060
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:45,464
Our job is a volunteer job, and I've been doing it for eight years, not expecting any pay.

1061
01:26:45,904 --> 01:27:00,497
It requires dedication, love, commitment, just being there to hear and understand and listen to the needs of everybody in the community, the teachers, the students, the families, caregivers.

1062
01:27:01,278 --> 01:27:02,439
It's not about the salary.

1063
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:05,442
I was confused about the resolution.

1064
01:27:05,622 --> 01:27:06,824
Where did they come from?

1065
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:09,847
Who did they speak to?

1066
01:27:09,867 --> 01:27:11,428
I was really confused.

1067
01:27:11,488 --> 01:27:16,133
And I just want to set it clear that the school committee did not have any meetings.

1068
01:27:16,473 --> 01:27:18,675
We were not talking about raising our salary.

1069
01:27:19,096 --> 01:27:20,977
And I'm talking from my own personal opinion.

1070
01:27:21,017 --> 01:27:22,098
Nobody's reached out to me.

1071
01:27:22,839 --> 01:27:24,300
It was not a thought in my mind.

1072
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:30,022
I was surprised and confused and disheartened by the resolution.

1073
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:33,664
It was just something that we're not expecting.

1074
01:27:33,884 --> 01:27:38,306
And I did hear, I got into the meeting late, but I did hear

1075
01:27:39,326 --> 01:27:46,850
Rick Caviello, Councilor Caviello mentioned that a pay cut in their salaries to make the salaries equal.

1076
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:57,997
You know, I think that would be the best way to make the salaries equal across the two different, you know, boards between the school committee and the city council.

1077
01:27:58,517 --> 01:28:06,381
If there's going to be any changes, then maybe a decrease in the salary to bring the councilor salary back down to the school committee salary.

1078
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:24,227
Okay, so I got my point across and I wasn't prepared and ready to speak, but I just hope that I made it clear that I object to this resolution and I hope and I pray that it does not pass tonight.

1079
01:28:24,907 --> 01:28:26,308
And thank you for your time.

1080
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:27,248
Thank you, everybody.

1081
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,949
Thank you, Kathy.

1082
01:28:29,989 --> 01:28:30,809
Thank you for speaking.

1083
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:32,450
Just one second.

1084
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:34,190
Kathy brings up a good point.

1085
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,111
People may have come into the room or joined.

1086
01:28:36,596 --> 01:28:37,757
since the motions were made.

1087
01:28:37,797 --> 01:28:42,779
But the current motion on the floor is amendments from President Morrell and Councilor Knight.

1088
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,440
Councilor Knight's for some legal questions.

1089
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:57,007
President Morrell has amended to strike some sentences around the majority makeup of the bodies as well as has suggested that future committee of the whole look at a phase in or or a change to this proposal.

1090
01:28:57,367 --> 01:28:58,827
So that is what is currently up for.

1091
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:01,549
That is the motion currently on the floor is to send this to committee of the whole

1092
01:29:02,029 --> 01:29:03,770
for more discussion with those amendments.

1093
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,951
And with that, I will go back to the podium.

1094
01:29:06,572 --> 01:29:06,872
Thank you.

1095
01:29:06,892 --> 01:29:07,852
Name and address for the record.

1096
01:29:08,193 --> 01:29:10,854
Hi, Melanie North, 45 Cross Street.

1097
01:29:11,815 --> 01:29:13,195
Good evening, City Council.

1098
01:29:13,596 --> 01:29:18,939
I'm speaking as an employee, taxpayer, and parent of Medford and Medford Public Schools.

1099
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:25,983
I am beyond insulted about this proposed raise that President Morrell and any other council member is voting for.

1100
01:29:26,963 --> 01:29:33,545
I feel that it is an abuse of power and pure negligence to even consider this preposterous raise.

1101
01:29:34,265 --> 01:29:37,847
As an employee, we were told that there was just no money in the budget.

1102
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:44,329
In fact, Dr. Cushing just stated last week to McGlynn in a meeting that the budget is the tightest it's ever been.

1103
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:51,855
There has also been talk of eliminating even more positions and more layoffs in the next school year due to budget constraints.

1104
01:29:52,175 --> 01:29:58,300
However, on the heels of winning the election for many of you and the mayor, you have conveniently located $117,000 in the budget.

1105
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:07,124
The paraprofessionals were told that although we were invaluable, the school committee was not able to provide a livable wage.

1106
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:21,090
If this 140% raise were to go through, the school committee members would be making more than our most qualified kindergarten aides and classroom assistants that work tirelessly year after year with multiple jobs to survive.

1107
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:25,671
We work an average of 1,300 hours and more each school year.

1108
01:30:25,991 --> 01:30:29,753
Most, if not all, overtime is unpaid due to budget cuts.

1109
01:30:30,373 --> 01:30:39,997
There, this is also being proposed as a general equity issue where the school committee has been dominated by females, which historically has mostly been men.

1110
01:30:40,577 --> 01:30:43,458
We have held, that have held the school committee positions.

1111
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,160
However, paraprofessionals are by far female dominated.

1112
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,421
So shouldn't we be considered for 140% race?

1113
01:30:55,177 --> 01:31:00,559
If you're making this about inequality, we clearly have some work to do on the negotiation table.

1114
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:05,301
Medford is the highest paid school committee in all of our surrounding areas.

1115
01:31:05,522 --> 01:31:07,602
I've done the research.

1116
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:13,965
But we were told that there is no money from the very school committee that you're planning to give this raise to.

1117
01:31:14,445 --> 01:31:24,290
It seems quite coincidental that suddenly money is appearing to benefit them and not the employees in the trenches every day working with the students to prepare them for the future.

1118
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:33,676
If you want to entice people to run, it should be so they can be part of making our district the best it can be, not because of the wages that we are going to receive.

1119
01:31:34,337 --> 01:31:36,618
You do not run for office to get rich.

1120
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,700
You run for office to make a difference.

1121
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:44,584
Medford Public is also actively trying to recruit paraprofessionals every single week.

1122
01:31:44,964 --> 01:31:49,107
Who would want to work in a district that will support political roles and not employees?

1123
01:31:49,687 --> 01:31:52,508
We have so many other issues that surround this raise.

1124
01:31:52,889 --> 01:32:00,032
How about our custodial staff that works tirelessly, even through COVID when everyone else was home, they still don't have a contract.

1125
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:03,454
What about the police department that serve and protect our community?

1126
01:32:03,474 --> 01:32:09,898
I believe we should be working on getting both contracts done before anything should be discussed about the school committee.

1127
01:32:10,378 --> 01:32:11,819
I'm on the front lines each day.

1128
01:32:11,839 --> 01:32:16,301
I've been punched in the face, which has resulted in a black eye from a student.

1129
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:18,262
I've been pushed, scratched,

1130
01:32:18,422 --> 01:32:21,044
and I get verbally abused each and every day.

1131
01:32:21,524 --> 01:32:23,825
I worked for a prison for almost two decades.

1132
01:32:24,186 --> 01:32:29,629
I've never been struck by an inmate or dealt with the stuff that I deal with on a daily basis.

1133
01:32:30,069 --> 01:32:31,110
That says something.

1134
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:44,378
A grievance was put in since last year to be paid for the coverage that I thought I'd been told there's no budget to pay this, yet I show up to work each and every day with our most at-risk students.

1135
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:44,839
Why?

1136
01:32:45,299 --> 01:32:46,260
because I love what I do.

1137
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:57,749
I'm heavily involved in after school programs that I personally run, not because I'm offered money, but because I believe that students should be given the opportunity to succeed in all areas of life.

1138
01:32:58,369 --> 01:33:02,052
As a parent, taxpayer, and an employee, this rate is

1139
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:04,073
This raise outrages me.

1140
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:13,441
Considering our schools are bursting at the seams, McGlynn Elementary is pouring water in kindergarten classrooms every time it rains or snows for the last few years.

1141
01:33:14,042 --> 01:33:20,848
When outraged parents demanded this be fixed due to mold issues, we were told it's the flashing, just not in the budget to fix.

1142
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:24,930
We need a new high school, and the list continues to grow.

1143
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:34,357
Yet, Medford Public Schools pays so poorly that potential employees who would excel in our schools and be amazing teachers and or paras go to other districts.

1144
01:33:34,857 --> 01:33:43,763
It's really heartbreaking that the City Council does not see the need for proper staff and better wages over raising the school committee's raises.

1145
01:33:44,243 --> 01:33:46,465
The numbers don't lie, it's in black and white.

1146
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:51,028
This does not seem like the fiscal responsibility that Sissy Hall preaches about.

1147
01:33:51,608 --> 01:33:58,292
My direct question to you is, the 2004 budget has already been approved for $179 million.

1148
01:33:58,433 --> 01:33:59,953
I do my research.

1149
01:34:00,574 --> 01:34:05,797
Can you tell me what line item will be reduced in the school's budget to compensate for these new raises?

1150
01:34:06,978 --> 01:34:07,578
Thank you for your time.

1151
01:34:07,598 --> 01:34:13,442
I'm going to go to Zoom.

1152
01:34:13,562 --> 01:34:16,304
I have Rebecca on Zoom.

1153
01:34:16,324 --> 01:34:18,846
Give us one second, Rebecca, and then name and address for the record.

1154
01:34:19,306 --> 01:34:20,507
Please try to respect the time.

1155
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:20,867
Thank you.

1156
01:34:23,308 --> 01:34:26,209
Rebecca Davidson, 101 Yeoman's Ave.

1157
01:34:27,569 --> 01:34:28,450
Good evening, everyone.

1158
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:31,771
I support the fact that this proposal is being presented this evening.

1159
01:34:32,011 --> 01:34:39,493
It's really important that we have socioeconomic diversity on our elected bodies so that these bodies fully reflect our city.

1160
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:42,054
No one is running for the salary.

1161
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:50,077
However, not being paid adequately for your time will absolutely constitute a barrier to running for those who are struggling to make ends meet.

1162
01:34:51,343 --> 01:34:55,725
This is a barrier not just on school committee, but in government participation in general.

1163
01:34:56,185 --> 01:34:58,486
So I appreciate the spirit behind this proposal.

1164
01:34:59,266 --> 01:35:07,769
I'm a parent of two kids in Medford, and as many have said, the current pay that our dedicated, hardworking Medford public school staff is nowhere near adequate.

1165
01:35:08,129 --> 01:35:12,131
And I wanna thank the teachers that have spoken this evening and highlighted their service to the city.

1166
01:35:12,731 --> 01:35:18,074
This has been an opportunity to hear about and spotlight additional equity issues our city is facing.

1167
01:35:18,514 --> 01:35:25,138
And from what I'm understanding tonight, there's no way for this body to direct funding to increase pay for MPS staff.

1168
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:27,420
That would have to go through different mechanisms.

1169
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:34,464
But the intent behind this proposal signals strong support for pay equity within Medford public schools as well.

1170
01:35:35,005 --> 01:35:41,309
And my hope is that we can move this conversation to a place where our budget reflects the need to increase salaries.

1171
01:35:41,809 --> 01:35:46,533
And for that, we need to be able to explore thoughtful ways of bringing additional revenue to the city.

1172
01:35:47,133 --> 01:35:59,159
Thank you for bringing this proposal to the table as an opportunity to raise awareness of multiple inequities facing our city, resulting from inadequate funding, so that we can move forward to make the city a better place for everyone.

1173
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:03,581
Thank you, Rebecca.

1174
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:07,242
I'm going to go to Anna on the podium.

1175
01:36:07,302 --> 01:36:08,683
Just name and address for the record, please.

1176
01:36:08,803 --> 01:36:09,103
Thank you.

1177
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:11,444
Hannah Silberman, 15 Maynard Street.

1178
01:36:13,045 --> 01:36:13,225
Go ahead.

1179
01:36:13,663 --> 01:36:18,850
All right, my name is Hannah, and I work at the second largest school in Medford.

1180
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,912
That's the Roberts Elementary School.

1181
01:36:20,932 --> 01:36:27,681
It goes Medford High School, Roberts Elementary School, and then I think the Brooks after that, and then the middle schools.

1182
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:30,284
So we need to make that make a little more sense.

1183
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:34,688
I think we should talk about rezoning before anyone talks about getting a raise.

1184
01:36:35,269 --> 01:36:38,131
At the Roberts, we have 576 students.

1185
01:36:38,351 --> 01:36:41,174
We're running out of physical space to contain them.

1186
01:36:42,395 --> 01:36:49,580
576 students, and yet we have the same amount of support staff as the other elementary schools, and some of which are half the size.

1187
01:36:49,961 --> 01:36:54,484
We're down to a skeleton crew, and administration continues to fatten up on school funding.

1188
01:36:55,285 --> 01:37:05,815
All we ever hear as teachers is that there isn't enough money, not enough to hire more classroom aides or to pay them more, not enough to raise our substitute pay, not enough money for paper even.

1189
01:37:05,835 --> 01:37:10,379
ESSER funds are running out, and those funds pay for over 30 people's salaries.

1190
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,561
And what's going to happen to their jobs next year?

1191
01:37:12,982 --> 01:37:18,787
We've been told drastic cuts no need to be made, and adding these substantial raises is only going to make that worse.

1192
01:37:19,568 --> 01:37:23,371
And you aren't going to find any teachers here who disagree with you about equal pay for equal work.

1193
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:28,895
This is a profession that's underpaid because it has historically been the work of women, as you said, President Morrell.

1194
01:37:29,815 --> 01:37:40,223
And yet, instead of correcting this, Medford is continuing to do what Medford has always done, spending school funding not on the people doing the physical, emotional, and mental labor of supporting our students,

1195
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:44,508
but instead spending the money on those who are already in power.

1196
01:37:45,309 --> 01:37:50,897
We're talking about paying the school committee the same amount or more as our classroom aides for a part-time political job.

1197
01:37:51,397 --> 01:37:56,544
School committee stipend pay should be proportional to the pay of the people doing the work face-to-face with those students.

1198
01:37:57,225 --> 01:38:00,447
If you want to show that you care about equity, this is not the way to do it.

1199
01:38:00,907 --> 01:38:07,750
Counselor Collins counselor saying you said that this is not a zero sum game but then you need to show us, because so far this is all we see.

1200
01:38:08,171 --> 01:38:13,633
And that's what we're talking about here tonight, the funding of upper administration, while the students and the staff are drowning.

1201
01:38:14,194 --> 01:38:16,155
We need to prioritize the schools themselves.

1202
01:38:17,415 --> 01:38:20,057
Please do the right thing and spend school funds.

1203
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:22,737
on what's really important.

1204
01:38:22,837 --> 01:38:25,838
We need to fix our buildings and increase substitute pay.

1205
01:38:26,258 --> 01:38:29,619
We need more aides, more social workers, more SPED and Yale staff.

1206
01:38:29,659 --> 01:38:33,180
We do not need to spend even more money on upper administration.

1207
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:33,921
Thank you.

1208
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:42,783
Thank you Hannah.

1209
01:38:42,803 --> 01:38:49,165
My name is Anthony Guillaume and between this meeting and the healthcare negotiations tomorrow, I live here today.

1210
01:38:53,174 --> 01:39:07,801
I am the president of the Medford Teachers Association, and I appreciate the call for civil conversation, but my member's anger is real, it is palpable, and we're being antagonized into this anger by this proposal.

1211
01:39:09,242 --> 01:39:16,505
We're being antagonized because every day we walk into the schools, and we hear that amount of money is available, and we see where it can go.

1212
01:39:17,105 --> 01:39:22,128
We see a lack of substitutes, we see a lack of aids, we see a leaking roof,

1213
01:39:23,345 --> 01:39:29,150
And then we hear that the school committee is our bridge, is our connection to the city.

1214
01:39:30,812 --> 01:39:34,535
We passed a vote of no confidence not a year ago.

1215
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:39,339
96% of us said we do not have the confidence in the school committee during contract negotiations.

1216
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,581
That has never been rescinded.

1217
01:39:42,382 --> 01:39:44,044
We never said, oh, okay, it's good now.

1218
01:39:44,784 --> 01:39:46,446
And yet we're being told this is all connected.

1219
01:39:46,466 --> 01:39:47,367
This isn't a zero sum.

1220
01:39:49,136 --> 01:39:51,218
Well, I can appreciate the call for civility.

1221
01:39:51,558 --> 01:39:53,400
The anger is real and that has to be recognized.

1222
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:58,184
I want to talk about some part-time jobs if we're talking about part-time job pay.

1223
01:39:59,705 --> 01:40:07,972
I want to talk about, first, our football coach, who's been celebrated all this year producing Massachusetts athletes of the week.

1224
01:40:09,213 --> 01:40:15,238
That coach has paid $3,000 to $6,000 less than all the surrounding cities, and even that is comparable to Medford.

1225
01:40:16,289 --> 01:40:20,030
Our soccer coach, $2,000 to $3,000 less.

1226
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:22,131
Our hockey coach, $2,000 to $3,000 less.

1227
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:24,371
Our basketball coach, $2,000 to $3,000 less.

1228
01:40:25,412 --> 01:40:27,952
Move out of athletics, move into the school.

1229
01:40:28,712 --> 01:40:40,956
Our Gay-Straight Alliance advisor, who makes our LGBTQIA plus students not only feel welcome, but celebrated in our schools, gets $600 to put on dances, to organize protests, to speak at rallies.

1230
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:55,362
Our senior class advisor, who puts on prom, who does fundraising, who works with the class, gets $1,000 for the year, which is an increase from when they're the freshman class advisor, and they get $600.

1231
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:12,844
The advisor to our Black Student Union who puts on our celebrated Haitian, who helps, I should say, the students do most of it, as they have said, but supervises our Haitian Flag Day and our Black History Month assembly, no compensation, does it out of the goodness of his heart.

1232
01:41:15,186 --> 01:41:19,408
We're all doing part-time jobs to make it work.

1233
01:41:20,869 --> 01:41:23,651
And some of us don't have the option to step away from our part-time jobs.

1234
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:27,774
It's not a matter of something we'd like to do, it's something we have to do to survive.

1235
01:41:29,929 --> 01:41:37,753
So I ask now that this money that is available by whatever means necessary be moved back into the schools.

1236
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:44,516
I ask that we enter this new year on a platform of transparency and trust and not of nepotism and top-down priorities.

1237
01:41:45,217 --> 01:41:48,778
I ask that we come to work in a city that believes and cares about us.

1238
01:41:49,779 --> 01:41:50,860
And I thank you all for your time.

1239
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,862
Thank you.

1240
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,961
I'm going to go to President Morrell, and then back to the podium.

1241
01:42:04,981 --> 01:42:05,521
President Morrell.

1242
01:42:05,581 --> 01:42:06,841
I just have a brief point of information.

1243
01:42:06,861 --> 01:42:10,462
I just want to note that no money has been moved anywhere just at this point.

1244
01:42:10,502 --> 01:42:11,343
No vote has been taken.

1245
01:42:11,363 --> 01:42:15,624
I just want to make sure that's clear, because I understand the intent of what you said.

1246
01:42:15,664 --> 01:42:18,265
I just want to make sure that's clear, because that happened.

1247
01:42:18,285 --> 01:42:18,985
Thank you, Madam President.

1248
01:42:19,825 --> 01:42:20,966
Name and address for the record, please.

1249
01:42:21,286 --> 01:42:22,426
My name's, can you hear me?

1250
01:42:22,446 --> 01:42:23,507
My name's Joanna McKay.

1251
01:42:24,147 --> 01:42:26,528
I'm a teacher at the Roberts Elementary, so I'll give 35 Court Street.

1252
01:42:28,427 --> 01:42:29,587
So I'm a fourth grade teacher.

1253
01:42:29,607 --> 01:42:32,568
I'm a member of the Teachers Association.

1254
01:42:32,608 --> 01:42:34,008
I was on the negotiating team.

1255
01:42:34,589 --> 01:42:37,429
So I understand some of what you go to, to an extent.

1256
01:42:37,809 --> 01:42:44,151
Like many people tonight, I'm here because the extent of this raise being proposed confuses me.

1257
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:45,572
It disheartens me.

1258
01:42:45,872 --> 01:42:47,152
Quite frankly, it disgusts me.

1259
01:42:48,198 --> 01:42:50,359
I'm not here to argue whether or not they need a raise.

1260
01:42:50,519 --> 01:42:51,460
Everyone should get a raise.

1261
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:52,860
That's a whole different point.

1262
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,482
I don't understand the level of this raise and the context in which it came about.

1263
01:42:58,062 --> 01:43:03,585
From speaking to many people on seeing comments on social media, it's evident that people don't agree with this.

1264
01:43:04,405 --> 01:43:05,506
It's too much of a raise.

1265
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:14,870
And the idea that it has to do with equity and parity and diversity is ironic to me, as what you heard everyone saying.

1266
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:15,870
I don't get it.

1267
01:43:17,782 --> 01:43:19,750
I reached out to Nicole Morel.

1268
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:21,275
I asked who she spoke to.

1269
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:22,139
She spoke to folks.

1270
01:43:23,124 --> 01:43:27,825
And she spoke to Paul Rousseau and Jenny Graham to find out about the legalities.

1271
01:43:28,185 --> 01:43:36,167
And then I asked you, Zach, who you spoke to, and you spoke to many people, and you spoke to Jenny and to Paul.

1272
01:43:36,307 --> 01:43:37,967
I have spoken to many people.

1273
01:43:38,147 --> 01:43:40,648
That's fine, about the legalities of it.

1274
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:49,610
So what confuses me is how do two separate people, committee members, council members, sorry, speak to the exact two

1275
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,992
council members and no one else.

1276
01:43:53,212 --> 01:43:55,453
There are eight people, six more phone calls.

1277
01:43:56,373 --> 01:43:57,034
Is that difficult?

1278
01:43:57,374 --> 01:44:01,455
We have over 450 people and we survey every single one of them.

1279
01:44:01,676 --> 01:44:03,897
We don't assume their needs when we negotiate.

1280
01:44:04,397 --> 01:44:08,459
It's a long process before we bring anything to the school committee.

1281
01:44:09,019 --> 01:44:11,700
Okay, so that confuses me, that's disgusting.

1282
01:44:13,846 --> 01:44:23,211
You heard from Kathy Kretsch, you heard from Nicole Branley, I heard from them myself, I heard from Mia McStone, they never heard of this before, they don't understand it.

1283
01:44:24,292 --> 01:44:31,956
I also heard that other members felt this way, but I won't quote them because I won't assume since I didn't talk to them, unlike what you did.

1284
01:44:34,136 --> 01:44:43,706
I do find it interesting that Paul Rousseau and Jenny Graham, who are often very vocal on social media, radio silence.

1285
01:44:44,547 --> 01:44:46,949
So your community feels this is fishy.

1286
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:49,672
Your community feels that you're in cahoots.

1287
01:44:50,533 --> 01:44:54,095
If you don't think that is true, then I don't know.

1288
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:56,276
It's mind boggling to me.

1289
01:44:56,396 --> 01:44:57,417
I said I talked to them.

1290
01:44:58,097 --> 01:44:59,778
So I'm just saying that's who I talked to.

1291
01:45:00,578 --> 01:45:05,821
But I'm just saying that your community feels that this is a backhand deal that that we're in cahoots.

1292
01:45:05,861 --> 01:45:08,162
I'm just telling you what the public meeting.

1293
01:45:08,362 --> 01:45:08,582
Yep.

1294
01:45:08,762 --> 01:45:09,002
Okay.

1295
01:45:09,183 --> 01:45:12,904
Well, I'm just saying speaker to say that this is for

1296
01:45:14,185 --> 01:45:21,008
diverse candidates, I find that insulting to every diverse candidate out there that they would only do this job for money.

1297
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:23,089
Okay, you did.

1298
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:28,832
I can read you the quote to say that you could do this job if you're financially privileged.

1299
01:45:29,492 --> 01:45:31,533
I suppose if you don't, you did say that.

1300
01:45:32,253 --> 01:45:37,836
So for people that don't pay mortgages, or have very rich husbands, that's who we're going to attract.

1301
01:45:37,876 --> 01:45:38,236
That's it.

1302
01:45:39,352 --> 01:45:39,893
Disgusting.

1303
01:45:40,914 --> 01:45:43,136
Because you're financially privileged, you can do this job.

1304
01:45:43,716 --> 01:45:46,639
So someone that's not financially privileged can't do this job?

1305
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:48,841
I'm just saying it's less likely, and that's statistically true.

1306
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:49,682
It's less likely.

1307
01:45:49,882 --> 01:45:50,663
I'm going to stop now.

1308
01:45:50,783 --> 01:45:51,563
Statistically.

1309
01:45:51,624 --> 01:45:52,845
We're going to get first.

1310
01:45:52,865 --> 01:45:53,405
No, that's OK.

1311
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:57,089
The extent of this raise is why people are upset.

1312
01:45:58,456 --> 01:46:07,520
the teachers, the aides, the paraprofessionals, to think that a part-time school committee member is gonna make more money than them is outrageous.

1313
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,462
These people that get kicked, spit on, yelled at, sworn at.

1314
01:46:12,002 --> 01:46:25,649
I really invite people, the community, to come and have you have one session where people kick, bite, spit on you, pee on you, where you have to stop and change a diaper, and see how well you do your job.

1315
01:46:26,269 --> 01:46:28,050
Because these people are rock stars.

1316
01:46:35,112 --> 01:46:42,760
I want to know if they take this raise or if a raise somewhat substantial like this goes through, how they're going to look their employees in the face.

1317
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,384
How are they going, the powers need to negotiate coming up.

1318
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:50,849
Take this raise, 140% raise and look them in the face and tell them there's no money.

1319
01:46:51,707 --> 01:47:00,050
Okay, tell these custodians, these custodians who have not gotten a raise, these police officers, look them in the face and tell them that that's what you deserve for a raise.

1320
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:07,913
These parents that have their children getting rained on and are sucking in mold, look them in the face and tell them there's no money in the budget.

1321
01:47:08,473 --> 01:47:09,914
And I'm gonna leave you with two things.

1322
01:47:10,754 --> 01:47:14,295
One was the same question about where it's coming from in the budget.

1323
01:47:14,735 --> 01:47:18,817
The same budget that we told has no money is bleeding

1324
01:47:19,929 --> 01:47:25,675
and that we were in jeopardy of laying off teachers because the ESSA funds are, all right, that's my one question.

1325
01:47:25,755 --> 01:47:27,878
Where is it coming from exactly in the budget?

1326
01:47:28,338 --> 01:47:29,680
And then I'm gonna leave you with a statement.

1327
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:34,125
I have a very good friend who's finishing his term on Tewksbury School Committee.

1328
01:47:34,505 --> 01:47:36,327
And I said to him, how much do you make?

1329
01:47:37,267 --> 01:47:43,649
And he said, and I told him what the proposal, he said, and I quote, oh my God, that is crazy.

1330
01:47:43,929 --> 01:47:44,329
We make $3,500.

1331
01:47:44,609 --> 01:47:47,710
It is a part-time job.

1332
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:50,651
For 30,000, I may have to come and make a comeback.

1333
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:51,652
Ha, ha, ha.

1334
01:47:52,112 --> 01:47:57,173
This job is a lot of work, but anything over $5,000 and they're stealing.

1335
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:58,494
I leave you with that.

1336
01:48:07,091 --> 01:48:07,571
That's a cut.

1337
01:48:07,611 --> 01:48:07,951
You're good.

1338
01:48:07,991 --> 01:48:08,532
You're on.

1339
01:48:08,552 --> 01:48:09,992
Give me an address for the record, please.

1340
01:48:10,132 --> 01:48:12,153
And just, you know, thank you.

1341
01:48:12,213 --> 01:48:14,454
I'll let you know when you have 30 seconds.

1342
01:48:14,874 --> 01:48:15,554
Thank you.

1343
01:48:15,934 --> 01:48:30,620
And I'm also president of the Bedford PAP Professional Behavior Specialists, Kinney-Gotton Kids Corner, Kinney-Gotton Assistants, and anything that has to do with teaching assistants and instructional tools.

1344
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:34,641
When I heard about this, I called Rick.

1345
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:35,742
I called George.

1346
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:38,789
Love calling Adam, gonna miss him.

1347
01:48:39,712 --> 01:48:41,237
And I was hoping that...

1348
01:48:42,403 --> 01:48:44,464
You know, they all said the same thing.

1349
01:48:45,264 --> 01:48:48,026
We don't think that a city council could propose this.

1350
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:55,790
But Adam said tonight that there was something in the books that could happen that you guys could give a raise.

1351
01:48:56,450 --> 01:49:00,572
Well, here's the real, I'm just gonna give you statistics.

1352
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:03,554
A girl was hired yesterday as a kindergarten assistant at $18,868.

1353
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:05,595
She's in one of the most high needs classroom.

1354
01:49:12,578 --> 01:49:14,019
She is making $18,000.

1355
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:25,167
It will take her nine years to make $29,000, what you're proposing for Paul Russo, Jenny Graham, McLaughlin, and everybody else.

1356
01:49:25,907 --> 01:49:36,655
So I propose that if they want that raise, they need to come to a MEEP classroom, a kindergarten classroom, and assist the assistant.

1357
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:40,902
just to do the same job as the assistant.

1358
01:49:40,962 --> 01:49:55,569
When they change diapers, when they chase kids because they're unsafe and they bolt, when they use Google Translate to see if the kid's sick or has to go to the bathroom, then I give you my blessing.

1359
01:49:56,109 --> 01:50:00,232
Take the $29,000 as a school committee member.

1360
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:02,913
But I'm telling you, $29,000 for each of them for 22 meetings,

1361
01:50:06,013 --> 01:50:10,495
I hate to say the word, but it's the S word, okay?

1362
01:50:10,675 --> 01:50:21,820
And I can't say it in public, because I wanna be, my students are watching, but don't worry, they kick us every day, so don't worry about that.

1363
01:50:22,381 --> 01:50:29,744
So my point is, I'm going into negotiations with the superintendent.

1364
01:50:30,785 --> 01:50:33,326
I'm taking staff with me, all right?

1365
01:50:34,722 --> 01:50:41,687
Can I say to the super, I want to put it to a vote because it's on the city council, that I want 140%.

1366
01:50:43,449 --> 01:50:48,092
Will you support 140% for women who are putting food on the table?

1367
01:50:51,235 --> 01:50:52,416
Will you support that?

1368
01:50:53,677 --> 01:50:59,001
Then I will give you my blessing for $29,000 for the school committee.

1369
01:51:00,122 --> 01:51:02,083
But I want the school committee to come and do my job.

1370
01:51:03,804 --> 01:51:04,205
One day,

1371
01:51:06,274 --> 01:51:07,594
Do I have my two minutes of up?

1372
01:51:07,915 --> 01:51:08,795
They are Gina, thank you.

1373
01:51:09,075 --> 01:51:10,235
Thank you so much, Zach.

1374
01:51:10,675 --> 01:51:13,416
I appreciate you, I appreciate you, I appreciate you, thank you.

1375
01:51:14,097 --> 01:51:14,337
Thank you.

1376
01:51:14,637 --> 01:51:15,297
Thank you for your time.

1377
01:51:16,297 --> 01:51:17,238
No one on Zoom, we'll go to Ms.

1378
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:17,758
Douglas.

1379
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,498
Hi, hello everyone.

1380
01:51:20,019 --> 01:51:20,959
Shaolin Douglas.

1381
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:29,155
I'm a president of the Method Teacher Association, resident 414 High Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1382
01:51:29,756 --> 01:51:37,242
To say I am disappointed to be here tonight to discuss a raise is beyond words.

1383
01:51:38,503 --> 01:51:42,166
I didn't write anything because I'm really disappointed.

1384
01:51:43,227 --> 01:51:45,689
Gender equality, sure.

1385
01:51:46,329 --> 01:51:47,571
I'm all for gender equality.

1386
01:51:48,777 --> 01:51:50,658
I think it should be number one.

1387
01:51:51,579 --> 01:52:06,190
Your school committee refused to negotiate FMLA, paid leave for our, maturity paid leave for our female teachers.

1388
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:08,332
That's gender equality.

1389
01:52:08,672 --> 01:52:09,953
They wouldn't even talk about it.

1390
01:52:10,313 --> 01:52:11,794
They held that over our heads.

1391
01:52:12,575 --> 01:52:14,056
Refused to talk about it.

1392
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:15,998
Gender equality.

1393
01:52:17,014 --> 01:52:32,847
Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the mayor and other members to negotiate our health insurance that we have not had a new health plan for over what to a year and a half now, almost two years.

1394
01:52:32,867 --> 01:52:35,509
And I've talked about that $25 million in free cash.

1395
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:38,280
Ms.

1396
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:42,085
Collins, with all due respect, you said we found that money tonight.

1397
01:52:42,806 --> 01:52:44,167
But maybe I misunderstood you.

1398
01:52:44,788 --> 01:52:46,590
That money's been there for a while.

1399
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:50,174
And when we've asked about it, we've been told we can't touch it.

1400
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:51,316
We can't use it.

1401
01:52:51,356 --> 01:52:52,897
And I think you've made that clear.

1402
01:52:53,178 --> 01:52:54,439
You can't use that tonight.

1403
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,240
Am I correct?

1404
01:52:56,206 --> 01:52:56,506
Correct?

1405
01:52:56,726 --> 01:52:58,588
There's no, Mr. Lewis, there's no money.

1406
01:52:59,129 --> 01:52:59,329
Right.

1407
01:52:59,429 --> 01:53:00,610
This is not a money proposal though.

1408
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:01,531
Right, I understand that.

1409
01:53:01,751 --> 01:53:07,556
But even if we were to come and say that's where that money's coming from, we have been told that money is not available.

1410
01:53:07,896 --> 01:53:11,159
We have been told there is no money for FMLA.

1411
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,001
There is no money for opt-out.

1412
01:53:13,221 --> 01:53:16,164
There is no money for better insurance for our employees.

1413
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:18,406
There is no money for our custodians.

1414
01:53:18,606 --> 01:53:20,187
There is no money for our,

1415
01:53:21,228 --> 01:53:21,628
police.

1416
01:53:21,828 --> 01:53:28,392
There's no money for our cafeteria workers who came in during COVID and never missed a day.

1417
01:53:28,692 --> 01:53:32,454
My sister being one of them who got COVID three times.

1418
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:34,651
And you know what she's gotten?

1419
01:53:35,051 --> 01:53:35,471
Nothing.

1420
01:53:35,852 --> 01:53:36,832
A goose egg.

1421
01:53:37,112 --> 01:53:38,033
That's what she's gotten.

1422
01:53:38,413 --> 01:53:39,514
It's a disgrace.

1423
01:53:39,694 --> 01:53:46,158
And all of you should be ashamed of yourselves for putting this forward and not thinking of the little people out there.

1424
01:53:46,438 --> 01:53:46,879
You're right.

1425
01:53:47,239 --> 01:53:49,360
My sister can't run for school committee.

1426
01:53:50,041 --> 01:53:52,082
And nor could I. But I will.

1427
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:54,284
I will run for school committee.

1428
01:53:58,882 --> 01:54:00,764
Because I don't really care.

1429
01:54:00,784 --> 01:54:01,025
30 seconds.

1430
01:54:01,045 --> 01:54:02,766
Seconds, I understand that.

1431
01:54:03,567 --> 01:54:12,015
And as president of the Method Teachers Association, where I worked many nights till three, four in the morning.

1432
01:54:12,035 --> 01:54:16,820
You wanna know what my stipend was?

1433
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:17,841
Are you ready?

1434
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:17,841
$8,000.

1435
01:54:17,921 --> 01:54:19,583
And that was my last year.

1436
01:54:21,345 --> 01:54:23,367
So don't tell me about gender equality.

1437
01:54:23,647 --> 01:54:30,253
Don't tell me about equal pay until you give it to every single person who works in this city.

1438
01:54:30,693 --> 01:54:31,133
I'm done.

1439
01:54:31,574 --> 01:54:31,974
Thank you.

1440
01:54:41,633 --> 01:54:42,894
Name and address for the record, please.

1441
01:54:42,954 --> 01:54:43,434
Two minutes.

1442
01:54:43,815 --> 01:54:48,438
James Chip O'Leary, 30 Norwich Circle, lifelong resident of Medford and taxpayer.

1443
01:54:49,158 --> 01:54:50,299
I'm also a custodian.

1444
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:51,420
Sorry, go.

1445
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,661
I'm also a custodian in the school system.

1446
01:54:54,302 --> 01:54:56,944
And we have not had a contract in two and a half years.

1447
01:54:58,245 --> 01:55:00,066
And from what I'm hearing, it could be longer.

1448
01:55:01,207 --> 01:55:02,207
I have a couple of questions.

1449
01:55:02,548 --> 01:55:04,549
And first, Mr. Scott Pelley, maybe you can answer this.

1450
01:55:05,009 --> 01:55:08,852
When you were on the school committee, did it ever come before you about putting a raisin?

1451
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:10,033
Never.

1452
01:55:11,590 --> 01:55:14,213
So why all of a sudden now is this coming out?

1453
01:55:16,335 --> 01:55:20,739
This is the problem right now in Medford, two divided houses.

1454
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,902
Medford's suffering big time.

1455
01:55:23,582 --> 01:55:24,964
People don't want to come to Medford.

1456
01:55:25,544 --> 01:55:28,668
People are taking their kids, sending them to other schools, so forth.

1457
01:55:29,188 --> 01:55:29,468
Why?

1458
01:55:29,588 --> 01:55:30,489
Because we're divided.

1459
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:34,253
We have storefronts that are empty, but worried about giving raises.

1460
01:55:35,134 --> 01:55:39,637
Let's get our act together, make Medford better, and put the right foot forward.

1461
01:55:40,157 --> 01:55:46,021
Next year, two new councils, a new council, a new school committee have to work together.

1462
01:55:46,282 --> 01:55:46,662
Thank you.

1463
01:55:47,182 --> 01:55:55,888
Thank you for your time.

1464
01:55:55,948 --> 01:55:56,729
I do just want to thank Ms.

1465
01:55:56,749 --> 01:55:58,790
Douglas for bringing that forward about the PFMLA.

1466
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:00,211
I wasn't aware of that fact.

1467
01:56:00,611 --> 01:56:02,793
Vice President Behrs and I actually introduced a resolution

1468
01:56:03,823 --> 01:56:07,886
two years ago about extending PFMLA to the entire city.

1469
01:56:08,327 --> 01:56:12,470
And we were essentially rebuffed by the administration about it being a possibility.

1470
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:16,353
So it's really helpful for me to know that that is continuing on.

1471
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:18,295
It's something that still is on our books.

1472
01:56:18,375 --> 01:56:19,636
It's nothing that's been disposed of.

1473
01:56:19,716 --> 01:56:23,079
So I hope that the next council will continue the conversation around it.

1474
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:25,480
Ms.

1475
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:25,741
Douglas.

1476
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:28,226
I just asked.

1477
01:56:28,306 --> 01:56:28,627
Thank you.

1478
01:56:28,647 --> 01:56:29,447
Thank you.

1479
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:34,889
And I just want to clarify, we wanted, we proposed that we'd be the first in the state to take it on.

1480
01:56:35,249 --> 01:56:38,030
We were told the same thing that everyone else here has been told.

1481
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:45,232
And I think we all would like to see the city spending more of its reserves on the priorities that we all share.

1482
01:56:45,392 --> 01:56:45,732
Thank you.

1483
01:56:46,153 --> 01:56:46,913
I'll go to the podium.

1484
01:56:47,769 --> 01:56:49,351
Jamie Thompson, 86 Lawrence Road.

1485
01:56:49,812 --> 01:56:53,876
There's been many more intelligent, better spoken people that have already covered most of my points.

1486
01:56:54,537 --> 01:56:59,082
I just want to, you know, I understand the spirit that this was put forward with.

1487
01:56:59,602 --> 01:57:02,425
I appreciate the amendments to it because that's been challenged.

1488
01:57:03,506 --> 01:57:08,111
Councillor Scarpelli, Caraballo and Councillor Knight, your comments about

1489
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:12,857
pay equity by offering your salaries to compensate that.

1490
01:57:12,877 --> 01:57:14,138
I appreciate those.

1491
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:16,520
These are service positions.

1492
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:19,984
People run knowing what they're going to be earning in these roles.

1493
01:57:25,342 --> 01:57:29,784
I hope that the city council that's coming, the school committee that's coming, and the mayor's office can work together.

1494
01:57:30,124 --> 01:57:31,444
We need to get the city solicitor.

1495
01:57:31,744 --> 01:57:33,745
We need to get the community development director.

1496
01:57:34,145 --> 01:57:36,746
We need a building commissioner.

1497
01:57:37,606 --> 01:57:47,490
And we need to get a tax base in here that can support so that we can fund the schools and the employees for what they need so that they can make our schools better.

1498
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:49,411
Thank you.

1499
01:57:49,571 --> 01:57:50,351
Thank you for your time.

1500
01:57:56,092 --> 01:57:57,433
If you name an address for the record, please.

1501
01:57:57,614 --> 01:58:01,077
Maria Geneska Micheli, I live at the Brooks School.

1502
01:58:01,097 --> 01:58:07,643
I have been an educator in the city for 30 years, born and raised.

1503
01:58:08,244 --> 01:58:13,409
I was not talking tonight, but I've compelled.

1504
01:58:16,161 --> 01:58:22,185
I can go on and on, but I'm just going to piggyback on Gina that spoke a couple of minutes ago.

1505
01:58:23,546 --> 01:58:31,932
She put out there that the school committee should come out and do their jobs, to do the jobs of the paras and the kindergarten aides.

1506
01:58:32,673 --> 01:58:34,574
I'd like them to just come to the schools.

1507
01:58:35,595 --> 01:58:37,557
I'd like them to just come.

1508
01:58:40,273 --> 01:58:44,158
to visit the schools, to come read to the classrooms.

1509
01:58:44,558 --> 01:58:47,361
Not to come only when it's an election year.

1510
01:58:48,102 --> 01:58:48,963
Pass out the appellate.

1511
01:58:48,983 --> 01:58:49,724
Well, maybe they can't.

1512
01:58:49,784 --> 01:58:51,686
I don't know if they can pass them out or whatever.

1513
01:58:51,846 --> 01:58:52,747
I don't know the laws.

1514
01:58:53,228 --> 01:58:55,090
That's why I'm only a kindergarten teacher.

1515
01:58:55,611 --> 01:58:57,072
Don't come only.

1516
01:58:57,092 --> 01:58:57,633
I know.

1517
01:58:58,334 --> 01:58:58,754
I know.

1518
01:58:58,774 --> 01:58:59,335
Don't come.

1519
01:59:01,772 --> 01:59:05,735
for the photo ops, come visit us in the classroom.

1520
01:59:06,236 --> 01:59:11,520
Come see what we're doing every day, all day, all the staffs.

1521
01:59:14,082 --> 01:59:21,228
I have not seen a school committee member, might be the last one was George Scarpelli, when he came to read, how many years ago?

1522
01:59:22,893 --> 01:59:24,674
I can invite them to come.

1523
01:59:24,694 --> 01:59:27,776
I have no time to invite them to come.

1524
01:59:28,397 --> 01:59:29,777
They know the addresses.

1525
01:59:30,438 --> 01:59:31,598
They know the schools.

1526
01:59:32,139 --> 01:59:33,479
Come to the schools.

1527
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,401
That's all I know.

1528
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,861
I could ask for a lot more.

1529
01:59:37,342 --> 01:59:39,003
And I can go on and on and on.

1530
01:59:39,603 --> 01:59:42,024
But that is my two cents.

1531
01:59:42,344 --> 01:59:42,965
Thank you for your time.

1532
01:59:47,085 --> 02:00:05,253
I do want to add, and I don't know if this law has changed since Councilor Scarapelli was on the school committee, state law asks and requires that school committee members be invited because they don't want school committee members walking into the schools unannounced, uninvited, to pass out pamphlets per se.

1533
02:00:05,313 --> 02:00:07,274
So that formal thing is a requirement.

1534
02:00:07,314 --> 02:00:07,854
Are they invited?

1535
02:00:08,454 --> 02:00:09,395
We're invited.

1536
02:00:09,455 --> 02:00:11,016
We're officially inviting them.

1537
02:00:11,976 --> 02:00:14,358
I hear you and I think a lot of people would like to come.

1538
02:00:14,418 --> 02:00:19,161
I don't know if it satisfies the legal requirements, but thank you.

1539
02:00:19,261 --> 02:00:20,362
I just wanted to put that out there.

1540
02:00:20,942 --> 02:00:21,823
Name and address for the record.

1541
02:00:22,023 --> 02:00:24,945
Sarah Sossfield, 141 Street, Medford.

1542
02:00:25,285 --> 02:00:31,048
I was also not going to speak and felt compelled and started writing notes while people were speaking.

1543
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,771
I love that the committee feels that

1544
02:00:35,509 --> 02:00:39,872
you know, you could take a recess because people aren't showing expected behavior.

1545
02:00:40,332 --> 02:00:42,314
We don't have that opportunity in the classroom.

1546
02:00:42,674 --> 02:00:48,137
If people aren't showing expected behavior, we need to continue on with business as usual.

1547
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:53,741
And while you're actually speaking, I want to be able to throw things at you.

1548
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:56,643
I want to be able to scream in your face.

1549
02:00:56,783 --> 02:01:05,309
I want to be able to maybe bite you here and there, but you also still need to carry on and hope that everyone else here is retaining the information that you're putting out.

1550
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:08,950
There was a recent court case, you may be well able to do most of that.

1551
02:01:09,290 --> 02:01:10,730
We just ask that everyone do it one at a time.

1552
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:11,451
And that's fine.

1553
02:01:11,511 --> 02:01:11,831
Okay.

1554
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:19,833
Well, we don't still have that opportunity to have them to tell a child, sorry, you need to wait your chance to do your unexpected behavior.

1555
02:01:19,973 --> 02:01:20,633
I hear you.

1556
02:01:21,573 --> 02:01:21,893
Okay.

1557
02:01:22,093 --> 02:01:23,934
So also with that being said,

1558
02:01:25,865 --> 02:01:28,586
Let me say, let me go down a little bit.

1559
02:01:28,746 --> 02:01:34,449
Any parents that have had me as their parent in the classroom know that my little nuggies come first in my life.

1560
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:35,950
They are always first.

1561
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:40,933
And we also know that kindergarten isn't considered mandatory in the state of Massachusetts.

1562
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:45,771
But we are always being given extra ELA time.

1563
02:01:45,811 --> 02:01:47,693
We need to give extra science time.

1564
02:01:47,753 --> 02:01:50,035
We have extra all of these things that are mandated.

1565
02:01:50,415 --> 02:01:51,916
We are losing out on playtime.

1566
02:01:51,956 --> 02:01:54,118
We are losing out on social and emotional support.

1567
02:01:54,499 --> 02:01:56,921
We are losing out on all of those things.

1568
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:58,522
Who has to offer that support?

1569
02:01:59,303 --> 02:02:00,604
Me as a kindergarten aid.

1570
02:02:00,784 --> 02:02:01,945
I have to give these kids

1571
02:02:02,486 --> 02:02:04,548
teach them how to deal with their peer support.

1572
02:02:04,649 --> 02:02:10,837
I have to show them what it means to play in the playground and if someone pushes them, what needs to happen.

1573
02:02:11,538 --> 02:02:17,206
That doesn't happen anymore because we don't have playtime or kids to be able to have that one-on-one time in the classroom anymore.

1574
02:02:17,927 --> 02:02:33,211
So to tell me that school committee now is going to get more money than I am in the classroom, who works hard every day, that they now work harder than I do in the classroom, is very disappointing and it's very frustrating.

1575
02:02:33,271 --> 02:02:37,873
And I have to say, if it goes through, you will see my resignation.

1576
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:41,034
Because I can't live on my 17 to $20,000 a year.

1577
02:02:41,074 --> 02:02:42,134
It is absolutely not possible.

1578
02:02:45,695 --> 02:02:47,316
It is absolutely not possible.

1579
02:02:47,797 --> 02:02:49,678
So you need to have additional support.

1580
02:02:50,019 --> 02:02:52,400
So to say that, well, this is my extra job.

1581
02:02:52,961 --> 02:02:58,505
I have three extra jobs to have to maintain what I do in the school system.

1582
02:02:59,186 --> 02:03:01,928
I have a college degree, speech and hearing science.

1583
02:03:02,068 --> 02:03:07,633
I could be working, making way more money doing than what I do as a paraprofessional in the kindergarten classroom.

1584
02:03:07,953 --> 02:03:09,955
But I love my kids.

1585
02:03:10,475 --> 02:03:11,816
I love my parents.

1586
02:03:11,976 --> 02:03:14,038
I love my community at the McGlynn.

1587
02:03:15,546 --> 02:03:23,008
I wouldn't give it up, but it's now getting to the point where I need to choose between my school family or my home family.

1588
02:03:23,508 --> 02:03:31,370
And my home family is suffering because I'm not receiving the pay that I frankly deserve and work for every day.

1589
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,090
I am a female.

1590
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:34,771
I choose Medford.

1591
02:03:35,131 --> 02:03:39,652
I just want to feel like Medford chooses me for once in a while.

1592
02:03:39,672 --> 02:03:43,193
Thank you, Sarah.

1593
02:03:51,431 --> 02:03:51,671
Thank you.

1594
02:03:51,691 --> 02:03:53,793
Name and address for the record, please, and I'll let you know when I have 30 seconds.

1595
02:03:54,854 --> 02:03:57,896
Jimmy Giddings, and I live at 25 Vernon Street in Melrose.

1596
02:03:58,076 --> 02:03:59,758
I teach at Roberts Elementary School.

1597
02:04:00,518 --> 02:04:02,120
This is my third year teaching kindergarten.

1598
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,822
I have a para in my classroom.

1599
02:04:05,162 --> 02:04:08,425
For the first six months, when I first came to Medford, I did not.

1600
02:04:09,185 --> 02:04:12,808
And I can tell you the big differences as soon as one came.

1601
02:04:13,889 --> 02:04:20,172
And I've been with my same power for three years, and I don't think that's like that in a lot of instances.

1602
02:04:20,192 --> 02:04:24,314
I think powers turn over quite quickly in a lot of places because of the low pay.

1603
02:04:25,134 --> 02:04:28,696
And we couldn't do what we do without them.

1604
02:04:29,856 --> 02:04:35,359
I see this proposal on the table, and I think how I can look at my power in the face,

1605
02:04:37,731 --> 02:04:39,953
And it's not fair because I can't fix it.

1606
02:04:40,474 --> 02:04:42,616
The people that can fix it are before me.

1607
02:04:43,377 --> 02:04:46,680
All of you are charged with this duty to help them.

1608
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:52,666
And I'm asking you, all of these people are asking you and the people on Zoom to help them.

1609
02:04:53,787 --> 02:04:57,270
We want them to feel like they deserve to be here.

1610
02:04:57,731 --> 02:05:00,513
And the only way we can do that is by increasing their pay.

1611
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:06,888
If we take money away from the school, it's going to take money away from potentially going to them.

1612
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:10,893
And the only way to fix that is to make this change.

1613
02:05:11,994 --> 02:05:15,679
I understand why that you brought this to the table.

1614
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:18,262
And I think that is a good thing to discuss.

1615
02:05:20,046 --> 02:05:30,473
But unlike city council, it takes directly from the schools, and that's where the big difference is there, because the money that's going to the schools isn't going to go to the para first, and it should.

1616
02:05:31,393 --> 02:05:35,716
I can't tell you how often I entrust my para with responsibilities.

1617
02:05:36,376 --> 02:05:44,221
She runs tables in my centers, and I trust her to almost run the classroom as I'm in my small groups, and she can do that.

1618
02:05:44,622 --> 02:05:45,902
So many of the other paras do too.

1619
02:05:47,063 --> 02:05:51,456
And they can do so much better if we show them their trust by giving them what they deserve.

1620
02:05:52,138 --> 02:05:52,459
Thank you.

1621
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:53,462
Thank you for your time.

1622
02:06:00,604 --> 02:06:03,167
I just want the clapping so we can hear you.

1623
02:06:03,187 --> 02:06:03,987
Name and address for the record.

1624
02:06:04,107 --> 02:06:05,329
I'm Mary Jo Petroni.

1625
02:06:05,509 --> 02:06:07,090
I'm at 12 Greenhalgh Street.

1626
02:06:07,751 --> 02:06:09,513
Just laying pinto 108 Woodruff Avenue.

1627
02:06:10,594 --> 02:06:11,655
Michelle left me.

1628
02:06:12,075 --> 02:06:18,821
My third person, I want, we are three of the secretary's administrative assistants that work for the school.

1629
02:06:18,841 --> 02:06:22,185
So I'm going to tell you, we are the heart and soul of the buildings.

1630
02:06:22,785 --> 02:06:31,134
And I have the distinct opportunity to work with the custodians who have not had their contract and who do work very hard because we're short staffed.

1631
02:06:31,615 --> 02:06:34,918
And I am the one that I'm calling them all the time to clean up their mess.

1632
02:06:35,499 --> 02:06:40,704
And this is disrespectful to everyone that works for the school department.

1633
02:06:41,445 --> 02:06:49,232
And especially for those people who are putting in their time and effort, we get no extra money for all the extra things that we do.

1634
02:06:49,592 --> 02:06:57,980
Michelle works at a school where, I don't know how many parents, we filled in just Lane and I occasionally at outside schools.

1635
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,362
I can't imagine what their life is like.

1636
02:07:00,882 --> 02:07:07,569
And I want to thank you, Mr. Scarpelli, Mr. Knight, Mr. Carviello, because I know you guys and what you've done.

1637
02:07:07,749 --> 02:07:13,836
And I want to think back to Mrs. Van de Kloet, Mrs. DiGentimasso, Mr. Brady, Mr. Pompeo.

1638
02:07:14,216 --> 02:07:18,961
Those are the people that served for 25 or more years on the school committee.

1639
02:07:19,321 --> 02:07:21,083
And there are other names that I can't even think of.

1640
02:07:21,543 --> 02:07:24,745
And those are the people that came with the actual attitude.

1641
02:07:25,146 --> 02:07:27,167
You are here to serve us.

1642
02:07:27,708 --> 02:07:32,151
It is not a job that you expect to earn money for.

1643
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:36,435
And Mr. Singh, I appreciate that you need to earn more funds on Mr. Beers.

1644
02:07:37,176 --> 02:07:38,737
I have worked for two jobs.

1645
02:07:38,978 --> 02:07:40,359
I have raised my family.

1646
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:48,789
My kids have got work, two jobs, because that is the life that we have, unfortunately, in order to survive in this state.

1647
02:07:48,929 --> 02:07:49,590
We know that.

1648
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:57,259
And the fact that you're trying to take money away from the schools for the kids, for the grandchildren that I have attending these programs.

1649
02:07:57,819 --> 02:07:59,861
It's absolutely disgusting.

1650
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:07,907
And not only are these people correct in that we are underpaid, we choose to do this because we love Medford and we love the students.

1651
02:08:08,227 --> 02:08:15,593
And again, every one of us could make double, and I'm not kidding because I worked in the real world, double what we're earning right now.

1652
02:08:16,534 --> 02:08:18,616
Just Lane speaks multiple languages.

1653
02:08:18,636 --> 02:08:23,280
And if we didn't have her half the time, we wouldn't have people be able to register in our programs.

1654
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:32,629
So I want to tell you that the reason why you ran for an office is because you want to serve your community, not make a living.

1655
02:08:32,669 --> 02:08:34,111
So I thank you.

1656
02:08:36,112 --> 02:08:37,513
Thank you for your time.

1657
02:08:38,033 --> 02:08:40,815
I do want to note, I believe Ms.

1658
02:08:40,855 --> 02:08:44,517
Vanden Heuvel, Mr. Giacomasso, Mr. Brady, and Mr. Pompeo were all on the school committee in 2000.

1659
02:08:45,037 --> 02:08:50,561
And that budget that passed that year had a similar increase from $5,000 to $12,000 for the school committee.

1660
02:08:51,121 --> 02:08:53,062
So just want to put that out there as a fact.

1661
02:08:54,303 --> 02:08:55,364
Well, that's just a fact.

1662
02:08:55,624 --> 02:08:56,745
Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

1663
02:09:00,407 --> 02:09:01,507
We have one person on Zoom.

1664
02:09:01,848 --> 02:09:02,488
And I will go to them.

1665
02:09:02,528 --> 02:09:03,809
Name and address for the record, please.

1666
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:09,320
Hi, this is Kim Willard.

1667
02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:13,123
I'm a resident of Medford at 10 Florence Street.

1668
02:09:13,283 --> 02:09:19,867
I am also a special education teacher at the Curtis Tufts High School.

1669
02:09:19,887 --> 02:09:25,210
I would just repeat all of the points that my colleagues have said about

1670
02:09:26,331 --> 02:09:43,579
the budgetary issues that we've been going through for the past decade, and would like to formally invite any school committee members or any city councilors to the Curtis Tufts High School to see the kinds of understaffing that we're going through.

1671
02:09:43,659 --> 02:09:47,221
We currently do not have a science teacher.

1672
02:09:48,221 --> 02:09:48,561
What?

1673
02:09:49,802 --> 02:09:50,922
Sorry, just we have some noise there.

1674
02:09:50,962 --> 02:09:52,123
I want to make sure everyone can hear you, Kate.

1675
02:09:52,592 --> 02:09:53,072
Oh, sorry.

1676
02:09:54,173 --> 02:09:58,877
We have not had a science teacher at the Curtis Sucks for the past two years.

1677
02:09:59,877 --> 02:10:12,626
Currently, the director of our high school is teaching three science classes without additional pay because she was told past practice principals don't get paid to cover classes.

1678
02:10:13,804 --> 02:10:20,067
Um, because that's not a thing that happens anywhere else Um, we don't have a secretary.

1679
02:10:20,207 --> 02:10:22,248
So the nurse answers our phones.

1680
02:10:22,628 --> 02:10:34,314
We haven't had a nurse in the past week because there's staff out at audi's outing Um throughout the district in the past couple weeks um, so

1681
02:10:35,498 --> 02:10:47,761
Again, just inviting any city council members, and I know a few, George Scott Kelly and Rick Carviello already have a connection to the Curtis Tufts, so you're familiar with our program.

1682
02:10:48,702 --> 02:10:58,524
I'm not sure about anyone else, but anyone who would like to see what's actually going on in the schools, I can invite you to mine.

1683
02:10:58,904 --> 02:10:59,264
Thank you.

1684
02:11:00,685 --> 02:11:01,325
Thank you, Kate.

1685
02:11:05,487 --> 02:11:06,448
And the rest of you, please.

1686
02:11:07,668 --> 02:11:11,250
Walter Buckley, President of Local 1032-340 Salish Street.

1687
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:18,713
I'd just like to know, with this money, you have to pay more taxes in order to fund these positions and pay these raises.

1688
02:11:19,274 --> 02:11:23,135
How many board members, how many council members own a house in Method?

1689
02:11:23,155 --> 02:11:25,476
I don't think we're gonna ask personal questions.

1690
02:11:25,897 --> 02:11:26,277
Oh, okay.

1691
02:11:26,797 --> 02:11:28,938
I thought we were debating, but I was wrong.

1692
02:11:28,978 --> 02:11:30,119
We're not actually.

1693
02:11:30,159 --> 02:11:32,680
Fact, fact, here's a fact for you, not many.

1694
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:36,751
So it's getting passed on to the homeowners, that's a fact.

1695
02:11:37,732 --> 02:11:45,696
Second fact is, the teachers negotiated out of the contract for two years, the fire department for almost three years, the police are out of the contract.

1696
02:11:46,317 --> 02:11:53,761
It would take us over 40 years to get the raise percentage that you are proposing here, over 140% raise.

1697
02:11:53,821 --> 02:11:56,062
That would take us 40 years to get that pay raise.

1698
02:11:59,924 --> 02:12:05,307
So when we talk about equity, we have a secretary who makes $60,000 a year for the fire department.

1699
02:12:05,927 --> 02:12:09,349
So a person that goes to a meeting twice a month is going to make $30,000.

1700
02:12:09,509 --> 02:12:11,651
Is that equitable?

1701
02:12:11,671 --> 02:12:12,791
Is that equity?

1702
02:12:12,851 --> 02:12:14,492
Is that what we count as equity?

1703
02:12:14,933 --> 02:12:15,493
No, it isn't.

1704
02:12:16,133 --> 02:12:16,614
It's sad.

1705
02:12:17,394 --> 02:12:26,579
And the fact that we have to go out of contract and the mayor stated at the debate that she can't negotiate with unions because they're asking for 9%.

1706
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:29,892
but she's gonna get 140% raise, where are they?

1707
02:12:29,912 --> 02:12:34,657
Where are the people on the school committee that are for this?

1708
02:12:34,777 --> 02:12:35,417
Where are they?

1709
02:12:36,919 --> 02:12:37,700
I can't find them.

1710
02:12:39,462 --> 02:12:41,304
Yeah, that's all I have to say.

1711
02:12:41,464 --> 02:12:45,788
The people on the school committee that are for this should be there talking about it.

1712
02:12:46,209 --> 02:12:48,431
It's not fair to these people at all.

1713
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:55,881
Mr. Pencil.

1714
02:12:56,461 --> 02:12:58,982
Good question, Robert Pencil, Zero Summit Road.

1715
02:12:59,242 --> 02:13:08,006
It's quite obvious from the comments that have been made here today, whether you're a paraprofessional or you're a full-time employee, you just haven't been treated the correct way.

1716
02:13:08,026 --> 02:13:21,972
And I think it's incumbent, I believe it's incumbent upon one city councilor who will have the guts and take this resolution and say, receive it and place it on file and kill the issue now.

1717
02:13:28,803 --> 02:13:29,323
Thank you.

1718
02:13:29,484 --> 02:13:31,405
Is there any further comment from members of the public?

1719
02:13:33,927 --> 02:13:40,052
Seeing none in the room, and seeing none on Zoom, there's a motion on the floor that has been, oh, Councilor Knight.

1720
02:13:40,452 --> 02:13:42,034
Oh, sorry, Councilor Morrell, then Councilor Knight.

1721
02:13:42,114 --> 02:13:42,794
Sorry, my apologies.

1722
02:13:42,854 --> 02:13:43,855
I'll let you know how to remember.

1723
02:13:43,875 --> 02:13:44,756
I'll teach you.

1724
02:13:44,816 --> 02:13:45,997
Yeah, it's not an easy job.

1725
02:13:46,897 --> 02:13:49,940
I just want to thank everyone for coming out and taking the time to speak.

1726
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:56,265
Obviously, my intention was never to submit this, and to be inflammatory, my intention was to start a conversation.

1727
02:13:56,926 --> 02:14:03,669
But I think what's come out of this conversation is so much that we don't get to hear on city council.

1728
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,531
We get the school budget delivered to us as such.

1729
02:14:06,571 --> 02:14:08,812
We're not at the bargaining table because we can't be.

1730
02:14:08,872 --> 02:14:17,576
So I think this really illuminates a lot of issues that they either come to us when the budget is already set in stone, or we simply just never hear about them.

1731
02:14:17,676 --> 02:14:20,298
So I really, really appreciate the time.

1732
02:14:20,498 --> 02:14:23,980
I'm sorry I won't be there to continue the conversations, at least in this role.

1733
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:26,401
But I think a lot of important things

1734
02:14:27,108 --> 02:14:43,176
were shared tonight and I do just want to make it explicit that I never introduced this as in insult or to say that the jobs are equal to paraprofessional and the school committee.

1735
02:14:44,216 --> 02:14:53,941
I noted before my mom taught in a poor school district for 35 years special education and I know how essential

1736
02:14:55,132 --> 02:14:57,594
her powers were to the success of her classrooms.

1737
02:14:58,055 --> 02:15:12,310
And I just know how much she had to fight and how much she had to put up with and how much I think she's thankful that she retired in 2011 because your jobs are so incredibly difficult and more multifaceted and challenging than they ever have been before.

1738
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:12,391
And

1739
02:15:14,139 --> 02:15:17,802
believe me or not, but I am so, so appreciative of the work you do.

1740
02:15:17,962 --> 02:15:23,527
And I thank you for taking the time to come out tonight, knowing you already put in a full day that is exhausting.

1741
02:15:23,587 --> 02:15:26,510
I watched my mother come home after work and just kind of pass it on the bed.

1742
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:27,691
I know how hard your day was.

1743
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:31,955
So I just want to make that clear again, believe me or not, but I just want to state that.

1744
02:15:32,015 --> 02:15:32,515
So thank you.

1745
02:15:33,516 --> 02:15:34,497
Can we, okay.

1746
02:15:34,737 --> 02:15:36,999
The council, the council respected all public comment.

1747
02:15:37,019 --> 02:15:38,701
I just ask that we keep it to one mic, please.

1748
02:15:38,781 --> 02:15:39,181
One voice.

1749
02:15:39,221 --> 02:15:39,481
Thank you.

1750
02:15:44,312 --> 02:15:44,772
Councilor Knight.

1751
02:15:45,732 --> 02:15:46,933
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1752
02:15:47,753 --> 02:16:00,076
First of all, I think we can all agree that diversity is important, and it's commendable for a public official to pursue diversity.

1753
02:16:02,176 --> 02:16:13,119
I also think that this issue before us here sheds light on a perfect example of why diversity of thought

1754
02:16:14,571 --> 02:16:26,479
and diversity of opinion is necessary when you go to the ballot box and you cast your vote to elect somebody to serve.

1755
02:16:28,481 --> 02:16:35,646
Because without diversity of thought, without diversity of opinion, what you're going to see is more and more of the same.

1756
02:16:38,168 --> 02:16:39,749
So I leave you with this.

1757
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:43,972
Moving forward, everybody behind this rail makes decisions.

1758
02:16:45,353 --> 02:16:50,635
based upon what they feel is those in the best interest of the city of Medford in one way or another.

1759
02:16:52,456 --> 02:16:58,758
And it's not easy to come out here every evening and be criticized and be trolled and be attacked.

1760
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:03,300
And all it is is an opportunity for us to have a discussion.

1761
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:08,082
Now, Councilor Penta came up and said that someone should make a motion to receive this and place this on file.

1762
02:17:10,803 --> 02:17:11,083
Then what?

1763
02:17:14,065 --> 02:17:15,205
It fails, then what?

1764
02:17:19,467 --> 02:17:21,548
Then what?

1765
02:17:22,668 --> 02:17:27,730
I think it's safe to say that we're all acting on behalf of the people.

1766
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:38,674
And it's that diversity of thought and that diversity of opinion on how do we address issues like this that's really coming into play right now.

1767
02:17:41,323 --> 02:17:55,689
For these reasons, I'm going to support the paper this evening, because quite frankly, I attached five amendments to it that ask a number of significant legal questions as to whether or not this is even the appropriate process, or whether or not the paper is even in proper legal form.

1768
02:17:57,190 --> 02:18:00,771
And as we move forward, this isn't going to be the last you hear of this.

1769
02:18:01,812 --> 02:18:03,112
This isn't going to be the last you hear of it.

1770
02:18:03,132 --> 02:18:03,832
It's going to come back.

1771
02:18:04,693 --> 02:18:07,234
When your landscape is out there,

1772
02:18:08,035 --> 02:18:10,736
blowing the leaves in your yard with an electric leaf blower.

1773
02:18:11,257 --> 02:18:11,837
You know what I mean?

1774
02:18:11,877 --> 02:18:14,998
You guys are gonna still be talking about the school committee and whether or not they're getting a raise.

1775
02:18:15,398 --> 02:18:16,999
That's the fact of the mat, all right?

1776
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:30,786
But with that being said, you know, I think that, you know, when we move forward in this community and we think about what direction we're gonna go in, diversity of thought and diversity of opinion is something that we really need to think about.

1777
02:18:32,386 --> 02:18:33,207
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1778
02:18:33,227 --> 02:18:35,068
And I apologize, Councilor Collins, I missed you.

1779
02:18:35,970 --> 02:18:37,612
frantically looking over here and I wasn't looking over there.

1780
02:18:37,652 --> 02:18:38,193
Councillor Collins.

1781
02:18:38,934 --> 02:18:39,354
Thank you.

1782
02:18:39,454 --> 02:18:39,915
It's okay.

1783
02:18:40,756 --> 02:18:47,804
There was a lot of, it feels cheap to say, there was a lot of really important perspectives shared tonight.

1784
02:18:47,884 --> 02:18:55,073
I feel like even just saying that doesn't really do it justice, but I wanted to leave the last word to a lead sponsor of the paper.

1785
02:18:56,091 --> 02:19:04,336
I did just wanted to quickly clarify one of my previous comments, because I think when I mentioned the free cash number, I was unclear, and I apologize for speaking unclearly.

1786
02:19:04,356 --> 02:19:05,296
I was nervous.

1787
02:19:05,916 --> 02:19:17,442
What I really meant to say was to try to recenter my comments on what I think is the most important part of most of the conversations that we have in the city council, which is that tight budgets are a choice.

1788
02:19:18,663 --> 02:19:23,005
And they're not a choice that we make in this branch of government.

1789
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:34,403
I hope that a silver lining of this conversation can be elucidating for this body and for the school committee and for the residents, how our budgets get made.

1790
02:19:34,443 --> 02:19:36,983
It's an ongoing process of making the budget every year.

1791
02:19:37,223 --> 02:19:38,963
And for us, it just means approving it.

1792
02:19:39,043 --> 02:19:42,064
We cannot appropriate, we cannot weigh in on collective bargaining.

1793
02:19:42,584 --> 02:19:45,745
We cannot move money from one salary to another.

1794
02:19:46,305 --> 02:19:47,965
We're sorely limited in what we can do.

1795
02:19:49,305 --> 02:19:53,306
And I hope that this ongoing process allows us to have the conversation with the community

1796
02:19:54,005 --> 02:20:02,949
how our budgets are shaped, and who shapes them, and what limited power lies where, because I think it's beneficial for the community to get a better sense of how that pie gets baked.

1797
02:20:03,610 --> 02:20:22,419
But I think what makes me frustrated, what I hear in this room tonight, is that we, the administration, willfully keeps urgently needed funding away from the people and services that need it, year after year, on a scale that exceeds by magnitude the scale of these proposed COLA increases.

1798
02:20:23,098 --> 02:20:26,060
And that is what I'll be focusing on as we continue to discuss this.

1799
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:38,087
And I hope that we can continue to center the conversation around this conversation and achieving equity and just what we need in our operating budget year after year.

1800
02:20:38,427 --> 02:20:42,410
And I thank you to everybody who brought that to this conversation tonight and will in the future.

1801
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:42,730
Thank you.

1802
02:20:43,605 --> 02:20:46,970
Thank you.

1803
02:20:47,311 --> 02:20:58,907
Um, you know, I already discussed it a little bit, but I just wanted to reiterate I know many of you will be disappointed with my, you know, when I vote to move this into subcommittee of the whole.

1804
02:20:59,988 --> 02:21:08,954
But my whole take on this is I wouldn't, ultimately, I won't vote for this if it does detract from the students, right?

1805
02:21:09,034 --> 02:21:11,015
I think we all agree on that value.

1806
02:21:11,075 --> 02:21:20,741
Everyone behind this rail agrees on that value, but only by moving into subcommittee can we have those meetings and conversations with financial folks to give us that better picture.

1807
02:21:22,102 --> 02:21:25,844
We also, as Councilor Collins alluded to it,

1808
02:21:26,384 --> 02:21:34,072
have to consider the different magnitudes of this proposal versus the actual needs for our schools, which I completely agree.

1809
02:21:34,272 --> 02:21:40,257
And I do agree that, you know, with huge raises for teachers in Paris.

1810
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:41,018
I really do.

1811
02:21:41,118 --> 02:21:43,040
And I'll stand by you with that.

1812
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:44,782
Before this meeting, I encouraged it.

1813
02:21:45,302 --> 02:21:48,745
I encouraged you guys to push for more future negotiations.

1814
02:21:50,447 --> 02:21:53,554
But again, we can't have these conversations without moving forward on this.

1815
02:21:53,815 --> 02:21:57,503
And so I know again, a lot of you will be disappointed.

1816
02:21:57,524 --> 02:21:59,588
I hope that

1817
02:22:01,192 --> 02:22:06,053
you guys will call me, email me, that we can have a conversation about this.

1818
02:22:06,333 --> 02:22:23,437
I know a lot of you know me personally, and a lot of you have friends who taught me as well, and I really encourage more conversation about this, and it'll help inform my views on this going forward, what a compromise looks like, because I think we can broker a better compromise, and that's really my priority.

1819
02:22:23,477 --> 02:22:27,258
So please reach out, please talk to me, and we'll have an open discussion about it.

1820
02:22:27,458 --> 02:22:27,738
Thank you.

1821
02:22:27,938 --> 02:22:28,579
Thank you, Councilor Sands.

1822
02:22:28,619 --> 02:22:29,979
Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Nye.

1823
02:22:30,285 --> 02:22:32,346
Thank you, Council Vice President.

1824
02:22:32,746 --> 02:22:33,867
And again, this isn't easy.

1825
02:22:34,227 --> 02:22:37,029
I think that this is what we agree to disagree.

1826
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:40,111
But I think this is what this council is about.

1827
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:45,282
not similar to what we're hearing that happens on the school side.

1828
02:22:45,382 --> 02:22:47,883
So I appreciate that, that we have this here.

1829
02:22:47,923 --> 02:22:54,466
So, but again, my intention was to listen to everybody, understanding, weighing the pros and the cons.

1830
02:22:55,066 --> 02:23:02,769
And as much as I respect former council, my motion was going to be received in place on file.

1831
02:23:02,829 --> 02:23:03,850
So that would be my motion.

1832
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:05,611
to receive and place on file.

1833
02:23:06,071 --> 02:23:11,856
Thank you, because I feel strongly enough that I've heard enough that we need to move forward without this as an issue.

1834
02:23:11,896 --> 02:23:15,058
Remember, we're going into this with a new council.

1835
02:23:15,619 --> 02:23:19,521
Why would we have them give them that responsibility?

1836
02:23:20,722 --> 02:23:22,924
That's what I feel that it's just not fair.

1837
02:23:23,504 --> 02:23:24,025
So thank you.

1838
02:23:24,665 --> 02:23:25,566
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1839
02:23:25,586 --> 02:23:28,328
We're going to go to Councilor Knight, and then we do have one more public comment on this.

1840
02:23:28,488 --> 02:23:29,749
Councilor Knight.

1841
02:23:29,809 --> 02:23:30,870
Mr. President, the more I think about this,

1842
02:23:34,138 --> 02:23:37,299
the more I think that there could potentially be a solution.

1843
02:23:37,959 --> 02:23:51,085
And, you know, week in and week out we come up here and we have Mina come up and talk to us about all the great things that the mayor's doing, all these grants and these outside contracts that they have and consultants that they have that are running the city.

1844
02:23:51,905 --> 02:23:57,907
And one of the things that the mayor's been touting as of recent is the fact that we have a grant.

1845
02:23:58,828 --> 02:24:02,209
We have this wonderful grant for a compensation equity study.

1846
02:24:03,473 --> 02:24:04,173
Now, we got the grant.

1847
02:24:04,253 --> 02:24:07,375
I don't know if the study started or not, right?

1848
02:24:07,875 --> 02:24:08,956
But we have these titles.

1849
02:24:09,376 --> 02:24:13,398
And they want to go around to every other surrounding community, and they're going to see what people in these titles make.

1850
02:24:15,139 --> 02:24:21,982
Why wouldn't we refer this paper to the city administration for inclusion in the compensation classification study that's provided by grant funding?

1851
02:24:22,442 --> 02:24:23,223
We're costing the city $0.

1852
02:24:23,343 --> 02:24:24,644
I would second that.

1853
02:24:24,704 --> 02:24:25,924
Take this off our table.

1854
02:24:27,265 --> 02:24:30,647
Let's see what the report says when it comes back to see if they're being compensated equitably.

1855
02:24:30,927 --> 02:24:31,547
I would second that.

1856
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:34,741
And if they are, they are.

1857
02:24:34,821 --> 02:24:42,325
And if they aren't, we've got a report there that's been done by an outside third party that's compared this with all those surrounding communities and people in like responsible positions.

1858
02:24:42,705 --> 02:24:47,688
And then we'll be able to provide something that's driven by data and it's not driven by desire.

1859
02:24:49,028 --> 02:24:49,669
Thank God tonight.

1860
02:24:49,729 --> 02:24:51,530
There are already motions on the floor.

1861
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:54,171
Would you like to include that as an amendment to the paper itself?

1862
02:24:55,575 --> 02:24:56,436
I'd like to make it as a motion.

1863
02:24:56,916 --> 02:24:58,117
Right, there's already motions on the floor.

1864
02:24:58,137 --> 02:25:00,999
I'm going to take them in order and it's possible that your motion won't be heard.

1865
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:04,061
Would you like to also put that as an amendment?

1866
02:25:04,381 --> 02:25:04,641
Sure.

1867
02:25:05,181 --> 02:25:05,402
All right.

1868
02:25:05,762 --> 02:25:06,542
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1869
02:25:08,103 --> 02:25:14,067
Going to go to Fire Eastford Tau, we know as Mr. Castanete on Zoom.

1870
02:25:14,127 --> 02:25:15,989
Name and address for the record, please.

1871
02:25:16,069 --> 02:25:19,771
Two minutes, and I will tell you when you have 30 seconds.

1872
02:25:19,951 --> 02:25:20,712
Mr. Castanete.

1873
02:25:26,144 --> 02:25:27,786
And address for the record, please.

1874
02:25:27,826 --> 02:25:28,847
Two minutes.

1875
02:25:29,328 --> 02:25:29,988
I'll tell you.

1876
02:25:30,008 --> 02:25:31,510
Thank you.

1877
02:25:31,630 --> 02:25:32,992
Cushing Street, Medford mask.

1878
02:25:33,012 --> 02:25:34,914
I want to say this.

1879
02:25:34,954 --> 02:25:36,356
Cushing Street, Medford mask.

1880
02:25:47,839 --> 02:25:50,321
This is one heck of a heinous-ness meeting tonight.

1881
02:25:50,741 --> 02:25:55,003
I must say, I want to say that our Council President Morell has the power.

1882
02:25:55,024 --> 02:25:57,745
Andrew, I'm going to have to mute you to think of your television.

1883
02:25:57,765 --> 02:26:00,067
We have a lot of feedback creating noise in the room.

1884
02:26:00,087 --> 02:26:01,147
We got the Council.

1885
02:26:02,068 --> 02:26:02,748
Can you hear me?

1886
02:26:03,249 --> 02:26:05,650
I believe it would cut their salary in half.

1887
02:26:08,072 --> 02:26:08,612
Sorry about that.

1888
02:26:08,672 --> 02:26:09,693
We'll try to go back to him.

1889
02:26:11,214 --> 02:26:13,375
Jamie, I'll go to you, then we'll see if we can get Mr. Castanetti.

1890
02:26:13,666 --> 02:26:14,246
Thank you.

1891
02:26:14,307 --> 02:26:15,708
Jamie Thompson, 86 Lawrence Road.

1892
02:26:16,788 --> 02:26:17,469
Just want to respond.

1893
02:26:17,789 --> 02:26:24,354
Councilor Collins spoke to what the City Council has the ability to do.

1894
02:26:25,895 --> 02:26:27,337
Councilor Knight, you spoke about diversity.

1895
02:26:27,357 --> 02:26:35,803
One of the things we have going on right now is the charter study, and I would push everyone to look at the opportunity to go to ward-based representation.

1896
02:26:36,424 --> 02:26:37,805
If you want diversity on the council,

1897
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:45,282
go to award based representation, you will have a different community, you'll have different representation, you will have a specific community that you will be representing.

1898
02:26:45,722 --> 02:26:49,483
You will not have to look to representing at large as an entire committee council.

1899
02:26:50,063 --> 02:26:53,524
Our as a committee, you'll look at lower costs for campaigning.

1900
02:26:54,185 --> 02:26:58,266
I know that funds have been talked about and that's where some of the salary compensation conversation.

1901
02:26:58,786 --> 02:27:05,231
has come from, but better representation and better opportunity comes from more based representation.

1902
02:27:05,652 --> 02:27:09,655
I really think that some of these conversations need to wait until that decision is made.

1903
02:27:10,416 --> 02:27:10,716
Thank you.

1904
02:27:11,877 --> 02:27:12,457
Thank you, Jamie.

1905
02:27:12,918 --> 02:27:16,241
All right, Andrew, I'm going to go back to you, but I need you to mute your television.

1906
02:27:20,124 --> 02:27:24,147
Thank you.

1907
02:27:24,187 --> 02:27:24,968
Thank you, Councilor.

1908
02:27:24,988 --> 02:27:25,548
Can you hear me?

1909
02:27:31,431 --> 02:27:51,117
blue bad connection it's a very bad connection i'm sorry blue you know you can submit comments and write it to the clerk all right any further public comment

1910
02:27:54,574 --> 02:28:03,737
Seeing none, there's a motion on the floor to refer to Committee of the Whole as amended by Councillor Morrell, and then Councillor Knight, and then Councillor Morrell, and then Councillor Knight.

1911
02:28:05,378 --> 02:28:07,659
On that motion, seconded by Councillor Collins.

1912
02:28:09,119 --> 02:28:09,940
All those in favour?

1913
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,681
All opposed?

1914
02:28:12,981 --> 02:28:13,521
Roll call.

1915
02:28:13,781 --> 02:28:15,482
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1916
02:28:15,502 --> 02:28:19,143
Do you want to read all the amendments?

1917
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:25,611
All right, I will summarize the amendments, and you can let me know if it's sufficient.

1918
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:34,013
There was an amendment initially from President Morrell to strike the whereas clauses referring to the majority membership of each body.

1919
02:28:34,573 --> 02:28:44,596
There was a further amendment to refer this to Committee of the Whole, along with the suggestion that this proposal be looked at as both a phase-in over time and potentially a different amount.

1920
02:28:45,296 --> 02:28:56,239
There were several motions by Counselor Knight made by email and text regarding legal questions in various sections of Massachusetts general law, and asking for those questions to be answered as part of this discussion.

1921
02:28:56,259 --> 02:29:06,203
And then I believe, Counselor Knight, that there's also an amendment that this, at some point, be referred to the compensation study that is being conducted by the administration for a response.

1922
02:29:08,403 --> 02:29:09,184
Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1923
02:29:14,815 --> 02:29:20,476
Councilor Scarpelli has a motion to receive a place on file, I'll take that after the first motion, that was seconded.

1924
02:29:20,696 --> 02:29:24,777
So on the motion, as amended, please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

1925
02:29:26,378 --> 02:29:26,938
Councilor Kerrio?

1926
02:29:27,138 --> 02:29:27,438
No.

1927
02:29:29,739 --> 02:29:30,299
Councilor Collins?

1928
02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:30,679
Yes.

1929
02:29:31,559 --> 02:29:31,999
Councilor Knight?

1930
02:29:32,359 --> 02:29:32,499
Yes.

1931
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:34,960
Councilor Scarpelli?

1932
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:35,080
No.

1933
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:36,960
Councilor Sang?

1934
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:37,220
Yes.

1935
02:29:38,621 --> 02:29:39,161
President Morrell?

1936
02:29:39,361 --> 02:29:39,521
Yes.

1937
02:29:40,632 --> 02:29:41,272
Vice President Pierce.

1938
02:29:41,472 --> 02:29:43,233
Yes, 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

1939
02:29:43,253 --> 02:29:46,354
The motion passes and the paper is referred to committee as amended.

1940
02:29:47,495 --> 02:29:48,495
Is there a motion on the floor?

1941
02:29:50,576 --> 02:29:55,458
Motion to revert to the regular order of business by President Morrell, seconded by

1942
02:29:57,208 --> 02:29:58,529
seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

1943
02:29:58,549 --> 02:29:59,270
All those in favour?

1944
02:29:59,951 --> 02:30:00,571
All those opposed?

1945
02:30:00,631 --> 02:30:01,212
Motion passes.

1946
02:30:01,232 --> 02:30:02,113
We'll average the regular order.

1947
02:30:02,133 --> 02:30:04,515
Would we like to take a five-minute recess?

1948
02:30:05,516 --> 02:30:08,139
Motion, President Morrell, five-minute recess, seconded by Councillor Knight.

1949
02:30:08,159 --> 02:30:08,879
All those in favour?

1950
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:09,981
All those opposed?

1951
02:30:10,041 --> 02:30:10,581
Motion passes.

1952
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:11,962
We are in recess for five minutes.

1953
02:47:19,058 --> 02:47:21,900
So, I believe we are back from recess.

1954
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:24,341
I know I motion to revert to regular business.

1955
02:47:24,361 --> 02:47:26,442
Someone would like to revert?

1956
02:47:26,462 --> 02:47:32,706
We have someone from public participation that I thought had left and he has been here the entire time and I feel like we should take him.

1957
02:47:33,667 --> 02:47:35,748
Motion to suspend the rules to take public participation.

1958
02:47:36,995 --> 02:47:40,578
The motion by Susan Baird to suspend the real estate public participation is seconded by Councillor Sang.

1959
02:47:40,738 --> 02:47:41,338
All those in favour?

1960
02:47:41,519 --> 02:47:41,659
Aye.

1961
02:47:42,099 --> 02:47:42,759
All those opposed?

1962
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:43,460
Motion passes.

1963
02:47:44,141 --> 02:47:44,601
Please come up.

1964
02:47:45,722 --> 02:47:48,844
And just name and address for the record, please.

1965
02:47:49,464 --> 02:47:50,765
Thank you for the microphone.

1966
02:47:50,805 --> 02:47:51,686
My name is Jim Crott.

1967
02:47:51,726 --> 02:47:53,888
I live at 22 Winter Street in Medford.

1968
02:47:53,908 --> 02:47:55,929
That's the hillside neighbourhood.

1969
02:47:55,949 --> 02:47:59,752
Wow, that was a really interesting session.

1970
02:48:02,025 --> 02:48:06,366
It's really eye-opening and saddening to hear about the dismal state of schools.

1971
02:48:06,706 --> 02:48:17,729
I actually feel a little bit embarrassed to talk to you about my petty issues, but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about things that are going on in my direct neighbourhood that I have a lot of experience with.

1972
02:48:18,469 --> 02:48:25,291
I've lived in Medford for 15 years now, and during this time there's been a lot of changes in the neighbourhood that I've been aware of.

1973
02:48:25,791 --> 02:48:30,332
A lot of these changes have been positive, like the Greenline extension, the new police

1974
02:48:31,588 --> 02:48:33,129
the new library and such and such.

1975
02:48:33,189 --> 02:48:42,194
A lot of people are doing construction on their houses and improving their houses, doing new roofs and dormers and porches and stuff, all of which is great, and I've done those things too.

1976
02:48:43,955 --> 02:48:59,083
What I'm noticing more recently, though, is that there is a lot of new—more and more gut renovations and new construction in Medford of accessory dwellings or attached houses in the neighbourhood.

1977
02:49:00,337 --> 02:49:11,640
In fact, there are two of these projects going on right now on my street, on Winter Street, and two have just completed on the corner of Winthrop and Summer Streets.

1978
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:20,682
As opposed to homeowners like me making modest improvements or renovations to the house, professional developers that come in to

1979
02:49:22,082 --> 02:49:33,531
build new construction stuff have an extended impact on the neighbourhood in terms of access and noise and all sorts of obstructions.

1980
02:49:34,312 --> 02:49:40,216
So what I want to talk about was three issues related to this that I've noticed.

1981
02:49:43,729 --> 02:49:49,670
Three aspects related to the professional developer activity that I'd like to discuss and have you guys consider.

1982
02:49:50,871 --> 02:50:00,753
Let me preface this by saying that I'm not opposed to development, and I think we need to build more houses, especially affordable houses.

1983
02:50:02,653 --> 02:50:06,654
But I think, as a community, we need to carefully think about the impacts of these developments.

1984
02:50:07,833 --> 02:50:20,380
Firstly, regarding the two projects on my street, at least two working-class families have been displaced, and now four $1.6 million condos are being built.

1985
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:25,883
So, across these two projects, the number of houses is going from three to four.

1986
02:50:26,703 --> 02:50:34,207
I would argue that the number of houses that are affordable to regular people is being reduced from three to zero.

1987
02:50:35,968 --> 02:50:36,989
Next, as far as I know,

1988
02:50:39,036 --> 02:50:49,978
when a developer is planning a new development or a large kind of housing complex, they're obliged to set aside some of those, a proportion of those for low-income families.

1989
02:50:50,058 --> 02:51:00,420
But if a developer comes in and one by one turns these regular houses into luxury condos, they can do as many of them as they like, so there are no restrictions there.

1990
02:51:00,460 --> 02:51:05,501
I think that this runs counter to what you guys are trying to achieve with the housing in Medford.

1991
02:51:06,301 --> 02:51:15,128
Thirdly, and probably on a little bit more of a selfish note, I'd like to discuss a little bit about what me, myself and my neighbours have been experiencing over the last two months.

1992
02:51:15,949 --> 02:51:21,494
We're about two months into this construction process and I'm told it's going to last about 10 months, eight to 10 months.

1993
02:51:24,075 --> 02:51:30,299
So just as a little taste of the things that we're experiencing is that, you know, workers are arriving before 7 a.m.

1994
02:51:30,419 --> 02:51:31,279
six days a week.

1995
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:44,366
Most of the time they wait until seven before they actively start working, but they often arrive in big trucks before seven and keep them running, or they start their excavator up to warm it up before seven so they can start on the dot.

1996
02:51:45,327 --> 02:51:51,971
They excavate all day for more than a week straight with dump trucks coming in and out all day, you know, causing a lot of vibration and noise.

1997
02:51:53,528 --> 02:51:55,849
Frequent noise greater than 80 decibels.

1998
02:51:56,529 --> 02:52:03,431
Digging holes in the street without any prior warning, verbal or with any signs, no cones, nothing.

1999
02:52:04,991 --> 02:52:06,832
Repeatedly blocking driveways.

2000
02:52:06,852 --> 02:52:10,953
We have to ask people to move their truck or move their excavator so we can get in and out of our driveway.

2001
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:20,935
blocking the street, rubble, excess dirt, debris and various trash on the street from food and drink containers and construction material and dust in the air.

2002
02:52:22,336 --> 02:52:25,298
Excavation undermines neighbouring property.

2003
02:52:25,718 --> 02:52:36,025
Just last Saturday, my neighbour, Mark, two doors down, had his property undermined and there was a section of his fence that was just floating in the air.

2004
02:52:37,329 --> 02:52:41,151
The guys also piled up dirt on my fence and pushed our fence over.

2005
02:52:41,171 --> 02:52:49,275
There are reserve spots on the street with cones and parking large trailers on the street, just some of the things.

2006
02:52:50,115 --> 02:52:55,698
When you take all these things together, they're all kind of individually minor, but they add up.

2007
02:52:56,158 --> 02:52:59,740
At the end of the day, it makes it impossible for us to use our houses normally.

2008
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:03,802
I'd like to kindly request that the Council consider.

2009
02:53:04,929 --> 02:53:23,788
that these longer-term, high-impact construction projects by professional developers really negatively affect the neighbours and make it difficult to work from home, makes it difficult to find parking, kids to do their homework or study for their exams, or even just to sleep in on Saturday.

2010
02:53:25,674 --> 02:53:40,302
They also may create additional costs for neighbours, including increased cleaning needs of the houses and cars and noise mitigation devices like noise cancelling headphones if you want to work at home.

2011
02:53:41,876 --> 02:53:47,222
If it were for a few weeks or a couple of months for someone to do an extension on their house, that's fine.

2012
02:53:47,242 --> 02:53:58,134
But what I'm talking about are professional developers that are coming here, making a bunch of money from these projects, laughing all the way to the bank while we're suffering for a year at a time on these projects.

2013
02:54:02,423 --> 02:54:31,507
In light of these facts, I'd like to suggest that the construction permitting process in Medford be re-evaluated to consider whether work is being done by a homeowner or a professional developer, and also to consider the length and severity of impact to the neighbouring residents, with potentially the cost of permits increasing with the impact and duration.

2014
02:54:33,147 --> 02:54:41,298
To finish off, I'd like to reiterate that I think the current trajectory of development is undermining what the city is trying to achieve in their housing production plan.

2015
02:54:41,318 --> 02:54:43,321
I didn't read the whole thing, but I skimmed it a little bit.

2016
02:54:44,133 --> 02:54:54,959
but because developers are focusing on the production of expensive luxury condos at the cost of affordable and smaller houses that regular people can afford.

2017
02:54:55,880 --> 02:54:56,680
So, that's all I have.

2018
02:54:56,700 --> 02:54:57,020
Thank you.

2019
02:54:57,521 --> 02:54:58,381
DEPUTY MAYOR WILLIAMS.

2020
02:54:58,401 --> 02:54:58,601
Thank you.

2021
02:54:58,641 --> 02:54:59,122
Councillor GRIFFITHS.

2022
02:54:59,142 --> 02:54:59,662
Councillor GRIFFITHS.

2023
02:54:59,682 --> 02:55:03,244
Madam President, if you can, I think that—we really can't debate it, but what we can do

2024
02:55:04,139 --> 02:55:07,461
Unfortunately, when you come, developers are smart, so they're not stupid.

2025
02:55:07,481 --> 02:55:11,443
They're trying to circumvent the system.

2026
02:55:11,483 --> 02:55:21,249
But what we can do, if we can, if we can share your information with the clerk to get the information to the code enforcement officer.

2027
02:55:23,570 --> 02:55:34,222
Because what you're saying, what they're doing, we have everything in place for that because we do have some developers out there that take total advantage of this in our community.

2028
02:55:34,242 --> 02:55:39,528
Yeah, it's kind of like death by a thousand cuts and they also do it and then ask for forgiveness later.

2029
02:55:39,548 --> 02:55:41,290
I don't want to do that every day.

2030
02:55:41,950 --> 02:55:46,074
You know, we can be pretty hard on some developers and I think that and making sure that they told the line.

2031
02:55:46,114 --> 02:55:59,648
So if we can make sure that our code enforcement officer has that, that address, and they get out there tomorrow, I'll make a phone call tomorrow as well to the code enforcement office to make sure they come out and set up a regular, you know, visit where they check in periodically throughout the day.

2032
02:55:59,808 --> 02:56:01,230
Yeah, because if it's that bad,

2033
02:56:01,940 --> 02:56:08,907
I mean, the most ridiculous one was when they just started digging a hole in front of our street without any warning, in front of my house without any warning.

2034
02:56:09,487 --> 02:56:14,252
Excavator in front of my driveway, we have to request permission to exit our own house.

2035
02:56:15,633 --> 02:56:19,997
Yeah, so we're at Winter Street.

2036
02:56:20,137 --> 02:56:26,183
I think that that property, I'm at 22, they're at 28, because there's a number or two missing, they're right next door.

2037
02:56:28,573 --> 02:56:32,797
You want to just list the infractions out in the email we have?

2038
02:56:32,857 --> 02:56:34,359
I'll just copy and paste.

2039
02:56:34,379 --> 02:56:36,361
Yeah, so copy and paste, and we'll make sure we get that.

2040
02:56:37,762 --> 02:56:38,783
Go to Councillor Collins.

2041
02:56:39,223 --> 02:56:45,289
I just want to say, excuse me, thank you for bringing your concerns to us tonight.

2042
02:56:46,430 --> 02:56:53,137
Glad to hear that we have some action steps we can quickly take on the construction infractions piece of things.

2043
02:56:53,875 --> 02:56:57,577
really appreciate you speaking to, especially appreciate you actually reading the housing production plan.

2044
02:56:57,937 --> 02:57:00,298
I skimmed it, I didn't read the whole thing.

2045
02:57:00,338 --> 02:57:03,039
Well, I think that's probably the average way to read it.

2046
02:57:04,159 --> 02:57:09,962
But I think that your comments resonate with a lot of the work that we've laid out for ourselves on the council.

2047
02:57:10,002 --> 02:57:14,784
We've been trying to work on this term and we have a lot more ahead coming up over the next two years.

2048
02:57:15,224 --> 02:57:23,227
I think that aligning the goals of the housing production plan in terms of making sure that the development we're building is not exclusively or heavily weighted to luxury development,

2049
02:57:23,846 --> 02:57:31,734
serving a wide range of users and households is deeply embedded in the work that we're trying to do through our zoning overhaul which we're very much gearing up for.

2050
02:57:31,754 --> 02:57:45,628
We have a condo conversion ordinance that's still in progress so there are some, there's some ongoing council projects that touch on exactly what you're speaking so just encourage you to, you know, we'd love to, you know, have you be engaged in the public process and those as they unfold and

2051
02:57:47,210 --> 02:57:49,672
These are projects that have come about because of what the community has said.

2052
02:57:49,692 --> 02:58:04,323
We want housing to look like and not look like in Medford, so we welcome your continuing participation in the high-level policy that we try to implement to make sure that we don't just turn into a community of luxury condos where nobody can afford to live in.

2053
02:58:04,863 --> 02:58:13,570
Literally within 200 feet, there's two and then two and then another, say, six on the corner.

2054
02:58:14,997 --> 02:58:27,376
Winthrop and some, it's just, you know, it's a formula they have, buy these regular houses, put all the, you know, bells and whistles on it and flip it over for like a million dollars.

2055
02:58:27,457 --> 02:58:28,879
I don't know who can afford that.

2056
02:58:32,042 --> 02:58:36,986
I'll be super brief, but I wanted to thank you for coming and sharing all these concerns.

2057
02:58:37,266 --> 02:58:43,591
Like what Councillor Collins said, this is a top priority for us going on into the next term.

2058
02:58:43,831 --> 02:58:48,455
And we have the whole zoning reform process going on, phase two of that.

2059
02:58:49,295 --> 02:58:51,677
And we'll be looking at a lot of policy ideas that might touch it.

2060
02:58:51,697 --> 02:58:53,879
I would, again, encourage you to stay in contact.

2061
02:58:54,379 --> 02:58:55,220
Please let us know.

2062
02:58:56,421 --> 02:59:03,232
what's going on in their neighborhood as well, and we'll try our best to refer to the code enforcement officers in the future.

2063
02:59:03,472 --> 02:59:09,281
And if there's anything policy-wise, any ideas that you might have, feel free to reach out to us as well.

2064
02:59:09,742 --> 02:59:09,982
Thank you.

2065
02:59:13,607 --> 02:59:15,428
I'll be super brief if we want to move to the next item.

2066
02:59:16,108 --> 02:59:22,031
I just want to be clear that what's happening here is that the land is so valuable and the prices are so high that it's worth building luxury units.

2067
02:59:22,592 --> 02:59:26,894
And they're going to keep doing that unless we allow them to build something else on the site.

2068
02:59:27,034 --> 02:59:29,975
And that's likely a larger number of smaller, affordable units.

2069
02:59:29,995 --> 02:59:30,315
Thank you.

2070
02:59:31,476 --> 02:59:31,756
Thank you.

2071
02:59:31,876 --> 02:59:33,337
Thank you so much for bearing with us.

2072
02:59:33,797 --> 02:59:37,979
Madam President, if we can take paper 23466 so this gentleman can get to go home tonight.

2073
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:40,200
Out of order.

2074
02:59:40,961 --> 02:59:41,301
What page?

2075
02:59:42,698 --> 02:59:48,599
23466 on page 14.

2076
02:59:49,219 --> 03:00:07,863
23466 offered by Councillor Carviello, be it so resolved that Medford City Council vote to authorize the Mayor of the City of Medford to petition the General Court for a special act in the form set forth below, providing that Medford Retirement Board be permitted to retire Joseph Albino, a former uniformed member of the City of Medford Fire Department who was involuntarily retired for accidental disability retirement,

2077
03:00:10,143 --> 03:00:33,090
for superannuation retirement as provided by sections 5 and 10 of chapter 32 of the general laws of Massachusetts provided, however, that the general court may make clerical or editorial changes of form only to the bill unless the mayor approves amendments to the bill before enactment by the general court, provided further that the mayor is hereby authorized to approve amendments which shall be within the scope of the general public objectives of this petition.

2078
03:00:34,231 --> 03:00:34,891
Thank you, Madam President.

2079
03:00:34,911 --> 03:00:37,752
So for those who don't know, Mr. Albano was a

2080
03:00:38,547 --> 03:00:47,896
He's a business owner in Medford, and he was injured fighting a fire some years ago in 2001, and he was able to return to work.

2081
03:00:48,196 --> 03:00:54,342
So in 2019, the fire chief filed an application for an involuntary accidental disability retirement.

2082
03:00:54,821 --> 03:00:55,761
with the retirement board.

2083
03:00:56,542 --> 03:01:01,963
The board over Mr. Albano's opposition approved the chief's request and Mr. Albano was put on disability requirement.

2084
03:01:02,543 --> 03:01:21,869
While Mr. Albano was aware of the limitation on outside areas for disability retirees, he had no idea that PERAC, who's a retirement group, would treat his necessary business expenses, that is to purchase or replacement of vehicles to comply with federal relation as personal income exposed to a business expense.

2085
03:01:22,284 --> 03:01:28,430
So had Mr. Urbano known about that, he would have accepted a different form of retirement.

2086
03:01:28,910 --> 03:01:40,662
And his attorney said, he could probably explain it a little more better than I can, but what it is, the gentleman's trying to get his retirement so he could live.

2087
03:01:42,464 --> 03:01:46,908
And his attorney would probably explain it better than I can.

2088
03:01:48,066 --> 03:01:48,806
Thank you, Counselor.

2089
03:01:48,886 --> 03:01:49,767
Is this on right now?

2090
03:01:49,787 --> 03:01:49,987
Yep.

2091
03:01:50,047 --> 03:01:51,148
And just name it just for the record.

2092
03:01:51,388 --> 03:01:53,569
So my name is Jerry McDonough.

2093
03:01:53,589 --> 03:01:56,231
I live at 13 Hollis Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2094
03:01:56,511 --> 03:01:59,172
I'm an attorney practicing public retirement law.

2095
03:01:59,672 --> 03:02:01,293
I represent Mr. Albano.

2096
03:02:01,854 --> 03:02:03,435
And as Counselor said,

2097
03:02:04,495 --> 03:02:08,159
First off, I want to thank you all for taking the time to listen to me this evening.

2098
03:02:09,019 --> 03:02:18,408
We first filed a piece of legislation to deal with this in the House of Representatives, and the House clerk said, no, you have to do a home rule petition in Medford.

2099
03:02:19,727 --> 03:02:23,791
contacted Adam, who gave me a little bit of instruction on how to arrange for that.

2100
03:02:24,252 --> 03:02:29,677
But as Councillor was saying, it's been a long road for Mr. Albano.

2101
03:02:29,737 --> 03:02:36,024
He founded a company in 1985, a transportation company that has been doing fairly well.

2102
03:02:36,524 --> 03:02:41,709
And around 2001, he fulfilled a lifelong dream and became a Medford firefighter.

2103
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:43,592
And he loved the job.

2104
03:02:43,912 --> 03:02:48,537
He wanted to continue on that till he reached the maximum retirement age of 65.

2105
03:02:48,597 --> 03:02:55,145
But in 2017, he was injured fighting a fire on Henry Avenue, and he was put on injured in duty leave.

2106
03:02:55,840 --> 03:03:15,935
and he wanted to come back to work, but I understand the problems that municipalities have when people are out on injured on duty leave and they have a position that they can't fill, so the fire chief filed for an involuntary retirement, and Mr. Albano was involuntarily retired on accidental disability retirement.

2107
03:03:17,136 --> 03:03:19,498
He had no say in that.

2108
03:03:19,538 --> 03:03:22,701
He tried to oppose it, but it didn't get him anywhere.

2109
03:03:22,841 --> 03:03:26,484
And so he now has restrictions on his outside income.

2110
03:03:26,644 --> 03:03:31,367
And the problem that he has is that there's a certain amount, there's a tax

2111
03:03:32,625 --> 03:03:45,015
you know, provision that treats transportation business expenses, and he has a transportation company, treats transportation costs differently than other business expenses.

2112
03:03:45,556 --> 03:03:55,504
So while you might buy a computer for your business and be able to deduct that from the business expenses, you know, he pays, he paid $300,000 and the business paid $300,000 in 2021 for transportation equipment.

2113
03:04:00,568 --> 03:04:04,130
But Parak considers that to be his own personal income.

2114
03:04:04,751 --> 03:04:08,073
So consequently, he doesn't get any retirement benefits at all.

2115
03:04:08,093 --> 03:04:10,995
That's because he's on this accidental disability retirement.

2116
03:04:11,575 --> 03:04:19,160
And if he had known that this is a new interpretation of the law by Parak in the last few years since Mr. Albano retired, he couldn't even have known of that.

2117
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:36,229
back there at the time, but he would prefer just to have an ordinary, regular retirement that he worked for over the amount of time that he spent as a firefighter in the city of Medford and not have to deal with disability and these earnings restrictions and things like that.

2118
03:04:36,829 --> 03:04:40,333
And so he's, you know, he would like to give the business to his sons.

2119
03:04:40,453 --> 03:04:44,617
His sons have been doing most of the work of the business since he became a firefighter.

2120
03:04:45,378 --> 03:04:57,830
And he's unable at this point in time to transfer the business because he's under a lot of stress, litigation stress, because his business was involved in a terrible accident.

2121
03:04:58,510 --> 03:05:01,631
and he can't give the business away at this point in time.

2122
03:05:01,731 --> 03:05:03,952
So he's kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.

2123
03:05:04,592 --> 03:05:15,475
So all we want to do is try to get a home rule petition filed with the legislature to convert his retirement from an accidental disability retirement to a superannuation retirement.

2124
03:05:15,875 --> 03:05:17,956
Superannuation retirement is much lower

2125
03:05:18,696 --> 03:05:22,779
Then, the disability retirement, disability retirement is 72%.

2126
03:05:22,999 --> 03:05:29,424
I think he'd be getting about 40% or something like that if it's on superannuation, but he wouldn't have these other restrictions.

2127
03:05:29,904 --> 03:05:37,930
Plus, he has an ex-spouse that he has to pay part of his retirement allowance to.

2128
03:05:38,390 --> 03:05:41,613
His ex-spouse is getting her half of the retirement allowance.

2129
03:05:42,333 --> 03:05:53,915
and which is fair but you know he now has to make up for every year he's missing his retirement allowance he has to wait two years because he has to pay the whole

2130
03:05:54,858 --> 03:06:00,461
you know, amount of his of his retirement allowance back to the to the bed for retirement for it.

2131
03:06:01,062 --> 03:06:17,692
So we would just respectfully ask that that you consider this as a matter of basic fairness for somebody who worked for the city for so long and, you know, wrecked his, you know, wrecked his health fighting a fire that if it could be helped some way, we appreciate it very much.

2132
03:06:18,413 --> 03:06:19,013
Thank you so much.

2133
03:06:19,773 --> 03:06:20,694
Any discussion on the council?

2134
03:06:28,911 --> 03:06:30,792
It needs a vote to send it to the mayor to approve it.

2135
03:06:31,133 --> 03:06:31,953
Send it to the state house.

2136
03:06:33,654 --> 03:06:34,655
Yeah.

2137
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:35,335
Yes.

2138
03:06:35,715 --> 03:06:37,096
Motion to ask for the home rule petition.

2139
03:06:37,476 --> 03:06:39,678
Send it to the mayor to sign and send it to the state house.

2140
03:06:41,639 --> 03:06:46,561
So on the motion of Councilor Carvalho, seconded by Councilor Sang, is that a roll call?

2141
03:06:46,842 --> 03:06:46,982
Yes.

2142
03:06:47,022 --> 03:06:52,925
It's a home rule petition.

2143
03:06:53,145 --> 03:06:54,086
Where's the mayor on this?

2144
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:55,310
Excuse me?

2145
03:06:55,530 --> 03:06:57,752
The mayor, has she been, did she say she would advance this?

2146
03:06:58,192 --> 03:06:59,853
Oh, I haven't spoken to the mayor at all.

2147
03:06:59,873 --> 03:07:03,476
We have to, you know, the first place we go is here to the council, so.

2148
03:07:03,676 --> 03:07:06,638
Okay, so if we do this, then the mayor has to approve and then it'll go.

2149
03:07:06,658 --> 03:07:08,599
The mayor would have to approve it or amend it.

2150
03:07:08,679 --> 03:07:10,460
She can change it in any way she wants, but.

2151
03:07:10,520 --> 03:07:10,660
Okay.

2152
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:16,904
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on my right.

2153
03:07:17,945 --> 03:07:18,585
Vice President Peers.

2154
03:07:18,746 --> 03:07:18,986
Yes.

2155
03:07:19,866 --> 03:07:20,427
Councilor Kerrio.

2156
03:07:20,467 --> 03:07:20,647
Yes.

2157
03:07:32,268 --> 03:07:32,468
Yes.

2158
03:07:32,708 --> 03:07:34,730
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2159
03:07:34,750 --> 03:07:35,571
The motion passes.

2160
03:07:35,611 --> 03:07:36,652
Well, thank you very much.

2161
03:07:36,892 --> 03:07:37,193
Thank you.

2162
03:07:37,233 --> 03:07:38,574
I guess some people are leaving.

2163
03:07:39,395 --> 03:07:44,140
Councilor Carrillo is leaving soon, and you're leaving, Madam President.

2164
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:47,143
So thank you for your service, and thank you all for your service.

2165
03:07:47,243 --> 03:07:47,583
Thank you.

2166
03:07:47,903 --> 03:07:48,184
Thank you.

2167
03:07:48,204 --> 03:07:48,684
I appreciate it.

2168
03:07:48,724 --> 03:07:49,585
Thanks for sticking around.

2169
03:07:50,045 --> 03:07:51,547
I know you had to, but I appreciate it.

2170
03:07:57,409 --> 03:07:58,469
We're to the regular order.

2171
03:07:58,810 --> 03:08:01,671
Yeah, we need to take a couple more.

2172
03:08:03,051 --> 03:08:03,851
There's a couple more.

2173
03:08:03,891 --> 03:08:04,752
Yeah, it's a regular order.

2174
03:08:04,772 --> 03:08:08,393
All right, motion from Vice President Behrs to revert to regular order of business.

2175
03:08:08,433 --> 03:08:09,173
Second by Councilor Seng.

2176
03:08:09,193 --> 03:08:09,814
All those in favor?

2177
03:08:10,294 --> 03:08:10,534
Aye.

2178
03:08:10,594 --> 03:08:10,894
Opposed?

2179
03:08:10,914 --> 03:08:11,674
Motion passes.

2180
03:08:12,155 --> 03:08:13,895
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

2181
03:08:13,975 --> 03:08:15,956
Hearings, two, three, four, four, eight.

2182
03:08:15,996 --> 03:08:19,217
Notice of a public hearing, Medford City Council, Chapter 94, Zoning.

2183
03:08:19,777 --> 03:08:24,559
The Medford City Council will conduct a public hearing on Tuesday, December 12th, 2023 at 7 p.m.

2184
03:08:24,599 --> 03:08:26,720
in the City Council Chamber on the second floor

2185
03:08:27,307 --> 03:08:38,078
of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, 02155, and via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a proposed amendment to the City of Medford zoning ordinance and zoning map.

2186
03:08:38,658 --> 03:08:41,541
A Zoom link to this meeting will be posted no later than December 8, 2023.

2187
03:08:43,001 --> 03:08:58,060
The purpose of the amendment is to comply with Section 3A of MGL-40A MBTA Community Zoning Law by establishing a new zoning overlay within a half-mile radius of the Wellington MBTA Orange Line station that will allow multifamily housing and mixed-use development as of right.

2188
03:08:58,686 --> 03:09:11,053
A copy of the full text of the amendment is available in the office of the city clerk and on the city's website www.medfordma.org slash department slash planning dash development dash sustainability by clicking on current city board filings.

2189
03:09:11,493 --> 03:09:16,235
For additional information and aids for accommodations aids call the Medford city clerk's office at 781-393-2425 TDD 781-393-2516.

2190
03:09:21,457 --> 03:09:28,879
as advertised in the Boston Herald on October 30th and November 6th, 2023, by order of the Medford City Council, signed Adam Hurtubise, City Clerk.

2191
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:33,301
So this was referred out to, do you wanna talk about the process?

2192
03:09:33,341 --> 03:09:44,104
You might say it better than me, but we do have, the council has received comments from the CD board, but I'll hand it to our planner and director of PDS to just remind us of the process.

2193
03:09:46,285 --> 03:09:47,365
Sorry, my laptop died.

2194
03:09:47,405 --> 03:09:48,766
I didn't bring my charger.

2195
03:09:51,350 --> 03:09:56,331
I don't have the dates off the top of my head.

2196
03:09:56,971 --> 03:10:07,094
Anyways, so we were here recently.

2197
03:10:16,015 --> 03:10:18,256
It was on this December 6th that we came here and had

2198
03:10:19,782 --> 03:10:24,746
The referral meeting, we basically explained what it was, but that wasn't the public hearing.

2199
03:10:25,586 --> 03:10:33,331
And per chapter 48, it was referred to the city board who held a public hearing over the course of two meetings.

2200
03:10:34,232 --> 03:10:47,321
There was some feedback, and they voted five to one to approve the version that came back to you with a reduced

2201
03:10:48,510 --> 03:10:54,434
parking requirements and correcting a scrivener's error and to reduce the height from five to four.

2202
03:10:54,454 --> 03:11:03,900
I explained the rationale for that in the memo, but we have Emily Innis, our consultant, that is being provided by MHP.

2203
03:11:04,180 --> 03:11:05,581
So fortunately, we are not paying for this.

2204
03:11:07,622 --> 03:11:12,966
And she can walk us through the details and nuts and bolts of what's in the ordinance.

2205
03:11:14,987 --> 03:11:15,247
Thank you.

2206
03:11:15,267 --> 03:11:17,969
Before we turn it over to Emily, are there any comments from the council at this time?

2207
03:11:20,575 --> 03:11:21,356
Thank you, Planner Evans.

2208
03:11:21,436 --> 03:11:26,400
I will turn it over to Emily Ennis to just remind us where we are and what's before us.

2209
03:11:33,126 --> 03:11:34,207
Thank you, Madam President.

2210
03:11:34,288 --> 03:11:36,590
I just had to wait to be allowed to be unmuted.

2211
03:11:38,391 --> 03:11:41,254
For the record, my name is Emily Ennis from Ennis Associates.

2212
03:11:42,032 --> 03:11:53,761
And as Danielle said, I have been assigned by MHP Mass Housing Partnership as part of technical assistance to assist the city with developing the zoning for compliance with 3A.

2213
03:11:54,922 --> 03:11:59,766
I appeared in addition to the work that the CD board has been doing.

2214
03:12:00,226 --> 03:12:08,673
I appeared in front of the committee of the whole on just checking my dates, November 29th to present this initially.

2215
03:12:09,833 --> 03:12:17,818
So the zoning is applicable, it is an overlay district, which means it sits on top of the existing district.

2216
03:12:17,898 --> 03:12:29,204
That means that somebody who owns property has a choice of using the existing zoning or using the overlay zoning, whichever is more beneficial to the project that they're trying to do.

2217
03:12:29,364 --> 03:12:32,906
So it's important to understand that property owners have a choice.

2218
03:12:33,406 --> 03:12:37,689
This particular zoning is for the Wellington station area.

2219
03:12:38,029 --> 03:12:51,539
This is an area that was identified in the recently approved Medford comprehensive plan as an area that could use additional attention and development as a station area.

2220
03:12:52,239 --> 03:12:57,063
It is a critical part of your city strategy for compliance.

2221
03:12:57,883 --> 03:13:05,888
The zoning itself is based on the sample zoning that was distributed by the executive office of housing and livable communities.

2222
03:13:06,448 --> 03:13:12,012
And the key was to make sure that the zoning fit the needs of Medford for this area.

2223
03:13:12,652 --> 03:13:30,892
So with the edits that were or the recommendations from the CD board, we're looking at a minimum lot size of currently a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet of a suggestion to make on that our recommendation to City Council maximum building coverage of 80%.

2224
03:13:32,873 --> 03:13:44,479
Minimum number of stories of two and a maximum of four, but with bonus incentives, a maximum of nine stories that's consistent with some of the existing buildings in the area.

2225
03:13:46,379 --> 03:13:56,144
Maximum height of 80 feet, again, with the bonus incentive of 140, again, consistent with stories for nine stories with potential ground floor use.

2226
03:13:57,795 --> 03:14:03,579
front yard setbacks, side yard setbacks and rear yard setbacks are consistent with the area.

2227
03:14:04,199 --> 03:14:11,465
I think the important component for you all to be aware of is this idea of the development incentives bonus.

2228
03:14:13,506 --> 03:14:20,711
And the idea is that there would be, sorry, I can hear laughter, so can you hear me all right?

2229
03:14:21,732 --> 03:14:24,214
Oh no, sorry, the clerk was just reminding me to do something.

2230
03:14:24,614 --> 03:14:25,315
Okay, fair enough.

2231
03:14:27,304 --> 03:14:29,725
I wanted to make sure I wasn't ever saying my welcome with zoning.

2232
03:14:31,365 --> 03:14:42,109
The development incentives are for additional stories for developments that meet city goals and those city goals are for affordability.

2233
03:14:42,649 --> 03:14:57,016
for developments that is responsive to concerns about climate change and helps to adapt or mitigate to that climate change, or that provides for an active ground floor use.

2234
03:14:57,196 --> 03:15:04,060
So, as I'm sure you're all aware, the MBTA Communities Act does not allow you to mandate ground floor use.

2235
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:15,425
So in areas like, for example, the Wellington station area where it's important to continue to have a mix of uses providing a development incentive is a good way to encourage that.

2236
03:15:16,185 --> 03:15:17,886
Same thing is true of affordability.

2237
03:15:17,906 --> 03:15:24,829
The MBTA Communities Act has a limited recommendation or ability to institute affordability.

2238
03:15:25,449 --> 03:15:33,233
The idea of a development incentive allows for the developments to offer either more affordable units or deeper affordability or both.

2239
03:15:33,813 --> 03:15:41,717
Again, being respectful of the city's needs for different housing types and different levels of affordability.

2240
03:15:41,837 --> 03:15:54,284
Finally, there's a development incentive or a floor incentive for certifying buildings as either net and zero emissions or as certified as legal or lead gold or lead platinum.

2241
03:15:54,724 --> 03:16:01,168
Again, being responsive to concerns and this also came out of the comprehensive planning around climate resiliency.

2242
03:16:02,961 --> 03:16:09,003
The zoning also allows for reduction in off-street parking.

2243
03:16:09,423 --> 03:16:14,125
This was a recommendation from the CD board for to 0.5 spaces.

2244
03:16:14,905 --> 03:16:27,449
There are bicycle parking spaces required, and then there are also site plan development standards to be used in the site plan review process by the CD board.

2245
03:16:28,529 --> 03:16:31,970
Most of these are either consistent with what was in the sample zoning,

2246
03:16:32,470 --> 03:16:36,235
or specifically targeted to developments in this area.

2247
03:16:36,875 --> 03:16:46,927
The only change that I would recommend post CD board and this was just as we reran the numbers to make sure that any changes recommended by the CD board stayed in compliance.

2248
03:16:48,148 --> 03:17:02,159
We noted that reducing the lot size from 10,000 square feet to 7,000 square feet would mean that all non publicly owned lots in the area would be conforming so that is a change that we would recommend.

2249
03:17:02,819 --> 03:17:09,945
And I think I'll stop there with a summary and if you all have any questions, I'm happy to answer them, or defer back to Alicia and Daniel.

2250
03:17:12,022 --> 03:17:12,322
Thank you.

2251
03:17:13,342 --> 03:17:18,523
And I know it was stated, but I just want to remind that the council did ask a number of questions when we met on this on the 29th.

2252
03:17:18,583 --> 03:17:22,384
So if questions are asked tonight, it may reflect that fact.

2253
03:17:22,424 --> 03:17:26,324
So I don't want that to come across as a lack of interest for anyone watching.

2254
03:17:26,344 --> 03:17:28,445
We did ask a number of questions that were helpful.

2255
03:17:29,125 --> 03:17:29,745
Vice President Behrs.

2256
03:17:30,345 --> 03:17:31,225
Thank you, Madam President.

2257
03:17:31,645 --> 03:17:34,486
Thank you, everyone, for sticking around on this one.

2258
03:17:34,626 --> 03:17:35,306
I know it's important.

2259
03:17:35,326 --> 03:17:36,286
I know we have a deadline on it.

2260
03:17:36,626 --> 03:17:40,807
My one question, sorry, and I just didn't catch it, Emily, was,

2261
03:17:42,312 --> 03:17:48,096
Was that a reduction in the square footage, an additional recommendation beyond what the CD board has recommended?

2262
03:17:48,356 --> 03:17:53,159
And that's the recommendation of, that's your recommendation, or is it the staff's recommendation?

2263
03:17:54,333 --> 03:17:55,694
That is my recommendation.

2264
03:17:56,154 --> 03:18:01,198
As I was reviewing the numbers, I did discuss it with Danielle and Alicia.

2265
03:18:01,898 --> 03:18:06,081
But as I was reviewing the numbers, I noticed that there were a few non-conforming lots.

2266
03:18:07,242 --> 03:18:09,944
Looking at them, a couple of them were publicly owned.

2267
03:18:10,304 --> 03:18:15,768
So we just wanted to make sure that all lots in the area would conform with the new zoning in terms of the dimensional standards.

2268
03:18:17,209 --> 03:18:17,369
OK.

2269
03:18:17,989 --> 03:18:19,890
And I can respond to that through Madam President.

2270
03:18:21,465 --> 03:18:33,068
and it was also something that was brought up at the city board member, the one dissenting vote thought that the lot size was too big, but we were able to run the model in time to find out the implications.

2271
03:18:33,188 --> 03:18:39,870
So it wasn't, no one felt comfortable voting on something that hadn't been modeled and not tested.

2272
03:18:40,230 --> 03:18:48,452
So in this intervening time, we were able to run that again and see that it would, I think it adds like 21 or something units

2273
03:18:50,336 --> 03:19:01,022
but that could be possible, but it also made all of the non-public lots buildable rather than unbuildable with the overlay.

2274
03:19:01,702 --> 03:19:02,602
Okay, great.

2275
03:19:02,963 --> 03:19:03,663
That's helpful context.

2276
03:19:03,683 --> 03:19:07,305
I was wondering what the offer was on the recommendation.

2277
03:19:07,505 --> 03:19:09,846
So I was wondering why there was one to center.

2278
03:19:11,227 --> 03:19:12,127
But that's helpful context.

2279
03:19:13,448 --> 03:19:14,649
I don't have any further questions.

2280
03:19:14,809 --> 03:19:17,110
After questions and comment, I would move to approve

2281
03:19:17,540 --> 03:19:26,745
and adopt the recommendations of the Community Development Board, as well as the recommendation to change the lot size from 10,000 to 7,000, if I got it right, square feet.

2282
03:19:28,157 --> 03:19:30,298
and I'll hold until discussion is complete.

2283
03:19:30,858 --> 03:19:31,699
Thank you.

2284
03:19:31,819 --> 03:19:32,239
Councilor Sanchez.

2285
03:19:32,459 --> 03:19:41,043
I wanted to keep it simple and reiterate how grateful I am for all the work that you guys and Emily has been doing for our city.

2286
03:19:43,164 --> 03:19:51,728
We know it's not been easy to work with the state government when it comes to getting the details about how we can be in compliance with the MTA Communities Act.

2287
03:19:52,288 --> 03:20:01,230
But I think this solution is something for people in Wellington to be very excited about, for residents of our city to be very excited about.

2288
03:20:01,710 --> 03:20:15,913
I know there's some excited chatter about potentially having more commercial or more people in the area, making it more walkable and bringing our attention to the walkability of the area as well, forcing us again into action.

2289
03:20:16,193 --> 03:20:19,834
And I just wanted to thank you for your hard work on this.

2290
03:20:22,213 --> 03:20:22,694
Councilor Collins.

2291
03:20:23,256 --> 03:20:24,398
Thank you, President Morrell.

2292
03:20:24,499 --> 03:20:25,200
I'll echo that.

2293
03:20:26,633 --> 03:20:28,293
I'm excited to vote on this tonight.

2294
03:20:28,313 --> 03:20:33,115
I appreciate your office and the consultant making yourself so available throughout this entire process.

2295
03:20:33,175 --> 03:20:41,637
And to echo what President Merrill said, if there's a lack of deep questions and comments tonight, it's because we've had so many opportunities for that in recent months and weeks.

2296
03:20:41,757 --> 03:20:51,939
I think that the recommendations that came out of the CD board, they affirm what's distinctive and significant about this district, its transit proximity.

2297
03:20:53,059 --> 03:20:56,080
Had some really interesting conversations with your department about making sure that this is

2298
03:20:56,600 --> 03:21:14,119
dialed in to have the right incentives for like really what we're trying to promote in this district, excited to see what comes out of this and you know for residents who are, you know, further curious about what this means for Wellington and in the greater context of, you know, development and rezoning and Medford, you know, as we talked about the last time

2299
03:21:14,679 --> 03:21:15,339
a couple weeks ago.

2300
03:21:16,299 --> 03:21:24,141
We still have the opportunity to look at the underlying zoning in the course of our already planned zoning overhaul beginning next year.

2301
03:21:24,721 --> 03:21:30,402
So we'll continue to talk about Wellington and the conversation of comprehensive rezoning for Medford.

2302
03:21:31,723 --> 03:21:40,544
But for today, excited to hit the deadline on this for state compliance and excited to make sure that this works in concert with the rest of our zoning for Medford.

2303
03:21:40,684 --> 03:21:40,965
Thank you.

2304
03:21:42,465 --> 03:21:43,085
Any further discussion?

2305
03:21:44,881 --> 03:21:48,503
I just want to echo my fellow bouncers and thank you for your hard work on this.

2306
03:21:49,003 --> 03:21:53,245
Also, just not short of just being here at 10.15, 10.30 to take this.

2307
03:21:54,245 --> 03:21:57,647
Thankfully, Medford is more amenable than I think some communities have been to receiving this.

2308
03:21:58,167 --> 03:22:00,188
So we at least have that going for us.

2309
03:22:00,568 --> 03:22:06,030
But I know it's not been easy as the state continues to change and adjust and tweak here.

2310
03:22:06,110 --> 03:22:11,993
So I appreciate all the work you've done to be in compliance with this and get us to compliance with it.

2311
03:22:12,073 --> 03:22:14,114
So vice versa.

2312
03:22:14,594 --> 03:22:16,995
I just want to say one thing since we're all here late.

2313
03:22:17,855 --> 03:22:24,718
I did talk to someone on the phone today, and they asked me, is there going to be a big controversy tonight?

2314
03:22:25,918 --> 03:22:27,078
And I said, about what?

2315
03:22:29,659 --> 03:22:32,820
And they said, about the MBT community zoning.

2316
03:22:33,301 --> 03:22:34,861
And I said, luckily, I don't think so.

2317
03:22:35,121 --> 03:22:39,903
So interesting conversation, but thanks for sticking with me.

2318
03:22:41,253 --> 03:22:42,834
So we do have a motion on the floor.

2319
03:22:44,395 --> 03:22:48,978
This is a public hearing.

2320
03:22:48,998 --> 03:22:49,759
This is still the way we do it.

2321
03:22:49,779 --> 03:22:50,799
We haven't figured out a better way yet.

2322
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:53,621
But as this is a public hearing, I will open the public hearing.

2323
03:22:55,342 --> 03:22:58,324
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us?

2324
03:23:00,926 --> 03:23:01,206
Thank you.

2325
03:23:01,326 --> 03:23:05,329
Is there anyone on Zoom who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us?

2326
03:23:08,547 --> 03:23:10,489
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

2327
03:23:10,509 --> 03:23:13,671
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us?

2328
03:23:16,593 --> 03:23:17,534
Or on Zoom or in person?

2329
03:23:19,135 --> 03:23:20,957
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

2330
03:23:21,677 --> 03:23:27,482
So going back to the motion for Isis of Paris to approve for first reading?

2331
03:23:28,243 --> 03:23:29,303
Or no, this is no, sorry.

2332
03:23:29,363 --> 03:23:31,285
To be ordained.

2333
03:23:31,325 --> 03:23:37,570
To be ordained with the recommendations of the Community Allotment Board and to change the

2334
03:23:38,951 --> 03:23:42,792
the minimum lot size from 10,000 square feet to 7,000 square feet.

2335
03:23:44,673 --> 03:23:48,494
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs, as seconded by Councilor Sang, am I making that up?

2336
03:23:49,714 --> 03:23:50,415
Am I making it up, or?

2337
03:23:50,435 --> 03:23:50,695
Okay.

2338
03:23:50,775 --> 03:23:55,736
It doesn't matter, as long as it's passed.

2339
03:23:55,856 --> 03:23:59,698
Oh, that's it, oh yeah.

2340
03:23:59,918 --> 03:24:06,500
All right, please call the roll when you're ready.

2341
03:24:13,851 --> 03:24:14,051
Yes.

2342
03:24:14,872 --> 03:24:15,472
Councilor Collins.

2343
03:24:15,632 --> 03:24:15,852
Yes.

2344
03:24:17,053 --> 03:24:17,894
Councilor Nugent's absence.

2345
03:24:19,555 --> 03:24:20,296
Councilor Scarpelli.

2346
03:24:20,436 --> 03:24:20,636
Yes.

2347
03:24:22,617 --> 03:24:23,198
Councilor Singh.

2348
03:24:23,218 --> 03:24:23,278
Yes.

2349
03:24:24,519 --> 03:24:25,059
Councilor Morrell.

2350
03:24:25,379 --> 03:24:25,600
Yes.

2351
03:24:25,820 --> 03:24:28,301
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2352
03:24:28,321 --> 03:24:28,922
The motion passes.

2353
03:24:28,942 --> 03:24:32,605
Why don't we say we have the president read the whole solid waste ordinance just for fun.

2354
03:24:33,085 --> 03:24:33,385
Thank you.

2355
03:24:33,425 --> 03:24:34,086
Thank you so much.

2356
03:24:43,292 --> 03:24:49,574
I remember, and I guess we had to, I remember President Falco read 70 pages of the marijuana ordinance.

2357
03:24:50,014 --> 03:24:51,814
I don't know if he had to do that or not, but he did it.

2358
03:24:51,934 --> 03:24:55,355
Yeah, he was like, no, I will not summarize it.

2359
03:24:55,776 --> 03:24:56,316
That was awful.

2360
03:24:56,336 --> 03:24:57,096
Was that on Zoom?

2361
03:24:57,116 --> 03:24:57,756
It was on Zoom.

2362
03:24:57,776 --> 03:25:00,597
People may have gotten up and walked away.

2363
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:12,241
131 Fuzzler West.

2364
03:25:12,781 --> 03:25:12,921
I'm 625.

2365
03:25:13,201 --> 03:25:17,463
Now you know where I live.

2366
03:25:18,624 --> 03:25:19,784
It's just on the city website.

2367
03:25:21,005 --> 03:25:21,766
Oh.

2368
03:25:21,926 --> 03:25:22,266
We're good.

2369
03:25:22,526 --> 03:25:23,146
Oh, where you live.

2370
03:25:23,386 --> 03:25:23,606
Yeah.

2371
03:25:23,807 --> 03:25:24,427
Let's wave back.

2372
03:25:24,467 --> 03:25:28,889
Going to motions, orders, and resolutions.

2373
03:25:28,909 --> 03:25:30,410
22605, offered by Councilor Collins.

2374
03:25:30,630 --> 03:25:30,970
Motion.

2375
03:25:30,990 --> 03:25:31,811
Chapter 70.

2376
03:25:31,911 --> 03:25:32,991
I'll at least read the title.

2377
03:25:33,031 --> 03:25:35,032
Chapter 70, Solid Waste.

2378
03:25:35,052 --> 03:25:35,693
Yeah, Chapter 70, Solid Waste.

2379
03:25:35,713 --> 03:25:37,674
Do we have a motion?

2380
03:25:38,314 --> 03:25:39,515
Yeah, so we change the title

2381
03:25:40,282 --> 03:25:44,286
to the Council of King Kong's resolution.

2382
03:25:44,386 --> 03:25:48,851
Solid waste resolution.

2383
03:25:49,552 --> 03:25:55,378
So we have a motion to waive the reading and for a summary from Councilor Collins who did a tremendous amount of work on this.

2384
03:25:55,418 --> 03:25:59,062
So motion for vice of affairs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2385
03:25:59,082 --> 03:25:59,662
All those in favor?

2386
03:25:59,682 --> 03:26:00,423
Aye.

2387
03:26:00,543 --> 03:26:01,064
Opposed?

2388
03:26:01,164 --> 03:26:02,065
Motion passes.

2389
03:26:02,225 --> 03:26:02,866
Councilor Collins.

2390
03:26:03,902 --> 03:26:04,723
Thank you, President Roehl.

2391
03:26:06,104 --> 03:26:11,669
So this is a project that we've been working on in subcommittee since March.

2392
03:26:12,390 --> 03:26:18,756
The real seeds of this project were in the Solid Waste Task Force that met for a lot of 2022 under the direction of

2393
03:26:20,503 --> 03:26:43,033
Director Hahn and consultants towards the goal of looking at tools available to us to start our next waste hauling contract with best possible deal for the city both in terms of cost effectiveness and in terms of progressing towards our zero waste goals which of course is integral to our overarching sustainability goals and one of the things that came out of that conversation not just recommendations for

2394
03:26:44,514 --> 03:27:02,845
our next waste hauling contract was actually to tweak the existing Medford legislation around solid waste in Medford to make sure that we had the legislative foundation to make sure that we could hold our future waste hauler vendor to account in accordance with our sustainability goals.

2395
03:27:04,065 --> 03:27:12,110
So in the Subcommittee on Ordinances and Rules, we worked closely with Director Hunt and her department.

2396
03:27:12,930 --> 03:27:13,591
There are a couple

2397
03:27:14,179 --> 03:27:22,104
main changes that we made, but overall we just took our existing waste hauling ordinance, which was pretty outdated in a lot of ways.

2398
03:27:22,144 --> 03:27:27,867
So we made sure that it was updated to align with best practices coming out of the MAS DEP.

2399
03:27:28,308 --> 03:27:30,869
And the origins of this document start with their template language.

2400
03:27:31,249 --> 03:27:32,290
So it's been thoroughly vetted.

2401
03:27:32,350 --> 03:27:36,112
This aligns with what other communities do in terms of waste hauling.

2402
03:27:37,881 --> 03:27:46,809
One of the most consequential changes is that there's now a bundled service requirement, which essentially just says, if you offer trash pickup in Medford, you have to also offer recycling.

2403
03:27:46,849 --> 03:27:54,436
And this is significant, because that way, vendors that only offer trash pickup cannot undercut vendors that offer both on price.

2404
03:27:54,496 --> 03:28:02,544
And this will allow us to recycle the most in Medford in the most cost-effective way, which affects people on the city contract as well as everybody else.

2405
03:28:05,327 --> 03:28:06,287
That's the main strokes.

2406
03:28:06,327 --> 03:28:22,332
We did work with Director O'Connor from the Board of Health to make sure that this document aligns with current Board of Health regulations for waste haulers because they do, they operate the permitting side to make sure that everything is consistent to make this legible and understandable for generators as well as vendors.

2407
03:28:23,093 --> 03:28:32,135
I do have a few last amendments that I'll make from the floor just on the definitions in article one after any further comment or questions from my fellow counselors.

2408
03:28:33,056 --> 03:28:33,656
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2409
03:28:35,493 --> 03:28:36,933
I disagree with everything.

2410
03:28:36,953 --> 03:28:42,334
I just want to honestly, I think you've done a great job with this.

2411
03:28:43,334 --> 03:28:45,555
As I'm following through, it's very thorough.

2412
03:28:45,575 --> 03:28:51,536
I feel secure that you've done your due diligence and feathering your cap.

2413
03:28:51,556 --> 03:28:53,436
This is a big, big contract.

2414
03:28:54,096 --> 03:28:58,017
And to see the work that you put into it, I have so much faith in it.

2415
03:28:58,137 --> 03:29:00,017
So I appreciate your hard work, Councilor.

2416
03:29:00,597 --> 03:29:00,877
Thank you.

2417
03:29:02,198 --> 03:29:03,418
Yeah, to echo Councilor Scarpelli,

2418
03:29:04,656 --> 03:29:05,817
for all the work you did for this.

2419
03:29:06,117 --> 03:29:10,742
And I reviewed it all and I work with this in my day job.

2420
03:29:10,782 --> 03:29:15,126
So this is very much in line with best practices and where everything is going.

2421
03:29:15,166 --> 03:29:19,531
So I really appreciate the work and just bringing this into the modern era and our needs for waste these days.

2422
03:29:19,611 --> 03:29:22,374
And it's something we definitely make jokes about.

2423
03:29:22,394 --> 03:29:27,479
It's easy to make jokes about, but it's one of those parts of the city that doesn't get talked about when it's going right.

2424
03:29:27,579 --> 03:29:28,660
The second it goes wrong,

2425
03:29:29,332 --> 03:29:32,875
you're hearing from everybody, and it impacts everybody dramatically.

2426
03:29:32,995 --> 03:29:35,217
So this is really important work, and I appreciate it.

2427
03:29:38,561 --> 03:29:38,921
Amendments?

2428
03:29:39,702 --> 03:29:41,003
Great.

2429
03:29:41,183 --> 03:29:45,687
And thank you so much for your comments, and to everybody who worked on this with me.

2430
03:29:46,308 --> 03:29:54,996
So just quickly, just some quick amendments for Article 1 in general.

2431
03:29:56,731 --> 03:30:08,396
This was the last piece that we didn't amend in subcommittee, but I have some amendments that were run past a whole host of department heads, and I have a list if people are interested in seeing.

2432
03:30:09,797 --> 03:30:14,439
We just wanted to take section 71, 72, sorry, 70-1, 70-2, and 70-3, put those into contemporary language and

2433
03:30:20,760 --> 03:30:29,349
make sure that everybody who ought to be, every department that ought to be mentioned in those sections so that they could be tasked with enforcement would be.

2434
03:30:30,951 --> 03:30:33,594
So I can read off those amendments.

2435
03:30:33,654 --> 03:30:37,758
They're just a short paragraph each, and I'll also email that language to the city clerk.

2436
03:30:40,861 --> 03:30:42,203
Yes, I'll email it to you.

2437
03:30:42,799 --> 03:30:48,185
have the draft queued up but I didn't send it unless there was any controversy about this.

2438
03:30:48,645 --> 03:30:56,393
I for one would like to make a stand for the broken boards and the coal ash and the crockery and the cinders.

2439
03:30:56,914 --> 03:30:57,935
Who will speak for the cinders?

2440
03:31:14,731 --> 03:31:16,033
Well, I don't know who speaks for the cows.

2441
03:31:19,638 --> 03:31:26,327
So for Section 70-1, the motion would be to strike the existing and replace with, you should have this in your email inbox,

2442
03:31:27,231 --> 03:31:32,573
No private property may become a gathering place for debris, refuse, discarded, or abandoned items or other waste.

2443
03:31:33,073 --> 03:31:44,797
Any property owner who has received written notice from the Department of Public Works, Medford Police Department, Code Enforcement Officer, or Medford Board of Health to remove any such material from their property must do so within the timeframe directed.

2444
03:31:46,764 --> 03:31:59,654
Second is to take the existing section 70-2 and strike that and replace it with no debris, refuse, discarded items, or other waste, including yard waste and construction debris may be placed or dumped in any public place or public way in the city.

2445
03:32:00,134 --> 03:32:09,522
All waste must be properly contained and properly placed for collection on scheduled collection days in accordance with the regulations, schedules, and policies promulgated by the Department of Public Works and Board of Health.

2446
03:32:09,602 --> 03:32:16,547
Any person who has been ordered by the Department of Public Works, Medford Police Department, code enforcement officer, Medford Board of Health, or designee thereof

2447
03:32:17,051 --> 03:32:23,893
to remove any improperly discarded material or waste from private or public property must do so within the time frame directed.

2448
03:32:24,433 --> 03:32:32,856
And then finally, to just strike 70-3 because that information has been subsumed into the proposed 70-1 and 70-2.

2449
03:32:32,916 --> 03:32:36,697
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2450
03:32:36,797 --> 03:32:37,758
Any issue with the amendments?

2451
03:32:37,898 --> 03:32:39,478
What color?

2452
03:32:40,399 --> 03:32:40,999
What color what?

2453
03:32:41,779 --> 03:32:41,999
Black.

2454
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:52,024
Oh, so we have a motion, I know, a motion to... Motion to accept.

2455
03:32:53,065 --> 03:32:55,387
Motion to approve for first reading with the amendments.

2456
03:32:56,048 --> 03:32:56,588
As amended, yeah.

2457
03:32:56,928 --> 03:32:57,449
As amended.

2458
03:32:57,989 --> 03:33:03,194
So we have a motion from Vice of Affairs to approve for first reading as amended, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2459
03:33:03,694 --> 03:33:05,255
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2460
03:33:16,035 --> 03:33:18,576
It's going to take a while, so I want the whole thing read.

2461
03:33:20,556 --> 03:33:23,477
I just want to remind us, even with this meeting, it's only 11 o'clock.

2462
03:33:23,497 --> 03:33:26,217
Vice President Pierce?

2463
03:33:26,717 --> 03:33:26,997
Yes.

2464
03:33:27,818 --> 03:33:28,398
Councilor Kerrio?

2465
03:33:28,458 --> 03:33:28,678
Yes.

2466
03:33:29,058 --> 03:33:29,678
Councilor Collins?

2467
03:33:29,698 --> 03:33:29,938
Yes.

2468
03:33:30,438 --> 03:33:31,038
Councilor Lanzano?

2469
03:33:31,058 --> 03:33:31,258
Yes.

2470
03:33:31,438 --> 03:33:32,158
Councilor Scarpelli?

2471
03:33:32,298 --> 03:33:32,559
Yes.

2472
03:33:32,579 --> 03:33:33,759
Councilor Sands?

2473
03:33:33,819 --> 03:33:33,919
Yes.

2474
03:33:34,339 --> 03:33:34,879
President Morales?

2475
03:33:35,219 --> 03:33:35,419
Yes.

2476
03:33:35,519 --> 03:33:38,800
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

2477
03:33:42,261 --> 03:33:43,941
It's always a good day to be tremendous.

2478
03:33:44,932 --> 03:33:45,892
That's terrible now.

2479
03:33:46,573 --> 03:33:50,954
Your new nickname for this council.

2480
03:33:51,954 --> 03:33:53,015
Trash Collins.

2481
03:33:54,595 --> 03:33:55,615
Trashy Collins.

2482
03:33:55,635 --> 03:33:57,736
That'll go over well with the population.

2483
03:33:58,456 --> 03:33:59,757
Council Scott Kelly's at it again.

2484
03:33:59,777 --> 03:34:01,677
Good old Trashy Collins.

2485
03:34:03,218 --> 03:34:06,519
Half of us will think it's endearing, and the other half will think it's accurate, right?

2486
03:34:06,979 --> 03:34:08,039
Yeah, yeah.

2487
03:34:11,257 --> 03:34:14,079
Tell your great kids how you became one of those trashy Collins.

2488
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:20,005
Trash Collins, waste of time fairs.

2489
03:34:24,388 --> 03:34:25,509
Another one for my page 13.

2490
03:34:26,270 --> 03:34:28,932
Another word for my list.

2491
03:34:29,793 --> 03:34:30,994
23465 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

2492
03:34:31,435 --> 03:34:35,358
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council call for a meeting to resolve public safety concerns from

2493
03:34:35,888 --> 03:34:38,149
malfunctioning streetlights on South Porter Road and beyond.

2494
03:34:38,169 --> 03:34:45,853
If you have further resolve, the superintendent of WIRE, Steven Randazzo, a representative from the administration and a representative from National Grid to be invited to that meeting.

2495
03:34:46,074 --> 03:34:46,914
Thank you, Madam President.

2496
03:34:47,454 --> 03:34:50,156
This is a problem that's going on for years.

2497
03:34:50,256 --> 03:34:55,459
So I know we've heard from the state delegates that said that there are issues that are going on.

2498
03:34:55,479 --> 03:34:56,819
I know that Rick's worked on it.

2499
03:34:56,859 --> 03:34:57,240
I know that

2500
03:34:58,775 --> 03:35:09,382
And what I'm hearing from all these sides is that there's different entities, there's the state, there's the electrical utility company, there's the private entity, there's the city.

2501
03:35:09,863 --> 03:35:20,110
We need to get everybody in a room and realize before somebody gets killed and then everybody's gonna be pointing their fingers at everybody else, we need to get everybody in a room for this meeting and find a resolution.

2502
03:35:20,130 --> 03:35:26,114
Because they say the simplest thing is meeting with the neighbors and taking up the pavers so they can make the changes.

2503
03:35:26,574 --> 03:35:44,564
Well, if the neighbor doesn't want that because they're afraid it's not going to be replaced the proper way, let's find a resolution to make this happen so we're not sitting here and talking about a horrific accident or a jogger or a bike rider that's going down South Border Road that gets killed.

2504
03:35:44,584 --> 03:35:54,310
So I think it's important that through public safety we call for this emergency meeting to make sure all the parties are in a room because I think everybody's working their tail off, but

2505
03:35:54,830 --> 03:35:56,451
They're all doing their own thing.

2506
03:35:56,471 --> 03:35:58,452
No one's sitting together and saying, let's do that.

2507
03:35:58,472 --> 03:36:01,213
So that's why I bring this forward tonight, Madam President.

2508
03:36:02,634 --> 03:36:03,675
Thank you, Madam President.

2509
03:36:03,695 --> 03:36:05,435
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli, for bringing this forward.

2510
03:36:07,116 --> 03:36:11,417
I drive through there pretty regularly, and it's just not good at night.

2511
03:36:12,498 --> 03:36:16,499
Probably six, seven, eight months ago, I worked with Director Hunt to contact DCR.

2512
03:36:17,079 --> 03:36:25,322
I actually saw Commissioner Arrigo at the Clippership Connector, and Councilor Sang and I talked to him, and I brought this specific issue up, and I completely agree with you.

2513
03:36:25,342 --> 03:36:30,124
And I talked to Mr. Randazzo, I talked to Steve about it, and he's like, I've been talking about this for two and a half years.

2514
03:36:30,784 --> 03:36:31,985
And so I completely agree with you.

2515
03:36:32,005 --> 03:36:33,125
I think if we can get everyone in the room,

2516
03:36:33,755 --> 03:36:37,820
I know Representative Donato was on an email chain that he would be trying to do that.

2517
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:45,649
Maybe this could be the meeting that he tries to work through his office to invite the state agency and the neighbor and everybody in.

2518
03:36:46,230 --> 03:36:46,810
So thank you.

2519
03:36:47,311 --> 03:36:49,253
Thank you, Mayor President.

2520
03:36:49,874 --> 03:36:51,856
I've worked on this for almost two years.

2521
03:36:53,800 --> 03:36:58,465
Dickie Peter is the head of the Fells, and he's explained to me what the process is.

2522
03:36:58,725 --> 03:37:01,808
There's a relay in the grounds, right in front of those houses there.

2523
03:37:02,729 --> 03:37:10,596
And all those houses have got the nice pavers there, and nobody wants their pavers ripped up, because who's gonna put the pavers back?

2524
03:37:11,616 --> 03:37:12,877
That's really the big issue.

2525
03:37:13,497 --> 03:37:15,798
But it's a relay that's in the ground.

2526
03:37:17,039 --> 03:37:19,860
It's in front of one of those houses, but that whole section has to be ripped up.

2527
03:37:20,460 --> 03:37:27,784
And until the neighbors get together and agree to get the driveways ripped up, it's not going to move anywhere.

2528
03:37:28,924 --> 03:37:30,765
And if I can, I think that that's important.

2529
03:37:30,865 --> 03:37:35,747
I wouldn't want anybody to touch our pavers unless we have a commitment by the

2530
03:37:37,492 --> 03:37:48,355
the public entities that are all involved to say, hey, listen, this is what we'll do to make sure at your discretion with your contractor, making sure that everything gets put back the right way.

2531
03:37:49,275 --> 03:37:59,618
I think that's the only thing that's fair, because I think what's happening is, it's dogs chasing his tail until somebody gets seriously hurt, and then all of a sudden we're sitting there saying, all it was is just moving some pavers.

2532
03:38:00,138 --> 03:38:02,839
So I think having everybody in the room is important.

2533
03:38:02,859 --> 03:38:05,780
I think that if Mr. Vita's, we should invite him too.

2534
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:10,622
Yes, we should get him involved as well, so he's familiar with that, so thank you.

2535
03:38:11,802 --> 03:38:20,365
I know this is for the meeting that we're talking about, but to be honest, if the issue is we can't get the papers up to get the stuff in, take the bulbs out of the lights.

2536
03:38:20,665 --> 03:38:25,767
I think you might actually be better off with no light than with the blinking, and it's really disruptive.

2537
03:38:36,069 --> 03:38:36,309
Yeah.

2538
03:38:37,370 --> 03:38:42,114
So the motion is to continue working with Rep Donato's office to schedule this, or what's the thought there?

2539
03:38:42,134 --> 03:38:43,735
You can refer it to subcommittee on public works.

2540
03:38:43,755 --> 03:38:50,821
Well, if we can do that and call for the meeting with the subcommittee on public works and ask for it, invite all of those parties.

2541
03:38:50,941 --> 03:38:53,584
Yeah, ask them.

2542
03:38:54,424 --> 03:38:55,265
Yeah.

2543
03:38:55,926 --> 03:38:59,509
Specifically ask Representative Donato to get the state to show up to the meeting.

2544
03:39:00,626 --> 03:39:01,387
Okay, thank you.

2545
03:39:01,547 --> 03:39:05,051
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice Mayor Behrs.

2546
03:39:06,192 --> 03:39:06,892
All those in favor?

2547
03:39:06,913 --> 03:39:07,253
Aye.

2548
03:39:07,613 --> 03:39:08,294
All those opposed?

2549
03:39:08,594 --> 03:39:09,075
Motion adjourned.

2550
03:39:09,095 --> 03:39:09,495
Motion passes.

2551
03:39:09,916 --> 03:39:12,318
The motion of Councilor Scarpelli adjourned.

2552
03:39:12,358 --> 03:39:13,179
Motion, third reading.

2553
03:39:20,771 --> 03:39:21,772
Unlimited terms.

2554
03:39:22,233 --> 03:39:22,694
All right.

2555
03:39:22,934 --> 03:39:23,314
All right.

2556
03:39:23,334 --> 03:39:28,301
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpell, I'd like to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2557
03:39:28,341 --> 03:39:29,002
All those in favor?

2558
03:39:29,502 --> 03:39:30,063
All those opposed?

2559
03:39:30,083 --> 03:39:31,225
Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
