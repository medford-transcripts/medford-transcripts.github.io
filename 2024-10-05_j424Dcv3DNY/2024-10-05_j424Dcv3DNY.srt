39
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:50,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Do I have a motion?

40
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,660
[SPEAKER_33]: Madam President, point of personal privilege.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,661
[SPEAKER_26]: On this specific favor?

42
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,661
[SPEAKER_33]: No, Madam President.

43
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:58,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Can we just pass this and then we'll go to you?

00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:58,303
[SPEAKER_33]: So do.

45
00:01:58,363 --> 00:01:58,663

48
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,009
[SPEAKER_33]: We can dispose of the paper first.

49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,630
[SPEAKER_26]: You want to go through the rest?

50
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:13,931
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

51
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:17,612
[SPEAKER_26]: 23-314, December 5th, 2023, Committee of the Whole on Private Ways report to follow.

52
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:27,436
[SPEAKER_26]: This was with our DPW commissioner, as well as two land use attorneys from KP Law to answer resident questions and frequently asked questions about the private ways in Medford.

53
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:28,788

00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:40,559
[SPEAKER_26]: 22-533, December 6, 2023, the whole zoning RFP report to follow.

61
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,806
[SPEAKER_26]: This was to discuss the long-awaited proposals on our next step in the zoning process, building on our recodification work.

62
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:54,030
[SPEAKER_26]: We had two proposals and we left it that Vice of Affairs and I were gonna follow up on those references.

63
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,051
[SPEAKER_26]: We had a pre,

64
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:00,060
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we all agreed on where we wanted to go to next, and hopefully we'll have a decision on that soon.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
[SPEAKER_26]: Do I have a motion?

66
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,381
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion.

67
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:02,881
[SPEAKER_38]: Second.

68
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:06,402
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Vice Chair Bears.

69
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:07,062
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

70
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:07,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

71
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:08,123
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

72
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:08,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

73
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:10,143
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

74
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,304
[SPEAKER_33]: Madam President, thank you very much.

75
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:22,487
[SPEAKER_33]: Shortly after the budget debates in late June, following 16 weeks of pregnancy, my brother and his wife gave birth to their second child, Amira.

76
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,388
[SPEAKER_33]: And after several months of hospitalization,

77
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:32,357
[SPEAKER_33]: She was unable to withstand the college medical procedures and was laid to rest in mid-October.

78
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:36,919
[SPEAKER_33]: I've served on this council for a decade now.

79
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:47,783
[SPEAKER_33]: I think my record will reflect that my first eight years of service, I missed one regular city council meeting, and that was for the birth of my second child, Brandon.

80
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:54,766
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't think anybody in this room can say that I haven't come to these meetings prepared, ready, or able to do the work.

81
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:09,907
[SPEAKER_33]: When I first decided to run for elected office, it was with the support of my family and the understanding that they were always going to come first.

82
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,488
[SPEAKER_33]: That's what needed to happen during this time.

83
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:18,311
[SPEAKER_33]: So I do regret my absence from the council during this period of time.

84
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,712
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a very private and personal matter to both me and my family.

85
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:26,615
[SPEAKER_33]: But quite frankly, it was something I felt like I needed to share this evening, albeit reluctantly.

86
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:34,748
[SPEAKER_33]: I offer this not specifically of a justification for my absences, but for an explanation to the voters here in this community.

87
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:46,857
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I've heard the conspiracy theories and underfunded criticisms and comments made by many people in this community, and I find it necessary that I address the situation.

88
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,018
[SPEAKER_33]: So I thank you, Madam President, for entertaining me at this time.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,280
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

90
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,021
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

91
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:54,142
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Bears.

92
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:55,703
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam President.

93
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:59,697
[SPEAKER_35]: My thoughts are with you, Councilor Knight.

94
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:01,858
[SPEAKER_35]: Motion to suspend the rules to take papers.

95
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:01,898
[SPEAKER_35]: 23-412.

96
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:02,699
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

97
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:02,739
[SPEAKER_35]: 23-464.

98
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:02,779
[SPEAKER_35]: 23-468.

99
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:02,819
[SPEAKER_35]: 23-469.

100
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:02,859
[SPEAKER_35]: 23-463.

101
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,059
[SPEAKER_35]: And 23-467.

102
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:33,571
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, on the motion, vices and bears suspend the rules to take those papers in that order, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, I'm sorry, Councilor Scarpelli.

103
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,172
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

104
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:34,352
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

105
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:35,273
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

106
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:36,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

107
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:42,421
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so 23-412 is a paper that has come before us a number of times before.

108
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,384
[SPEAKER_26]: 23-412, Adam Dash, Associates, Attorneys at Law.

109
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:51,700
[SPEAKER_26]: regarding 12 Dell Avenue, a petition to amend deed restriction petitioners and owners, Gerald L. Alves and Janet R. Alves.

110
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:55,963
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we've read this paper a number of times, unless council would want me to read it again.

111
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:59,806
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we're happy to hear from the petitioner as to where we are and what's before us tonight.

112
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,069
[SPEAKER_31]: Madam President, I'm Adam Dash 48 Grove Street.

113
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,971
[SPEAKER_31]: Some of those with me are Gerald and Janet Alves, the petitioners.

114
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,495
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll give you a brief update as to where we are, and then I'll ask you to bump it to the next time.

115
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:22,847
[SPEAKER_31]: Since we last saw you, we've been working on the terms for an agreement with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability so the Council can amend the existing development restriction on the 12 Dell Avenue property.

116
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:36,959
[SPEAKER_31]: We have the framework of an agreement whereby the Alvarez's will make a payment in lieu of providing affordable housing on site, and this will avoid all the complications we've been encountering in having an affordable unit and having the disabled son and the other family members in there.

117
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:40,529
[SPEAKER_31]: and whether they qualify, and having to go through a lottery system.

118
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,871
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's sort of complicated this entire situation.

119
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:55,663
[SPEAKER_31]: And working with staff, it seems everyone's in agreement that a payment in lieu of providing the unit on site so that an affordable unit could be built somewhere else solves the Alva's problem and the city's problem all at the same time.

120
00:06:56,344 --> 00:07:01,389
[SPEAKER_31]: So what we're working on now is two formulas which one to use to come up with the number.

121
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,641
[SPEAKER_31]: And then secondly, when would the payments be made?

122
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,722
[SPEAKER_31]: Because obviously, Alvarez's aren't wealthy people.

123
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,904
[SPEAKER_31]: They would have to get these out of the sale of the units.

124
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:12,226
[SPEAKER_31]: So those are the two bits that are still outstanding.

125
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:14,387
[SPEAKER_31]: I think staff and I have been working on that.

126
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,030
[SPEAKER_31]: We fully expect we'll have an actual written agreement to come with you on the 19th.

127
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:27,876
[SPEAKER_31]: So in staff's preference was rather than have you vote at contention on coming up with an agreement tonight to go forward and just come with the agreement next time.

128
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:31,618
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to make sure that all of you got to vote on this because you've all spent time on it.

129
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:33,840
[SPEAKER_31]: And I know not all of you will be here after the 19th.

130
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,162
[SPEAKER_31]: So nice to have met you, although not for very long.

131
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:38,303
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for your service.

132
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,844
[SPEAKER_31]: I spent two terms on the select board at the helm.

133
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:42,485
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand.

134
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:49,730
[SPEAKER_31]: So with that, we would like to continue this to the 19th so we can complete the agreement with staff and then wrap this entire thing up.

135
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:54,438
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Attorney Dash, and thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Helms, for coming up to so many meetings at this point.

136
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,439
[SPEAKER_26]: Do I have a motion?

137
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:57,962
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion to continue to the 19th.

138
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:58,883
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

139
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,044
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

140
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Did you have something to add, Councilor?

141
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:01,866
[SPEAKER_39]: No, no, no.

142
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:06,031
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion by Supervisor Bears to continue to the 19th, our next regular meeting, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

143
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:06,752
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

144
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:07,192
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

145
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:07,913
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

147
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:09,694
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

148
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:09,994
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

149
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:11,895

268

00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:03,048
[SPEAKER_30]: I apologize.

273
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,689
[SPEAKER_30]: I just was able to get on.

274
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,249
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you hear me?

275
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:08,130
[SPEAKER_26]: The sound's not coming through the speakers.

276
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:11,974

00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:12,454

[SPEAKER_30]: Yep.

282
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:23,999

283
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,920

284
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,901
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a tree inventory program.

285
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:38,324
[SPEAKER_30]: It's one of the pieces of the puzzle that we need for a lot of the planning work that we're doing for our canopy.

286
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:40,245
[SPEAKER_30]: So this is a piece of that.

287
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,393
[SPEAKER_30]: bigger picture, tree inventory.

288
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:50,194

00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:51,694
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

290
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,115

292
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:05,498
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a roll call because it's financial.

293
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:08,579
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

294

[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

298
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,150
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Collins?

299
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:14,391
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

300
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:14,931
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Nielsen?

301
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:15,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

302
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:16,073
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng? President Bears??

303
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:16,193
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

304
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:16,553
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion passes.

305
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:18,475
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Commissioner McIver.

306
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:19,276
[SPEAKER_43]: All right.

307
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:19,317
[SPEAKER_43]: 23-463.

[SPEAKER_26]: and to accept any grants or the project from the MWRA, provided that the amount of the authorized borrowing shall be reduced by the amount of any such grant received from the MWRA.

[SPEAKER_38]: And- Madam President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading for a summary.

[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

316
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:56,339
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

317
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:57,519
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

318
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,379
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

319
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,220
[SPEAKER_26]: City Engineer Bortella, are you speaking on this or?

320
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,300
[SPEAKER_26]: I am.

321
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,680
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, if you wanna come up if you wanna

322
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,340
[SPEAKER_26]: Tell us about this.

323
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:11,362
[SPEAKER_19]: City Engineer Cortello, thank you for having me.

324
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:14,363
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an interest-free loan from the MWRA.

325
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:16,204
[SPEAKER_19]: We're trying to do some work this spring.

326
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:21,546
[SPEAKER_19]: And I apologize, we should have gotten this to you a little bit sooner.

327
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:33,591
[SPEAKER_19]: So if approved, we would request that you waive the three readings so that we could get onto a January bond agreement with the MWRA so that we could start this work first thing come spring.

328
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:36,273
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

329
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:42,496
[SPEAKER_26]: Can't waive the three readings because it's a financial paper, but tonight, ideally.

330
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,938
[SPEAKER_26]: So unfortunately, we can't waive the three readings.

331
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,881
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we could talk to the clerk about if there's funds to get it posted and advertised faster.

332
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,022
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

333
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Any questions or discussion from the council?

334
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,600
[SPEAKER_26]: And do I have a motion?

335
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,981
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion to approve for first reading.

336
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:01,821
[SPEAKER_38]: Second.

337
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:06,043
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a motion from Vice President Bears to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

338
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,283
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

339
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:16,507
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, see you.

340
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,187
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Bears?

341
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:17,527
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

342
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:18,748
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Caraviello?

343
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:19,028
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

344
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,128
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Collins?

345
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:20,508
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

346
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:21,529
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Knight?

347
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:21,609
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

348
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,309
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli?

349
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:23,389
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

350
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,990
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng?

351
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, you're in the negative, the motion passes for first reading.

352
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:39,779
[SPEAKER_26]: 23467, I believe that's my paper, so I will go in first to the chair, so vice president Bears.

353
00:20:56,826 --> 00:21:03,658
[SPEAKER_38]: to 3-467 offered by President Morell, whereas Mass General Lodge, excuse me, Chapter 71, Section 52,

354
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:27,047
[SPEAKER_38]: places the authority for school committee compensation with the City Council and whereas the Medford School Committee is a duly elected body of at-large members elected every two years with members being paid a yearly salary of $12,000 and whereas the majority of elected members of the Medford School Committee have historically been and continue to be women and whereas the Medford City Council is a duly elected body

355
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:44,343
[SPEAKER_38]: of at-large members elected every two years with members being paid a yearly salary of $29,359.80, and whereas the majority of elected members of the City Council have historically been and continue to be men, and whereas the ideal of equal pay for equal work

356
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:58,683
[SPEAKER_38]: is a long-established and accepted principle in our nation, and, whereas, this ordinance would establish pay parity for all members of duly elected legislative bodies in the city, now therefore, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford

357
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:17,071
[SPEAKER_38]: In Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved, the City's Classification and Compensation Plan, formerly included as Article 2, Section 66-31 to 66-40, be updated with the following titles and wages, effective January 1, 2024.

358
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:19,791
[SPEAKER_38]: School committee member, $29,359.80.

359
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:26,683
[SPEAKER_38]: School committee chair, $32,550.

360
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,485
[SPEAKER_38]: School committee vice chair, $30,640.

361
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,526
[SPEAKER_38]: School committee secretary, $31,760.

362
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:41,169
[SPEAKER_38]: Further, in keeping with past practice, these wages will be paid from the Medford Schools budget and paid by the Medford Schools payroll department.

363
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,071
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, so we're going to not do that.

364
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:45,611
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

365
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:47,452
[SPEAKER_38]: Hold on a minute.

366
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:48,012
[SPEAKER_38]: All right.

367
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:49,673
[SPEAKER_38]: Are we?

368
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:50,753
[SPEAKER_38]: Are we?

369
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:51,694
[SPEAKER_38]: OK, thank you.

370
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:57,100
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, all right, if we're going to disrupt, we're going to have to call a recess.

371
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,184
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm going to read some stuff, and then I'm going to turn it over, and we're going to have a respectful conversation.

372
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:06,748
[SPEAKER_38]: This is an initial proposal placed on the agenda by a single member for the first time.

373
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:14,954
[SPEAKER_38]: How this is going to go is we're going to hear from the proponent, then I will recognize the other councillors, and then we will hear from members of the public.

374
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:18,017
[SPEAKER_38]: For the public, each person is going to have two minutes.

375
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:20,399
[SPEAKER_38]: We have a lot of interest in this, and we need to hear from everybody.

376
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,614
[SPEAKER_38]: And I want to make sure everybody can be heard in a reasonable amount of time.

377
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:28,197
[SPEAKER_38]: Each person will address their comments towards me as the chair, per the rules.

378
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:32,980
[SPEAKER_38]: As I said, there's a lot of interest, and we need to make sure everyone can be heard in a timely way.

379
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,863
[SPEAKER_38]: I will do my best to give a 30-second warning to the two-minute time limit.

380
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,746
[SPEAKER_38]: And your comments, again, should be directed at me.

381
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,027
[SPEAKER_38]: This is not a back and forth.

382
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:44,528
[SPEAKER_38]: This is not a debate with individual people.

383
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,170
[SPEAKER_38]: We want to hear everyone's comments.

384
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,971
[SPEAKER_38]: We want to hear them in a timely way.

385
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:53,850
[SPEAKER_38]: I want to state I'm, as the chair, not going to issue my opinion on this.

386
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,052
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm sure everyone here knows that they can find it somewhere else.

387
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:04,639
[SPEAKER_38]: I do want to say, before we start, that the purview of the chair is to state facts and to address motions of order.

388
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,183
[SPEAKER_38]: I want to put a number of three facts out there.

389
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:13,908
[SPEAKER_38]: School committee in Medford has not received a compensation adjustment since fiscal year 2000.

390
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:17,708
[SPEAKER_38]: In fiscal year 2000, school committee pay was $12,000 and city council pay was $13,500.

391
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,550
[SPEAKER_38]: 24 years later, school committee pay is still $12,000 and council pay is $29,359.

392
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:32,856
[SPEAKER_38]: Those are the facts I'm going to put out.

393
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:37,779
[SPEAKER_38]: The rest of this meeting, I'm just going to organize and make sure we have a respectful discussion.

394
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,345
[SPEAKER_38]: I ask that we all keep the facts in mind, that we be respectful, that we don't interrupt each other, and that people please only speak when recognized by the chair.

395
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:52,530
[SPEAKER_33]: And with that, I will go- Mr. President, I just want to reiterate the fact that- Councilor Knight, I haven't recognized you.

396
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:54,231
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you have a motion?

397
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:54,731
[SPEAKER_33]: I do.

398
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,293
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd like to fact check.

399
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,574
[SPEAKER_38]: I would like to go to-

400
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:04,805
[SPEAKER_38]: I would like to go to the proponent, and then I will recognize Councilors in order that they raise their hands and indicate to me that they would like to speak.

401
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:05,865
[SPEAKER_38]: President Morell.

402
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:06,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

403
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:11,027
[SPEAKER_26]: So first, I'd like to amend my letter if I could, Mr. Clerk, for the record.

404
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,268
[SPEAKER_26]: My language was not clear.

405
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:17,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Though the school committee has largely been women for the better part of a decade, it was more evenly split before that.

406
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,711
[SPEAKER_26]: However, my statement stands about the makeup of the city council and how hard it is for women to break in there.

407
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:28,433
[SPEAKER_26]: Only a small number of women have ever served on the city council in Medford's history, with two more joining in January.

408
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:33,380
[SPEAKER_26]: I would have meant to strike both references from the whereas if I could, thank you.

409
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,403
[SPEAKER_26]: Historically, the school committee has been the only elected body where women could serve while city council remains majority men to this day.

410
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:48,626
[SPEAKER_26]: Going back more than a hundred years ago, there've been multiple women on school committee in Medford, whereas the city council has been almost exclusively men until more recent history.

411
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:55,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Historically, school committees have been paid less and valued less than that of city council statewide, countrywide as an accepted fact.

412
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:59,554
[SPEAKER_26]: One reason I brought forth this resolution is to interrogate that fact.

413
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,158
[SPEAKER_26]: School committee has many statutory powers outlined at the state level.

414
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:08,903
[SPEAKER_26]: They play an essential role in the city, a role that's getting more involved and more complicated in the current political climate.

415
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:12,506
[SPEAKER_26]: And like many city Councilors, they're on call essentially 24 seven.

416
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:16,529
[SPEAKER_26]: But yet this body has always been seen and continues to be seen as less than.

417
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:23,896
[SPEAKER_26]: One reason to me comes from a conversation I've had many times with my mother, a 35 year public school teacher.

418
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:27,050
[SPEAKER_26]: is that the school committee is an extension of the schools.

419
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,672
[SPEAKER_26]: Schools and teaching are seen as women's work, largely because it's one of the few ways women could gain employment.

420
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:46,797
[SPEAKER_26]: In a country where we undervalue or often do not value women's work, be it caregiving roles, aides, paras, teachers, social workers, nurses, and the like, regardless of who is serving in these roles, men or women, we do not value them in the way that we should.

421
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:50,738
[SPEAKER_26]: This is not to equate any of these positions as they are very different.

422
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:52,659
[SPEAKER_26]: I absolutely understand that and believe that.

423
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:59,430
[SPEAKER_26]: But it is to note that when we undervalue work for a long time, changing the financials and the mindset around it becomes hard.

424
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,992
[SPEAKER_26]: Simply reaching for equity of pay seems like an overreach.

425
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:07,696
[SPEAKER_26]: Equity of opportunity is another important reason I brought this forward.

426
00:27:08,396 --> 00:27:10,237
[SPEAKER_26]: This resolution is about who's not in the room.

427
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:17,703
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been to many trainings and brainstorms where folks struggle with how to bring diversity of experiences and voices to the table in many, many spaces.

428
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Diversity, which has been proven to make boards and organizations more successful.

429
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:25,148
[SPEAKER_26]: It's something we struggle with here, but it's not unique to Medford.

430
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:31,814
[SPEAKER_26]: The one answer that always comes back in these brainstorms and these thought projects is paying folks for their time.

431
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:50,869
[SPEAKER_26]: I've spoken with many folks in Medford who want to be more involved, but it doesn't make financial sense for them to get a babysitter to attend a school committee meeting, let alone commit to multiple years of pay that barely covers the cost of childcare or loss of learnings they would need to cover regular meetings, negotiating meetings, grievances, executive sessions, and the day-to-day essential role of responding to residents.

432
00:27:51,957 --> 00:28:00,962
[SPEAKER_26]: By saying we don't value this position, we say we don't value the insight, experiences, and representation of folks who do not have the financial support and caregiver support that is needed to give to these roles.

433
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:07,265
[SPEAKER_26]: This excludes folks doing shift work, folks who need two jobs to get by, people without free or low cost childcare.

434
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:16,350
[SPEAKER_26]: No one does these jobs, these elected jobs for the pay, but the lack of it certainly keeps many folks from seeking them and having a representative body.

435
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:23,084
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been having these conversations long before I even ran for council, so I wanted to bring this forward before the end of my term.

436
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:27,292
[SPEAKER_26]: This equity discussion is important to me, and equity delayed is equity denied.

437
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:28,455
[SPEAKER_26]: However,

438
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:33,806
[SPEAKER_26]: I absolutely do hear you, and I really want to thank the folks who have reached out to me on email over the past few days.

439
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:38,009
[SPEAKER_26]: I appreciate those just willing to hear what I have to say.

440
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,050
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand your feelings, absolutely.

441
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,772
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know there are many folks eager to talk tonight, and I'm eager to hear from you.

442
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:57,679
[SPEAKER_26]: So reflecting on this, I would further amend this paper that I would hope for a phase-in over time to either these amounts or amounts that reflect similar cost of living increases to the council or other city employees over the past 24 years.

443
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:02,274
[SPEAKER_26]: nearly two and a half decades where there were no such adjustments for the school committee.

444
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:10,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Also understanding it's the end of my term, as I did not seek reelection to spend more time with my almost two year old, a testament to the trade offs of these types of jobs.

445
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:22,053
[SPEAKER_26]: My motion is to send this to the committee the whole so that the incoming council may consider it if they so choose and explore what they would like based on the conversations we have here tonight and ongoing conversations.

446
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:23,429
[SPEAKER_26]: So I thank you for your time.

447
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:25,691
[SPEAKER_26]: I thank you for your respect as I share this tonight.

448
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:30,195
[SPEAKER_26]: I know it's a topic that people feel very, very strongly about, and I absolutely understand.

449
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:31,977
[SPEAKER_26]: And I thank you, Mr. President.

450
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:33,759
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Madam President.

451
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:41,506
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm gonna go just address the motion, and then I'll call Councilor Knight, Councilor Collins, and then if I see another hand, they'll go next.

452
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:45,790
[SPEAKER_38]: But just before we get there, on the motion of President Morell- Second.

453
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,732
[SPEAKER_38]: To amend the

454
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:55,162
[SPEAKER_38]: The motion, I think there were three amendments, two strikings to whereas, and then- Yeah, that has to be an amendment, yeah.

455
00:29:55,543 --> 00:30:10,010
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, amendments to strike whereas, two of the whereas clauses referencing majority membership based on gender, and also an amendment to consider phasing this in at a different pay amount, and to refer to Committee of the Whole.

456
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,371
[SPEAKER_38]: Is there a second on that motion?

457
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:12,651
[SPEAKER_35]: I think Councilor Collins.

458
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:14,392
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Collins, is there a debate on that motion?

459
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:18,014
[SPEAKER_38]: I heard Councilor Knight, and I recognize Councilor Knight at this time.

460
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:28,419
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, just on the facts, I believe you stated the school committee's salary has not increased from a figure of $12,000 per annual.

461
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:40,952
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, you did mention that the school committee's

462
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:50,714
[SPEAKER_33]: Monetary figure may not have changed since the year 2000, but I do believe that their compensation structure has changed, which is something that's important to point out.

463
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:57,418
[SPEAKER_33]: Previously, their compensation structure was that of a stipend, which made the position a line item budget item.

464
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:05,804
[SPEAKER_33]: And now it's turned into a pension eligible health insurance eligible benefited position, which therefore can become

465
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,847
[SPEAKER_33]: what would be called an unfunded pension liability.

466
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:11,349
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's something that we also have to take a look at as we move forward.

467
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:26,283
[SPEAKER_33]: But the pay structure did change from the way that the committee was compensated to the way they are currently compensated previously, where stipends were added and included into their salaries to raise that pay and reflect pensionable monetary gain.

468
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,607
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm not aware of health insurance's eligibility.

469
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:34,469
[SPEAKER_38]: I know that we were not eligible, and I don't believe that's true for the school committee either.

470
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:41,694
[SPEAKER_33]: Point of information on that, I do believe if the mayor's in the room, she can tell us when she was on the council how she collected health insurance.

471
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,816
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm aware that the council used to be health insurance eligible, but that changed.

472
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,757
[SPEAKER_33]: When she became mayor and didn't need it anymore?

473
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:48,839
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, I won't speak to that.

474
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,682
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Collins.

475
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:56,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

476
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:03,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morell, sorry, to the chair you're sitting in, for introducing this paper.

477
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:07,264
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank you to everybody who's reached out over the past several days and took the time to be here tonight.

478
00:32:07,284 --> 00:32:11,426
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to acknowledge, I know that there's a lot of engagement around this issue.

479
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,467
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's a lot of strong feelings about this proposal.

480
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:17,769
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just, before I state my own thoughts, I just want to acknowledge that and thank you for being here.

481
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for engaging in this process.

482
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,851
[SPEAKER_16]: As Councilor Bears said, this is a process.

483
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,012
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the initial introduction.

484
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:28,660
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what this process looks like coming up and sharing opinions and working through things together.

485
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here.

486
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:43,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to use my time to explain my support for looking into this proposal, my support for achieving pay equity between the city council and school committee, my view on what this proposal is and what it isn't.

487
00:32:45,956 --> 00:33:05,348
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not believe that this is in any way incompatible with what I think has been a core and shared goal of the City Council, at least in the one term that I've been a part of it, which is supporting all of our public school employees, supporting Medford Public Schools, and trying to ever improve the conditions of everybody that touches our public school systems.

488
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:08,209
[SPEAKER_16]: The students, their families, the teachers, the paras.

489
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:15,140
[SPEAKER_16]: all of the workers in our schools that help students and students' families thrive.

490
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,866
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not believe that this proposal is incompatible with that shared goal whatsoever.

491
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:21,429
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that this

492
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:31,197
[SPEAKER_16]: the equity between the school committee and the city council is something that I've wanted to, that I've hoped to have the opportunity to vote on ever since I first took office.

493
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,638
[SPEAKER_16]: These are two elected bodies.

494
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,998
[SPEAKER_16]: I know how hard we work.

495
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:39,819
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some glimmer of perspective of how hard the school committee works.

496
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:41,660
[SPEAKER_16]: They have responsibilities that we don't.

497
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it is outdated that our bodies are paid differently.

498
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,641
[SPEAKER_16]: That is the core reason for my support for this proposal.

499
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:53,822
[SPEAKER_16]: And even if it were to stop right there, that would be enough for me.

500
00:33:54,802 --> 00:34:06,407
[SPEAKER_16]: But I see that this draws in a larger conversation about what we can and can't do in Medford, what we have and haven't done in Medford so far, especially every June during budget cycle and really all year round.

501
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:18,032
[SPEAKER_16]: If you watch the city council meetings, if you watch the school committee meetings, we are constantly talking about the resources that are afforded to Medford public schools, the people that work in them and everybody that experiences the work that is done in those buildings.

502
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:24,155
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are constantly in this conversation about why aren't we doing better and how can we continue to do better

503
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,824
[SPEAKER_16]: to better value and better resource what goes on in the schools, and better value and better resource the people that do the work of the schools.

504
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:40,171
[SPEAKER_16]: This proposal, I think, has brought up those values and those feelings and that imperative that we have to keep doing better.

505
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:46,576
[SPEAKER_16]: What I don't believe is that this is an either-or, and what I don't believe is that this is a zero-sum game.

506
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:53,141
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that if this proposal were to go forward even as written before amendments,

507
00:34:54,221 --> 00:35:03,488
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not, this would not take from the same bucket of money that would otherwise go to the workers that contribute to MPS students experience.

508
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:06,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Hang on, please.

509
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:09,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, thank you for letting me speak.

510
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:20,540
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, we found out that we had a 25 million sum of certified free cash, $25 million.

511
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:37,061
[SPEAKER_16]: When we talk about what we can and can't do in Medford and what we have and haven't done, I think that we need to stay, I try to stay, laser focused on what our real opponent is.

512
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:40,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Our real opponent is austerity budgeting.

513
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:50,533
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that we have the money to value the people who choose to nominate themselves for school committee and go through the process of running and seek election and serve in that role.

514
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:58,897
[SPEAKER_16]: that we have the resources, that we can marshal the resources to do better by everybody who contributes to the Medford public school system.

515
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:01,218
[SPEAKER_16]: We talk about it all year long.

516
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:12,363
[SPEAKER_16]: We talk about how little authority the school committee, sorry, we talk about where the city council's authority lies and doesn't lie when it comes to making direct appropriations to our budgets, including the school budgets.

517
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:13,003
[SPEAKER_16]: We talk about this.

518
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,524
[SPEAKER_16]: all the time, often in great frustration.

519
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:19,806
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the power to influence bargaining units here in the city council.

520
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:24,548
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the authority to make appropriations whatsoever that is out of our purview.

521
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:36,194
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, speaking for myself, there's been countless times when I wished it was in our purview, because I'm so frustrated by what I see in the line items in the budgets that we have to vote yes or no on, because that's all that we can do on those budgets.

522
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:38,935
[SPEAKER_16]: So when it comes back to this proposal,

523
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:45,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Due to the constraints of our jurisdiction here, this is something that we are legally allowed to vote on.

524
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:51,331
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are many things that we will never have the opportunity to vote on, because that is not within our purview.

525
00:36:52,072 --> 00:36:58,617
[SPEAKER_16]: When something comes in front of me that is an opportunity to discuss and interrogate, is this an opportunity to do a good thing?

526
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:00,779
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to take that opportunity.

527
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,702
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do not think it is in any way incompatible with continuing to do better.

528
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:09,297
[SPEAKER_16]: in the many areas, the many school-related areas where we need to keep doing better.

529
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:11,699
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a zero-sum, and it's not an either-or.

530
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:26,270
[SPEAKER_16]: I look forward to hearing the discussion tonight, and I look forward to continuing to hold ourselves accountable to do this right, and to do right by all of our public employees, and to do as many things right as we can, all at the same time.

531
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think that we have to choose between one or the other.

532
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:29,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

533
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,474
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

534
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:32,455
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Scarpelli.

535
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:34,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

536
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Council Vice President.

537
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:46,148
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna speak as someone who no one else in this council had the opportunity to do.

538
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:51,032
[SPEAKER_21]: That's someone that both sat on the school committee seat and in the city council seat.

539
00:37:51,833 --> 00:38:00,780
[SPEAKER_21]: And understanding, I'll give you my opinion, then I'm gonna share a lot of emails, phone calls, conversations I've had in the last few days.

540
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,002
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think they're very telling.

541
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:12,682
[SPEAKER_21]: When you decide to take the chance and the responsibility of becoming an elected official, it's being elected official.

542
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,664
[SPEAKER_21]: It's truly a position of service.

543
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:22,526
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing it for a reason other than the paycheck.

544
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:23,947
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never looked at it.

545
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, as I grew up in this city,

546
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:38,978
[SPEAKER_21]: I took it upon myself to watch people that led the way for us.

547
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:57,288
[SPEAKER_21]: And they gave back in service, whether it's coaching little league teams, whether it's volunteering at the food bank, whether it's joining a school committee that didn't make any money, or whether it's taking the leap to the city council, because you think you could make more of a difference.

548
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:11,455
[SPEAKER_21]: So I generally, personally feel that understanding the process of a pay structure being a major issue, I think it's sad.

549
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:13,097
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's sad to look at it that way.

550
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:23,966
[SPEAKER_21]: To think that I had one phone call that said that understanding that we can get better candidates if we pay, that's sad even to think of.

551
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:29,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Imagine, imagine voting in people that are there for the money.

552
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,144
[SPEAKER_21]: That's horrifically frightening to me.

553
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:42,612
[SPEAKER_21]: As we move forward, what I found very, very glaring in this situation, the issue of gender equity in pay.

554
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:59,822
[SPEAKER_21]: And we received a dialogue from three female school kid members that knew nothing about this, that didn't want anything to do with this vote and think that they're totally against it on the record.

555
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:03,084
[SPEAKER_21]: There were two members that didn't reach out to me.

556
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:05,539
[SPEAKER_21]: two members that didn't reach out.

557
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:14,282
[SPEAKER_21]: And there were two members that I find it, it's very frightening that these two members are the catalyst behind this motion.

558
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:24,807
[SPEAKER_21]: So let me share a few things.

559
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:31,670
[SPEAKER_21]: As a member of the council, we had an opportunity to stand up at budget time, didn't we?

560
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Didn't we?

561
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,580
[SPEAKER_21]: We did.

562
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,062
[SPEAKER_21]: And three of us stood up and said no.

563
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,825
[SPEAKER_21]: But some others didn't.

564
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:52,277
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll revert to most important thing that bothers me more than anything are the phone calls that I got from the people that work the hardest in our school district.

565
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:55,420
[SPEAKER_21]: By the way, majority of them are women.

566
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,352
[SPEAKER_21]: they're getting their butts kicked.

567
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:05,817
[SPEAKER_21]: And what's glaring to this, it's something that we need to turn to our school committee members that's more important than a pay structure.

568
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:24,373
[SPEAKER_21]: From what I've heard, and I'm sure we'll hear it tonight, that the possible legalities of lack of coverage in special needs classrooms, lack of coverage with teachers absences, lack of coverage in severely disabled classrooms, that's a problem.

569
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:34,501
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm glad this came up in the sense that this brings something forward.

570
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:44,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the city council does more, and I think its responsibilities are far more succeeding.

571
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Doesn't mean I'm better than a school kid member at all.

572
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:57,597
[SPEAKER_21]: But our responsibilities, our charter, give us the responsibility far greater than our colleagues on the school committee.

573
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:17,705
[SPEAKER_21]: And to be honest with you, I'll make a motion later on, whether it's tonight or another night, that since we've cut our time, I'll make the motion if equity, financial equity is serious to the issue, then I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have to.

574
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:41,617
[SPEAKER_21]: because Mr. President, Mr. President, again, this city councilor didn't join or didn't ask their constituents to hire, to vote for me so I can make a paycheck.

575
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,558
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not rich, we're not gonna get rich.

576
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:51,963
[SPEAKER_21]: And when everybody ran for their office, when our school committee ran for their office, you're gonna have some candidates that are gonna be stepping in seats that are in the audience tonight.

577
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:57,207
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure if you ask them, if this was a big concern in their eyes,

578
00:42:58,308 --> 00:43:02,310
[SPEAKER_21]: they would absolutely flat say, no way, that was not the intention at all.

579
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:26,084
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just think that this seems like there's fingerprints with only two spooky members that are pushing an agenda, and I think that this is a sad, sad day when we have unions that don't have contracts, when we have teachers that don't have coverage, and more importantly, please, more importantly, that I find frightening as a former teacher,

580
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:46,638
[SPEAKER_21]: that I've talked to a few paraprofessionals, I have two teachers that told me straight out that we have classes, high level, low leveling functioning classes, with special need classrooms, with lack of aids, with lack of certified teachers, and they're just covering them just to have a body in the room, and that's against the law, and that our kids, they don't deserve that.

581
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:47,939
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the biggest issue.

582
00:43:55,919 --> 00:44:01,381
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know this is going to be left on the next council in January.

583
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:05,203
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think it's important that this happens.

584
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:13,087
[SPEAKER_21]: These phone calls, these conversations, I think it's great, because I think that's the dialogue we need to move the needle where we need to move it to.

585
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,008
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not going to be critical, but I will to all of you.

586
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Get involved.

587
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:23,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't come out just when it involves your issue, because that's what we're seeing.

588
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:24,912
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can't do that anymore.

589
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:27,656
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you, Mr. President.

590
00:44:28,677 --> 00:44:30,418
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

591
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:33,701
[SPEAKER_38]: I do want to say in 2021, we had 85 meetings.

592
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,062
[SPEAKER_38]: That's when we had weekly meetings.

593
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:39,185
[SPEAKER_38]: This year we had 79 meetings, so we have not cut the meetings in half.

594
00:44:39,865 --> 00:44:42,027
[SPEAKER_38]: I will go to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Caraviello.

595
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:44,789
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

596
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I know many of you all taught me just a few years ago.

597
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:56,486
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you'll know that I'm a fan of nuance, but that not everyone's a fan of nuance.

598
00:44:58,088 --> 00:45:00,950
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I just wanted to preface my remarks with that.

599
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:07,056
[SPEAKER_17]: I do actually agree with the principles of this resolution.

600
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,319
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in execution, we need to tailor it.

601
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,400
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to improve it.

602
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:14,843
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do appreciate that President Morell has

603
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:24,926
[SPEAKER_17]: put out a proposal to address a problem that we have in our city, a can that's been kicked down the road since the year I was born.

604
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:36,127
[SPEAKER_17]: And I understand how politically difficult it is for the president to introduce this motion and to take so much flack on it.

605
00:45:37,948 --> 00:45:41,048
[SPEAKER_17]: It's never easy to discuss the salaries of elected officials.

606
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:44,909
[SPEAKER_17]: And whether you agree or disagree with it,

607
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:54,472
[SPEAKER_17]: we were always bound to have this conversation at some point, and so I do have to give President Morell props for having the courage to bring this out.

608
00:45:55,632 --> 00:46:04,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I also need to note that procedurally, I've heard a lot about, you know, why haven't you talked to other members of the council or other members of the school committee about it?

609
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:04,935
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have

610
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:15,067
[SPEAKER_17]: laws that govern how we introduce ideas, and the most transparent way to introduce an idea is to put it on the City Council agenda.

611
00:46:15,787 --> 00:46:22,235
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't mean it's going to be passed tonight and it's an ordinance, so it would require three readings anyways.

612
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:32,288
[SPEAKER_17]: But usually it's the most transparent approach because we can hear from you, we can hear whether you agree or disagree, we can send it to subcommittee and work on it even more.

613
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:35,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's procedurally how it usually works.

614
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:50,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I did say I support the principles of this, especially given the fact that school committees being paid a wage or a salary that few in the private sector would ever pay for any job, really.

615
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:58,749
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sympathetic to the argument that school committees and schools in general are seen as female institutions and treated accordingly.

616
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:03,132
[SPEAKER_17]: And in other words, there's societal expectations to lower pay outcomes.

617
00:47:03,832 --> 00:47:07,595
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is really what the crux of the gender pay gap is.

618
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:15,558
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say my first reaction to this resolution was, why is the school committee being paid the same as city council?

619
00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:32,125
[SPEAKER_17]: But I had to reconsider why I even asked that question in the first place, especially given what we know as people who engage with the law, that school committee exercises, you know, city council exercises purview over city hall, which is about

620
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:37,849
[SPEAKER_17]: two-thirds of the budget, and the school committee exercises authority over one-third of the city budget.

621
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:44,454
[SPEAKER_17]: And in addition, state law does give the school committees many more powers and authorities that we don't have as a city council.

622
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:52,200
[SPEAKER_17]: I do know from personal experience, whether you like the job that they're doing or you dislike the job that they're doing, they do spend a lot of hours on their job.

623
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:13,119
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in addition to that, as a young person, as a person of color, and as a recent student of social sciences, I know from both my personal experience and from the numerous studies from top researchers that better pay for public officials does increase the quality, diversity, and experience of candidates who run for public office.

624
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:27,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Too often, low pay doesn't justify the time that we spend being public officials, and the negativity and hostility of politics in recent years only exacerbates that problem.

625
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:35,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Those, you know, we can, I do agree in principle that people running for office should run out of service.

626
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:53,493
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, you know, everyone who runs does run out of service, but we can't ignore the economic reality that for people who aren't as economically well off, like students or people of color, we can't just take time out of our days to do political stuff like this instead of working another part-time job.

627
00:48:54,073 --> 00:48:56,454
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, it's just economic reality.

628
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:08,261
[SPEAKER_17]: We, you know, there are experienced folks who can't justify taking on higher paying projects and research after research shows that government that pays better moves more efficiently.

629
00:49:10,968 --> 00:49:21,990
[SPEAKER_17]: I hear a lot, and I totally agree with teachers generally, about wanting more young people to run for office, because we have more, especially for school community, because we have more recent experience at the schools.

630
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:29,232
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a reason why I ran for this office in the first place, because the schools, I believe, should be the number one budget issue.

631
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:35,393
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the last few budgets, I've sat down with the mayor to negotiate millions more for our schools, successfully.

632
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:39,674
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been the number one conversation when I walked into the office.

633
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,228
[SPEAKER_33]: I just want to know when these discussions happen.

634
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,812
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll recognize you after Councilor Caraviello.

635
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:46,133
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

636
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:57,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, okay, that being said, I am sympathetic to all the ideas in opposition to this.

637
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:09,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I've spent a good amount of time these last few days talking to teachers, and I agree in principle that the school committee should pay, should reflect pay increases that teachers get.

638
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:21,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we should also keep in mind that the committee hasn't had an increase since 2000, and using a salary calculator, if we compare the percentage increases, this proposal is somewhere in the ballpark of

639
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:24,814
[SPEAKER_17]: where that pay has grown in the last 25 years.

640
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,477
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, that's all details.

641
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:33,641
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we need to have, again, nuance matters.

642
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:37,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to have a conversation about what that looks like.

643
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:48,211
[SPEAKER_17]: We should also keep in mind that we do face large structural challenges when it comes to problems in the city and in our schools.

644
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:54,996
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's obvious to everyone who goes into the schools, and I have been into the schools.

645
00:50:56,517 --> 00:51:01,821
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have to consider amounts, and we have to consider percentages.

646
00:51:02,922 --> 00:51:04,423
[SPEAKER_17]: This proposal takes up

647
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:13,405
[SPEAKER_17]: 0.05% of the city budget, and we have $25 million in free cash that we keep pressuring the mayor to use and spend, and she has.

648
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,725
[SPEAKER_17]: She has spent that.

649
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:27,368
[SPEAKER_17]: We've talked to the CFO about this, and the money does exist for it without pulling out of the budget for schools.

650
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:33,166
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the logical trap here isn't that this isn't an either or situation, it's a yes and.

651
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:40,409
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this brings me to maybe the most pressing point for me, why I would be amenable to an idea like this.

652
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:47,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not really any of the reasons listed in the whereas section of this resolution.

653
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:54,756
[SPEAKER_17]: It's because I'm a strong believer that government should push ourselves to make better decisions in the future.

654
00:51:55,917 --> 00:52:04,244
[SPEAKER_17]: make decisions now that put us in tougher positions in the future, that force our hand and make us, that force us to make better decisions.

655
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:18,436
[SPEAKER_17]: I think when we send this to committee, I think we can craft a good deal that's better in execution, but also pushes us in a political direction where we have to accept demands for better for our teachers in Paris.

656
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:22,249
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a little bit different thinking.

657
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:26,253
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a reason I've heard online or from anyone in the last few days.

658
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:34,661
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's how I see the political picture of this, is this forces the city government to be more accountable to our teachers and paraprofessionals.

659
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:49,999
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, again, considering all these principles makes me sympathetic to this resolution, but I do think that there can be tinkering done in committee, and that's why I'm particularly grateful.

660
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:53,722
[SPEAKER_17]: that President Morell amended her paper before introducing it to us.

661
00:52:55,123 --> 00:53:08,873
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would be especially reasonable to discuss changes in timing or phasing in, even though, again, the money that we need to solve large structural challenges citywide in our schools far exceeds the amount that's proposed.

662
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:18,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think it would be prudent to phase this in as we get more information about the greater financial picture with the FY25 budget and with the new budget ordinance that we're

663
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,161
[SPEAKER_17]: intent on passing soon.

664
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:24,842
[SPEAKER_17]: That way, we can make sure that this is additive and not subtractive.

665
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:25,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

666
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:27,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

667
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:28,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello.

668
00:53:29,264 --> 00:53:29,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

669
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:33,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I, for one, never ran for this job for the money.

670
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,306
[SPEAKER_18]: I never considered it a part-time job.

671
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:39,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I think considering this, running for this as a job, is insulting to me.

672
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:48,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I ran for the last 12 years for community service and for the goodness of the community, not for the money.

673
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:03,931
[SPEAKER_18]: For those who don't know, when I first got elected to the council, former councilor Pintus here, the pay was $22,000.

674
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:07,193
[SPEAKER_18]: And we used to get a stipend for expenses.

675
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:09,314
[SPEAKER_18]: And somewhere along the line,

676
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:13,551
[SPEAKER_18]: They changed the stipend and they ran it into the pay.

677
00:54:13,692 --> 00:54:17,254
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what brought the pay up to the $28,000.

678
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:20,317
[SPEAKER_18]: But the original salary when I ran was $22,000.

679
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:25,881
[SPEAKER_18]: So let people know, we didn't get a raise.

680
00:54:25,941 --> 00:54:29,404
[SPEAKER_18]: No one voted us a raise of that money to get us up to that amount.

681
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:33,908
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that was maybe eight, nine years ago when that happened.

682
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:40,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here because I sat here for the last 12 years because I wanted to be here.

683
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:42,489
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not here for the money.

684
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of the money that I make, I donate back to the community.

685
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:47,132
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm involved in the community.

686
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:52,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm involved in a small community, then everybody in this whole council together on different boards, commissions, and groups.

687
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:59,240
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anyone that ever sat here for the money, sadly mistaken.

688
00:55:01,192 --> 00:55:09,796
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna support Councilor Scarpelli's motion to drop our pay down to the pay of the school committee.

689
00:55:10,537 --> 00:55:25,524
[SPEAKER_18]: If everybody wants to be fair and equitable, and I was one of the votes when we changed to the twice a month meetings, I supported cutting our pay in half also then, and I'm gonna support it again tonight.

690
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:29,586
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where this councilor stands and will always stand.

691
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:39,750
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

692
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:44,194
[SPEAKER_33]: Must have some English teachers in the room today.

693
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:45,815
[SPEAKER_33]: Fiction, maybe a little fiction.

694
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,316
[SPEAKER_33]: There's some fiction going on here tonight.

695
00:55:48,197 --> 00:55:50,018
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, it's a good story.

696
00:55:51,319 --> 00:56:00,507
[SPEAKER_33]: But to me, being the cynic that I am, it does somewhat sound like a money grab for the faces that I share in campaign literature.

697
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:05,579
[SPEAKER_33]: You run as a slate, and then the first thing you do is move to give raises.

698
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:17,382
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that presents a questionable standard of ethics that the next council is going to have to deal with.

699
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:20,463
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't think it's fair to them that they're going to be put in that position.

700
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:26,145
[SPEAKER_33]: When looking at the paper on face value, the paper is contrary to law.

701
00:56:27,643 --> 00:56:38,971
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, you know, we look at MGL section 71 chapter 71 section 53 as the enabling language to give the city council the authority to issue raises.

702
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:54,601
[SPEAKER_33]: But if you look what that section of the general law says, um, in its first line, it says the school committee shall serve without compensation, but they may be compensated for this services by a majority vote of the city council.

703
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:56,963
[SPEAKER_33]: This has already been done.

704
00:56:58,851 --> 00:56:59,792
[SPEAKER_33]: This has already been done.

705
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:12,583
[SPEAKER_33]: The language in the general laws that speaks to salary adjustments is governed under Chapter 44, Section 33A.

706
00:57:14,284 --> 00:57:23,752
[SPEAKER_33]: And this section clearly reads that the annual budget shall include the sum sufficient to pay the salaries of all officers and employees, fixed by law or witness.

707
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:27,275
[SPEAKER_33]: Our budget's passed, and these figures are not included in that budget.

708
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:50,152
[SPEAKER_33]: The section also reads, no new position shall be created or an increase in any rate made by ordinance, vote, or appointment during the financial year subsequent to the submission of the annual budget, unless provision, therefore, has been made by means of a supplemental appropriation.

709
00:57:51,392 --> 00:57:59,655
[SPEAKER_33]: Without a money paper, we can't change the ordinance based on state law in my reading, which is a question for

710
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:03,445
[SPEAKER_33]: the ever so invisible and elusive city solicitor.

711
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,330
[SPEAKER_33]: I thank the council president for entertaining me.

712
00:58:14,832 --> 00:58:17,873
[SPEAKER_33]: Included in our packets this evening were a series of amendments that I have offered.

713
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:24,317
[SPEAKER_33]: In response to this paper, I would spare the chairman the

714
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:43,726
[SPEAKER_33]: long duration of having to read through it and motion that it be included as part of this paper going forward and hope that the new city council and their divine wisdom acts in the best interest of this community.

715
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:53,751
[SPEAKER_33]: We hear a lot of talk about a revenue crisis, the need for the city of Medford to raise more revenue

716
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,752
[SPEAKER_33]: the need for a Proposition 2.5 override.

717
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:07,554
[SPEAKER_33]: And when this issue came up previously, there was some discussion about whether or not it was really a revenue crisis or a spending problem.

718
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:17,057
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that when we look at a paper like this, I think that it shows that we do have a little bit of a spending problem.

719
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:22,898
[SPEAKER_33]: And a solution to hard decisions a lot of the time is to throw money at it.

720
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:28,415
[SPEAKER_33]: And that does not fix systemic problems and issues.

721
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:40,186
[SPEAKER_33]: So with that being said, I do thank my council colleague for the time and do ask that the paper be included by way of a motion to waive the reading and include.

722
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:45,371
[SPEAKER_38]: Is the proponent of the paper amenable to including those questions as an amendment?

723
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:45,511
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure.

724
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:46,953
[SPEAKER_38]: Great.

725
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,155
[SPEAKER_38]: So Councilor Knight's papers will be referred

726
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:51,253
[SPEAKER_38]: under the motion to Committee of the Whole.

727
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:54,516
[SPEAKER_38]: If it passes, to the Committee of the Whole for further discussion along with the paper.

728
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:56,718
[SPEAKER_38]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

729
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,822
[SPEAKER_38]: Seeing none, we will go to members of the public.

730
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:02,063
[SPEAKER_38]: I will alternate between

731
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:05,078
[SPEAKER_38]: in person, in public, and Zoom.

732
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:08,121
[SPEAKER_38]: If you are on Zoom, please raise your hand.

733
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:10,723
[SPEAKER_38]: If you are a member of the public, please stand in line.

734
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:13,765
[SPEAKER_38]: If you do not want to stand in line, try to grab a seat.

735
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:16,707
[SPEAKER_38]: I think we all will respect not cutting or cutting.

736
01:00:17,307 --> 01:00:19,629
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, we're going to do two minutes per person.

737
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:23,492
[SPEAKER_38]: I would like everyone to please provide their name and address for the record.

738
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:25,634
[SPEAKER_38]: And we will start with the person at the chair.

739
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:27,175
[SPEAKER_38]: Please provide your name and address for the record.

740
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:28,916
[SPEAKER_38]: And I will give you a 30-second warning.

741
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,537
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Maureen Lavin.

742
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:31,598
[SPEAKER_28]: I live in Stoneham.

743
01:00:32,381 --> 01:00:33,962
[SPEAKER_28]: I was born and raised in Medford.

744
01:00:34,742 --> 01:00:37,423
[SPEAKER_28]: I am a Medford public school teacher.

745
01:00:38,603 --> 01:00:40,844
[SPEAKER_28]: And I had no intention of speaking this evening.

746
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:48,047
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to just give you a few bullet points of things to consider.

747
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:55,529
[SPEAKER_28]: One, our paraprofessionals make $17,000 a year.

748
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:56,610
[SPEAKER_28]: They work full time.

749
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,958
[SPEAKER_28]: with our most at need students full time.

750
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:13,448
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of their pay is beyond that, but there are some people that are trying to make a living off of making $17,000 a year.

751
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:17,352
[SPEAKER_28]: That is ridiculous to me, okay?

752
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:22,798
[SPEAKER_28]: The teachers have been without a contract

753
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:26,945
[SPEAKER_28]: How long did we go, a year and a half or so without a contract?

754
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:42,089
[SPEAKER_28]: So if the school committee would like a raise, maybe they should hold signs out front during city council meetings.

755
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:44,430
[SPEAKER_28]: And beg for a 3% raise.

756
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,771
[SPEAKER_28]: It's ridiculous to me that we're having this conversation.

757
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:51,652
[SPEAKER_28]: We have been threatened

758
01:01:52,768 --> 01:02:01,531
[SPEAKER_28]: by our current central administration of job cuts, upward of 30 teaching positions are at risk of being cut.

759
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,051
[SPEAKER_35]: 30 seconds left.

760
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:05,012
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you guys had more than two minutes, so.

761
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:08,093
[SPEAKER_38]: I just ask you to respect the rules.

762
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:08,473
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

763
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:13,775
[SPEAKER_28]: And my position at the high school got cut.

764
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:18,497
[SPEAKER_28]: I am the only female physical education teacher at Medford High School.

765
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:21,207
[SPEAKER_28]: So you want to talk about gender issues.

766
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:29,797
[SPEAKER_28]: There's not a co-ed public high school in the universe that doesn't have a male and a female physical education teacher.

767
01:02:30,657 --> 01:02:32,540
[SPEAKER_28]: I got moved down to the middle school, which is great.

768
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,861
[SPEAKER_28]: I love the Andrews Middle School.

769
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:39,828
[SPEAKER_28]: But we have left our high school without a female physical education teacher, which means

770
01:02:41,055 --> 01:02:44,378
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no one to oversee the locker room, the safety of the locker room.

771
01:02:44,418 --> 01:02:47,420
[SPEAKER_28]: We know bathrooms have violence in them.

772
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,422
[SPEAKER_28]: We have it documented in the high school.

773
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:55,706
[SPEAKER_28]: If you've been into the women's locker room in Bedford High School, it's bigger than I don't know.

774
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,508
[SPEAKER_28]: It's probably three times the size of this room.

775
01:02:58,829 --> 01:03:00,190
[SPEAKER_28]: So gender equity.

776
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,411
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I have an issue with that.

777
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,593
[SPEAKER_28]: This is, I believe, is a Title nine violation.

778
01:03:03,633 --> 01:03:06,495
[SPEAKER_28]: So I don't know how to register that, but that needs to be brought up.

779
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:12,537
[SPEAKER_28]: boys and girls should both have equal access to locker rooms, right?

780
01:03:12,637 --> 01:03:14,037
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just no brainer.

781
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:22,481
[SPEAKER_28]: But if the school committee would like a raise, then maybe three, let's start with 3%.

782
01:03:22,521 --> 01:03:24,901
[SPEAKER_28]: 140% seems mind blowing to me.

783
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:28,303
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.

784
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:39,260
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to Anne-Marie Cugno on Zoom.

785
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:40,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Say it again?

786
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:42,482
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to Zoom, Anne-Marie Cugno.

787
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:43,542
[SPEAKER_38]: You can unmute.

788
01:03:43,562 --> 01:03:51,026
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to ask you to unmute again.

789
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:13,417
[SPEAKER_38]: just waiting on unmute.

790
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,279
[SPEAKER_38]: All I can do is ask you to unmute.

791
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:16,460
[SPEAKER_38]: I can't unmute you myself.

792
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:26,248
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

793
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:29,151
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please.

794
01:04:30,092 --> 01:04:30,432
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

795
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:31,373
[SPEAKER_38]: So we can hear from everyone.

796
01:04:31,393 --> 01:04:32,013
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a long line.

797
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:32,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

798
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:36,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha.

799
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:44,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

800
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:53,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight have said.

801
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:56,792
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's call this what it is.

802
01:04:56,812 --> 01:05:01,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest.

803
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:05,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is, this is not a gender issue.

804
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:07,359
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a power issue.

805
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:19,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what

806
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:41,989
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget?

807
01:05:43,075 --> 01:05:48,344
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million.

808
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:52,190
[SPEAKER_10]: $25 million could be used and utilized in so many more things.

809
01:05:53,226 --> 01:05:58,709
[SPEAKER_10]: than just the school committee increase or a school committee increase.

810
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:13,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind

811
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: the chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary.

812
01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:28,692
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also the same people that said.

813
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:36,971
[SPEAKER_10]: They are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs.

814
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:44,358
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall.

815
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:45,659
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the same.

816
01:06:47,071 --> 01:07:16,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Board committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their

817
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:20,414
[SPEAKER_10]: opportunity to speak what they want.

818
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:25,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, it's the way Zoom works, there's like a lot of sound, it cuts out.

819
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,164
[SPEAKER_38]: Zoom prevents loud disruptions so that people's speakers don't get blown out on their computers or their phones.

820
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:32,526
[SPEAKER_21]: So when you clap, it stops it.

821
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Silence is the whole thing.

822
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:37,371
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not a Zach against George thing.

823
01:07:41,694 --> 01:07:51,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person.

824
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:52,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I would definitely want to be there but

825
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:57,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half.

826
01:07:57,746 --> 01:08:03,830
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise.

827
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%.

828
01:08:08,913 --> 01:08:14,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Give them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for.

829
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:19,759
[SPEAKER_10]: If we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.

830
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,201
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Anne-Marie.

831
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:28,610
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to go to the podium.

832
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,651
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. Penta, name and address for the record, please.

833
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:31,251
[SPEAKER_38]: You have two minutes.

834
01:08:31,271 --> 01:08:33,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a two-page statement.

835
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:33,872
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

836
01:08:33,992 --> 01:08:39,555
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this August party on the City Council.

837
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:51,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, does grant to the City Council, by a majority vote and by the city charter, the responsibility of how much members of the school committee get paid.

838
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:59,165
[SPEAKER_03]: But historically, the city council has paid more than the city school committee because the council's responsibilities exceed those of the school committee.

839
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:13,214
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council responsibilities include, but are not limited to enacting ordinances, zoning, fire and police, public safety requirements, setting the city's tax rate, and has the final authority over the city and school department budget.

840
01:09:13,895 --> 01:09:21,540
[SPEAKER_03]: As examples of major differences between one challenging equal pay for equal work between the city council and the school committee.

841
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:27,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Further, just as in any business, job responsibilities and pay are what one is applying for.

842
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:35,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Under this proposal, it is a gender attack being disguised as pay parity, for equal pay for equal work, for which it is not.

843
01:09:36,008 --> 01:09:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: The proposed school department 100% plus pay increase will be paid from the Medford Public Schools.

844
01:09:41,952 --> 01:09:43,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a look at what that means.

845
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:49,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Annually, we are barely able to meet the resources we have now at our school's disposal.

846
01:09:50,282 --> 01:10:00,596
[SPEAKER_03]: If we cut further any of our school resources by not funding them, and instead giving them 100% plus salary increase for school committee members, we should be concerned as to where we are heading.

847
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:10,485
[SPEAKER_03]: If we are to cut some $90,000, because that's what it'll come to, plus each year from going forward from the school department budget, the results can possibly affect the following.

848
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:13,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Fewer instructional hours for students.

849
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:15,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Elimination of AP classes.

850
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Increased class sizes.

851
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:19,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Elimination of some athletic programming.

852
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:22,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Elimination of support for some school activities.

853
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Elimination of school librarians.

854
01:10:24,297 --> 01:10:25,398
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. Penty, you have 30 seconds.

855
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:28,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the rules say five minutes if you check the council rules.

856
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:44,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Reductions in council services, school security being at risk, reduced custodial cleaning and maintenance, after school programming, migrant student education support, and unbeing prepared for migrant student educational support.

857
01:10:44,904 --> 01:10:48,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant the public schools short and long range term should not be subject to this.

858
01:10:49,387 --> 01:10:56,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the school committee pay increase does go through, what do you say about the salary for the everyday school paraprofessionals?

859
01:10:57,051 --> 01:11:00,973
[SPEAKER_03]: As example, every class assistant under five years would finally earn $30,000.

860
01:11:01,593 --> 01:11:05,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyday kindergarten teachers after five years would only earn $25,980.

861
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:20,132
[SPEAKER_03]: This after five years, while the school committee would receive $29,000 annually for a part time job with no everyday reporting requirements and responsibilities is at best.

862
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:35,124
[SPEAKER_03]: If the city council is to accept this ridiculous proposal, maybe the council should then set a pay scale standard for both the city council and the school committee for years of service as compared to pay scales a standard for just every other municipal employee.

863
01:11:36,577 --> 01:11:49,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the presently proposed gender issue of females being more in number who are elected to serve is not only discriminatory, but a sexist allegation that has no merit.

864
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:53,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about a person who claims to be other?

865
01:11:53,525 --> 01:11:58,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about when trends tend to go back to when men become more elected than women?

866
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:06,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Being elected is a gender neutral opportunity, not to be disguised as pay parity for equal pay for equal work.

867
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:12,100
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said in the beginning, job responsibilities and pay are the guidelines for which one is applying for.

868
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:20,347
[SPEAKER_03]: As of this meeting, there has been no input from community members on the Medford School Committee regarding this 100 plus salary increase.

869
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:43,126
[SPEAKER_03]: As a thought, and this flows right into what you said Councilor Scarpelli, if the council is so inclined to accept this measure of allowing this red herring issue of more females than males being elected officials, then maybe in the spirit of physical conservatism and the council being magnanimous, the council should entertain

870
01:12:43,806 --> 01:12:49,887
[SPEAKER_03]: being paid the same $12,000, as we said before, annual salary that the school committee is currently paid.

871
01:12:50,447 --> 01:13:07,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, on the city side, if the city can save $90,000 annually from their city council salary, which can be used for municipal needs, the school department, one sentence, the school department will not lose the $90,000 annually that can go to public school education.

872
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:08,171
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

873
01:13:11,072 --> 01:13:11,512
[SPEAKER_03]: One sentence.

874
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:15,587
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Penta, I just gave you an incredible deference, thank you for your time.

875
01:13:15,627 --> 01:13:17,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna close by saying my following sentence.

876
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:19,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Penta, Mr. Penta.

877
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:20,288
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

878
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:21,169
[SPEAKER_37]: Please.

879
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:22,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, hey, wait a minute.

880
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,430
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm asking you to respect everybody's time here.

881
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,910
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so if you have to- We have rules.

882
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,671
[SPEAKER_37]: Why are you exempt from the rules, Mr. Penta?

883
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:31,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask you a serious question.

884
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:39,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I served on this board for 36 years, and we stayed here sometimes till 12 and one o'clock in the morning to let everybody speak, not to be shut off.

885
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:41,395
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm letting everybody speak, thank you.

886
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:43,439
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

887
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:44,561
[SPEAKER_37]: Eileen, you're recognized.

888
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:45,864
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Penza, please, thank you.

889
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:46,726
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for your time.

890
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:49,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make my last sentence.

891
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:49,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mind?

892
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:50,093
[SPEAKER_37]: Save the sentence.

893
01:13:50,414 --> 01:13:50,995
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I might.

894
01:13:51,075 --> 01:13:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

895
01:13:52,355 --> 01:14:01,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I shall close by saying, why did the city council president put this controversial proposal on the agenda now?

896
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it because of the busy Christmas season and it being at the end of the year?

897
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,924
[SPEAKER_03]: With the hopes that nobody would observe it and find out.

898
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:09,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did.

899
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:10,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did.

900
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:12,646
[SPEAKER_37]: It was not, but thank you.

901
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:15,388
[SPEAKER_37]: Eileen, name and address for the record, please.

902
01:14:17,188 --> 01:14:25,036
[SPEAKER_45]: Okay, so my name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, Mass., and I support the proposal.

903
01:14:26,037 --> 01:14:30,702
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that $29,000 is a part-time salary.

904
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:36,167
[SPEAKER_45]: How could anyone survive on $29,000 in Medford?

905
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:39,330
[SPEAKER_45]: It just doesn't make sense to me.

906
01:14:40,131 --> 01:14:46,754
[SPEAKER_45]: And I do recognize that we need to pay so many people in our school system more money.

907
01:14:47,535 --> 01:14:53,958
[SPEAKER_45]: It's absolutely clear that we need more employees and we need to pay the ones that are there more.

908
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:58,360
[SPEAKER_45]: And it's an injustice that they're not getting what they deserve.

909
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:04,263
[SPEAKER_45]: But I don't think that creating more injustice makes for justice.

910
01:15:04,863 --> 01:15:07,485
[SPEAKER_45]: Two injustices doesn't make justice.

911
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:08,885
[SPEAKER_45]: And I think that

912
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:18,343
[SPEAKER_45]: you know, to say that anybody is working for the money, just because they're going to get $29,000 is ridiculous.

913
01:15:18,443 --> 01:15:20,204
[SPEAKER_45]: That's such a little sum of money.

914
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:27,289
[SPEAKER_45]: And we've just found out this lot of money that can pay for it and hopefully for more than that.

915
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,712
[SPEAKER_45]: And I'd like to see everybody.

916
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:33,213
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

917
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:36,776
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

918
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:38,077
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for your time.

919
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,088
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, I would just ask everyone to respect everyone who's speaking.

920
01:15:43,108 --> 01:15:44,088
[SPEAKER_38]: We're hearing from everyone.

921
01:15:44,688 --> 01:15:48,229
[SPEAKER_38]: As I noted, there are a lot of people who want to speak, and that's the reason there's a time limit.

922
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:50,669
[SPEAKER_38]: I ask everyone to respect it, regardless of who they are.

923
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:51,709
[SPEAKER_38]: Ms.

924
01:15:51,729 --> 01:15:52,149
[SPEAKER_38]: Brandly.

925
01:15:52,169 --> 01:15:53,690
[SPEAKER_42]: Hello.

926
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,750
[SPEAKER_38]: Please name and address for the record.

927
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,350
[SPEAKER_38]: Two minutes.

928
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:58,291
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll give you a warning, and I'm giving a little leeway here.

929
01:15:58,331 --> 01:15:58,671
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

930
01:15:59,011 --> 01:15:59,391
[SPEAKER_51]: All right.

931
01:15:59,471 --> 01:15:59,751
[SPEAKER_51]: Got it.

932
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:02,351
[SPEAKER_51]: So you put me in a tricky position.

933
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:03,872
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm Nicole Brandly.

934
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:05,412
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm at 54 Norwich Circle.

935
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:10,666
[SPEAKER_51]: And as a newly elected school committee member, I questioned if I should speak tonight.

936
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:13,807
[SPEAKER_51]: I feel like I'm torn between everybody, right?

937
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:17,868
[SPEAKER_51]: So as always, I also know I couldn't stay quiet.

938
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:23,470
[SPEAKER_51]: So I look over the agendas for both our city council and our school committee as they become available.

939
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:30,172
[SPEAKER_51]: And when I read the city council agenda last week, I was shocked at the pay increase.

940
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,413
[SPEAKER_51]: There's been a lot of accusation on social media that

941
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:36,009
[SPEAKER_51]: newly elected members are somehow pushing for this.

942
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:37,049
[SPEAKER_51]: I had no idea.

943
01:16:39,231 --> 01:16:43,794
[SPEAKER_51]: I actually had to read the proposal twice.

944
01:16:44,794 --> 01:16:46,495
[SPEAKER_51]: And then I asked someone else to read it for me.

945
01:16:47,996 --> 01:16:51,759
[SPEAKER_51]: I did not run for the school committee seat for the salary.

946
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:54,320
[SPEAKER_51]: Although I do appreciate the salary.

947
01:16:55,441 --> 01:17:01,725
[SPEAKER_51]: But if you've seen me up at this podium over the last year, you know my motivation and surely where my heart is.

948
01:17:02,987 --> 01:17:07,090
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm the only person in this city, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, I'm sure they will somewhere.

949
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:16,396
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm the only person in this city who can say that I've been elected to a school committee seat, but have also worked at the city of Medford as a kindergarten aide.

950
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:28,189
[SPEAKER_51]: So I held that beloved position for six years, and according to my W-2s, because I'm a good record keeper, in 2020, for my 180-day full-time position, I earned $17,642.93.

951
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,070
[SPEAKER_51]: I left that position.

952
01:17:39,895 --> 01:17:43,437
[SPEAKER_51]: because it is a not fair living wage, and it's still not.

953
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:48,160
[SPEAKER_51]: And like too many unions in this city, we also had no contract at the time.

954
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:56,746
[SPEAKER_51]: I've sat at most of these meetings, whether it's for good reason or bad, and George's, Mr. Scarpelli's right, we have to come all the time.

955
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:07,873
[SPEAKER_51]: I've sat here and watched all of these unions sit here in solidarity with each other, asking for contracts, asking for a fair living wage, for their rightfully earned COVID pay,

956
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:13,489
[SPEAKER_51]: There are still unions in this city negotiating their contracts, most namely the police.

957
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:20,775
[SPEAKER_51]: As a newly elected official, I believe the $17,359.80 pay increase for us on this school committee is fiscally irresponsible.

958
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,262
[SPEAKER_36]: our current 30 more seconds.

959
01:18:29,342 --> 01:18:31,423
[SPEAKER_51]: Okay, our start our current stipend is fair.

960
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:35,966
[SPEAKER_51]: And although not equivalent to you on the city council, I'm not sure it really should be.

961
01:18:35,986 --> 01:18:43,631
[SPEAKER_51]: I don't think anyone would begrudge the school committee a fair living wage increase like other unions in the city have agreed on.

962
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,933
[SPEAKER_51]: But this proposed increase is exorbitant.

963
01:18:46,113 --> 01:18:48,875
[SPEAKER_51]: It's not in line with the increases anybody else has gotten in the city.

964
01:18:49,736 --> 01:18:57,301
[SPEAKER_51]: And I have sat right here in this room listening to the budget hearings and never once have I heard that we have any extra money, especially in our school budget.

965
01:18:58,221 --> 01:19:08,307
[SPEAKER_51]: I also think this proposal itself causes even more animosity between elected officials, like all of us, and the same people that voted us in to do the right thing.

966
01:19:09,348 --> 01:19:10,549
[SPEAKER_51]: So let's do the right thing.

967
01:19:10,569 --> 01:19:11,589
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

968
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:12,090
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Ms.

969
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,350
[SPEAKER_37]: Framley.

970
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:18,333
[SPEAKER_37]: And thank you for your respect for the rules.

971
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:22,596
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Christina McGordy on Zoom, and then I'll come back to you, Mr. D'Antonio.

972
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:29,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Christina McGordy, 24 North Street.

973
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:33,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say, and I'll try and keep it brief.

974
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:39,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I learned about this proposal, I've kind of had a lot of back and forth emotions.

975
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:45,952
[SPEAKER_01]: My first initial reaction was just sort of like, well, we don't have the money for that.

976
01:19:46,693 --> 01:19:53,076
[SPEAKER_01]: But after hearing the thoughtful discussion behind where it came from, I definitely

977
01:19:54,406 --> 01:19:58,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely appreciate and agree with the spirit behind this.

978
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:09,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the people who say that being an elected official is, you do it, you don't do it for the money, you do it because you want to provide service, like, of course.

979
01:20:09,339 --> 01:20:14,904
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also comes from a place of privilege because you are able to do it.

980
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:20,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that as someone who is able to not work and pretty much volunteers 100% of my time.

981
01:20:22,811 --> 01:20:30,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it because I want to do it, but I also know that I'm in a unique position from a lot of other people who can't do it.

982
01:20:31,401 --> 01:20:42,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it is important to think about increasing the pay because like as people have stated, it will help us to get more diversity and we need that on our

983
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:44,535
[SPEAKER_01]: representative bodies.

984
01:20:45,136 --> 01:21:01,793
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want to say that as a parent of two kids, as someone who started subbing because there were zero subs at our school, I just, I want to obviously make sure everyone is thinking about

985
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:06,898
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, equal, fair pay for everyone.

986
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,661
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay our subs $90 a day.

987
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:13,606
[SPEAKER_01]: That is much less than they pay in surrounding communities.

988
01:21:14,106 --> 01:21:22,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's shortages everywhere, but how can we get people to come work and cover when, you know, we don't pay as much.

989
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:24,957
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just sort of like, I just want to say that.

990
01:21:26,118 --> 01:21:27,178
[SPEAKER_01]: just to put out there.

991
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:32,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea where it was, you know, Nicole mentioned doing it in, or Ms.

992
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:36,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Morell said something about doing it in a phased approach.

993
01:21:37,001 --> 01:21:43,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have this like extra free money, I would love to hear that.

994
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:53,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, they're able to increase the paraprofessional pay and the sub pay so that everyone feels like they're getting compensation for their work.

995
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,547
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, thank you.

996
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:55,027
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

997
01:21:56,305 --> 01:21:57,147
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for your time.

998
01:21:57,327 --> 01:21:58,128
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll go to the podium.

999
01:21:58,168 --> 01:21:59,170
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. D'Antonio.

1000
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,471
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1001
01:21:59,691 --> 01:22:00,713
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please.

1002
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:03,618
[SPEAKER_48]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue in Medford.

1003
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,803
[SPEAKER_48]: I brought the wrong damn glasses today.

1004
01:22:07,145 --> 01:22:09,269
[SPEAKER_48]: Anyway, here's my take on this whole thing.

1005
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:15,989
[SPEAKER_48]: Financial integrity in politics, especially within the role of a city councilor, stands as a cornerstone of ethical governance.

1006
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:26,056
[SPEAKER_48]: The significance of maintaining an unwavering financial integrity cannot be overstated as it forms the bedrock of trust, transparency, and accountability within the realm of public service.

1007
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:35,043
[SPEAKER_48]: At its core, financial integrity in politics embodies a commitment to honesty, responsibility, and ethical behavior in handling public funds and resources.

1008
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:43,483
[SPEAKER_48]: As a city councilor, one assumes the crucial responsibility of managing taxpayer money and making decisions that directly impact the community's well-being.

1009
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:52,415
[SPEAKER_48]: This trust bestowed upon the Council necessitates the highest level of ethical conduct, particularly in financial matters.

1010
01:22:52,915 --> 01:22:56,438
[SPEAKER_48]: The ramifications of financial impropriety can be severe and far-reaching.

1011
01:22:57,018 --> 01:23:05,464
[SPEAKER_48]: Misuse or mismanagement of public funds not only undermines the public's confidence in their elected official, but also erodes the foundations of democracy itself.

1012
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:14,510
[SPEAKER_48]: It jeopardizes the credibility of the Council and the entire institution of governance, casting doubt on the motives and intentions behind policy decisions.

1013
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:20,312
[SPEAKER_48]: Maintaining financial integrity as a city councilor goes beyond adhering to legal statutes.

1014
01:23:20,472 --> 01:23:22,633
[SPEAKER_48]: It embodies a commitment to ethical leadership.

1015
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:30,116
[SPEAKER_48]: Transparency in financial dealings, proper allocation of resources, and rigorous accountability measures are imperative.

1016
01:23:30,656 --> 01:23:39,240
[SPEAKER_48]: Striving for transparency ensures that constituents are aware of how their tax dollars are utilized, fostering trust and credibility in the council's decisions.

1017
01:23:42,128 --> 01:23:46,411
[SPEAKER_48]: Integrity in financial matters also extends to ethical fundraising and campaign finance.

1018
01:23:46,951 --> 01:23:51,714
[SPEAKER_48]: Ultimately, financial integrity is the linchpin that upholds a councilor's ethical compass.

1019
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:58,358
[SPEAKER_48]: It forms the basis for sound decision-making, fosters public trust, and strengthens the democratic process.

1020
01:23:58,878 --> 01:24:08,644
[SPEAKER_48]: As a city councilor, embracing and championing financial integrity isn't just a duty, it's a commitment to serve the public interest with honor, honesty, and unwavering ethical standards.

1021
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:09,084
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

1022
01:24:09,977 --> 01:24:11,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. D'Antonio.

1023
01:24:11,078 --> 01:24:11,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President.

1024
01:24:11,598 --> 01:24:13,419
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, if I can.

1025
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Just one second.

1026
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Sharpell.

1027
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a point of information.

1028
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:22,084
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a comment that's out that there's $25 million we can spend.

1029
01:24:22,965 --> 01:24:23,585
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not true.

1030
01:24:23,745 --> 01:24:24,066
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not.

1031
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,467
[SPEAKER_21]: There isn't $25 million.

1032
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:27,648
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not trying to debate.

1033
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,670
[SPEAKER_21]: It was something that was in our free cash.

1034
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,011
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not like it's still there and that we have to use it.

1035
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:33,571
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not.

1036
01:24:34,012 --> 01:24:34,452
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not.

1037
01:24:34,672 --> 01:24:36,633
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a point of clarification.

1038
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:39,115
[SPEAKER_38]: The free cash reserves are currently at $25 million.

1039
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:41,536
[SPEAKER_38]: Until they're certified, they can't even be appropriated.

1040
01:24:42,137 --> 01:24:44,378
[SPEAKER_38]: Just one moment, we have someone on Zoom, and then I'll come back to the podium.

1041
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:54,004
[SPEAKER_38]: Kathy Kreatz, school committee member on Zoom, I just asked you to unmute, and I'll just ask for your name and address, and then you'll have two minutes.

1042
01:24:56,277 --> 01:24:57,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1043
01:24:57,338 --> 01:24:59,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Kathy Kreatz.

1044
01:24:59,822 --> 01:25:02,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 391 Fulton Street, Medford.

1045
01:25:03,387 --> 01:25:04,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I can't be there tonight.

1046
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:07,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I had something going on here at the house.

1047
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:11,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, so I just wanted to, you know, kind

1048
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:22,783
[SPEAKER_00]: to set something clear is, you know, the first time as a school committee member that I heard about this raise was by reading it on the city council agenda.

1049
01:25:23,303 --> 01:25:32,308
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not something that the school committee discussed or even received any communications from the city council on.

1050
01:25:33,289 --> 01:25:36,450
[SPEAKER_00]: We were, you know, in my own personal opinion,

1051
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:39,413
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even thinking about a raise.

1052
01:25:40,013 --> 01:25:41,955
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't even something we were discussing.

1053
01:25:43,516 --> 01:25:50,542
[SPEAKER_00]: In eight years that I've been on school committee, at one point, there was a raise discussed years ago.

1054
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,103
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before COVID.

1055
01:25:52,704 --> 01:26:05,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And we declined, voted it down, because we wanted to make sure that if there was any additional funds, it went to the school budget, to the teachers, to the students, and the needs of the schools.

1056
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:12,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's any additional money, which there isn't, it should go directly to the schools.

1057
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,762
[SPEAKER_00]: It should go to the needs of the students and the teachers.

1058
01:26:17,763 --> 01:26:23,467
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard from, you know, a lot of the members that have spoken tonight and the community has come out.

1059
01:26:24,147 --> 01:26:35,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I totally agree that if there's extra money, this extra money for salaries should go to the parents to raise their salaries, not the school committee members.

1060
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:45,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is a volunteer job, and I've been doing it for eight years, not expecting any pay.

1061
01:26:45,904 --> 01:27:00,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires dedication, love, commitment, just being there to hear and understand and listen to the needs of everybody in the community, the teachers, the students, the families, caregivers.

1062
01:27:01,278 --> 01:27:02,439
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about the salary.

1063
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:05,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I was confused about the resolution.

1064
01:27:05,622 --> 01:27:06,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did they come from?

1065
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:09,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did they speak to?

1066
01:27:09,867 --> 01:27:11,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really confused.

1067
01:27:11,488 --> 01:27:16,133
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to set it clear that the school committee did not have any meetings.

1068
01:27:16,473 --> 01:27:18,675
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not talking about raising our salary.

1069
01:27:19,096 --> 01:27:20,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking from my own personal opinion.

1070
01:27:21,017 --> 01:27:22,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's reached out to me.

1071
01:27:22,839 --> 01:27:24,300
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a thought in my mind.

1072
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:30,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised and confused and disheartened by the resolution.

1073
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:33,664
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just something that we're not expecting.

1074
01:27:33,884 --> 01:27:38,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did hear, I got into the meeting late, but I did hear

1075
01:27:39,326 --> 01:27:46,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Caraviello, Councilor Caraviello mentioned that a pay cut in their salaries to make the salaries equal.

1076
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:57,997
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that would be the best way to make the salaries equal across the two different, you know, boards between the school committee and the city council.

1077
01:27:58,517 --> 01:28:06,381
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's going to be any changes, then maybe a decrease in the salary to bring the councilor salary back down to the school committee salary.

1078
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:24,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I got my point across and I wasn't prepared and ready to speak, but I just hope that I made it clear that I object to this resolution and I hope and I pray that it does not pass tonight.

1079
01:28:24,907 --> 01:28:26,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your time.

1080
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:27,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.

1081
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,949
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Kathy.

1082
01:28:29,989 --> 01:28:30,809
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for speaking.

1083
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:32,450
[SPEAKER_38]: Just one second.

1084
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:34,190
[SPEAKER_38]: Kathy brings up a good point.

1085
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,111
[SPEAKER_38]: People may have come into the room or joined.

1086
01:28:36,596 --> 01:28:37,757
[SPEAKER_38]: since the motions were made.

1087
01:28:37,797 --> 01:28:42,779
[SPEAKER_38]: But the current motion on the floor is amendments from President Morell and Councilor Knight.

1088
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,440
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Knight's for some legal questions.

1089
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:57,007
[SPEAKER_38]: President Morell has amended to strike some sentences around the majority makeup of the bodies as well as has suggested that future committee of the whole look at a phase in or or a change to this proposal.

1090
01:28:57,367 --> 01:28:58,827
[SPEAKER_38]: So that is what is currently up for.

1091
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:01,549
[SPEAKER_38]: That is the motion currently on the floor is to send this to committee of the whole

1092
01:29:02,029 --> 01:29:03,770
[SPEAKER_38]: for more discussion with those amendments.

1093
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,951
[SPEAKER_38]: And with that, I will go back to the podium.

1094
01:29:06,572 --> 01:29:06,872
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1095
01:29:06,892 --> 01:29:07,852
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record.

1096
01:29:08,193 --> 01:29:10,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Melanie North, 45 Cross Street.

1097
01:29:11,815 --> 01:29:13,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, City Council.

1098
01:29:13,596 --> 01:29:18,939
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm speaking as an employee, taxpayer, and parent of Medford and Medford Public Schools.

1099
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:25,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I am beyond insulted about this proposed raise that President Morell and any other council member is voting for.

1100
01:29:26,963 --> 01:29:33,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel that it is an abuse of power and pure negligence to even consider this preposterous raise.

1101
01:29:34,265 --> 01:29:37,847
[SPEAKER_14]: As an employee, we were told that there was just no money in the budget.

1102
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:44,329
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, Dr. Cushing just stated last week to McGlynn in a meeting that the budget is the tightest it's ever been.

1103
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:51,855
[SPEAKER_14]: There has also been talk of eliminating even more positions and more layoffs in the next school year due to budget constraints.

1104
01:29:52,175 --> 01:29:58,300
[SPEAKER_14]: However, on the heels of winning the election for many of you and the mayor, you have conveniently located $117,000 in the budget.

1105
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:07,124
[SPEAKER_14]: The paraprofessionals were told that although we were invaluable, the school committee was not able to provide a livable wage.

1106
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:21,090
[SPEAKER_14]: If this 140% raise were to go through, the school committee members would be making more than our most qualified kindergarten aides and classroom assistants that work tirelessly year after year with multiple jobs to survive.

1107
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:25,671
[SPEAKER_14]: We work an average of 1,300 hours and more each school year.

1108
01:30:25,991 --> 01:30:29,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Most, if not all, overtime is unpaid due to budget cuts.

1109
01:30:30,373 --> 01:30:39,997
[SPEAKER_14]: There, this is also being proposed as a general equity issue where the school committee has been dominated by females, which historically has mostly been men.

1110
01:30:40,577 --> 01:30:43,458
[SPEAKER_14]: We have held, that have held the school committee positions.

1111
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,160
[SPEAKER_14]: However, paraprofessionals are by far female dominated.

1112
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So shouldn't we be considered for 140% race?

1113
01:30:55,177 --> 01:31:00,559
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're making this about inequality, we clearly have some work to do on the negotiation table.

1114
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:05,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford is the highest paid school committee in all of our surrounding areas.

1115
01:31:05,522 --> 01:31:07,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done the research.

1116
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:13,965
[SPEAKER_14]: But we were told that there is no money from the very school committee that you're planning to give this raise to.

1117
01:31:14,445 --> 01:31:24,290
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems quite coincidental that suddenly money is appearing to benefit them and not the employees in the trenches every day working with the students to prepare them for the future.

1118
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:33,676
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to entice people to run, it should be so they can be part of making our district the best it can be, not because of the wages that we are going to receive.

1119
01:31:34,337 --> 01:31:36,618
[SPEAKER_14]: You do not run for office to get rich.

1120
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,700
[SPEAKER_14]: You run for office to make a difference.

1121
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:44,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford Public is also actively trying to recruit paraprofessionals every single week.

1122
01:31:44,964 --> 01:31:49,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Who would want to work in a district that will support political roles and not employees?

1123
01:31:49,687 --> 01:31:52,508
[SPEAKER_14]: We have so many other issues that surround this raise.

1124
01:31:52,889 --> 01:32:00,032
[SPEAKER_14]: How about our custodial staff that works tirelessly, even through COVID when everyone else was home, they still don't have a contract.

1125
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:03,454
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the police department that serve and protect our community?

1126
01:32:03,474 --> 01:32:09,898
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe we should be working on getting both contracts done before anything should be discussed about the school committee.

1127
01:32:10,378 --> 01:32:11,819
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on the front lines each day.

1128
01:32:11,839 --> 01:32:16,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been punched in the face, which has resulted in a black eye from a student.

1129
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:18,262
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been pushed, scratched,

1130
01:32:18,422 --> 01:32:21,044
[SPEAKER_14]: and I get verbally abused each and every day.

1131
01:32:21,524 --> 01:32:23,825
[SPEAKER_14]: I worked for a prison for almost two decades.

1132
01:32:24,186 --> 01:32:29,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never been struck by an inmate or dealt with the stuff that I deal with on a daily basis.

1133
01:32:30,069 --> 01:32:31,110
[SPEAKER_14]: That says something.

1134
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:44,378
[SPEAKER_14]: A grievance was put in since last year to be paid for the coverage that I thought I'd been told there's no budget to pay this, yet I show up to work each and every day with our most at-risk students.

1135
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:44,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1136
01:32:45,299 --> 01:32:46,260
[SPEAKER_14]: because I love what I do.

1137
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:57,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm heavily involved in after school programs that I personally run, not because I'm offered money, but because I believe that students should be given the opportunity to succeed in all areas of life.

1138
01:32:58,369 --> 01:33:02,052
[SPEAKER_14]: As a parent, taxpayer, and an employee, this rate is

1139
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:04,073
[SPEAKER_14]: This raise outrages me.

1140
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:13,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Considering our schools are bursting at the seams, McGlynn Elementary is pouring water in kindergarten classrooms every time it rains or snows for the last few years.

1141
01:33:14,042 --> 01:33:20,848
[SPEAKER_14]: When outraged parents demanded this be fixed due to mold issues, we were told it's the flashing, just not in the budget to fix.

1142
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:24,930
[SPEAKER_14]: We need a new high school, and the list continues to grow.

1143
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:34,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet, Medford Public Schools pays so poorly that potential employees who would excel in our schools and be amazing teachers and or paras go to other districts.

1144
01:33:34,857 --> 01:33:43,763
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really heartbreaking that the City Council does not see the need for proper staff and better wages over raising the school committee's raises.

1145
01:33:44,243 --> 01:33:46,465
[SPEAKER_14]: The numbers don't lie, it's in black and white.

1146
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:51,028
[SPEAKER_14]: This does not seem like the fiscal responsibility that Sissy Hall preaches about.

1147
01:33:51,608 --> 01:33:58,292
[SPEAKER_14]: My direct question to you is, the 2004 budget has already been approved for $179 million.

1148
01:33:58,433 --> 01:33:59,953
[SPEAKER_14]: I do my research.

1149
01:34:00,574 --> 01:34:05,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you tell me what line item will be reduced in the school's budget to compensate for these new raises?

1150
01:34:06,978 --> 01:34:07,578
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for your time.

1151
01:34:07,598 --> 01:34:13,442
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1152
01:34:13,562 --> 01:34:16,304
[SPEAKER_38]: I have Rebecca on Zoom.

1153
01:34:16,324 --> 01:34:18,846
[SPEAKER_38]: Give us one second, Rebecca, and then name and address for the record.

1154
01:34:19,306 --> 01:34:20,507
[SPEAKER_38]: Please try to respect the time.

1155
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:20,867
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1156
01:34:23,308 --> 01:34:26,209
[SPEAKER_44]: Rebecca Davidson, 101 Yeoman's Ave.

1157
01:34:27,569 --> 01:34:28,450
[SPEAKER_44]: Good evening, everyone.

1158
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:31,771
[SPEAKER_44]: I support the fact that this proposal is being presented this evening.

1159
01:34:32,011 --> 01:34:39,493
[SPEAKER_44]: It's really important that we have socioeconomic diversity on our elected bodies so that these bodies fully reflect our city.

1160
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:42,054
[SPEAKER_44]: No one is running for the salary.

1161
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:50,077
[SPEAKER_44]: However, not being paid adequately for your time will absolutely constitute a barrier to running for those who are struggling to make ends meet.

1162
01:34:51,343 --> 01:34:55,725
[SPEAKER_44]: This is a barrier not just on school committee, but in government participation in general.

1163
01:34:56,185 --> 01:34:58,486
[SPEAKER_44]: So I appreciate the spirit behind this proposal.

1164
01:34:59,266 --> 01:35:07,769
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm a parent of two kids in Medford, and as many have said, the current pay that our dedicated, hardworking Medford public school staff is nowhere near adequate.

1165
01:35:08,129 --> 01:35:12,131
[SPEAKER_44]: And I wanna thank the teachers that have spoken this evening and highlighted their service to the city.

1166
01:35:12,731 --> 01:35:18,074
[SPEAKER_44]: This has been an opportunity to hear about and spotlight additional equity issues our city is facing.

1167
01:35:18,514 --> 01:35:25,138
[SPEAKER_44]: And from what I'm understanding tonight, there's no way for this body to direct funding to increase pay for MPS staff.

1168
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:27,420
[SPEAKER_44]: That would have to go through different mechanisms.

1169
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:34,464
[SPEAKER_44]: But the intent behind this proposal signals strong support for pay equity within Medford public schools as well.

1170
01:35:35,005 --> 01:35:41,309
[SPEAKER_44]: And my hope is that we can move this conversation to a place where our budget reflects the need to increase salaries.

1171
01:35:41,809 --> 01:35:46,533
[SPEAKER_44]: And for that, we need to be able to explore thoughtful ways of bringing additional revenue to the city.

1172
01:35:47,133 --> 01:35:59,159
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for bringing this proposal to the table as an opportunity to raise awareness of multiple inequities facing our city, resulting from inadequate funding, so that we can move forward to make the city a better place for everyone.

1173
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:03,581
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Rebecca.

1174
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:07,242
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to go to Anna on the podium.

1175
01:36:07,302 --> 01:36:08,683
[SPEAKER_38]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1176
01:36:08,803 --> 01:36:09,103
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1177
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Hannah Silberman, 15 Maynard Street.

1178
01:36:13,045 --> 01:36:13,225
[SPEAKER_36]: Go ahead.

1179
01:36:13,663 --> 01:36:18,850
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, my name is Hannah, and I work at the second largest school in Medford.

1180
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,912
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Roberts Elementary School.

1181
01:36:20,932 --> 01:36:27,681
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes Medford High School, Roberts Elementary School, and then I think the Brooks after that, and then the middle schools.

1182
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:30,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to make that make a little more sense.

1183
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:34,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should talk about rezoning before anyone talks about getting a raise.

1184
01:36:35,269 --> 01:36:38,131
[SPEAKER_08]: At the Roberts, we have 576 students.

1185
01:36:38,351 --> 01:36:41,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running out of physical space to contain them.

1186
01:36:42,395 --> 01:36:49,580
[SPEAKER_08]: 576 students, and yet we have the same amount of support staff as the other elementary schools, and some of which are half the size.

1187
01:36:49,961 --> 01:36:54,484
[SPEAKER_08]: We're down to a skeleton crew, and administration continues to fatten up on school funding.

1188
01:36:55,285 --> 01:37:05,815
[SPEAKER_08]: All we ever hear as teachers is that there isn't enough money, not enough to hire more classroom aides or to pay them more, not enough to raise our substitute pay, not enough money for paper even.

1189
01:37:05,835 --> 01:37:10,379
[SPEAKER_08]: ESSER funds are running out, and those funds pay for over 30 people's salaries.

1190
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,561
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's going to happen to their jobs next year?

1191
01:37:12,982 --> 01:37:18,787
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been told drastic cuts no need to be made, and adding these substantial raises is only going to make that worse.

1192
01:37:19,568 --> 01:37:23,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And you aren't going to find any teachers here who disagree with you about equal pay for equal work.

1193
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:28,895
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a profession that's underpaid because it has historically been the work of women, as you said, President Morell.

1194
01:37:29,815 --> 01:37:40,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet, instead of correcting this, Medford is continuing to do what Medford has always done, spending school funding not on the people doing the physical, emotional, and mental labor of supporting our students,

1195
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:44,508
[SPEAKER_08]: but instead spending the money on those who are already in power.

1196
01:37:45,309 --> 01:37:50,897
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about paying the school committee the same amount or more as our classroom aides for a part-time political job.

1197
01:37:51,397 --> 01:37:56,544
[SPEAKER_08]: School committee stipend pay should be proportional to the pay of the people doing the work face-to-face with those students.

1198
01:37:57,225 --> 01:38:00,447
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to show that you care about equity, this is not the way to do it.

1199
01:38:00,907 --> 01:38:07,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins Councilor Tseng you said that this is not a zero sum game but then you need to show us, because so far this is all we see.

1200
01:38:08,171 --> 01:38:13,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we're talking about here tonight, the funding of upper administration, while the students and the staff are drowning.

1201
01:38:14,194 --> 01:38:16,155
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to prioritize the schools themselves.

1202
01:38:17,415 --> 01:38:20,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do the right thing and spend school funds.

1203
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:22,737
[SPEAKER_08]: on what's really important.

1204
01:38:22,837 --> 01:38:25,838
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to fix our buildings and increase substitute pay.

1205
01:38:26,258 --> 01:38:29,619
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more aides, more social workers, more SPED and Yale staff.

1206
01:38:29,659 --> 01:38:33,180
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not need to spend even more money on upper administration.

1207
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:33,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1208
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:42,783
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you Hannah.

1209
01:38:42,803 --> 01:38:49,165
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Anthony Guillaume and between this meeting and the healthcare negotiations tomorrow, I live here today.

1210
01:38:53,174 --> 01:39:07,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I am the president of the Medford Teachers Association, and I appreciate the call for civil conversation, but my member's anger is real, it is palpable, and we're being antagonized into this anger by this proposal.

1211
01:39:09,242 --> 01:39:16,505
[SPEAKER_13]: We're being antagonized because every day we walk into the schools, and we hear that amount of money is available, and we see where it can go.

1212
01:39:17,105 --> 01:39:22,128
[SPEAKER_13]: We see a lack of substitutes, we see a lack of aids, we see a leaking roof,

1213
01:39:23,345 --> 01:39:29,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we hear that the school committee is our bridge, is our connection to the city.

1214
01:39:30,812 --> 01:39:34,535
[SPEAKER_13]: We passed a vote of no confidence not a year ago.

1215
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:39,339
[SPEAKER_13]: 96% of us said we do not have the confidence in the school committee during contract negotiations.

1216
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,581
[SPEAKER_13]: That has never been rescinded.

1217
01:39:42,382 --> 01:39:44,044
[SPEAKER_13]: We never said, oh, okay, it's good now.

1218
01:39:44,784 --> 01:39:46,446
[SPEAKER_13]: And yet we're being told this is all connected.

1219
01:39:46,466 --> 01:39:47,367
[SPEAKER_13]: This isn't a zero sum.

1220
01:39:49,136 --> 01:39:51,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can appreciate the call for civility.

1221
01:39:51,558 --> 01:39:53,400
[SPEAKER_13]: The anger is real and that has to be recognized.

1222
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:58,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to talk about some part-time jobs if we're talking about part-time job pay.

1223
01:39:59,705 --> 01:40:07,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to talk about, first, our football coach, who's been celebrated all this year producing Massachusetts athletes of the week.

1224
01:40:09,213 --> 01:40:15,238
[SPEAKER_13]: That coach has paid $3,000 to $6,000 less than all the surrounding cities, and even that is comparable to Medford.

1225
01:40:16,289 --> 01:40:20,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Our soccer coach, $2,000 to $3,000 less.

1226
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:22,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Our hockey coach, $2,000 to $3,000 less.

1227
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:24,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Our basketball coach, $2,000 to $3,000 less.

1228
01:40:25,412 --> 01:40:27,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Move out of athletics, move into the school.

1229
01:40:28,712 --> 01:40:40,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Our Gay-Straight Alliance advisor, who makes our LGBTQIA plus students not only feel welcome, but celebrated in our schools, gets $600 to put on dances, to organize protests, to speak at rallies.

1230
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:55,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Our senior class advisor, who puts on prom, who does fundraising, who works with the class, gets $1,000 for the year, which is an increase from when they're the freshman class advisor, and they get $600.

1231
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:12,844
[SPEAKER_13]: The advisor to our Black Student Union who puts on our celebrated Haitian, who helps, I should say, the students do most of it, as they have said, but supervises our Haitian Flag Day and our Black History Month assembly, no compensation, does it out of the goodness of his heart.

1232
01:41:15,186 --> 01:41:19,408
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all doing part-time jobs to make it work.

1233
01:41:20,869 --> 01:41:23,651
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of us don't have the option to step away from our part-time jobs.

1234
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:27,774
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a matter of something we'd like to do, it's something we have to do to survive.

1235
01:41:29,929 --> 01:41:37,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So I ask now that this money that is available by whatever means necessary be moved back into the schools.

1236
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:44,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I ask that we enter this new year on a platform of transparency and trust and not of nepotism and top-down priorities.

1237
01:41:45,217 --> 01:41:48,778
[SPEAKER_13]: I ask that we come to work in a city that believes and cares about us.

1238
01:41:49,779 --> 01:41:50,860
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank you all for your time.

1239
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,862
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1240
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,961
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to President Morell, and then back to the podium.

1241
01:42:04,981 --> 01:42:05,521
[SPEAKER_39]: President Morell.

1242
01:42:05,581 --> 01:42:06,841
[SPEAKER_26]: I just have a brief point of information.

1243
01:42:06,861 --> 01:42:10,462
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to note that no money has been moved anywhere just at this point.

1244
01:42:10,502 --> 01:42:11,343
[SPEAKER_26]: No vote has been taken.

1245
01:42:11,363 --> 01:42:15,624
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to make sure that's clear, because I understand the intent of what you said.

1246
01:42:15,664 --> 01:42:18,265
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to make sure that's clear, because that happened.

1247
01:42:18,285 --> 01:42:18,985
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Madam President.

1248
01:42:19,825 --> 01:42:20,966
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please.

1249
01:42:21,286 --> 01:42:22,426
[SPEAKER_11]: My name's, can you hear me?

1250
01:42:22,446 --> 01:42:23,507
[SPEAKER_11]: My name's Joanna McKay.

1251
01:42:24,147 --> 01:42:26,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a teacher at the Roberts Elementary, so I'll give 35 Court Street.

1252
01:42:28,427 --> 01:42:29,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a fourth grade teacher.

1253
01:42:29,607 --> 01:42:32,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a member of the Teachers Association.

1254
01:42:32,608 --> 01:42:34,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on the negotiating team.

1255
01:42:34,589 --> 01:42:37,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So I understand some of what you go to, to an extent.

1256
01:42:37,809 --> 01:42:44,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Like many people tonight, I'm here because the extent of this raise being proposed confuses me.

1257
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:45,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It disheartens me.

1258
01:42:45,872 --> 01:42:47,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite frankly, it disgusts me.

1259
01:42:48,198 --> 01:42:50,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not here to argue whether or not they need a raise.

1260
01:42:50,519 --> 01:42:51,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone should get a raise.

1261
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:52,860
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a whole different point.

1262
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand the level of this raise and the context in which it came about.

1263
01:42:58,062 --> 01:43:03,585
[SPEAKER_11]: From speaking to many people on seeing comments on social media, it's evident that people don't agree with this.

1264
01:43:04,405 --> 01:43:05,506
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too much of a raise.

1265
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:14,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And the idea that it has to do with equity and parity and diversity is ironic to me, as what you heard everyone saying.

1266
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:15,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it.

1267
01:43:17,782 --> 01:43:19,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I reached out to Nicole Morel.

1268
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:21,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked who she spoke to.

1269
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:22,139
[SPEAKER_11]: She spoke to folks.

1270
01:43:23,124 --> 01:43:27,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And she spoke to Paul Rousseau and Jenny Graham to find out about the legalities.

1271
01:43:28,185 --> 01:43:36,167
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I asked you, Zach, who you spoke to, and you spoke to many people, and you spoke to Jenny and to Paul.

1272
01:43:36,307 --> 01:43:37,967
[SPEAKER_37]: I have spoken to many people.

1273
01:43:38,147 --> 01:43:40,648
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine, about the legalities of it.

1274
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:49,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So what confuses me is how do two separate people, committee members, council members, sorry, speak to the exact two

1275
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,992
[SPEAKER_11]: council members and no one else.

1276
01:43:53,212 --> 01:43:55,453
[SPEAKER_11]: There are eight people, six more phone calls.

1277
01:43:56,373 --> 01:43:57,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that difficult?

1278
01:43:57,374 --> 01:44:01,455
[SPEAKER_11]: We have over 450 people and we survey every single one of them.

1279
01:44:01,676 --> 01:44:03,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't assume their needs when we negotiate.

1280
01:44:04,397 --> 01:44:08,459
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a long process before we bring anything to the school committee.

1281
01:44:09,019 --> 01:44:11,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that confuses me, that's disgusting.

1282
01:44:13,846 --> 01:44:23,211
[SPEAKER_11]: You heard from Kathy Kretsch, you heard from Nicole Branley, I heard from them myself, I heard from Mia Mustone, they never heard of this before, they don't understand it.

1283
01:44:24,292 --> 01:44:31,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I also heard that other members felt this way, but I won't quote them because I won't assume since I didn't talk to them, unlike what you did.

1284
01:44:34,136 --> 01:44:43,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I do find it interesting that Paul Rousseau and Jenny Graham, who are often very vocal on social media, radio silence.

1285
01:44:44,547 --> 01:44:46,949
[SPEAKER_11]: So your community feels this is fishy.

1286
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:49,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Your community feels that you're in cahoots.

1287
01:44:50,533 --> 01:44:54,095
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't think that is true, then I don't know.

1288
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:56,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's mind boggling to me.

1289
01:44:56,396 --> 01:44:57,417
[SPEAKER_38]: I said I talked to them.

1290
01:44:58,097 --> 01:44:59,778
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm just saying that's who I talked to.

1291
01:45:00,578 --> 01:45:05,821
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just saying that your community feels that this is a backhand deal that that we're in cahoots.

1292
01:45:05,861 --> 01:45:08,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just telling you what the public meeting.

1293
01:45:08,362 --> 01:45:08,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1294
01:45:08,762 --> 01:45:09,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1295
01:45:09,183 --> 01:45:12,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm just saying speaker to say that this is for

1296
01:45:14,185 --> 01:45:21,008
[SPEAKER_11]: diverse candidates, I find that insulting to every diverse candidate out there that they would only do this job for money.

1297
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you did.

1298
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:28,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I can read you the quote to say that you could do this job if you're financially privileged.

1299
01:45:29,492 --> 01:45:31,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I suppose if you don't, you did say that.

1300
01:45:32,253 --> 01:45:37,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So for people that don't pay mortgages, or have very rich husbands, that's who we're going to attract.

1301
01:45:37,876 --> 01:45:38,236
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1302
01:45:39,352 --> 01:45:39,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Disgusting.

1303
01:45:40,914 --> 01:45:43,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're financially privileged, you can do this job.

1304
01:45:43,716 --> 01:45:46,639
[SPEAKER_11]: So someone that's not financially privileged can't do this job?

1305
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:48,841
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just saying it's less likely, and that's statistically true.

1306
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:49,682
[SPEAKER_11]: It's less likely.

1307
01:45:49,882 --> 01:45:50,663
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to stop now.

1308
01:45:50,783 --> 01:45:51,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Statistically.

1309
01:45:51,624 --> 01:45:52,845
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get first.

1310
01:45:52,865 --> 01:45:53,405
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's OK.

1311
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:57,089
[SPEAKER_11]: The extent of this raise is why people are upset.

1312
01:45:58,456 --> 01:46:07,520
[SPEAKER_11]: the teachers, the aides, the paraprofessionals, to think that a part-time school committee member is gonna make more money than them is outrageous.

1313
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,462
[SPEAKER_11]: These people that get kicked, spit on, yelled at, sworn at.

1314
01:46:12,002 --> 01:46:25,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I really invite people, the community, to come and have you have one session where people kick, bite, spit on you, pee on you, where you have to stop and change a diaper, and see how well you do your job.

1315
01:46:26,269 --> 01:46:28,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Because these people are rock stars.

1316
01:46:35,112 --> 01:46:42,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know if they take this raise or if a raise somewhat substantial like this goes through, how they're going to look their employees in the face.

1317
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,384
[SPEAKER_11]: How are they going, the powers need to negotiate coming up.

1318
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:50,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Take this raise, 140% raise and look them in the face and tell them there's no money.

1319
01:46:51,707 --> 01:47:00,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, tell these custodians, these custodians who have not gotten a raise, these police officers, look them in the face and tell them that that's what you deserve for a raise.

1320
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:07,913
[SPEAKER_11]: These parents that have their children getting rained on and are sucking in mold, look them in the face and tell them there's no money in the budget.

1321
01:47:08,473 --> 01:47:09,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm gonna leave you with two things.

1322
01:47:10,754 --> 01:47:14,295
[SPEAKER_11]: One was the same question about where it's coming from in the budget.

1323
01:47:14,735 --> 01:47:18,817
[SPEAKER_11]: The same budget that we told has no money is bleeding

1324
01:47:19,929 --> 01:47:25,675
[SPEAKER_11]: and that we were in jeopardy of laying off teachers because the ESSA funds are, all right, that's my one question.

1325
01:47:25,755 --> 01:47:27,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is it coming from exactly in the budget?

1326
01:47:28,338 --> 01:47:29,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm gonna leave you with a statement.

1327
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:34,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a very good friend who's finishing his term on Tewksbury School Committee.

1328
01:47:34,505 --> 01:47:36,327
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said to him, how much do you make?

1329
01:47:37,267 --> 01:47:43,649
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said, and I told him what the proposal, he said, and I quote, oh my God, that is crazy.

1330
01:47:43,929 --> 01:47:44,329
[SPEAKER_11]: We make $3,500.

1331
01:47:44,609 --> 01:47:47,710
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a part-time job.

1332
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:50,651
[SPEAKER_11]: For 30,000, I may have to come and make a comeback.

1333
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:51,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha, ha, ha.

1334
01:47:52,112 --> 01:47:57,173
[SPEAKER_11]: This job is a lot of work, but anything over $5,000 and they're stealing.

1335
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:58,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I leave you with that.

1336
01:48:07,091 --> 01:48:07,571
[SPEAKER_38]: That's a cut.

1337
01:48:07,611 --> 01:48:07,951
[SPEAKER_38]: You're good.

1338
01:48:07,991 --> 01:48:08,532
[SPEAKER_38]: You're on.

1339
01:48:08,552 --> 01:48:09,992
[SPEAKER_38]: Give me an address for the record, please.

1340
01:48:10,132 --> 01:48:12,153
[SPEAKER_15]: And just, you know, thank you.

1341
01:48:12,213 --> 01:48:14,454
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll let you know when you have 30 seconds.

1342
01:48:14,874 --> 01:48:15,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1343
01:48:15,934 --> 01:48:30,620
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm also president of the Bedford PAP Professional Behavior Specialists, Kinney-Gotton Kids Corner, Kinney-Gotton Assistants, and anything that has to do with teaching assistants and instructional tools.

1344
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:34,641
[SPEAKER_15]: When I heard about this, I called Rick.

1345
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:35,742
[SPEAKER_15]: I called George.

1346
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:38,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Love calling Adam, gonna miss him.

1347
01:48:39,712 --> 01:48:41,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was hoping that...

1348
01:48:42,403 --> 01:48:44,464
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they all said the same thing.

1349
01:48:45,264 --> 01:48:48,026
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't think that a city council could propose this.

1350
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:55,790
[SPEAKER_15]: But Adam said tonight that there was something in the books that could happen that you guys could give a raise.

1351
01:48:56,450 --> 01:49:00,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here's the real, I'm just gonna give you statistics.

1352
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:03,554
[SPEAKER_15]: A girl was hired yesterday as a kindergarten assistant at $18,868.

1353
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:05,595
[SPEAKER_15]: She's in one of the most high needs classroom.

1354
01:49:12,578 --> 01:49:14,019
[SPEAKER_15]: She is making $18,000.

1355
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:25,167
[SPEAKER_15]: It will take her nine years to make $29,000, what you're proposing for Paul Russo, Jenny Graham, McLaughlin, and everybody else.

1356
01:49:25,907 --> 01:49:36,655
[SPEAKER_15]: So I propose that if they want that raise, they need to come to a MEEP classroom, a kindergarten classroom, and assist the assistant.

1357
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:40,902
[SPEAKER_15]: just to do the same job as the assistant.

1358
01:49:40,962 --> 01:49:55,569
[SPEAKER_15]: When they change diapers, when they chase kids because they're unsafe and they bolt, when they use Google Translate to see if the kid's sick or has to go to the bathroom, then I give you my blessing.

1359
01:49:56,109 --> 01:50:00,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Take the $29,000 as a school committee member.

1360
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:02,913
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm telling you, $29,000 for each of them for 22 meetings,

1361
01:50:06,013 --> 01:50:10,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate to say the word, but it's the S word, okay?

1362
01:50:10,675 --> 01:50:21,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can't say it in public, because I wanna be, my students are watching, but don't worry, they kick us every day, so don't worry about that.

1363
01:50:22,381 --> 01:50:29,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So my point is, I'm going into negotiations with the superintendent.

1364
01:50:30,785 --> 01:50:33,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm taking staff with me, all right?

1365
01:50:34,722 --> 01:50:41,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I say to the super, I want to put it to a vote because it's on the city council, that I want 140%.

1366
01:50:43,449 --> 01:50:48,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Will you support 140% for women who are putting food on the table?

1367
01:50:51,235 --> 01:50:52,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Will you support that?

1368
01:50:53,677 --> 01:50:59,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I will give you my blessing for $29,000 for the school committee.

1369
01:51:00,122 --> 01:51:02,083
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want the school committee to come and do my job.

1370
01:51:03,804 --> 01:51:04,205
[SPEAKER_15]: One day,

1371
01:51:06,274 --> 01:51:07,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have my two minutes of up?

1372
01:51:07,915 --> 01:51:08,795
[SPEAKER_38]: They are Gina, thank you.

1373
01:51:09,075 --> 01:51:10,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, Zach.

1374
01:51:10,675 --> 01:51:13,416
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate you, I appreciate you, I appreciate you, thank you.

1375
01:51:14,097 --> 01:51:14,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1376
01:51:14,637 --> 01:51:15,297
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for your time.

1377
01:51:16,297 --> 01:51:17,238
[SPEAKER_38]: No one on Zoom, we'll go to Ms.

1378
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:17,758
[SPEAKER_38]: Douglas.

1379
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, hello everyone.

1380
01:51:20,019 --> 01:51:20,959
[SPEAKER_29]: Shaolin Douglas.

1381
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:29,155
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a president of the Method Teacher Association, resident 414 High Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1382
01:51:29,756 --> 01:51:37,242
[SPEAKER_29]: To say I am disappointed to be here tonight to discuss a raise is beyond words.

1383
01:51:38,503 --> 01:51:42,166
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't write anything because I'm really disappointed.

1384
01:51:43,227 --> 01:51:45,689
[SPEAKER_29]: Gender equality, sure.

1385
01:51:46,329 --> 01:51:47,571
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm all for gender equality.

1386
01:51:48,777 --> 01:51:50,658
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it should be number one.

1387
01:51:51,579 --> 01:52:06,190
[SPEAKER_29]: Your school committee refused to negotiate FMLA, paid leave for our, maturity paid leave for our female teachers.

1388
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:08,332
[SPEAKER_29]: That's gender equality.

1389
01:52:08,672 --> 01:52:09,953
[SPEAKER_29]: They wouldn't even talk about it.

1390
01:52:10,313 --> 01:52:11,794
[SPEAKER_29]: They held that over our heads.

1391
01:52:12,575 --> 01:52:14,056
[SPEAKER_29]: Refused to talk about it.

1392
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:15,998
[SPEAKER_29]: Gender equality.

1393
01:52:17,014 --> 01:52:32,847
[SPEAKER_29]: Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the mayor and other members to negotiate our health insurance that we have not had a new health plan for over what to a year and a half now, almost two years.

1394
01:52:32,867 --> 01:52:35,509
[SPEAKER_29]: And I've talked about that $25 million in free cash.

1395
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:38,280
[SPEAKER_29]: Ms.

1396
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:42,085
[SPEAKER_29]: Collins, with all due respect, you said we found that money tonight.

1397
01:52:42,806 --> 01:52:44,167
[SPEAKER_29]: But maybe I misunderstood you.

1398
01:52:44,788 --> 01:52:46,590
[SPEAKER_29]: That money's been there for a while.

1399
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:50,174
[SPEAKER_29]: And when we've asked about it, we've been told we can't touch it.

1400
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:51,316
[SPEAKER_29]: We can't use it.

1401
01:52:51,356 --> 01:52:52,897
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think you've made that clear.

1402
01:52:53,178 --> 01:52:54,439
[SPEAKER_29]: You can't use that tonight.

1403
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,240
[SPEAKER_29]: Am I correct?

1404
01:52:56,206 --> 01:52:56,506
[SPEAKER_36]: Correct?

1405
01:52:56,726 --> 01:52:58,588
[SPEAKER_36]: There's no, Mr. Lewis, there's no money.

1406
01:52:59,129 --> 01:52:59,329
[SPEAKER_36]: Right.

1407
01:52:59,429 --> 01:53:00,610
[SPEAKER_36]: This is not a money proposal though.

1408
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:01,531
[SPEAKER_29]: Right, I understand that.

1409
01:53:01,751 --> 01:53:07,556
[SPEAKER_29]: But even if we were to come and say that's where that money's coming from, we have been told that money is not available.

1410
01:53:07,896 --> 01:53:11,159
[SPEAKER_29]: We have been told there is no money for FMLA.

1411
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,001
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no money for opt-out.

1412
01:53:13,221 --> 01:53:16,164
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no money for better insurance for our employees.

1413
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:18,406
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no money for our custodians.

1414
01:53:18,606 --> 01:53:20,187
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no money for our,

1415
01:53:21,228 --> 01:53:21,628
[SPEAKER_29]: police.

1416
01:53:21,828 --> 01:53:28,392
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no money for our cafeteria workers who came in during COVID and never missed a day.

1417
01:53:28,692 --> 01:53:32,454
[SPEAKER_29]: My sister being one of them who got COVID three times.

1418
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:34,651
[SPEAKER_29]: And you know what she's gotten?

1419
01:53:35,051 --> 01:53:35,471
[SPEAKER_29]: Nothing.

1420
01:53:35,852 --> 01:53:36,832
[SPEAKER_29]: A goose egg.

1421
01:53:37,112 --> 01:53:38,033
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what she's gotten.

1422
01:53:38,413 --> 01:53:39,514
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a disgrace.

1423
01:53:39,694 --> 01:53:46,158
[SPEAKER_29]: And all of you should be ashamed of yourselves for putting this forward and not thinking of the little people out there.

1424
01:53:46,438 --> 01:53:46,879
[SPEAKER_29]: You're right.

1425
01:53:47,239 --> 01:53:49,360
[SPEAKER_29]: My sister can't run for school committee.

1426
01:53:50,041 --> 01:53:52,082
[SPEAKER_29]: And nor could I. But I will.

1427
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:54,284
[SPEAKER_29]: I will run for school committee.

1428
01:53:58,882 --> 01:54:00,764
[SPEAKER_43]: Because I don't really care.

1429
01:54:00,784 --> 01:54:01,025
[SPEAKER_43]: 30 seconds.

1430
01:54:01,045 --> 01:54:02,766
[SPEAKER_29]: Seconds, I understand that.

1431
01:54:03,567 --> 01:54:12,015
[SPEAKER_29]: And as president of the Method Teachers Association, where I worked many nights till three, four in the morning.

1432
01:54:12,035 --> 01:54:16,820
[SPEAKER_29]: You wanna know what my stipend was?

1433
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:17,841
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you ready?

1434
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:17,841
$8,000.

1435
01:54:17,921 --> 01:54:19,583
[SPEAKER_29]: And that was my last year.

1436
01:54:21,345 --> 01:54:23,367
[SPEAKER_29]: So don't tell me about gender equality.

1437
01:54:23,647 --> 01:54:30,253
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't tell me about equal pay until you give it to every single person who works in this city.

1438
01:54:30,693 --> 01:54:31,133
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm done.

1439
01:54:31,574 --> 01:54:31,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1440
01:54:41,633 --> 01:54:42,894
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1441
01:54:42,954 --> 01:54:43,434
[SPEAKER_39]: Two minutes.

1442
01:54:43,815 --> 01:54:48,438
[SPEAKER_49]: James Chip O'Leary, 30 Norwich Circle, lifelong resident of Medford and taxpayer.

1443
01:54:49,158 --> 01:54:50,299
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm also a custodian.

1444
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:51,420
[SPEAKER_38]: Sorry, go.

1445
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,661
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm also a custodian in the school system.

1446
01:54:54,302 --> 01:54:56,944
[SPEAKER_49]: And we have not had a contract in two and a half years.

1447
01:54:58,245 --> 01:55:00,066
[SPEAKER_49]: And from what I'm hearing, it could be longer.

1448
01:55:01,207 --> 01:55:02,207
[SPEAKER_49]: I have a couple of questions.

1449
01:55:02,548 --> 01:55:04,549
[SPEAKER_49]: And first, Mr. Scarpelli, maybe you can answer this.

1450
01:55:05,009 --> 01:55:08,852
[SPEAKER_49]: When you were on the school committee, did it ever come before you about putting a raisin?

1451
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:10,033
[SPEAKER_49]: Never.

1452
01:55:11,590 --> 01:55:14,213
[SPEAKER_49]: So why all of a sudden now is this coming out?

1453
01:55:16,335 --> 01:55:20,739
[SPEAKER_49]: This is the problem right now in Medford, two divided houses.

1454
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,902
[SPEAKER_49]: Medford's suffering big time.

1455
01:55:23,582 --> 01:55:24,964
[SPEAKER_49]: People don't want to come to Medford.

1456
01:55:25,544 --> 01:55:28,668
[SPEAKER_49]: People are taking their kids, sending them to other schools, so forth.

1457
01:55:29,188 --> 01:55:29,468
[SPEAKER_49]: Why?

1458
01:55:29,588 --> 01:55:30,489
[SPEAKER_49]: Because we're divided.

1459
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:34,253
[SPEAKER_49]: We have storefronts that are empty, but worried about giving raises.

1460
01:55:35,134 --> 01:55:39,637
[SPEAKER_49]: Let's get our act together, make Medford better, and put the right foot forward.

1461
01:55:40,157 --> 01:55:46,021
[SPEAKER_49]: Next year, two new councils, a new council, a new school committee have to work together.

1462
01:55:46,282 --> 01:55:46,662
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

1463
01:55:47,182 --> 01:55:55,888
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for your time.

1464
01:55:55,948 --> 01:55:56,729
[SPEAKER_26]: I do just want to thank Ms.

1465
01:55:56,749 --> 01:55:58,790
[SPEAKER_26]: Douglas for bringing that forward about the PFMLA.

1466
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:00,211
[SPEAKER_26]: I wasn't aware of that fact.

1467
01:56:00,611 --> 01:56:02,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Bears and I actually introduced a resolution

1468
01:56:03,823 --> 01:56:07,886
[SPEAKER_26]: two years ago about extending PFMLA to the entire city.

1469
01:56:08,327 --> 01:56:12,470
[SPEAKER_26]: And we were essentially rebuffed by the administration about it being a possibility.

1470
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:16,353
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's really helpful for me to know that that is continuing on.

1471
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:18,295
[SPEAKER_26]: It's something that still is on our books.

1472
01:56:18,375 --> 01:56:19,636
[SPEAKER_26]: It's nothing that's been disposed of.

1473
01:56:19,716 --> 01:56:23,079
[SPEAKER_26]: So I hope that the next council will continue the conversation around it.

1474
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:25,480
[SPEAKER_38]: Ms.

1475
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:25,741
[SPEAKER_38]: Douglas.

1476
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:28,226
[SPEAKER_38]: I just asked.

1477
01:56:28,306 --> 01:56:28,627
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1478
01:56:28,647 --> 01:56:29,447
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1479
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:34,889
[SPEAKER_38]: And I just want to clarify, we wanted, we proposed that we'd be the first in the state to take it on.

1480
01:56:35,249 --> 01:56:38,030
[SPEAKER_38]: We were told the same thing that everyone else here has been told.

1481
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:45,232
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think we all would like to see the city spending more of its reserves on the priorities that we all share.

1482
01:56:45,392 --> 01:56:45,732
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1483
01:56:46,153 --> 01:56:46,913
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll go to the podium.

1484
01:56:47,769 --> 01:56:49,351
[SPEAKER_50]: Jamie Thompson, 86 Lawrence Road.

1485
01:56:49,812 --> 01:56:53,876
[SPEAKER_50]: There's been many more intelligent, better spoken people that have already covered most of my points.

1486
01:56:54,537 --> 01:56:59,082
[SPEAKER_50]: I just want to, you know, I understand the spirit that this was put forward with.

1487
01:56:59,602 --> 01:57:02,425
[SPEAKER_50]: I appreciate the amendments to it because that's been challenged.

1488
01:57:03,506 --> 01:57:08,111
[SPEAKER_50]: Councilor Scarpelli, Caraviello and Councilor Knight, your comments about

1489
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:12,857
[SPEAKER_50]: pay equity by offering your salaries to compensate that.

1490
01:57:12,877 --> 01:57:14,138
[SPEAKER_50]: I appreciate those.

1491
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:16,520
[SPEAKER_50]: These are service positions.

1492
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:19,984
[SPEAKER_50]: People run knowing what they're going to be earning in these roles.

1493
01:57:25,342 --> 01:57:29,784
[SPEAKER_50]: I hope that the city council that's coming, the school committee that's coming, and the mayor's office can work together.

1494
01:57:30,124 --> 01:57:31,444
[SPEAKER_50]: We need to get the city solicitor.

1495
01:57:31,744 --> 01:57:33,745
[SPEAKER_50]: We need to get the community development director.

1496
01:57:34,145 --> 01:57:36,746
[SPEAKER_50]: We need a building commissioner.

1497
01:57:37,606 --> 01:57:47,490
[SPEAKER_50]: And we need to get a tax base in here that can support so that we can fund the schools and the employees for what they need so that they can make our schools better.

1498
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:49,411
Thank you.

1499
01:57:49,571 --> 01:57:50,351
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for your time.

1500
01:57:56,092 --> 01:57:57,433
[SPEAKER_39]: If you name an address for the record, please.

1501
01:57:57,614 --> 01:58:01,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Maria Geneska Micheli, I live at the Brooks School.

1502
01:58:01,097 --> 01:58:07,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been an educator in the city for 30 years, born and raised.

1503
01:58:08,244 --> 01:58:13,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not talking tonight, but I've compelled.

1504
01:58:16,161 --> 01:58:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go on and on, but I'm just going to piggyback on Gina that spoke a couple of minutes ago.

1505
01:58:23,546 --> 01:58:31,932
[SPEAKER_09]: She put out there that the school committee should come out and do their jobs, to do the jobs of the paras and the kindergarten aides.

1506
01:58:32,673 --> 01:58:34,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like them to just come to the schools.

1507
01:58:35,595 --> 01:58:37,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like them to just come.

1508
01:58:40,273 --> 01:58:44,158
[SPEAKER_09]: to visit the schools, to come read to the classrooms.

1509
01:58:44,558 --> 01:58:47,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to come only when it's an election year.

1510
01:58:48,102 --> 01:58:48,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Pass out the appellate.

1511
01:58:48,983 --> 01:58:49,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe they can't.

1512
01:58:49,784 --> 01:58:51,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they can pass them out or whatever.

1513
01:58:51,846 --> 01:58:52,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the laws.

1514
01:58:53,228 --> 01:58:55,090
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm only a kindergarten teacher.

1515
01:58:55,611 --> 01:58:57,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't come only.

1516
01:58:57,092 --> 01:58:57,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1517
01:58:58,334 --> 01:58:58,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1518
01:58:58,774 --> 01:58:59,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't come.

1519
01:59:01,772 --> 01:59:05,735
[SPEAKER_09]: for the photo ops, come visit us in the classroom.

1520
01:59:06,236 --> 01:59:11,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Come see what we're doing every day, all day, all the staffs.

1521
01:59:14,082 --> 01:59:21,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not seen a school committee member, might be the last one was George Scarpelli, when he came to read, how many years ago?

1522
01:59:22,893 --> 01:59:24,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I can invite them to come.

1523
01:59:24,694 --> 01:59:27,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no time to invite them to come.

1524
01:59:28,397 --> 01:59:29,777
[SPEAKER_09]: They know the addresses.

1525
01:59:30,438 --> 01:59:31,598
[SPEAKER_09]: They know the schools.

1526
01:59:32,139 --> 01:59:33,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Come to the schools.

1527
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,401
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I know.

1528
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I could ask for a lot more.

1529
01:59:37,342 --> 01:59:39,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can go on and on and on.

1530
01:59:39,603 --> 01:59:42,024
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is my two cents.

1531
01:59:42,344 --> 01:59:42,965
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for your time.

1532
01:59:47,085 --> 02:00:05,253
[SPEAKER_38]: I do want to add, and I don't know if this law has changed since Councilor Scarapelli was on the school committee, state law asks and requires that school committee members be invited because they don't want school committee members walking into the schools unannounced, uninvited, to pass out pamphlets per se.

1533
02:00:05,313 --> 02:00:07,274
[SPEAKER_38]: So that formal thing is a requirement.

1534
02:00:07,314 --> 02:00:07,854
[SPEAKER_47]: Are they invited?

1535
02:00:08,454 --> 02:00:09,395
[SPEAKER_47]: We're invited.

1536
02:00:09,455 --> 02:00:11,016
[SPEAKER_47]: We're officially inviting them.

1537
02:00:11,976 --> 02:00:14,358
[SPEAKER_38]: I hear you and I think a lot of people would like to come.

1538
02:00:14,418 --> 02:00:19,161
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if it satisfies the legal requirements, but thank you.

1539
02:00:19,261 --> 02:00:20,362
[SPEAKER_38]: I just wanted to put that out there.

1540
02:00:20,942 --> 02:00:21,823
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record.

1541
02:00:22,023 --> 02:00:24,945
[SPEAKER_47]: Sarah Sossfield, 141 Street, Medford.

1542
02:00:25,285 --> 02:00:31,048
[SPEAKER_47]: I was also not going to speak and felt compelled and started writing notes while people were speaking.

1543
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,771
[SPEAKER_47]: I love that the committee feels that

1544
02:00:35,509 --> 02:00:39,872
[SPEAKER_47]: you know, you could take a recess because people aren't showing expected behavior.

1545
02:00:40,332 --> 02:00:42,314
[SPEAKER_47]: We don't have that opportunity in the classroom.

1546
02:00:42,674 --> 02:00:48,137
[SPEAKER_47]: If people aren't showing expected behavior, we need to continue on with business as usual.

1547
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:53,741
[SPEAKER_47]: And while you're actually speaking, I want to be able to throw things at you.

1548
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:56,643
[SPEAKER_47]: I want to be able to scream in your face.

1549
02:00:56,783 --> 02:01:05,309
[SPEAKER_47]: I want to be able to maybe bite you here and there, but you also still need to carry on and hope that everyone else here is retaining the information that you're putting out.

1550
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:08,950
[SPEAKER_38]: There was a recent court case, you may be well able to do most of that.

1551
02:01:09,290 --> 02:01:10,730
[SPEAKER_38]: We just ask that everyone do it one at a time.

1552
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:11,451
[SPEAKER_47]: And that's fine.

1553
02:01:11,511 --> 02:01:11,831
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

1554
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:19,833
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, we don't still have that opportunity to have them to tell a child, sorry, you need to wait your chance to do your unexpected behavior.

1555
02:01:19,973 --> 02:01:20,633
[SPEAKER_47]: I hear you.

1556
02:01:21,573 --> 02:01:21,893
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

1557
02:01:22,093 --> 02:01:23,934
[SPEAKER_47]: So also with that being said,

1558
02:01:25,865 --> 02:01:28,586
[SPEAKER_47]: Let me say, let me go down a little bit.

1559
02:01:28,746 --> 02:01:34,449
[SPEAKER_47]: Any parents that have had me as their parent in the classroom know that my little nuggies come first in my life.

1560
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:35,950
[SPEAKER_47]: They are always first.

1561
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:40,933
[SPEAKER_47]: And we also know that kindergarten isn't considered mandatory in the state of Massachusetts.

1562
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:45,771
[SPEAKER_47]: But we are always being given extra ELA time.

1563
02:01:45,811 --> 02:01:47,693
[SPEAKER_47]: We need to give extra science time.

1564
02:01:47,753 --> 02:01:50,035
[SPEAKER_47]: We have extra all of these things that are mandated.

1565
02:01:50,415 --> 02:01:51,916
[SPEAKER_47]: We are losing out on playtime.

1566
02:01:51,956 --> 02:01:54,118
[SPEAKER_47]: We are losing out on social and emotional support.

1567
02:01:54,499 --> 02:01:56,921
[SPEAKER_47]: We are losing out on all of those things.

1568
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:58,522
[SPEAKER_47]: Who has to offer that support?

1569
02:01:59,303 --> 02:02:00,604
[SPEAKER_47]: Me as a kindergarten aid.

1570
02:02:00,784 --> 02:02:01,945
[SPEAKER_47]: I have to give these kids

1571
02:02:02,486 --> 02:02:04,548
[SPEAKER_47]: teach them how to deal with their peer support.

1572
02:02:04,649 --> 02:02:10,837
[SPEAKER_47]: I have to show them what it means to play in the playground and if someone pushes them, what needs to happen.

1573
02:02:11,538 --> 02:02:17,206
[SPEAKER_47]: That doesn't happen anymore because we don't have playtime or kids to be able to have that one-on-one time in the classroom anymore.

1574
02:02:17,927 --> 02:02:33,211
[SPEAKER_47]: So to tell me that school committee now is going to get more money than I am in the classroom, who works hard every day, that they now work harder than I do in the classroom, is very disappointing and it's very frustrating.

1575
02:02:33,271 --> 02:02:37,873
[SPEAKER_47]: And I have to say, if it goes through, you will see my resignation.

1576
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:41,034
[SPEAKER_47]: Because I can't live on my 17 to $20,000 a year.

1577
02:02:41,074 --> 02:02:42,134
[SPEAKER_47]: It is absolutely not possible.

1578
02:02:45,695 --> 02:02:47,316
[SPEAKER_47]: It is absolutely not possible.

1579
02:02:47,797 --> 02:02:49,678
[SPEAKER_47]: So you need to have additional support.

1580
02:02:50,019 --> 02:02:52,400
[SPEAKER_47]: So to say that, well, this is my extra job.

1581
02:02:52,961 --> 02:02:58,505
[SPEAKER_47]: I have three extra jobs to have to maintain what I do in the school system.

1582
02:02:59,186 --> 02:03:01,928
[SPEAKER_47]: I have a college degree, speech and hearing science.

1583
02:03:02,068 --> 02:03:07,633
[SPEAKER_47]: I could be working, making way more money doing than what I do as a paraprofessional in the kindergarten classroom.

1584
02:03:07,953 --> 02:03:09,955
[SPEAKER_47]: But I love my kids.

1585
02:03:10,475 --> 02:03:11,816
[SPEAKER_47]: I love my parents.

1586
02:03:11,976 --> 02:03:14,038
[SPEAKER_47]: I love my community at the McGlynn.

1587
02:03:15,546 --> 02:03:23,008
[SPEAKER_47]: I wouldn't give it up, but it's now getting to the point where I need to choose between my school family or my home family.

1588
02:03:23,508 --> 02:03:31,370
[SPEAKER_47]: And my home family is suffering because I'm not receiving the pay that I frankly deserve and work for every day.

1589
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,090
[SPEAKER_47]: I am a female.

1590
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:34,771
[SPEAKER_47]: I choose Medford.

1591
02:03:35,131 --> 02:03:39,652
[SPEAKER_47]: I just want to feel like Medford chooses me for once in a while.

1592
02:03:39,672 --> 02:03:43,193
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Sarah.

1593
02:03:51,431 --> 02:03:51,671
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1594
02:03:51,691 --> 02:03:53,793
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please, and I'll let you know when I have 30 seconds.

1595
02:03:54,854 --> 02:03:57,896
[SPEAKER_34]: Jimmy Giddings, and I live at 25 Vernon Street in Melrose.

1596
02:03:58,076 --> 02:03:59,758
[SPEAKER_34]: I teach at Roberts Elementary School.

1597
02:04:00,518 --> 02:04:02,120
[SPEAKER_34]: This is my third year teaching kindergarten.

1598
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,822
[SPEAKER_34]: I have a para in my classroom.

1599
02:04:05,162 --> 02:04:08,425
[SPEAKER_34]: For the first six months, when I first came to Medford, I did not.

1600
02:04:09,185 --> 02:04:12,808
[SPEAKER_34]: And I can tell you the big differences as soon as one came.

1601
02:04:13,889 --> 02:04:20,172
[SPEAKER_34]: And I've been with my same power for three years, and I don't think that's like that in a lot of instances.

1602
02:04:20,192 --> 02:04:24,314
[SPEAKER_34]: I think powers turn over quite quickly in a lot of places because of the low pay.

1603
02:04:25,134 --> 02:04:28,696
[SPEAKER_34]: And we couldn't do what we do without them.

1604
02:04:29,856 --> 02:04:35,359
[SPEAKER_34]: I see this proposal on the table, and I think how I can look at my power in the face,

1605
02:04:37,731 --> 02:04:39,953
[SPEAKER_34]: And it's not fair because I can't fix it.

1606
02:04:40,474 --> 02:04:42,616
[SPEAKER_34]: The people that can fix it are before me.

1607
02:04:43,377 --> 02:04:46,680
[SPEAKER_34]: All of you are charged with this duty to help them.

1608
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:52,666
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm asking you, all of these people are asking you and the people on Zoom to help them.

1609
02:04:53,787 --> 02:04:57,270
[SPEAKER_34]: We want them to feel like they deserve to be here.

1610
02:04:57,731 --> 02:05:00,513
[SPEAKER_34]: And the only way we can do that is by increasing their pay.

1611
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:06,888
[SPEAKER_34]: If we take money away from the school, it's going to take money away from potentially going to them.

1612
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:10,893
[SPEAKER_34]: And the only way to fix that is to make this change.

1613
02:05:11,994 --> 02:05:15,679
[SPEAKER_34]: I understand why that you brought this to the table.

1614
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:18,262
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think that is a good thing to discuss.

1615
02:05:20,046 --> 02:05:30,473
[SPEAKER_34]: But unlike city council, it takes directly from the schools, and that's where the big difference is there, because the money that's going to the schools isn't going to go to the para first, and it should.

1616
02:05:31,393 --> 02:05:35,716
[SPEAKER_34]: I can't tell you how often I entrust my para with responsibilities.

1617
02:05:36,376 --> 02:05:44,221
[SPEAKER_34]: She runs tables in my centers, and I trust her to almost run the classroom as I'm in my small groups, and she can do that.

1618
02:05:44,622 --> 02:05:45,902
[SPEAKER_34]: So many of the other paras do too.

1619
02:05:47,063 --> 02:05:51,456
[SPEAKER_34]: And they can do so much better if we show them their trust by giving them what they deserve.

1620
02:05:52,138 --> 02:05:52,459
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1621
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:53,462
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you for your time.

1622
02:06:00,604 --> 02:06:03,167
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want the clapping so we can hear you.

1623
02:06:03,187 --> 02:06:03,987
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record.

1624
02:06:04,107 --> 02:06:05,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Mary Jo Petroni.

1625
02:06:05,509 --> 02:06:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at 12 Greenhalgh Street.

1626
02:06:07,751 --> 02:06:09,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Just laying pinto 108 Woodruff Avenue.

1627
02:06:10,594 --> 02:06:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Michelle left me.

1628
02:06:12,075 --> 02:06:18,821
[SPEAKER_02]: My third person, I want, we are three of the secretary's administrative assistants that work for the school.

1629
02:06:18,841 --> 02:06:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to tell you, we are the heart and soul of the buildings.

1630
02:06:22,785 --> 02:06:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have the distinct opportunity to work with the custodians who have not had their contract and who do work very hard because we're short staffed.

1631
02:06:31,615 --> 02:06:34,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am the one that I'm calling them all the time to clean up their mess.

1632
02:06:35,499 --> 02:06:40,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is disrespectful to everyone that works for the school department.

1633
02:06:41,445 --> 02:06:49,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially for those people who are putting in their time and effort, we get no extra money for all the extra things that we do.

1634
02:06:49,592 --> 02:06:57,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Michelle works at a school where, I don't know how many parents, we filled in just Lane and I occasionally at outside schools.

1635
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine what their life is like.

1636
02:07:00,882 --> 02:07:07,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you, Mr. Scarpelli, Mr. Knight, Mr. Caraviello, because I know you guys and what you've done.

1637
02:07:07,749 --> 02:07:13,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to think back to Mrs. Van der Kloot, Mrs. DiGentimasso, Mr. Brady, Mr. Pompeo.

1638
02:07:14,216 --> 02:07:18,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the people that served for 25 or more years on the school committee.

1639
02:07:19,321 --> 02:07:21,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other names that I can't even think of.

1640
02:07:21,543 --> 02:07:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the people that came with the actual attitude.

1641
02:07:25,146 --> 02:07:27,167
[SPEAKER_02]: You are here to serve us.

1642
02:07:27,708 --> 02:07:32,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a job that you expect to earn money for.

1643
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:36,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Singh, I appreciate that you need to earn more funds on Mr. Beers.

1644
02:07:37,176 --> 02:07:38,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I have worked for two jobs.

1645
02:07:38,978 --> 02:07:40,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I have raised my family.

1646
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:48,789
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids have got work, two jobs, because that is the life that we have, unfortunately, in order to survive in this state.

1647
02:07:48,929 --> 02:07:49,590
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that.

1648
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:57,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that you're trying to take money away from the schools for the kids, for the grandchildren that I have attending these programs.

1649
02:07:57,819 --> 02:07:59,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely disgusting.

1650
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:07,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only are these people correct in that we are underpaid, we choose to do this because we love Medford and we love the students.

1651
02:08:08,227 --> 02:08:15,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, every one of us could make double, and I'm not kidding because I worked in the real world, double what we're earning right now.

1652
02:08:16,534 --> 02:08:18,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Lane speaks multiple languages.

1653
02:08:18,636 --> 02:08:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we didn't have her half the time, we wouldn't have people be able to register in our programs.

1654
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:32,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to tell you that the reason why you ran for an office is because you want to serve your community, not make a living.

1655
02:08:32,669 --> 02:08:34,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you.

1656
02:08:36,112 --> 02:08:37,513
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for your time.

1657
02:08:38,033 --> 02:08:40,815
[SPEAKER_38]: I do want to note, I believe Ms.

1658
02:08:40,855 --> 02:08:44,517
[SPEAKER_38]: Vanden Heuvel, Mr. Giacomasso, Mr. Brady, and Mr. Pompeo were all on the school committee in 2000.

1659
02:08:45,037 --> 02:08:50,561
[SPEAKER_38]: And that budget that passed that year had a similar increase from $5,000 to $12,000 for the school committee.

1660
02:08:51,121 --> 02:08:53,062
[SPEAKER_38]: So just want to put that out there as a fact.

1661
02:08:54,303 --> 02:08:55,364
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, that's just a fact.

1662
02:08:55,624 --> 02:08:56,745
[SPEAKER_38]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

1663
02:09:00,407 --> 02:09:01,507
[SPEAKER_38]: We have one person on Zoom.

1664
02:09:01,848 --> 02:09:02,488
[SPEAKER_38]: And I will go to them.

1665
02:09:02,528 --> 02:09:03,809
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please.

1666
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:09,320
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, this is Kim Willard.

1667
02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:13,123
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm a resident of Medford at 10 Florence Street.

1668
02:09:13,283 --> 02:09:19,867
[SPEAKER_46]: I am also a special education teacher at the Curtis Tufts High School.

1669
02:09:19,887 --> 02:09:25,210
[SPEAKER_46]: I would just repeat all of the points that my colleagues have said about

1670
02:09:26,331 --> 02:09:43,579
[SPEAKER_46]: the budgetary issues that we've been going through for the past decade, and would like to formally invite any school committee members or any city councilors to the Curtis Tufts High School to see the kinds of understaffing that we're going through.

1671
02:09:43,659 --> 02:09:47,221
[SPEAKER_46]: We currently do not have a science teacher.

1672
02:09:48,221 --> 02:09:48,561
[SPEAKER_46]: What?

1673
02:09:49,802 --> 02:09:50,922
[SPEAKER_38]: Sorry, just we have some noise there.

1674
02:09:50,962 --> 02:09:52,123
[SPEAKER_38]: I want to make sure everyone can hear you, Kate.

1675
02:09:52,592 --> 02:09:53,072
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, sorry.

1676
02:09:54,173 --> 02:09:58,877
[SPEAKER_46]: We have not had a science teacher at the Curtis Sucks for the past two years.

1677
02:09:59,877 --> 02:10:12,626
[SPEAKER_46]: Currently, the director of our high school is teaching three science classes without additional pay because she was told past practice principals don't get paid to cover classes.

1678
02:10:13,804 --> 02:10:20,067
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, because that's not a thing that happens anywhere else Um, we don't have a secretary.

1679
02:10:20,207 --> 02:10:22,248
[SPEAKER_46]: So the nurse answers our phones.

1680
02:10:22,628 --> 02:10:34,314
[SPEAKER_46]: We haven't had a nurse in the past week because there's staff out at audi's outing Um throughout the district in the past couple weeks um, so

1681
02:10:35,498 --> 02:10:47,761
[SPEAKER_46]: Again, just inviting any city council members, and I know a few, George Scarpelli and Rick Caraviello already have a connection to the Curtis Tufts, so you're familiar with our program.

1682
02:10:48,702 --> 02:10:58,524
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not sure about anyone else, but anyone who would like to see what's actually going on in the schools, I can invite you to mine.

1683
02:10:58,904 --> 02:10:59,264
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1684
02:11:00,685 --> 02:11:01,325
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Kate.

1685
02:11:05,487 --> 02:11:06,448
[SPEAKER_39]: And the rest of you, please.

1686
02:11:07,668 --> 02:11:11,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Walter Buckley, President of Local 1032-340 Salish Street.

1687
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:18,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just like to know, with this money, you have to pay more taxes in order to fund these positions and pay these raises.

1688
02:11:19,274 --> 02:11:23,135
[SPEAKER_06]: How many board members, how many council members own a house in Method?

1689
02:11:23,155 --> 02:11:25,476
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't think we're gonna ask personal questions.

1690
02:11:25,897 --> 02:11:26,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1691
02:11:26,797 --> 02:11:28,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we were debating, but I was wrong.

1692
02:11:28,978 --> 02:11:30,119
[SPEAKER_36]: We're not actually.

1693
02:11:30,159 --> 02:11:32,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Fact, fact, here's a fact for you, not many.

1694
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:36,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's getting passed on to the homeowners, that's a fact.

1695
02:11:37,732 --> 02:11:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Second fact is, the teachers negotiated out of the contract for two years, the fire department for almost three years, the police are out of the contract.

1696
02:11:46,317 --> 02:11:53,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It would take us over 40 years to get the raise percentage that you are proposing here, over 140% raise.

1697
02:11:53,821 --> 02:11:56,062
[SPEAKER_06]: That would take us 40 years to get that pay raise.

1698
02:11:59,924 --> 02:12:05,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we talk about equity, we have a secretary who makes $60,000 a year for the fire department.

1699
02:12:05,927 --> 02:12:09,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So a person that goes to a meeting twice a month is going to make $30,000.

1700
02:12:09,509 --> 02:12:11,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that equitable?

1701
02:12:11,671 --> 02:12:12,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that equity?

1702
02:12:12,851 --> 02:12:14,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what we count as equity?

1703
02:12:14,933 --> 02:12:15,493
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it isn't.

1704
02:12:16,133 --> 02:12:16,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.

1705
02:12:17,394 --> 02:12:26,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that we have to go out of contract and the mayor stated at the debate that she can't negotiate with unions because they're asking for 9%.

1706
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: but she's gonna get 140% raise, where are they?

1707
02:12:29,912 --> 02:12:34,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are the people on the school committee that are for this?

1708
02:12:34,777 --> 02:12:35,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are they?

1709
02:12:36,919 --> 02:12:37,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find them.

1710
02:12:39,462 --> 02:12:41,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all I have to say.

1711
02:12:41,464 --> 02:12:45,788
[SPEAKER_06]: The people on the school committee that are for this should be there talking about it.

1712
02:12:46,209 --> 02:12:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fair to these people at all.

1713
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:55,881
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. Pencil.

1714
02:12:56,461 --> 02:12:58,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question, Robert Pencil, Zero Summit Road.

1715
02:12:59,242 --> 02:13:08,006
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite obvious from the comments that have been made here today, whether you're a paraprofessional or you're a full-time employee, you just haven't been treated the correct way.

1716
02:13:08,026 --> 02:13:21,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's incumbent, I believe it's incumbent upon one city councilor who will have the guts and take this resolution and say, receive it and place it on file and kill the issue now.

1717
02:13:28,803 --> 02:13:29,323
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1718
02:13:29,484 --> 02:13:31,405
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there any further comment from members of the public?

1719
02:13:33,927 --> 02:13:40,052
[SPEAKER_38]: Seeing none in the room, and seeing none on Zoom, there's a motion on the floor that has been, oh, Councilor Knight.

1720
02:13:40,452 --> 02:13:42,034
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, sorry, Councilor Morell, then Councilor Knight.

1721
02:13:42,114 --> 02:13:42,794
[SPEAKER_38]: Sorry, my apologies.

1722
02:13:42,854 --> 02:13:43,855
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll let you know how to remember.

1723
02:13:43,875 --> 02:13:44,756
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll teach you.

1724
02:13:44,816 --> 02:13:45,997
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it's not an easy job.

1725
02:13:46,897 --> 02:13:49,940
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to thank everyone for coming out and taking the time to speak.

1726
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:56,265
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously, my intention was never to submit this, and to be inflammatory, my intention was to start a conversation.

1727
02:13:56,926 --> 02:14:03,669
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think what's come out of this conversation is so much that we don't get to hear on city council.

1728
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,531
[SPEAKER_26]: We get the school budget delivered to us as such.

1729
02:14:06,571 --> 02:14:08,812
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not at the bargaining table because we can't be.

1730
02:14:08,872 --> 02:14:17,576
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think this really illuminates a lot of issues that they either come to us when the budget is already set in stone, or we simply just never hear about them.

1731
02:14:17,676 --> 02:14:20,298
[SPEAKER_26]: So I really, really appreciate the time.

1732
02:14:20,498 --> 02:14:23,980
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry I won't be there to continue the conversations, at least in this role.

1733
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:26,401
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think a lot of important things

1734
02:14:27,108 --> 02:14:43,176
[SPEAKER_26]: were shared tonight and I do just want to make it explicit that I never introduced this as in insult or to say that the jobs are equal to paraprofessional and the school committee.

1735
02:14:44,216 --> 02:14:53,941
[SPEAKER_26]: I noted before my mom taught in a poor school district for 35 years special education and I know how essential

1736
02:14:55,132 --> 02:14:57,594
[SPEAKER_26]: her powers were to the success of her classrooms.

1737
02:14:58,055 --> 02:15:12,310
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just know how much she had to fight and how much she had to put up with and how much I think she's thankful that she retired in 2011 because your jobs are so incredibly difficult and more multifaceted and challenging than they ever have been before.

1738
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:12,391
[SPEAKER_26]: And

1739
02:15:14,139 --> 02:15:17,802
[SPEAKER_26]: believe me or not, but I am so, so appreciative of the work you do.

1740
02:15:17,962 --> 02:15:23,527
[SPEAKER_26]: And I thank you for taking the time to come out tonight, knowing you already put in a full day that is exhausting.

1741
02:15:23,587 --> 02:15:26,510
[SPEAKER_26]: I watched my mother come home after work and just kind of pass it on the bed.

1742
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:27,691
[SPEAKER_26]: I know how hard your day was.

1743
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:31,955
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just want to make that clear again, believe me or not, but I just want to state that.

1744
02:15:32,015 --> 02:15:32,515
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you.

1745
02:15:33,516 --> 02:15:34,497
[SPEAKER_38]: Can we, okay.

1746
02:15:34,737 --> 02:15:36,999
[SPEAKER_38]: The council, the council respected all public comment.

1747
02:15:37,019 --> 02:15:38,701
[SPEAKER_38]: I just ask that we keep it to one mic, please.

1748
02:15:38,781 --> 02:15:39,181
[SPEAKER_38]: One voice.

1749
02:15:39,221 --> 02:15:39,481
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1750
02:15:44,312 --> 02:15:44,772
[SPEAKER_33]: Councilor Knight.

1751
02:15:45,732 --> 02:15:46,933
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1752
02:15:47,753 --> 02:16:00,076
[SPEAKER_33]: First of all, I think we can all agree that diversity is important, and it's commendable for a public official to pursue diversity.

1753
02:16:02,176 --> 02:16:13,119
[SPEAKER_33]: I also think that this issue before us here sheds light on a perfect example of why diversity of thought

1754
02:16:14,571 --> 02:16:26,479
[SPEAKER_33]: and diversity of opinion is necessary when you go to the ballot box and you cast your vote to elect somebody to serve.

1755
02:16:28,481 --> 02:16:35,646
[SPEAKER_33]: Because without diversity of thought, without diversity of opinion, what you're going to see is more and more of the same.

1756
02:16:38,168 --> 02:16:39,749
[SPEAKER_33]: So I leave you with this.

1757
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:43,972
[SPEAKER_33]: Moving forward, everybody behind this rail makes decisions.

1758
02:16:45,353 --> 02:16:50,635
[SPEAKER_33]: based upon what they feel is those in the best interest of the city of Medford in one way or another.

1759
02:16:52,456 --> 02:16:58,758
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's not easy to come out here every evening and be criticized and be trolled and be attacked.

1760
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:03,300
[SPEAKER_33]: And all it is is an opportunity for us to have a discussion.

1761
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:08,082
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, Councilor Penta came up and said that someone should make a motion to receive this and place this on file.

1762
02:17:10,803 --> 02:17:11,083
[SPEAKER_33]: Then what?

1763
02:17:14,065 --> 02:17:15,205
[SPEAKER_33]: It fails, then what?

1764
02:17:19,467 --> 02:17:21,548
[SPEAKER_33]: Then what?

1765
02:17:22,668 --> 02:17:27,730
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it's safe to say that we're all acting on behalf of the people.

1766
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:38,674
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's that diversity of thought and that diversity of opinion on how do we address issues like this that's really coming into play right now.

1767
02:17:41,323 --> 02:17:55,689
[SPEAKER_33]: For these reasons, I'm going to support the paper this evening, because quite frankly, I attached five amendments to it that ask a number of significant legal questions as to whether or not this is even the appropriate process, or whether or not the paper is even in proper legal form.

1768
02:17:57,190 --> 02:18:00,771
[SPEAKER_33]: And as we move forward, this isn't going to be the last you hear of this.

1769
02:18:01,812 --> 02:18:03,112
[SPEAKER_33]: This isn't going to be the last you hear of it.

1770
02:18:03,132 --> 02:18:03,832
[SPEAKER_33]: It's going to come back.

1771
02:18:04,693 --> 02:18:07,234
[SPEAKER_33]: When your landscape is out there,

1772
02:18:08,035 --> 02:18:10,736
[SPEAKER_33]: blowing the leaves in your yard with an electric leaf blower.

1773
02:18:11,257 --> 02:18:11,837
[SPEAKER_33]: You know what I mean?

1774
02:18:11,877 --> 02:18:14,998
[SPEAKER_33]: You guys are gonna still be talking about the school committee and whether or not they're getting a raise.

1775
02:18:15,398 --> 02:18:16,999
[SPEAKER_33]: That's the fact of the mat, all right?

1776
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:30,786
[SPEAKER_33]: But with that being said, you know, I think that, you know, when we move forward in this community and we think about what direction we're gonna go in, diversity of thought and diversity of opinion is something that we really need to think about.

1777
02:18:32,386 --> 02:18:33,207
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1778
02:18:33,227 --> 02:18:35,068
[SPEAKER_38]: And I apologize, Councilor Collins, I missed you.

1779
02:18:35,970 --> 02:18:37,612
[SPEAKER_38]: frantically looking over here and I wasn't looking over there.

1780
02:18:37,652 --> 02:18:38,193
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Collins.

1781
02:18:38,934 --> 02:18:39,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1782
02:18:39,454 --> 02:18:39,915
[SPEAKER_16]: It's okay.

1783
02:18:40,756 --> 02:18:47,804
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a lot of, it feels cheap to say, there was a lot of really important perspectives shared tonight.

1784
02:18:47,884 --> 02:18:55,073
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like even just saying that doesn't really do it justice, but I wanted to leave the last word to a lead sponsor of the paper.

1785
02:18:56,091 --> 02:19:04,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I did just wanted to quickly clarify one of my previous comments, because I think when I mentioned the free cash number, I was unclear, and I apologize for speaking unclearly.

1786
02:19:04,356 --> 02:19:05,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I was nervous.

1787
02:19:05,916 --> 02:19:17,442
[SPEAKER_16]: What I really meant to say was to try to recenter my comments on what I think is the most important part of most of the conversations that we have in the city council, which is that tight budgets are a choice.

1788
02:19:18,663 --> 02:19:23,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're not a choice that we make in this branch of government.

1789
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:34,403
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope that a silver lining of this conversation can be elucidating for this body and for the school committee and for the residents, how our budgets get made.

1790
02:19:34,443 --> 02:19:36,983
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an ongoing process of making the budget every year.

1791
02:19:37,223 --> 02:19:38,963
[SPEAKER_16]: And for us, it just means approving it.

1792
02:19:39,043 --> 02:19:42,064
[SPEAKER_16]: We cannot appropriate, we cannot weigh in on collective bargaining.

1793
02:19:42,584 --> 02:19:45,745
[SPEAKER_16]: We cannot move money from one salary to another.

1794
02:19:46,305 --> 02:19:47,965
[SPEAKER_16]: We're sorely limited in what we can do.

1795
02:19:49,305 --> 02:19:53,306
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope that this ongoing process allows us to have the conversation with the community

1796
02:19:54,005 --> 02:20:02,949
[SPEAKER_16]: how our budgets are shaped, and who shapes them, and what limited power lies where, because I think it's beneficial for the community to get a better sense of how that pie gets baked.

1797
02:20:03,610 --> 02:20:22,419
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think what makes me frustrated, what I hear in this room tonight, is that we, the administration, willfully keeps urgently needed funding away from the people and services that need it, year after year, on a scale that exceeds by magnitude the scale of these proposed COLA increases.

1798
02:20:23,098 --> 02:20:26,060
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is what I'll be focusing on as we continue to discuss this.

1799
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:38,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope that we can continue to center the conversation around this conversation and achieving equity and just what we need in our operating budget year after year.

1800
02:20:38,427 --> 02:20:42,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thank you to everybody who brought that to this conversation tonight and will in the future.

1801
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:42,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1802
02:20:43,605 --> 02:20:46,970
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1803
02:20:47,311 --> 02:20:58,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, you know, I already discussed it a little bit, but I just wanted to reiterate I know many of you will be disappointed with my, you know, when I vote to move this into subcommittee of the whole.

1804
02:20:59,988 --> 02:21:08,954
[SPEAKER_17]: But my whole take on this is I wouldn't, ultimately, I won't vote for this if it does detract from the students, right?

1805
02:21:09,034 --> 02:21:11,015
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we all agree on that value.

1806
02:21:11,075 --> 02:21:20,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone behind this rail agrees on that value, but only by moving into subcommittee can we have those meetings and conversations with financial folks to give us that better picture.

1807
02:21:22,102 --> 02:21:25,844
[SPEAKER_17]: We also, as Councilor Collins alluded to it,

1808
02:21:26,384 --> 02:21:34,072
[SPEAKER_17]: have to consider the different magnitudes of this proposal versus the actual needs for our schools, which I completely agree.

1809
02:21:34,272 --> 02:21:40,257
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do agree that, you know, with huge raises for teachers in Paris.

1810
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:41,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I really do.

1811
02:21:41,118 --> 02:21:43,040
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll stand by you with that.

1812
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:44,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Before this meeting, I encouraged it.

1813
02:21:45,302 --> 02:21:48,745
[SPEAKER_17]: I encouraged you guys to push for more future negotiations.

1814
02:21:50,447 --> 02:21:53,554
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, we can't have these conversations without moving forward on this.

1815
02:21:53,815 --> 02:21:57,503
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I know again, a lot of you will be disappointed.

1816
02:21:57,524 --> 02:21:59,588
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that

1817
02:22:01,192 --> 02:22:06,053
[SPEAKER_17]: you guys will call me, email me, that we can have a conversation about this.

1818
02:22:06,333 --> 02:22:23,437
[SPEAKER_17]: I know a lot of you know me personally, and a lot of you have friends who taught me as well, and I really encourage more conversation about this, and it'll help inform my views on this going forward, what a compromise looks like, because I think we can broker a better compromise, and that's really my priority.

1819
02:22:23,477 --> 02:22:27,258
[SPEAKER_17]: So please reach out, please talk to me, and we'll have an open discussion about it.

1820
02:22:27,458 --> 02:22:27,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1821
02:22:27,938 --> 02:22:28,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Sands.

1822
02:22:28,619 --> 02:22:29,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Knight.

1823
02:22:30,285 --> 02:22:32,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Council Vice President.

1824
02:22:32,746 --> 02:22:33,867
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, this isn't easy.

1825
02:22:34,227 --> 02:22:37,029
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that this is what we agree to disagree.

1826
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:40,111
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think this is what this council is about.

1827
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:45,282
[SPEAKER_21]: not similar to what we're hearing that happens on the school side.

1828
02:22:45,382 --> 02:22:47,883
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate that, that we have this here.

1829
02:22:47,923 --> 02:22:54,466
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but again, my intention was to listen to everybody, understanding, weighing the pros and the cons.

1830
02:22:55,066 --> 02:23:02,769
[SPEAKER_21]: And as much as I respect former council, my motion was going to be received in place on file.

1831
02:23:02,829 --> 02:23:03,850
[SPEAKER_21]: So that would be my motion.

1832
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:05,611
[SPEAKER_21]: to receive and place on file.

1833
02:23:06,071 --> 02:23:11,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, because I feel strongly enough that I've heard enough that we need to move forward without this as an issue.

1834
02:23:11,896 --> 02:23:15,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, we're going into this with a new council.

1835
02:23:15,619 --> 02:23:19,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Why would we have them give them that responsibility?

1836
02:23:20,722 --> 02:23:22,924
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I feel that it's just not fair.

1837
02:23:23,504 --> 02:23:24,025
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

1838
02:23:24,665 --> 02:23:25,566
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1839
02:23:25,586 --> 02:23:28,328
[SPEAKER_38]: We're going to go to Councilor Knight, and then we do have one more public comment on this.

1840
02:23:28,488 --> 02:23:29,749
[SPEAKER_33]: Councilor Knight.

1841
02:23:29,809 --> 02:23:30,870
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. President, the more I think about this,

1842
02:23:34,138 --> 02:23:37,299
[SPEAKER_33]: the more I think that there could potentially be a solution.

1843
02:23:37,959 --> 02:23:51,085
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, week in and week out we come up here and we have Mina come up and talk to us about all the great things that the mayor's doing, all these grants and these outside contracts that they have and consultants that they have that are running the city.

1844
02:23:51,905 --> 02:23:57,907
[SPEAKER_33]: And one of the things that the mayor's been touting as of recent is the fact that we have a grant.

1845
02:23:58,828 --> 02:24:02,209
[SPEAKER_33]: We have this wonderful grant for a compensation equity study.

1846
02:24:03,473 --> 02:24:04,173
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, we got the grant.

1847
02:24:04,253 --> 02:24:07,375
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know if the study started or not, right?

1848
02:24:07,875 --> 02:24:08,956
[SPEAKER_33]: But we have these titles.

1849
02:24:09,376 --> 02:24:13,398
[SPEAKER_33]: And they want to go around to every other surrounding community, and they're going to see what people in these titles make.

1850
02:24:15,139 --> 02:24:21,982
[SPEAKER_33]: Why wouldn't we refer this paper to the city administration for inclusion in the compensation classification study that's provided by grant funding?

1851
02:24:22,442 --> 02:24:23,223
[SPEAKER_33]: We're costing the city $0.

1852
02:24:23,343 --> 02:24:24,644
[SPEAKER_33]: I would second that.

1853
02:24:24,704 --> 02:24:25,924
[SPEAKER_33]: Take this off our table.

1854
02:24:27,265 --> 02:24:30,647
[SPEAKER_33]: Let's see what the report says when it comes back to see if they're being compensated equitably.

1855
02:24:30,927 --> 02:24:31,547
[SPEAKER_33]: I would second that.

1856
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:34,741
[SPEAKER_33]: And if they are, they are.

1857
02:24:34,821 --> 02:24:42,325
[SPEAKER_33]: And if they aren't, we've got a report there that's been done by an outside third party that's compared this with all those surrounding communities and people in like responsible positions.

1858
02:24:42,705 --> 02:24:47,688
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we'll be able to provide something that's driven by data and it's not driven by desire.

1859
02:24:49,028 --> 02:24:49,669
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank God tonight.

1860
02:24:49,729 --> 02:24:51,530
[SPEAKER_38]: There are already motions on the floor.

1861
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:54,171
[SPEAKER_38]: Would you like to include that as an amendment to the paper itself?

1862
02:24:55,575 --> 02:24:56,436
[SPEAKER_33]: I'd like to make it as a motion.

1863
02:24:56,916 --> 02:24:58,117
[SPEAKER_38]: Right, there's already motions on the floor.

1864
02:24:58,137 --> 02:25:00,999
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to take them in order and it's possible that your motion won't be heard.

1865
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:04,061
[SPEAKER_38]: Would you like to also put that as an amendment?

1866
02:25:04,381 --> 02:25:04,641
[SPEAKER_35]: Sure.

1867
02:25:05,181 --> 02:25:05,402
[SPEAKER_38]: All right.

1868
02:25:05,762 --> 02:25:06,542
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1869
02:25:08,103 --> 02:25:14,067
[SPEAKER_38]: Going to go to Fire Eastford Tau, we know as Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1870
02:25:14,127 --> 02:25:15,989
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please.

1871
02:25:16,069 --> 02:25:19,771
[SPEAKER_38]: Two minutes, and I will tell you when you have 30 seconds.

1872
02:25:19,951 --> 02:25:20,712
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. Castagnetti.

1873
02:25:26,144 --> 02:25:27,786
[SPEAKER_39]: And address for the record, please.

1874
02:25:27,826 --> 02:25:28,847
[SPEAKER_39]: Two minutes.

1875
02:25:29,328 --> 02:25:29,988
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll tell you.

1876
02:25:30,008 --> 02:25:31,510
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1877
02:25:31,630 --> 02:25:32,992
[SPEAKER_39]: Cushing Street, Medford mask.

1878
02:25:33,012 --> 02:25:34,914
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to say this.

1879
02:25:34,954 --> 02:25:36,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Cushing Street, Medford mask.

1880
02:25:47,839 --> 02:25:50,321
[SPEAKER_22]: This is one heck of a heinous-ness meeting tonight.

1881
02:25:50,741 --> 02:25:55,003
[SPEAKER_22]: I must say, I want to say that our Council President Morell has the power.

1882
02:25:55,024 --> 02:25:57,745
[SPEAKER_38]: Andrew, I'm going to have to mute you to think of your television.

1883
02:25:57,765 --> 02:26:00,067
[SPEAKER_38]: We have a lot of feedback creating noise in the room.

1884
02:26:00,087 --> 02:26:01,147
[SPEAKER_22]: We got the Council.

1885
02:26:02,068 --> 02:26:02,748
[SPEAKER_38]: Can you hear me?

1886
02:26:03,249 --> 02:26:05,650
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe it would cut their salary in half.

1887
02:26:08,072 --> 02:26:08,612
[SPEAKER_38]: Sorry about that.

1888
02:26:08,672 --> 02:26:09,693
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll try to go back to him.

1889
02:26:11,214 --> 02:26:13,375
[SPEAKER_38]: Jamie, I'll go to you, then we'll see if we can get Mr. Castagnetti.

1890
02:26:13,666 --> 02:26:14,246
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1891
02:26:14,307 --> 02:26:15,708
[SPEAKER_50]: Jamie Thompson, 86 Lawrence Road.

1892
02:26:16,788 --> 02:26:17,469
[SPEAKER_50]: Just want to respond.

1893
02:26:17,789 --> 02:26:24,354
[SPEAKER_50]: Councilor Collins spoke to what the City Council has the ability to do.

1894
02:26:25,895 --> 02:26:27,337
[SPEAKER_50]: Councilor Knight, you spoke about diversity.

1895
02:26:27,357 --> 02:26:35,803
[SPEAKER_50]: One of the things we have going on right now is the charter study, and I would push everyone to look at the opportunity to go to ward-based representation.

1896
02:26:36,424 --> 02:26:37,805
[SPEAKER_50]: If you want diversity on the council,

1897
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:45,282
[SPEAKER_50]: go to award based representation, you will have a different community, you'll have different representation, you will have a specific community that you will be representing.

1898
02:26:45,722 --> 02:26:49,483
[SPEAKER_50]: You will not have to look to representing at large as an entire committee council.

1899
02:26:50,063 --> 02:26:53,524
[SPEAKER_50]: Our as a committee, you'll look at lower costs for campaigning.

1900
02:26:54,185 --> 02:26:58,266
[SPEAKER_50]: I know that funds have been talked about and that's where some of the salary compensation conversation.

1901
02:26:58,786 --> 02:27:05,231
[SPEAKER_50]: has come from, but better representation and better opportunity comes from more based representation.

1902
02:27:05,652 --> 02:27:09,655
[SPEAKER_50]: I really think that some of these conversations need to wait until that decision is made.

1903
02:27:10,416 --> 02:27:10,716
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1904
02:27:11,877 --> 02:27:12,457
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Jamie.

1905
02:27:12,918 --> 02:27:16,241
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, Andrew, I'm going to go back to you, but I need you to mute your television.

1906
02:27:20,124 --> 02:27:24,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1907
02:27:24,187 --> 02:27:24,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

1908
02:27:24,988 --> 02:27:25,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear me?

1909
02:27:31,431 --> 02:27:51,117
[SPEAKER_37]: blue bad connection it's a very bad connection i'm sorry blue you know you can submit comments and write it to the clerk all right any further public comment

1910
02:27:54,574 --> 02:28:03,737
[SPEAKER_38]: Seeing none, there's a motion on the floor to refer to Committee of the Whole as amended by Councilor Morell, and then Councilor Knight, and then Councilor Morell, and then Councilor Knight.

1911
02:28:05,378 --> 02:28:07,659
[SPEAKER_38]: On that motion, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1912
02:28:09,119 --> 02:28:09,940
[SPEAKER_38]: All those in favour?

1913
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,681
[SPEAKER_38]: All opposed?

1914
02:28:12,981 --> 02:28:13,521
[SPEAKER_38]: Roll call.

1915
02:28:13,781 --> 02:28:15,482
[SPEAKER_38]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1916
02:28:15,502 --> 02:28:19,143
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you want to read all the amendments?

1917
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:25,611
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, I will summarize the amendments, and you can let me know if it's sufficient.

1918
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:34,013
[SPEAKER_38]: There was an amendment initially from President Morell to strike the whereas clauses referring to the majority membership of each body.

1919
02:28:34,573 --> 02:28:44,596
[SPEAKER_38]: There was a further amendment to refer this to Committee of the Whole, along with the suggestion that this proposal be looked at as both a phase-in over time and potentially a different amount.

1920
02:28:45,296 --> 02:28:56,239
[SPEAKER_38]: There were several motions by Councilor Knight made by email and text regarding legal questions in various sections of Massachusetts general law, and asking for those questions to be answered as part of this discussion.

1921
02:28:56,259 --> 02:29:06,203
[SPEAKER_38]: And then I believe, Councilor Knight, that there's also an amendment that this, at some point, be referred to the compensation study that is being conducted by the administration for a response.

1922
02:29:08,403 --> 02:29:09,184
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1923
02:29:14,815 --> 02:29:20,476
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Scarpelli has a motion to receive a place on file, I'll take that after the first motion, that was seconded.

1924
02:29:20,696 --> 02:29:24,777
[SPEAKER_38]: So on the motion, as amended, please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

1925
02:29:26,378 --> 02:29:26,938
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Caraviello?

1926
02:29:27,138 --> 02:29:27,438
[SPEAKER_41]: No.

1927
02:29:29,739 --> 02:29:30,299
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Collins?

1928
02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:30,679
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1929
02:29:31,559 --> 02:29:31,999
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Knight?

1930
02:29:32,359 --> 02:29:32,499
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1931
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:34,960
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1932
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:35,080
[SPEAKER_41]: No.

1933
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:36,960
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng?

1934
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:37,220
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

1935
02:29:38,621 --> 02:29:39,161
[SPEAKER_41]: President Morell?

1936
02:29:39,361 --> 02:29:39,521
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1937
02:29:40,632 --> 02:29:41,272
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Pierce.

1938
02:29:41,472 --> 02:29:43,233
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

1939
02:29:43,253 --> 02:29:46,354
[SPEAKER_38]: The motion passes and the paper is referred to committee as amended.

1940
02:29:47,495 --> 02:29:48,495
[SPEAKER_38]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1941
02:29:50,576 --> 02:29:55,458
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by President Morell, seconded by

1942
02:29:57,208 --> 02:29:58,529
[SPEAKER_38]: seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1943
02:29:58,549 --> 02:29:59,270
[SPEAKER_38]: All those in favour?

1944
02:29:59,951 --> 02:30:00,571
[SPEAKER_38]: All those opposed?

1945
02:30:00,631 --> 02:30:01,212
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion passes.

1946
02:30:01,232 --> 02:30:02,113
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll average the regular order.

1947
02:30:02,133 --> 02:30:04,515
[SPEAKER_38]: Would we like to take a five-minute recess?

1948
02:30:05,516 --> 02:30:08,139
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion, President Morell, five-minute recess, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1949
02:30:08,159 --> 02:30:08,879
[SPEAKER_38]: All those in favour?

1950
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:09,981
[SPEAKER_38]: All those opposed?

1951
02:30:10,041 --> 02:30:10,581
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion passes.

1952
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:11,962
[SPEAKER_38]: We are in recess for five minutes.

1953
02:47:19,058 --> 02:47:21,900
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I believe we are back from recess.

1954
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:24,341
[SPEAKER_26]: I know I motion to revert to regular business.

1955
02:47:24,361 --> 02:47:26,442
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone would like to revert?

1956
02:47:26,462 --> 02:47:32,706
[SPEAKER_26]: We have someone from public participation that I thought had left and he has been here the entire time and I feel like we should take him.

1957
02:47:33,667 --> 02:47:35,748
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion to suspend the rules to take public participation.

1958
02:47:36,995 --> 02:47:40,578
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion by Susan Baird to suspend the real estate public participation is seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1959
02:47:40,738 --> 02:47:41,338
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favour?

1960
02:47:41,519 --> 02:47:41,659
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1961
02:47:42,099 --> 02:47:42,759
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

1962
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:43,460
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1963
02:47:44,141 --> 02:47:44,601
[SPEAKER_26]: Please come up.

1964
02:47:45,722 --> 02:47:48,844
[SPEAKER_26]: And just name and address for the record, please.

1965
02:47:49,464 --> 02:47:50,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the microphone.

1966
02:47:50,805 --> 02:47:51,686
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Jim Crott.

1967
02:47:51,726 --> 02:47:53,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I live at 22 Winter Street in Medford.

1968
02:47:53,908 --> 02:47:55,929
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the hillside neighbourhood.

1969
02:47:55,949 --> 02:47:59,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was a really interesting session.

1970
02:48:02,025 --> 02:48:06,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really eye-opening and saddening to hear about the dismal state of schools.

1971
02:48:06,706 --> 02:48:17,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually feel a little bit embarrassed to talk to you about my petty issues, but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about things that are going on in my direct neighbourhood that I have a lot of experience with.

1972
02:48:18,469 --> 02:48:25,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lived in Medford for 15 years now, and during this time there's been a lot of changes in the neighbourhood that I've been aware of.

1973
02:48:25,791 --> 02:48:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these changes have been positive, like the Greenline extension, the new police

1974
02:48:31,588 --> 02:48:33,129
[SPEAKER_05]: the new library and such and such.

1975
02:48:33,189 --> 02:48:42,194
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are doing construction on their houses and improving their houses, doing new roofs and dormers and porches and stuff, all of which is great, and I've done those things too.

1976
02:48:43,955 --> 02:48:59,083
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm noticing more recently, though, is that there is a lot of new—more and more gut renovations and new construction in Medford of accessory dwellings or attached houses in the neighbourhood.

1977
02:49:00,337 --> 02:49:11,640
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there are two of these projects going on right now on my street, on Winter Street, and two have just completed on the corner of Winthrop and Summer Streets.

1978
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:20,682
[SPEAKER_05]: As opposed to homeowners like me making modest improvements or renovations to the house, professional developers that come in to

1979
02:49:22,082 --> 02:49:33,531
[SPEAKER_05]: build new construction stuff have an extended impact on the neighbourhood in terms of access and noise and all sorts of obstructions.

1980
02:49:34,312 --> 02:49:40,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I want to talk about was three issues related to this that I've noticed.

1981
02:49:43,729 --> 02:49:49,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Three aspects related to the professional developer activity that I'd like to discuss and have you guys consider.

1982
02:49:50,871 --> 02:50:00,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me preface this by saying that I'm not opposed to development, and I think we need to build more houses, especially affordable houses.

1983
02:50:02,653 --> 02:50:06,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, as a community, we need to carefully think about the impacts of these developments.

1984
02:50:07,833 --> 02:50:20,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Firstly, regarding the two projects on my street, at least two working-class families have been displaced, and now four $1.6 million condos are being built.

1985
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:25,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So, across these two projects, the number of houses is going from three to four.

1986
02:50:26,703 --> 02:50:34,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I would argue that the number of houses that are affordable to regular people is being reduced from three to zero.

1987
02:50:35,968 --> 02:50:36,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, as far as I know,

1988
02:50:39,036 --> 02:50:49,978
[SPEAKER_05]: when a developer is planning a new development or a large kind of housing complex, they're obliged to set aside some of those, a proportion of those for low-income families.

1989
02:50:50,058 --> 02:51:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But if a developer comes in and one by one turns these regular houses into luxury condos, they can do as many of them as they like, so there are no restrictions there.

1990
02:51:00,460 --> 02:51:05,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that this runs counter to what you guys are trying to achieve with the housing in Medford.

1991
02:51:06,301 --> 02:51:15,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Thirdly, and probably on a little bit more of a selfish note, I'd like to discuss a little bit about what me, myself and my neighbours have been experiencing over the last two months.

1992
02:51:15,949 --> 02:51:21,494
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about two months into this construction process and I'm told it's going to last about 10 months, eight to 10 months.

1993
02:51:24,075 --> 02:51:30,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as a little taste of the things that we're experiencing is that, you know, workers are arriving before 7 a.m.

1994
02:51:30,419 --> 02:51:31,279
[SPEAKER_05]: six days a week.

1995
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:44,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the time they wait until seven before they actively start working, but they often arrive in big trucks before seven and keep them running, or they start their excavator up to warm it up before seven so they can start on the dot.

1996
02:51:45,327 --> 02:51:51,971
[SPEAKER_05]: They excavate all day for more than a week straight with dump trucks coming in and out all day, you know, causing a lot of vibration and noise.

1997
02:51:53,528 --> 02:51:55,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Frequent noise greater than 80 decibels.

1998
02:51:56,529 --> 02:52:03,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Digging holes in the street without any prior warning, verbal or with any signs, no cones, nothing.

1999
02:52:04,991 --> 02:52:06,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Repeatedly blocking driveways.

2000
02:52:06,852 --> 02:52:10,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to ask people to move their truck or move their excavator so we can get in and out of our driveway.

2001
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:20,935
[SPEAKER_05]: blocking the street, rubble, excess dirt, debris and various trash on the street from food and drink containers and construction material and dust in the air.

2002
02:52:22,336 --> 02:52:25,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Excavation undermines neighbouring property.

2003
02:52:25,718 --> 02:52:36,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Just last Saturday, my neighbour, Mark, two doors down, had his property undermined and there was a section of his fence that was just floating in the air.

2004
02:52:37,329 --> 02:52:41,151
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys also piled up dirt on my fence and pushed our fence over.

2005
02:52:41,171 --> 02:52:49,275
[SPEAKER_05]: There are reserve spots on the street with cones and parking large trailers on the street, just some of the things.

2006
02:52:50,115 --> 02:52:55,698
[SPEAKER_05]: When you take all these things together, they're all kind of individually minor, but they add up.

2007
02:52:56,158 --> 02:52:59,740
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, it makes it impossible for us to use our houses normally.

2008
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:03,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to kindly request that the Council consider.

2009
02:53:04,929 --> 02:53:23,788
[SPEAKER_05]: that these longer-term, high-impact construction projects by professional developers really negatively affect the neighbours and make it difficult to work from home, makes it difficult to find parking, kids to do their homework or study for their exams, or even just to sleep in on Saturday.

2010
02:53:25,674 --> 02:53:40,302
[SPEAKER_05]: They also may create additional costs for neighbours, including increased cleaning needs of the houses and cars and noise mitigation devices like noise cancelling headphones if you want to work at home.

2011
02:53:41,876 --> 02:53:47,222
[SPEAKER_05]: If it were for a few weeks or a couple of months for someone to do an extension on their house, that's fine.

2012
02:53:47,242 --> 02:53:58,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm talking about are professional developers that are coming here, making a bunch of money from these projects, laughing all the way to the bank while we're suffering for a year at a time on these projects.

2013
02:54:02,423 --> 02:54:31,507
[SPEAKER_05]: In light of these facts, I'd like to suggest that the construction permitting process in Medford be re-evaluated to consider whether work is being done by a homeowner or a professional developer, and also to consider the length and severity of impact to the neighbouring residents, with potentially the cost of permits increasing with the impact and duration.

2014
02:54:33,147 --> 02:54:41,298
[SPEAKER_05]: To finish off, I'd like to reiterate that I think the current trajectory of development is undermining what the city is trying to achieve in their housing production plan.

2015
02:54:41,318 --> 02:54:43,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't read the whole thing, but I skimmed it a little bit.

2016
02:54:44,133 --> 02:54:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: but because developers are focusing on the production of expensive luxury condos at the cost of affordable and smaller houses that regular people can afford.

2017
02:54:55,880 --> 02:54:56,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's all I have.

2018
02:54:56,700 --> 02:54:57,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2019
02:54:57,521 --> 02:54:58,381
[SPEAKER_27]: DEPUTY MAYOR WILLIAMS.

2020
02:54:58,401 --> 02:54:58,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2021
02:54:58,641 --> 02:54:59,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor GRIFFITHS.

2022
02:54:59,142 --> 02:54:59,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor GRIFFITHS.

2023
02:54:59,682 --> 02:55:03,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam President, if you can, I think that—we really can't debate it, but what we can do

2024
02:55:04,139 --> 02:55:07,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, when you come, developers are smart, so they're not stupid.

2025
02:55:07,481 --> 02:55:11,443
[SPEAKER_21]: They're trying to circumvent the system.

2026
02:55:11,483 --> 02:55:21,249
[SPEAKER_21]: But what we can do, if we can, if we can share your information with the clerk to get the information to the code enforcement officer.

2027
02:55:23,570 --> 02:55:34,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Because what you're saying, what they're doing, we have everything in place for that because we do have some developers out there that take total advantage of this in our community.

2028
02:55:34,242 --> 02:55:39,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of like death by a thousand cuts and they also do it and then ask for forgiveness later.

2029
02:55:39,548 --> 02:55:41,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do that every day.

2030
02:55:41,950 --> 02:55:46,074
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we can be pretty hard on some developers and I think that and making sure that they told the line.

2031
02:55:46,114 --> 02:55:59,648
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we can make sure that our code enforcement officer has that, that address, and they get out there tomorrow, I'll make a phone call tomorrow as well to the code enforcement office to make sure they come out and set up a regular, you know, visit where they check in periodically throughout the day.

2032
02:55:59,808 --> 02:56:01,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, because if it's that bad,

2033
02:56:01,940 --> 02:56:08,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the most ridiculous one was when they just started digging a hole in front of our street without any warning, in front of my house without any warning.

2034
02:56:09,487 --> 02:56:14,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Excavator in front of my driveway, we have to request permission to exit our own house.

2035
02:56:15,633 --> 02:56:19,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we're at Winter Street.

2036
02:56:20,137 --> 02:56:26,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that property, I'm at 22, they're at 28, because there's a number or two missing, they're right next door.

2037
02:56:28,573 --> 02:56:32,797
[SPEAKER_26]: You want to just list the infractions out in the email we have?

2038
02:56:32,857 --> 02:56:34,359
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll just copy and paste.

2039
02:56:34,379 --> 02:56:36,361
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so copy and paste, and we'll make sure we get that.

2040
02:56:37,762 --> 02:56:38,783
[SPEAKER_26]: Go to Councilor Collins.

2041
02:56:39,223 --> 02:56:45,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say, excuse me, thank you for bringing your concerns to us tonight.

2042
02:56:46,430 --> 02:56:53,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Glad to hear that we have some action steps we can quickly take on the construction infractions piece of things.

2043
02:56:53,875 --> 02:56:57,577
[SPEAKER_16]: really appreciate you speaking to, especially appreciate you actually reading the housing production plan.

2044
02:56:57,937 --> 02:57:00,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I skimmed it, I didn't read the whole thing.

2045
02:57:00,338 --> 02:57:03,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think that's probably the average way to read it.

2046
02:57:04,159 --> 02:57:09,962
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that your comments resonate with a lot of the work that we've laid out for ourselves on the council.

2047
02:57:10,002 --> 02:57:14,784
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been trying to work on this term and we have a lot more ahead coming up over the next two years.

2048
02:57:15,224 --> 02:57:23,227
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that aligning the goals of the housing production plan in terms of making sure that the development we're building is not exclusively or heavily weighted to luxury development,

2049
02:57:23,846 --> 02:57:31,734
[SPEAKER_16]: serving a wide range of users and households is deeply embedded in the work that we're trying to do through our zoning overhaul which we're very much gearing up for.

2050
02:57:31,754 --> 02:57:45,628
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a condo conversion ordinance that's still in progress so there are some, there's some ongoing council projects that touch on exactly what you're speaking so just encourage you to, you know, we'd love to, you know, have you be engaged in the public process and those as they unfold and

2051
02:57:47,210 --> 02:57:49,672
[SPEAKER_16]: These are projects that have come about because of what the community has said.

2052
02:57:49,692 --> 02:58:04,323
[SPEAKER_16]: We want housing to look like and not look like in Medford, so we welcome your continuing participation in the high-level policy that we try to implement to make sure that we don't just turn into a community of luxury condos where nobody can afford to live in.

2053
02:58:04,863 --> 02:58:13,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally within 200 feet, there's two and then two and then another, say, six on the corner.

2054
02:58:14,997 --> 02:58:27,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Winthrop and some, it's just, you know, it's a formula they have, buy these regular houses, put all the, you know, bells and whistles on it and flip it over for like a million dollars.

2055
02:58:27,457 --> 02:58:28,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who can afford that.

2056
02:58:32,042 --> 02:58:36,986
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be super brief, but I wanted to thank you for coming and sharing all these concerns.

2057
02:58:37,266 --> 02:58:43,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Like what Councilor Collins said, this is a top priority for us going on into the next term.

2058
02:58:43,831 --> 02:58:48,455
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have the whole zoning reform process going on, phase two of that.

2059
02:58:49,295 --> 02:58:51,677
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll be looking at a lot of policy ideas that might touch it.

2060
02:58:51,697 --> 02:58:53,879
[SPEAKER_17]: I would, again, encourage you to stay in contact.

2061
02:58:54,379 --> 02:58:55,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Please let us know.

2062
02:58:56,421 --> 02:59:03,232
[SPEAKER_17]: what's going on in their neighborhood as well, and we'll try our best to refer to the code enforcement officers in the future.

2063
02:59:03,472 --> 02:59:09,281
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's anything policy-wise, any ideas that you might have, feel free to reach out to us as well.

2064
02:59:09,742 --> 02:59:09,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2065
02:59:13,607 --> 02:59:15,428
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll be super brief if we want to move to the next item.

2066
02:59:16,108 --> 02:59:22,031
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to be clear that what's happening here is that the land is so valuable and the prices are so high that it's worth building luxury units.

2067
02:59:22,592 --> 02:59:26,894
[SPEAKER_38]: And they're going to keep doing that unless we allow them to build something else on the site.

2068
02:59:27,034 --> 02:59:29,975
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's likely a larger number of smaller, affordable units.

2069
02:59:29,995 --> 02:59:30,315
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

2070
02:59:31,476 --> 02:59:31,756
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2071
02:59:31,876 --> 02:59:33,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much for bearing with us.

2072
02:59:33,797 --> 02:59:37,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President, if we can take paper 23466 so this gentleman can get to go home tonight.

2073
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:40,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Out of order.

2074
02:59:40,961 --> 02:59:41,301
[SPEAKER_27]: What page?

2075
02:59:42,698 --> 02:59:48,599
[SPEAKER_18]: 23466 on page 14.

2076
02:59:49,219 --> 03:00:07,863
[SPEAKER_26]: 23466 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it so resolved that Medford City Council vote to authorize the Mayor of the City of Medford to petition the General Court for a special act in the form set forth below, providing that Medford Retirement Board be permitted to retire Joseph Albino, a former uniformed member of the City of Medford Fire Department who was involuntarily retired for accidental disability retirement,

2077
03:00:10,143 --> 03:00:33,090
[SPEAKER_26]: for superannuation retirement as provided by sections 5 and 10 of chapter 32 of the general laws of Massachusetts provided, however, that the general court may make clerical or editorial changes of form only to the bill unless the mayor approves amendments to the bill before enactment by the general court, provided further that the mayor is hereby authorized to approve amendments which shall be within the scope of the general public objectives of this petition.

2078
03:00:34,231 --> 03:00:34,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

2079
03:00:34,911 --> 03:00:37,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So for those who don't know, Mr. Albano was a

2080
03:00:38,547 --> 03:00:47,896
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a business owner in Medford, and he was injured fighting a fire some years ago in 2001, and he was able to return to work.

2081
03:00:48,196 --> 03:00:54,342
[SPEAKER_18]: So in 2019, the fire chief filed an application for an involuntary accidental disability retirement.

2082
03:00:54,821 --> 03:00:55,761
[SPEAKER_18]: with the retirement board.

2083
03:00:56,542 --> 03:01:01,963
[SPEAKER_18]: The board over Mr. Albano's opposition approved the chief's request and Mr. Albano was put on disability requirement.

2084
03:01:02,543 --> 03:01:21,869
[SPEAKER_18]: While Mr. Albano was aware of the limitation on outside areas for disability retirees, he had no idea that PERAC, who's a retirement group, would treat his necessary business expenses, that is to purchase or replacement of vehicles to comply with federal relation as personal income exposed to a business expense.

2085
03:01:22,284 --> 03:01:28,430
[SPEAKER_18]: So had Mr. Urbano known about that, he would have accepted a different form of retirement.

2086
03:01:28,910 --> 03:01:40,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And his attorney said, he could probably explain it a little more better than I can, but what it is, the gentleman's trying to get his retirement so he could live.

2087
03:01:42,464 --> 03:01:46,908
[SPEAKER_18]: And his attorney would probably explain it better than I can.

2088
03:01:48,066 --> 03:01:48,806
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor.

2089
03:01:48,886 --> 03:01:49,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Is this on right now?

2090
03:01:49,787 --> 03:01:49,987
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

2091
03:01:50,047 --> 03:01:51,148
[SPEAKER_24]: And just name it just for the record.

2092
03:01:51,388 --> 03:01:53,569
[SPEAKER_23]: So my name is Jerry McDonough.

2093
03:01:53,589 --> 03:01:56,231
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 13 Hollis Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2094
03:01:56,511 --> 03:01:59,172
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm an attorney practicing public retirement law.

2095
03:01:59,672 --> 03:02:01,293
[SPEAKER_23]: I represent Mr. Albano.

2096
03:02:01,854 --> 03:02:03,435
[SPEAKER_23]: And as Councilor said,

2097
03:02:04,495 --> 03:02:08,159
[SPEAKER_23]: First off, I want to thank you all for taking the time to listen to me this evening.

2098
03:02:09,019 --> 03:02:18,408
[SPEAKER_23]: We first filed a piece of legislation to deal with this in the House of Representatives, and the House clerk said, no, you have to do a home rule petition in Medford.

2099
03:02:19,727 --> 03:02:23,791
[SPEAKER_23]: contacted Adam, who gave me a little bit of instruction on how to arrange for that.

2100
03:02:24,252 --> 03:02:29,677
[SPEAKER_23]: But as Councilor was saying, it's been a long road for Mr. Albano.

2101
03:02:29,737 --> 03:02:36,024
[SPEAKER_23]: He founded a company in 1985, a transportation company that has been doing fairly well.

2102
03:02:36,524 --> 03:02:41,709
[SPEAKER_23]: And around 2001, he fulfilled a lifelong dream and became a Medford firefighter.

2103
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:43,592
[SPEAKER_23]: And he loved the job.

2104
03:02:43,912 --> 03:02:48,537
[SPEAKER_23]: He wanted to continue on that till he reached the maximum retirement age of 65.

2105
03:02:48,597 --> 03:02:55,145
[SPEAKER_23]: But in 2017, he was injured fighting a fire on Henry Avenue, and he was put on injured in duty leave.

2106
03:02:55,840 --> 03:03:15,935
[SPEAKER_23]: and he wanted to come back to work, but I understand the problems that municipalities have when people are out on injured on duty leave and they have a position that they can't fill, so the fire chief filed for an involuntary retirement, and Mr. Albano was involuntarily retired on accidental disability retirement.

2107
03:03:17,136 --> 03:03:19,498
[SPEAKER_23]: He had no say in that.

2108
03:03:19,538 --> 03:03:22,701
[SPEAKER_23]: He tried to oppose it, but it didn't get him anywhere.

2109
03:03:22,841 --> 03:03:26,484
[SPEAKER_23]: And so he now has restrictions on his outside income.

2110
03:03:26,644 --> 03:03:31,367
[SPEAKER_23]: And the problem that he has is that there's a certain amount, there's a tax

2111
03:03:32,625 --> 03:03:45,015
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, provision that treats transportation business expenses, and he has a transportation company, treats transportation costs differently than other business expenses.

2112
03:03:45,556 --> 03:03:55,504
[SPEAKER_23]: So while you might buy a computer for your business and be able to deduct that from the business expenses, you know, he pays, he paid $300,000 and the business paid $300,000 in 2021 for transportation equipment.

2113
03:04:00,568 --> 03:04:04,130
[SPEAKER_23]: But Parak considers that to be his own personal income.

2114
03:04:04,751 --> 03:04:08,073
[SPEAKER_23]: So consequently, he doesn't get any retirement benefits at all.

2115
03:04:08,093 --> 03:04:10,995
[SPEAKER_23]: That's because he's on this accidental disability retirement.

2116
03:04:11,575 --> 03:04:19,160
[SPEAKER_23]: And if he had known that this is a new interpretation of the law by Parak in the last few years since Mr. Albano retired, he couldn't even have known of that.

2117
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:36,229
[SPEAKER_23]: back there at the time, but he would prefer just to have an ordinary, regular retirement that he worked for over the amount of time that he spent as a firefighter in the city of Medford and not have to deal with disability and these earnings restrictions and things like that.

2118
03:04:36,829 --> 03:04:40,333
[SPEAKER_23]: And so he's, you know, he would like to give the business to his sons.

2119
03:04:40,453 --> 03:04:44,617
[SPEAKER_23]: His sons have been doing most of the work of the business since he became a firefighter.

2120
03:04:45,378 --> 03:04:57,830
[SPEAKER_23]: And he's unable at this point in time to transfer the business because he's under a lot of stress, litigation stress, because his business was involved in a terrible accident.

2121
03:04:58,510 --> 03:05:01,631
[SPEAKER_23]: and he can't give the business away at this point in time.

2122
03:05:01,731 --> 03:05:03,952
[SPEAKER_23]: So he's kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.

2123
03:05:04,592 --> 03:05:15,475
[SPEAKER_23]: So all we want to do is try to get a home rule petition filed with the legislature to convert his retirement from an accidental disability retirement to a superannuation retirement.

2124
03:05:15,875 --> 03:05:17,956
[SPEAKER_23]: Superannuation retirement is much lower

2125
03:05:18,696 --> 03:05:22,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Then, the disability retirement, disability retirement is 72%.

2126
03:05:22,999 --> 03:05:29,424
[SPEAKER_23]: I think he'd be getting about 40% or something like that if it's on superannuation, but he wouldn't have these other restrictions.

2127
03:05:29,904 --> 03:05:37,930
[SPEAKER_23]: Plus, he has an ex-spouse that he has to pay part of his retirement allowance to.

2128
03:05:38,390 --> 03:05:41,613
[SPEAKER_23]: His ex-spouse is getting her half of the retirement allowance.

2129
03:05:42,333 --> 03:05:53,915
[SPEAKER_23]: and which is fair but you know he now has to make up for every year he's missing his retirement allowance he has to wait two years because he has to pay the whole

2130
03:05:54,858 --> 03:06:00,461
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, amount of his of his retirement allowance back to the to the bed for retirement for it.

2131
03:06:01,062 --> 03:06:17,692
[SPEAKER_23]: So we would just respectfully ask that that you consider this as a matter of basic fairness for somebody who worked for the city for so long and, you know, wrecked his, you know, wrecked his health fighting a fire that if it could be helped some way, we appreciate it very much.

2132
03:06:18,413 --> 03:06:19,013
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you so much.

2133
03:06:19,773 --> 03:06:20,694
[SPEAKER_27]: Any discussion on the council?

2134
03:06:28,911 --> 03:06:30,792
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs a vote to send it to the mayor to approve it.

2135
03:06:31,133 --> 03:06:31,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Send it to the state house.

2136
03:06:33,654 --> 03:06:34,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2137
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:35,335
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2138
03:06:35,715 --> 03:06:37,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to ask for the home rule petition.

2139
03:06:37,476 --> 03:06:39,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Send it to the mayor to sign and send it to the state house.

2140
03:06:41,639 --> 03:06:46,561
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Tseng, is that a roll call?

2141
03:06:46,842 --> 03:06:46,982
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2142
03:06:47,022 --> 03:06:52,925
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a home rule petition.

2143
03:06:53,145 --> 03:06:54,086
[SPEAKER_38]: Where's the mayor on this?

2144
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:55,310
[SPEAKER_38]: Excuse me?

2145
03:06:55,530 --> 03:06:57,752
[SPEAKER_38]: The mayor, has she been, did she say she would advance this?

2146
03:06:58,192 --> 03:06:59,853
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I haven't spoken to the mayor at all.

2147
03:06:59,873 --> 03:07:03,476
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to, you know, the first place we go is here to the council, so.

2148
03:07:03,676 --> 03:07:06,638
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so if we do this, then the mayor has to approve and then it'll go.

2149
03:07:06,658 --> 03:07:08,599
[SPEAKER_23]: The mayor would have to approve it or amend it.

2150
03:07:08,679 --> 03:07:10,460
[SPEAKER_23]: She can change it in any way she wants, but.

2151
03:07:10,520 --> 03:07:10,660
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2152
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:16,904
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on my right.

2153
03:07:17,945 --> 03:07:18,585
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Peers.

2154
03:07:18,746 --> 03:07:18,986
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

03:07:19,866 --> 03:07:20,427
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Caraviello.

2156
03:07:20,467 --> 03:07:20,647
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_26]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2159
03:07:34,750 --> 03:07:35,571
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

[SPEAKER_23]: Well, thank you very much.

2161
03:07:36,892 --> 03:07:37,193
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2162
03:07:37,233 --> 03:07:38,574
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess some people are leaving.

2163
03:07:39,395 --> 03:07:44,140
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Caraviello is leaving soon, and you're leaving, Madam President.

[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for sticking around.

2169
03:07:50,045 --> 03:07:51,547

[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's a regular order.

2174

[SPEAKER_26]: Second by Councilor Tseng.

[SPEAKER_26]: For additional information and aids for accommodations aids call the Medford city clerk's office at 781-393-2425 TDD 781-393-2516.

2190
03:09:21,457 --> 03:09:28,879
[SPEAKER_26]: as advertised in the Boston Herald on October 30th and November 6th, 2023, by order of the Medford City Council, signed Adam Hurtubise, City Clerk.

2191
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:33,301
[SPEAKER_26]: So this was referred out to, do you wanna talk about the process?

2192
03:09:33,341 --> 03:09:44,104
[SPEAKER_26]: You might say it better than me, but we do have, the council has received comments from the CD board, but I'll hand it to our planner and director of PDS to just remind us of the process.

2193
03:09:46,285 --> 03:09:47,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, my laptop died.

2194
03:09:47,405 --> 03:09:48,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't bring my charger.

2195
03:09:51,350 --> 03:09:56,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the dates off the top of my head.

2196
03:09:56,971 --> 03:10:07,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so we were here recently.

2197
03:10:16,015 --> 03:10:18,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on this December 6th that we came here and had

2198
03:10:19,782 --> 03:10:24,746
[SPEAKER_07]: The referral meeting, we basically explained what it was, but that wasn't the public hearing.

2199
03:10:25,586 --> 03:10:33,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And per chapter 48, it was referred to the city board who held a public hearing over the course of two meetings.

2200
03:10:34,232 --> 03:10:47,321
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some feedback, and they voted five to one to approve the version that came back to you with a reduced

2201
03:10:48,510 --> 03:10:54,434
[SPEAKER_07]: parking requirements and correcting a scrivener's error and to reduce the height from five to four.

2202
03:10:54,454 --> 03:11:03,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I explained the rationale for that in the memo, but we have Emily Innis, our consultant, that is being provided by MHP.

2203
03:11:04,180 --> 03:11:05,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So fortunately, we are not paying for this.

2204
03:11:07,622 --> 03:11:12,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And she can walk us through the details and nuts and bolts of what's in the ordinance.

2205
03:11:14,987 --> 03:11:15,247
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2206
03:11:15,267 --> 03:11:17,969
[SPEAKER_25]: Before we turn it over to Emily, are there any comments from the council at this time?

2207
03:11:20,575 --> 03:11:21,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Planner Evans.

2208
03:11:21,436 --> 03:11:26,400
[SPEAKER_25]: I will turn it over to Emily Ennis to just remind us where we are and what's before us.

2209
03:11:33,126 --> 03:11:34,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

2210
03:11:34,288 --> 03:11:36,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I just had to wait to be allowed to be unmuted.

2211
03:11:38,391 --> 03:11:41,254
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, my name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates.

2212
03:11:42,032 --> 03:11:53,761
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Danielle said, I have been assigned by MHP Mass Housing Partnership as part of technical assistance to assist the city with developing the zoning for compliance with 3A.

2213
03:11:54,922 --> 03:11:59,766
[SPEAKER_12]: I appeared in addition to the work that the CD board has been doing.

2214
03:12:00,226 --> 03:12:08,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I appeared in front of the committee of the whole on just checking my dates, November 29th to present this initially.

2215
03:12:09,833 --> 03:12:17,818
[SPEAKER_12]: So the zoning is applicable, it is an overlay district, which means it sits on top of the existing district.

2216
03:12:17,898 --> 03:12:29,204
[SPEAKER_12]: That means that somebody who owns property has a choice of using the existing zoning or using the overlay zoning, whichever is more beneficial to the project that they're trying to do.

2217
03:12:29,364 --> 03:12:32,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's important to understand that property owners have a choice.

2218
03:12:33,406 --> 03:12:37,689
[SPEAKER_12]: This particular zoning is for the Wellington station area.

2219
03:12:38,029 --> 03:12:51,539
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an area that was identified in the recently approved Medford comprehensive plan as an area that could use additional attention and development as a station area.

2220
03:12:52,239 --> 03:12:57,063
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a critical part of your city strategy for compliance.

2221
03:12:57,883 --> 03:13:05,888
[SPEAKER_12]: The zoning itself is based on the sample zoning that was distributed by the executive office of housing and livable communities.

2222
03:13:06,448 --> 03:13:12,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And the key was to make sure that the zoning fit the needs of Medford for this area.

2223
03:13:12,652 --> 03:13:30,892
[SPEAKER_12]: So with the edits that were or the recommendations from the CD board, we're looking at a minimum lot size of currently a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet of a suggestion to make on that our recommendation to City Council maximum building coverage of 80%.

2224
03:13:32,873 --> 03:13:44,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Minimum number of stories of two and a maximum of four, but with bonus incentives, a maximum of nine stories that's consistent with some of the existing buildings in the area.

2225
03:13:46,379 --> 03:13:56,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Maximum height of 80 feet, again, with the bonus incentive of 140, again, consistent with stories for nine stories with potential ground floor use.

2226
03:13:57,795 --> 03:14:03,579
[SPEAKER_12]: front yard setbacks, side yard setbacks and rear yard setbacks are consistent with the area.

2227
03:14:04,199 --> 03:14:11,465
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the important component for you all to be aware of is this idea of the development incentives bonus.

2228
03:14:13,506 --> 03:14:20,711
[SPEAKER_12]: And the idea is that there would be, sorry, I can hear laughter, so can you hear me all right?

2229
03:14:21,732 --> 03:14:24,214
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh no, sorry, the clerk was just reminding me to do something.

2230
03:14:24,614 --> 03:14:25,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, fair enough.

2231
03:14:27,304 --> 03:14:29,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to make sure I wasn't ever saying my welcome with zoning.

2232
03:14:31,365 --> 03:14:42,109
[SPEAKER_12]: The development incentives are for additional stories for developments that meet city goals and those city goals are for affordability.

2233
03:14:42,649 --> 03:14:57,016
[SPEAKER_12]: for developments that is responsive to concerns about climate change and helps to adapt or mitigate to that climate change, or that provides for an active ground floor use.

2234
03:14:57,196 --> 03:15:04,060
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as I'm sure you're all aware, the MBTA Communities Act does not allow you to mandate ground floor use.

2235
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:15,425
[SPEAKER_12]: So in areas like, for example, the Wellington station area where it's important to continue to have a mix of uses providing a development incentive is a good way to encourage that.

2236
03:15:16,185 --> 03:15:17,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Same thing is true of affordability.

2237
03:15:17,906 --> 03:15:24,829
[SPEAKER_12]: The MBTA Communities Act has a limited recommendation or ability to institute affordability.

2238
03:15:25,449 --> 03:15:33,233
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea of a development incentive allows for the developments to offer either more affordable units or deeper affordability or both.

2239
03:15:33,813 --> 03:15:41,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, being respectful of the city's needs for different housing types and different levels of affordability.

2240
03:15:41,837 --> 03:15:54,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, there's a development incentive or a floor incentive for certifying buildings as either net and zero emissions or as certified as legal or lead gold or lead platinum.

2241
03:15:54,724 --> 03:16:01,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, being responsive to concerns and this also came out of the comprehensive planning around climate resiliency.

2242
03:16:02,961 --> 03:16:09,003
[SPEAKER_12]: The zoning also allows for reduction in off-street parking.

2243
03:16:09,423 --> 03:16:14,125
[SPEAKER_12]: This was a recommendation from the CD board for to 0.5 spaces.

2244
03:16:14,905 --> 03:16:27,449
[SPEAKER_12]: There are bicycle parking spaces required, and then there are also site plan development standards to be used in the site plan review process by the CD board.

2245
03:16:28,529 --> 03:16:31,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of these are either consistent with what was in the sample zoning,

2246
03:16:32,470 --> 03:16:36,235
[SPEAKER_12]: or specifically targeted to developments in this area.

2247
03:16:36,875 --> 03:16:46,927
[SPEAKER_12]: The only change that I would recommend post CD board and this was just as we reran the numbers to make sure that any changes recommended by the CD board stayed in compliance.

2248
03:16:48,148 --> 03:17:02,159
[SPEAKER_12]: We noted that reducing the lot size from 10,000 square feet to 7,000 square feet would mean that all non publicly owned lots in the area would be conforming so that is a change that we would recommend.

2249
03:17:02,819 --> 03:17:09,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I'll stop there with a summary and if you all have any questions, I'm happy to answer them, or defer back to Alicia and Daniel.

2250
03:17:12,022 --> 03:17:12,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2251
03:17:13,342 --> 03:17:18,523
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know it was stated, but I just want to remind that the council did ask a number of questions when we met on this on the 29th.

2252
03:17:18,583 --> 03:17:22,384
[SPEAKER_26]: So if questions are asked tonight, it may reflect that fact.

2253
03:17:22,424 --> 03:17:26,324
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't want that to come across as a lack of interest for anyone watching.

2254
03:17:26,344 --> 03:17:28,445
[SPEAKER_24]: We did ask a number of questions that were helpful.

2255
03:17:29,125 --> 03:17:29,745
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Bears.

2256
03:17:30,345 --> 03:17:31,225
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Madam President.

2257
03:17:31,645 --> 03:17:34,486
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, everyone, for sticking around on this one.

2258
03:17:34,626 --> 03:17:35,306
[SPEAKER_38]: I know it's important.

2259
03:17:35,326 --> 03:17:36,286
[SPEAKER_38]: I know we have a deadline on it.

2260
03:17:36,626 --> 03:17:40,807
[SPEAKER_38]: My one question, sorry, and I just didn't catch it, Emily, was,

2261
03:17:42,312 --> 03:17:48,096
[SPEAKER_38]: Was that a reduction in the square footage, an additional recommendation beyond what the CD board has recommended?

2262
03:17:48,356 --> 03:17:53,159
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's the recommendation of, that's your recommendation, or is it the staff's recommendation?

2263
03:17:54,333 --> 03:17:55,694
[SPEAKER_12]: That is my recommendation.

2264
03:17:56,154 --> 03:18:01,198
[SPEAKER_12]: As I was reviewing the numbers, I did discuss it with Danielle and Alicia.

2265
03:18:01,898 --> 03:18:06,081
[SPEAKER_12]: But as I was reviewing the numbers, I noticed that there were a few non-conforming lots.

2266
03:18:07,242 --> 03:18:09,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking at them, a couple of them were publicly owned.

2267
03:18:10,304 --> 03:18:15,768
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just wanted to make sure that all lots in the area would conform with the new zoning in terms of the dimensional standards.

2268
03:18:17,209 --> 03:18:17,369
[SPEAKER_42]: OK.

2269
03:18:17,989 --> 03:18:19,890
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can respond to that through Madam President.

2270
03:18:21,465 --> 03:18:33,068
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was also something that was brought up at the city board member, the one dissenting vote thought that the lot size was too big, but we were able to run the model in time to find out the implications.

2271
03:18:33,188 --> 03:18:39,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't, no one felt comfortable voting on something that hadn't been modeled and not tested.

2272
03:18:40,230 --> 03:18:48,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So in this intervening time, we were able to run that again and see that it would, I think it adds like 21 or something units

2273
03:18:50,336 --> 03:19:01,022
[SPEAKER_07]: but that could be possible, but it also made all of the non-public lots buildable rather than unbuildable with the overlay.

2274
03:19:01,702 --> 03:19:02,602
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, great.

2275
03:19:02,963 --> 03:19:03,663
[SPEAKER_38]: That's helpful context.

2276
03:19:03,683 --> 03:19:07,305
[SPEAKER_38]: I was wondering what the offer was on the recommendation.

2277
03:19:07,505 --> 03:19:09,846
[SPEAKER_38]: So I was wondering why there was one to center.

2278
03:19:11,227 --> 03:19:12,127
[SPEAKER_38]: But that's helpful context.

2279
03:19:13,448 --> 03:19:14,649
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't have any further questions.

2280
03:19:14,809 --> 03:19:17,110
[SPEAKER_38]: After questions and comment, I would move to approve

2281
03:19:17,540 --> 03:19:26,745
[SPEAKER_38]: and adopt the recommendations of the Community Development Board, as well as the recommendation to change the lot size from 10,000 to 7,000, if I got it right, square feet.

2282
03:19:28,157 --> 03:19:30,298
[SPEAKER_38]: and I'll hold until discussion is complete.

2283
03:19:30,858 --> 03:19:31,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2284
03:19:31,819 --> 03:19:32,239
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Tseng.

2285
03:19:32,459 --> 03:19:41,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to keep it simple and reiterate how grateful I am for all the work that you guys and Emily has been doing for our city.

2286
03:19:43,164 --> 03:19:51,728
[SPEAKER_17]: We know it's not been easy to work with the state government when it comes to getting the details about how we can be in compliance with the MTA Communities Act.

2287
03:19:52,288 --> 03:20:01,230
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think this solution is something for people in Wellington to be very excited about, for residents of our city to be very excited about.

2288
03:20:01,710 --> 03:20:15,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's some excited chatter about potentially having more commercial or more people in the area, making it more walkable and bringing our attention to the walkability of the area as well, forcing us again into action.

2289
03:20:16,193 --> 03:20:19,834
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to thank you for your hard work on this.

2290
03:20:22,213 --> 03:20:22,694
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Collins.

2291
03:20:23,256 --> 03:20:24,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morell.

2292
03:20:24,499 --> 03:20:25,200
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll echo that.

2293
03:20:26,633 --> 03:20:28,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited to vote on this tonight.

2294
03:20:28,313 --> 03:20:33,115
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate your office and the consultant making yourself so available throughout this entire process.

2295
03:20:33,175 --> 03:20:41,637
[SPEAKER_16]: And to echo what President Morell said, if there's a lack of deep questions and comments tonight, it's because we've had so many opportunities for that in recent months and weeks.

2296
03:20:41,757 --> 03:20:51,939
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the recommendations that came out of the CD board, they affirm what's distinctive and significant about this district, its transit proximity.

2297
03:20:53,059 --> 03:20:56,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Had some really interesting conversations with your department about making sure that this is

2298
03:20:56,600 --> 03:21:14,119
[SPEAKER_16]: dialed in to have the right incentives for like really what we're trying to promote in this district, excited to see what comes out of this and you know for residents who are, you know, further curious about what this means for Wellington and in the greater context of, you know, development and rezoning and Medford, you know, as we talked about the last time

2299
03:21:14,679 --> 03:21:15,339
[SPEAKER_16]: a couple weeks ago.

2300
03:21:16,299 --> 03:21:24,141
[SPEAKER_16]: We still have the opportunity to look at the underlying zoning in the course of our already planned zoning overhaul beginning next year.

2301
03:21:24,721 --> 03:21:30,402
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll continue to talk about Wellington and the conversation of comprehensive rezoning for Medford.

2302
03:21:31,723 --> 03:21:40,544
[SPEAKER_16]: But for today, excited to hit the deadline on this for state compliance and excited to make sure that this works in concert with the rest of our zoning for Medford.

2303
03:21:40,684 --> 03:21:40,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2304
03:21:42,465 --> 03:21:43,085
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further discussion?

2305
03:21:44,881 --> 03:21:48,503
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to echo my fellow bouncers and thank you for your hard work on this.

2306
03:21:49,003 --> 03:21:53,245
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, just not short of just being here at 10.15, 10.30 to take this.

2307
03:21:54,245 --> 03:21:57,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Thankfully, Medford is more amenable than I think some communities have been to receiving this.

2308
03:21:58,167 --> 03:22:00,188
[SPEAKER_26]: So we at least have that going for us.

2309
03:22:00,568 --> 03:22:06,030
[SPEAKER_26]: But I know it's not been easy as the state continues to change and adjust and tweak here.

2310
03:22:06,110 --> 03:22:11,993
[SPEAKER_26]: So I appreciate all the work you've done to be in compliance with this and get us to compliance with it.

2311
03:22:12,073 --> 03:22:14,114
[SPEAKER_24]: So vice versa.

2312
03:22:14,594 --> 03:22:16,995
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to say one thing since we're all here late.

2313
03:22:17,855 --> 03:22:24,718
[SPEAKER_38]: I did talk to someone on the phone today, and they asked me, is there going to be a big controversy tonight?

2314
03:22:25,918 --> 03:22:27,078
[SPEAKER_38]: And I said, about what?

2315
03:22:29,659 --> 03:22:32,820
[SPEAKER_38]: And they said, about the MBT community zoning.

2316
03:22:33,301 --> 03:22:34,861
[SPEAKER_38]: And I said, luckily, I don't think so.

2317
03:22:35,121 --> 03:22:39,903
[SPEAKER_38]: So interesting conversation, but thanks for sticking with me.

2318
03:22:41,253 --> 03:22:42,834
[SPEAKER_26]: So we do have a motion on the floor.

2319
03:22:44,395 --> 03:22:48,978
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a public hearing.

2320
03:22:48,998 --> 03:22:49,759
[SPEAKER_26]: This is still the way we do it.

2321
03:22:49,779 --> 03:22:50,799
[SPEAKER_26]: We haven't figured out a better way yet.

2322
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:53,621
[SPEAKER_26]: But as this is a public hearing, I will open the public hearing.

2323
03:22:55,342 --> 03:22:58,324
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us?

2324
03:23:00,926 --> 03:23:01,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2325
03:23:01,326 --> 03:23:05,329
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anyone on Zoom who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us?

2326
03:23:08,547 --> 03:23:10,489
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

2327
03:23:10,509 --> 03:23:13,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us?

2328
03:23:16,593 --> 03:23:17,534
[SPEAKER_26]: Or on Zoom or in person?

2329
03:23:19,135 --> 03:23:20,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

2330
03:23:21,677 --> 03:23:27,482
[SPEAKER_26]: So going back to the motion for Isis of Paris to approve for first reading?

2331
03:23:28,243 --> 03:23:29,303
[SPEAKER_26]: Or no, this is no, sorry.

2332
03:23:29,363 --> 03:23:31,285
[SPEAKER_26]: To be ordained.

2333
03:23:31,325 --> 03:23:37,570
[SPEAKER_38]: To be ordained with the recommendations of the Community Allotment Board and to change the

2334
03:23:38,951 --> 03:23:42,792
[SPEAKER_38]: the minimum lot size from 10,000 square feet to 7,000 square feet.

2335
03:23:44,673 --> 03:23:48,494
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, as seconded by Councilor Tseng, am I making that up?

2336
03:23:49,714 --> 03:23:50,415
[SPEAKER_26]: Am I making it up, or?

2337
03:23:50,435 --> 03:23:50,695
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2338
03:23:50,775 --> 03:23:55,736
[SPEAKER_43]: It doesn't matter, as long as it's passed.

2339
03:23:55,856 --> 03:23:59,698
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, that's it, oh yeah.

2340
03:23:59,918 --> 03:24:06,500
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, please call the roll when you're ready.

2341
03:24:13,851 --> 03:24:14,051
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2342
03:24:14,872 --> 03:24:15,472
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Collins.

2343
03:24:15,632 --> 03:24:15,852
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2344
03:24:17,053 --> 03:24:17,894
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Nugent's absence.

2345
03:24:19,555 --> 03:24:20,296
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2346
03:24:20,436 --> 03:24:20,636
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2347
03:24:22,617 --> 03:24:23,198
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng.

2348
03:24:23,218 --> 03:24:23,278
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2349
03:24:24,519 --> 03:24:25,059
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Morell.

2350
03:24:25,379 --> 03:24:25,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2351
03:24:25,820 --> 03:24:28,301
[SPEAKER_26]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2352
03:24:28,321 --> 03:24:28,922
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

2353
03:24:28,942 --> 03:24:32,605
[SPEAKER_38]: Why don't we say we have the president read the whole solid waste ordinance just for fun.

2354
03:24:33,085 --> 03:24:33,385
Thank you.

2355
03:24:33,425 --> 03:24:34,086
Thank you so much.

2356
03:24:43,292 --> 03:24:49,574
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember, and I guess we had to, I remember President Falco read 70 pages of the marijuana ordinance.

2357
03:24:50,014 --> 03:24:51,814
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if he had to do that or not, but he did it.

2358
03:24:51,934 --> 03:24:55,355
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, he was like, no, I will not summarize it.

2359
03:24:55,776 --> 03:24:56,316
[SPEAKER_41]: That was awful.

2360
03:24:56,336 --> 03:24:57,096
[SPEAKER_41]: Was that on Zoom?

2361
03:24:57,116 --> 03:24:57,756
[SPEAKER_41]: It was on Zoom.

2362
03:24:57,776 --> 03:25:00,597
[SPEAKER_41]: People may have gotten up and walked away.

2363
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:12,241
[SPEAKER_38]: 131 Fuzzler West.

2364
03:25:12,781 --> 03:25:12,921
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm 625.

2365
03:25:13,201 --> 03:25:17,463
[SPEAKER_38]: Now you know where I live.

2366
03:25:18,624 --> 03:25:19,784
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just on the city website.

2367
03:25:21,005 --> 03:25:21,766
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh.

2368
03:25:21,926 --> 03:25:22,266
[SPEAKER_38]: We're good.

2369
03:25:22,526 --> 03:25:23,146
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, where you live.

2370
03:25:23,386 --> 03:25:23,606
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.

2371
03:25:23,807 --> 03:25:24,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's wave back.

2372
03:25:24,467 --> 03:25:28,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Going to motions, orders, and resolutions.

2373
03:25:28,909 --> 03:25:30,410
[SPEAKER_26]: 22605, offered by Councilor Collins.

2374
03:25:30,630 --> 03:25:30,970
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion.

2375
03:25:30,990 --> 03:25:31,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Chapter 70.

2376
03:25:31,911 --> 03:25:32,991
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll at least read the title.

2377
03:25:33,031 --> 03:25:35,032
[SPEAKER_26]: Chapter 70, Solid Waste.

2378
03:25:35,052 --> 03:25:35,693
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Chapter 70, Solid Waste.

2379
03:25:35,713 --> 03:25:37,674
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have a motion?

2380
03:25:38,314 --> 03:25:39,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so we change the title

2381
03:25:40,282 --> 03:25:44,286
[SPEAKER_21]: to the Council of King Kong's resolution.

2382
03:25:44,386 --> 03:25:48,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Solid waste resolution.

2383
03:25:49,552 --> 03:25:55,378
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have a motion to waive the reading and for a summary from Councilor Collins who did a tremendous amount of work on this.

2384
03:25:55,418 --> 03:25:59,062
[SPEAKER_26]: So motion for vice of affairs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2385
03:25:59,082 --> 03:25:59,662
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2386
03:25:59,682 --> 03:26:00,423
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2387
03:26:00,543 --> 03:26:01,064
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed?

2388
03:26:01,164 --> 03:26:02,065
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2389
03:26:02,225 --> 03:26:02,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Collins.

2390
03:26:03,902 --> 03:26:04,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Roehl.

2391
03:26:06,104 --> 03:26:11,669
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a project that we've been working on in subcommittee since March.

2392
03:26:12,390 --> 03:26:18,756
[SPEAKER_16]: The real seeds of this project were in the Solid Waste Task Force that met for a lot of 2022 under the direction of

2393
03:26:20,503 --> 03:26:43,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Director Hahn and consultants towards the goal of looking at tools available to us to start our next waste hauling contract with best possible deal for the city both in terms of cost effectiveness and in terms of progressing towards our zero waste goals which of course is integral to our overarching sustainability goals and one of the things that came out of that conversation not just recommendations for

2394
03:26:44,514 --> 03:27:02,845
[SPEAKER_16]: our next waste hauling contract was actually to tweak the existing Medford legislation around solid waste in Medford to make sure that we had the legislative foundation to make sure that we could hold our future waste hauler vendor to account in accordance with our sustainability goals.

2395
03:27:04,065 --> 03:27:12,110
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the Subcommittee on Ordinances and Rules, we worked closely with Director Hunt and her department.

2396
03:27:12,930 --> 03:27:13,591
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a couple

2397
03:27:14,179 --> 03:27:22,104
[SPEAKER_16]: main changes that we made, but overall we just took our existing waste hauling ordinance, which was pretty outdated in a lot of ways.

2398
03:27:22,144 --> 03:27:27,867
[SPEAKER_16]: So we made sure that it was updated to align with best practices coming out of the MAS DEP.

2399
03:27:28,308 --> 03:27:30,869
[SPEAKER_16]: And the origins of this document start with their template language.

2400
03:27:31,249 --> 03:27:32,290
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's been thoroughly vetted.

2401
03:27:32,350 --> 03:27:36,112
[SPEAKER_16]: This aligns with what other communities do in terms of waste hauling.

2402
03:27:37,881 --> 03:27:46,809
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the most consequential changes is that there's now a bundled service requirement, which essentially just says, if you offer trash pickup in Medford, you have to also offer recycling.

2403
03:27:46,849 --> 03:27:54,436
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is significant, because that way, vendors that only offer trash pickup cannot undercut vendors that offer both on price.

2404
03:27:54,496 --> 03:28:02,544
[SPEAKER_16]: And this will allow us to recycle the most in Medford in the most cost-effective way, which affects people on the city contract as well as everybody else.

2405
03:28:05,327 --> 03:28:06,287
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the main strokes.

2406
03:28:06,327 --> 03:28:22,332
[SPEAKER_16]: We did work with Director O'Connor from the Board of Health to make sure that this document aligns with current Board of Health regulations for waste haulers because they do, they operate the permitting side to make sure that everything is consistent to make this legible and understandable for generators as well as vendors.

2407
03:28:23,093 --> 03:28:32,135
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have a few last amendments that I'll make from the floor just on the definitions in article one after any further comment or questions from my fellow Councilors.

2408
03:28:33,056 --> 03:28:33,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2409
03:28:35,493 --> 03:28:36,933
[SPEAKER_21]: I disagree with everything.

2410
03:28:36,953 --> 03:28:42,334
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to honestly, I think you've done a great job with this.

2411
03:28:43,334 --> 03:28:45,555
[SPEAKER_21]: As I'm following through, it's very thorough.

2412
03:28:45,575 --> 03:28:51,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel secure that you've done your due diligence and feathering your cap.

2413
03:28:51,556 --> 03:28:53,436
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a big, big contract.

2414
03:28:54,096 --> 03:28:58,017
[SPEAKER_21]: And to see the work that you put into it, I have so much faith in it.

2415
03:28:58,137 --> 03:29:00,017
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate your hard work, Councilor.

2416
03:29:00,597 --> 03:29:00,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2417
03:29:02,198 --> 03:29:03,418
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, to echo Councilor Scarpelli,

2418
03:29:04,656 --> 03:29:05,817
[SPEAKER_26]: for all the work you did for this.

2419
03:29:06,117 --> 03:29:10,742
[SPEAKER_26]: And I reviewed it all and I work with this in my day job.

2420
03:29:10,782 --> 03:29:15,126
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is very much in line with best practices and where everything is going.

2421
03:29:15,166 --> 03:29:19,531
[SPEAKER_26]: So I really appreciate the work and just bringing this into the modern era and our needs for waste these days.

2422
03:29:19,611 --> 03:29:22,374
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's something we definitely make jokes about.

2423
03:29:22,394 --> 03:29:27,479
[SPEAKER_26]: It's easy to make jokes about, but it's one of those parts of the city that doesn't get talked about when it's going right.

2424
03:29:27,579 --> 03:29:28,660
[SPEAKER_26]: The second it goes wrong,

2425
03:29:29,332 --> 03:29:32,875
[SPEAKER_26]: you're hearing from everybody, and it impacts everybody dramatically.

2426
03:29:32,995 --> 03:29:35,217
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is really important work, and I appreciate it.

2427
03:29:38,561 --> 03:29:38,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Amendments?

2428
03:29:39,702 --> 03:29:41,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

2429
03:29:41,183 --> 03:29:45,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you so much for your comments, and to everybody who worked on this with me.

2430
03:29:46,308 --> 03:29:54,996
[SPEAKER_16]: So just quickly, just some quick amendments for Article 1 in general.

2431
03:29:56,731 --> 03:30:08,396
[SPEAKER_16]: This was the last piece that we didn't amend in subcommittee, but I have some amendments that were run past a whole host of department heads, and I have a list if people are interested in seeing.

2432
03:30:09,797 --> 03:30:14,439
[SPEAKER_16]: We just wanted to take section 71, 72, sorry, 70-1, 70-2, and 70-3, put those into contemporary language and

2433
03:30:20,760 --> 03:30:29,349
[SPEAKER_16]: make sure that everybody who ought to be, every department that ought to be mentioned in those sections so that they could be tasked with enforcement would be.

2434
03:30:30,951 --> 03:30:33,594
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can read off those amendments.

2435
03:30:33,654 --> 03:30:37,758
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just a short paragraph each, and I'll also email that language to the city clerk.

2436
03:30:40,861 --> 03:30:42,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'll email it to you.

2437
03:30:42,799 --> 03:30:48,185
[SPEAKER_16]: have the draft queued up but I didn't send it unless there was any controversy about this.

2438
03:30:48,645 --> 03:30:56,393
[SPEAKER_38]: I for one would like to make a stand for the broken boards and the coal ash and the crockery and the cinders.

2439
03:30:56,914 --> 03:30:57,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Who will speak for the cinders?

2440
03:31:14,731 --> 03:31:16,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know who speaks for the cows.

2441
03:31:19,638 --> 03:31:26,327
[SPEAKER_16]: So for Section 70-1, the motion would be to strike the existing and replace with, you should have this in your email inbox,

2442
03:31:27,231 --> 03:31:32,573
[SPEAKER_16]: No private property may become a gathering place for debris, refuse, discarded, or abandoned items or other waste.

2443
03:31:33,073 --> 03:31:44,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Any property owner who has received written notice from the Department of Public Works, Medford Police Department, Code Enforcement Officer, or Medford Board of Health to remove any such material from their property must do so within the timeframe directed.

2444
03:31:46,764 --> 03:31:59,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Second is to take the existing section 70-2 and strike that and replace it with no debris, refuse, discarded items, or other waste, including yard waste and construction debris may be placed or dumped in any public place or public way in the city.

2445
03:32:00,134 --> 03:32:09,522
[SPEAKER_16]: All waste must be properly contained and properly placed for collection on scheduled collection days in accordance with the regulations, schedules, and policies promulgated by the Department of Public Works and Board of Health.

2446
03:32:09,602 --> 03:32:16,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Any person who has been ordered by the Department of Public Works, Medford Police Department, code enforcement officer, Medford Board of Health, or designee thereof

2447
03:32:17,051 --> 03:32:23,893
[SPEAKER_16]: to remove any improperly discarded material or waste from private or public property must do so within the time frame directed.

2448
03:32:24,433 --> 03:32:32,856
[SPEAKER_16]: And then finally, to just strike 70-3 because that information has been subsumed into the proposed 70-1 and 70-2.

2449
03:32:32,916 --> 03:32:36,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2450
03:32:36,797 --> 03:32:37,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Any issue with the amendments?

2451
03:32:37,898 --> 03:32:39,478
[SPEAKER_24]: What color?

2452
03:32:40,399 --> 03:32:40,999
[SPEAKER_24]: What color what?

2453
03:32:41,779 --> 03:32:41,999
[SPEAKER_42]: Black.

2454
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:52,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, so we have a motion, I know, a motion to... Motion to accept.

2455
03:32:53,065 --> 03:32:55,387
[SPEAKER_38]: Motion to approve for first reading with the amendments.

2456
03:32:56,048 --> 03:32:56,588
[SPEAKER_26]: As amended, yeah.

2457
03:32:56,928 --> 03:32:57,449
[SPEAKER_38]: As amended.

2458
03:32:57,989 --> 03:33:03,194
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have a motion from Vice of Affairs to approve for first reading as amended, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2459
03:33:03,694 --> 03:33:05,255
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2460
03:33:16,035 --> 03:33:18,576
[SPEAKER_38]: It's going to take a while, so I want the whole thing read.

2461
03:33:20,556 --> 03:33:23,477
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to remind us, even with this meeting, it's only 11 o'clock.

2462
03:33:23,497 --> 03:33:26,217
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Pierce?

2463
03:33:26,717 --> 03:33:26,997
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2464
03:33:27,818 --> 03:33:28,398
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Caraviello?

2465
03:33:28,458 --> 03:33:28,678
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2466
03:33:29,058 --> 03:33:29,678
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Collins?

2467
03:33:29,698 --> 03:33:29,938
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2468
03:33:30,438 --> 03:33:31,038
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lanzano?

2469
03:33:31,058 --> 03:33:31,258
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2470
03:33:31,438 --> 03:33:32,158
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2471
03:33:32,298 --> 03:33:32,559
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

2472
03:33:32,579 --> 03:33:33,759
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Sands?

2473
03:33:33,819 --> 03:33:33,919
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2474
03:33:34,339 --> 03:33:34,879
[SPEAKER_41]: President Morales?

2475
03:33:35,219 --> 03:33:35,419
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2476
03:33:35,519 --> 03:33:38,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

2477
03:33:42,261 --> 03:33:43,941
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always a good day to be tremendous.

2478
03:33:44,932 --> 03:33:45,892
[SPEAKER_20]: That's terrible now.

2479
03:33:46,573 --> 03:33:50,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Your new nickname for this council.

2480
03:33:51,954 --> 03:33:53,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Trash Collins.

2481
03:33:54,595 --> 03:33:55,615
[SPEAKER_20]: Trashy Collins.

2482
03:33:55,635 --> 03:33:57,736
[SPEAKER_20]: That'll go over well with the population.

2483
03:33:58,456 --> 03:33:59,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Council Scarpelli's at it again.

2484
03:33:59,777 --> 03:34:01,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Good old Trashy Collins.

2485
03:34:03,218 --> 03:34:06,519
[SPEAKER_38]: Half of us will think it's endearing, and the other half will think it's accurate, right?

2486
03:34:06,979 --> 03:34:08,039
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, yeah.

2487
03:34:11,257 --> 03:34:14,079
[SPEAKER_26]: Tell your great kids how you became one of those trashy Collins.

2488
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:20,005
[SPEAKER_38]: Trash Collins, waste of time fairs.

2489
03:34:24,388 --> 03:34:25,509
[SPEAKER_38]: Another one for my page 13.

2490
03:34:26,270 --> 03:34:28,932
[SPEAKER_38]: Another word for my list.

2491
03:34:29,793 --> 03:34:30,994
[SPEAKER_26]: 23465 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

2492
03:34:31,435 --> 03:34:35,358
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council call for a meeting to resolve public safety concerns from

2493
03:34:35,888 --> 03:34:38,149
[SPEAKER_26]: malfunctioning streetlights on South Porter Road and beyond.

2494
03:34:38,169 --> 03:34:45,853
[SPEAKER_26]: If you have further resolve, the superintendent of WIRE, Steven Randazzo, a representative from the administration and a representative from National Grid to be invited to that meeting.

2495
03:34:46,074 --> 03:34:46,914
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

2496
03:34:47,454 --> 03:34:50,156
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a problem that's going on for years.

2497
03:34:50,256 --> 03:34:55,459
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know we've heard from the state delegates that said that there are issues that are going on.

2498
03:34:55,479 --> 03:34:56,819
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that Rick's worked on it.

2499
03:34:56,859 --> 03:34:57,240
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that

2500
03:34:58,775 --> 03:35:09,382
[SPEAKER_21]: And what I'm hearing from all these sides is that there's different entities, there's the state, there's the electrical utility company, there's the private entity, there's the city.

2501
03:35:09,863 --> 03:35:20,110
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to get everybody in a room and realize before somebody gets killed and then everybody's gonna be pointing their fingers at everybody else, we need to get everybody in a room for this meeting and find a resolution.

2502
03:35:20,130 --> 03:35:26,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they say the simplest thing is meeting with the neighbors and taking up the pavers so they can make the changes.

2503
03:35:26,574 --> 03:35:44,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if the neighbor doesn't want that because they're afraid it's not going to be replaced the proper way, let's find a resolution to make this happen so we're not sitting here and talking about a horrific accident or a jogger or a bike rider that's going down South Border Road that gets killed.

2504
03:35:44,584 --> 03:35:54,310
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think it's important that through public safety we call for this emergency meeting to make sure all the parties are in a room because I think everybody's working their tail off, but

2505
03:35:54,830 --> 03:35:56,451
[SPEAKER_21]: They're all doing their own thing.

2506
03:35:56,471 --> 03:35:58,452
[SPEAKER_21]: No one's sitting together and saying, let's do that.

2507
03:35:58,472 --> 03:36:01,213
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why I bring this forward tonight, Madam President.

2508
03:36:02,634 --> 03:36:03,675
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Madam President.

2509
03:36:03,695 --> 03:36:05,435
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for bringing this forward.

2510
03:36:07,116 --> 03:36:11,417
[SPEAKER_38]: I drive through there pretty regularly, and it's just not good at night.

2511
03:36:12,498 --> 03:36:16,499
[SPEAKER_38]: Probably six, seven, eight months ago, I worked with Director Hunt to contact DCR.

2512
03:36:17,079 --> 03:36:25,322
[SPEAKER_38]: I actually saw Commissioner Arrigo at the Clippership Connector, and Councilor Tseng and I talked to him, and I brought this specific issue up, and I completely agree with you.

2513
03:36:25,342 --> 03:36:30,124
[SPEAKER_38]: And I talked to Mr. Randazzo, I talked to Steve about it, and he's like, I've been talking about this for two and a half years.

2514
03:36:30,784 --> 03:36:31,985
[SPEAKER_38]: And so I completely agree with you.

2515
03:36:32,005 --> 03:36:33,125
[SPEAKER_38]: I think if we can get everyone in the room,

2516
03:36:33,755 --> 03:36:37,820
[SPEAKER_38]: I know Representative Donato was on an email chain that he would be trying to do that.

2517
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:45,649
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe this could be the meeting that he tries to work through his office to invite the state agency and the neighbor and everybody in.

2518
03:36:46,230 --> 03:36:46,810
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

2519
03:36:47,311 --> 03:36:49,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mayor President.

2520
03:36:49,874 --> 03:36:51,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I've worked on this for almost two years.

2521
03:36:53,800 --> 03:36:58,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Dickie Peter is the head of the Fells, and he's explained to me what the process is.

2522
03:36:58,725 --> 03:37:01,808
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a relay in the grounds, right in front of those houses there.

2523
03:37:02,729 --> 03:37:10,596
[SPEAKER_18]: And all those houses have got the nice pavers there, and nobody wants their pavers ripped up, because who's gonna put the pavers back?

2524
03:37:11,616 --> 03:37:12,877
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really the big issue.

2525
03:37:13,497 --> 03:37:15,798
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's a relay that's in the ground.

2526
03:37:17,039 --> 03:37:19,860
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in front of one of those houses, but that whole section has to be ripped up.

2527
03:37:20,460 --> 03:37:27,784
[SPEAKER_18]: And until the neighbors get together and agree to get the driveways ripped up, it's not going to move anywhere.

2528
03:37:28,924 --> 03:37:30,765
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I can, I think that that's important.

2529
03:37:30,865 --> 03:37:35,747
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't want anybody to touch our pavers unless we have a commitment by the

2530
03:37:37,492 --> 03:37:48,355
[SPEAKER_21]: the public entities that are all involved to say, hey, listen, this is what we'll do to make sure at your discretion with your contractor, making sure that everything gets put back the right way.

2531
03:37:49,275 --> 03:37:59,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's the only thing that's fair, because I think what's happening is, it's dogs chasing his tail until somebody gets seriously hurt, and then all of a sudden we're sitting there saying, all it was is just moving some pavers.

2532
03:38:00,138 --> 03:38:02,839
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think having everybody in the room is important.

2533
03:38:02,859 --> 03:38:05,780
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that if Mr. Vita's, we should invite him too.

2534
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:10,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we should get him involved as well, so he's familiar with that, so thank you.

2535
03:38:11,802 --> 03:38:20,365
[SPEAKER_38]: I know this is for the meeting that we're talking about, but to be honest, if the issue is we can't get the papers up to get the stuff in, take the bulbs out of the lights.

2536
03:38:20,665 --> 03:38:25,767
[SPEAKER_38]: I think you might actually be better off with no light than with the blinking, and it's really disruptive.

2537
03:38:36,069 --> 03:38:36,309
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.

2538
03:38:37,370 --> 03:38:42,114
[SPEAKER_26]: So the motion is to continue working with Rep Donato's office to schedule this, or what's the thought there?

2539
03:38:42,134 --> 03:38:43,735
[SPEAKER_38]: You can refer it to subcommittee on public works.

2540
03:38:43,755 --> 03:38:50,821
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, if we can do that and call for the meeting with the subcommittee on public works and ask for it, invite all of those parties.

2541
03:38:50,941 --> 03:38:53,584
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, ask them.

2542
03:38:54,424 --> 03:38:55,265
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

2543
03:38:55,926 --> 03:38:59,509
[SPEAKER_35]: Specifically ask Representative Donato to get the state to show up to the meeting.

2544
03:39:00,626 --> 03:39:01,387
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you.

2545
03:39:01,547 --> 03:39:05,051
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice Mayor Bears.

2546
03:39:06,192 --> 03:39:06,892
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2547
03:39:06,913 --> 03:39:07,253
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2548
03:39:07,613 --> 03:39:08,294
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

2549
03:39:08,594 --> 03:39:09,075
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion adjourned.

2550
03:39:09,095 --> 03:39:09,495
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2551
03:39:09,916 --> 03:39:12,318
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion of Councilor Scarpelli adjourned.

2552
03:39:12,358 --> 03:39:13,179
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion, third reading.

2553
03:39:20,771 --> 03:39:21,772
[SPEAKER_38]: Unlimited terms.

2554
03:39:22,233 --> 03:39:22,694
[SPEAKER_38]: All right.

2555
03:39:22,934 --> 03:39:23,314
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

2556
03:39:23,334 --> 03:39:28,301
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpell, I'd like to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2557
03:39:28,341 --> 03:39:29,002
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2558
03:39:29,502 --> 03:39:30,063
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

2559
03:39:30,083 --> 03:39:31,225
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
