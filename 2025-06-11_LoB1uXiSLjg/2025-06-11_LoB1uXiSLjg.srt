00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:35,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings, a show far and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:46,103
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:53,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, we want to welcome our guest, attorney Nick Jaleo, to Medford Happenings.

5
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:53,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Nick.

6
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:55,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to have you on the show.

7
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:56,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, John.

8
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:57,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me here.

9
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:08,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So first and foremost, I want to thank Nick on his announcement that he is a candidate for our Method City Council.

10
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:16,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no doubt that he will do an outstanding job for our city.

11
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get right into the questions.

12
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Nick, we're going to start off.

13
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:28,201
[SPEAKER_01]: By giving us, can you give us some background information?

14
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:30,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is Nick Jaleo?

15
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:31,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

16
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:35,808
[SPEAKER_00]: So, John, I was, I've lived my whole life in Medford.

17
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:41,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up here from a hardworking family, Italian-American family.

18
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:43,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through the Medford public schools.

19
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:48,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended the Brooks for elementary, then the McGlynn for middle, and then I went to Medford High.

20
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,403
[SPEAKER_00]: At Medford High, I really focused on academics, so I studied hard.

21
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:57,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate enough to graduate number one in my class.

22
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:03,531
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I decided I would go on to college, so I attended Tufts University.

23
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:07,795
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was at Tufts, I studied history and I studied international relations.

24
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did a minor in Italian.

25
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Graduated from Tufts, magna cum laude.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,785
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went on to attend law school at Boston College Law.

27
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:22,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And there I had really excellent professors and a really great course of study.

28
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:26,421
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it was focused on municipal law and zoning and land use.

29
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had some clinical experience, too.

30
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:33,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a while as a prosecutor with the Malden District Court.

31
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:38,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I graduated from law school, and I took the bar exam.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed on the first go, and I became a lawyer.

33
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially what I do today.

34
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:46,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked in criminal law a little bit.

35
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:49,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a law office in Medford Square for a while.

36
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm with a law firm in downtown Boston on State Street.

37
00:02:54,387 --> 00:03:04,851
[SPEAKER_00]: It does primarily medical malpractice in court all the time defending rather prosecuting cases for people who are injured by doctors.

38
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.

39
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Great background.

40
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:12,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly qualified, I would say, so that's that's always a good thing.

41
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:15,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, great background.

42
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:29,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I guess a lot of people would wonder why is Nick running for Medford City Council and, you know, what reasons are making you want to run for the job?

43
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:30,945
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.

44
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:39,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the people who are considering voting for me, they should get an explanation for that because I think it's important to understand why somebody is running for elected office.

45
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:46,096
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to summarize it in a few words, but to say it in a few words, or at least attempt to, I would say it's because I really do care about Medford.

46
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Medford.

47
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived here my whole life.

48
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:51,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to do, I think, what's best for Medford.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really just passionate about this community, and I feel like it has so much potential.

50
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of it is untapped potential, so potential we could actualize.

51
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:02,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big part of it.

52
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I've just been unhappy, I would say, with the way things have been going with city leadership.

53
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we could be doing better.

54
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:15,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I might have the qualifications to improve what's been going on in our city.

55
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:41,077
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifications primarily I'd say for my education just the fact that I've done a lot of school and I'm a lawyer and I think being a member of any sort of elected body you need to have kind of skills like that that a lawyer might have so I'd say all of that overall has kind of motivated me to run and for me it's very important you know it's easy to complain and say I don't like the way things are going but then we complain we don't take action.

56
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,138
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

57
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:47,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I said to myself, it's time to stop complaining and time to do something about that.

58
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm throwing my hat in.

59
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:53,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that happens a lot, a lot of complaining.

60
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:57,068
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to offer solutions too.

61
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so, you know,

62
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:08,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself personally, I think there's a lot of issues right now, major issues concerning Method.

63
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:14,865
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you consider major issues right now regarding the city of Medford?

64
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,347
[SPEAKER_01]: What are things that you see?

65
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what you said at the beginning, that there are a lot of issues.

66
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:27,271
[SPEAKER_00]: We could sit here all day and talk, but obviously we can't do that, so let's just talk about, I think, what are the major issues, just like you asked.

67
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:33,093
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I would say that the number one issue is probably affordability at the moment.

68
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:38,518
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing on the national level just an issue of cost of living.

69
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,820
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just becoming very expensive to live anywhere.

70
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:49,028
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially in suburban communities near big successful cities like Medford, it's just becoming really expensive to live in Medford.

71
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are various reasons why that's the case.

72
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:56,155
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I want to do something about the situation with

73
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,957
[SPEAKER_00]: affordability in our city.

74
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:05,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people are very worried and concerned, you know, how am I going to afford to stay in the home that I've lived in, you know, or my family's lived in, you know, for all our lives.

75
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:07,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do about that?

76
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:10,051
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make this city an affordable place to live?

77
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:17,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the next issue in terms of importance would probably be, and I think it's related to affordability, but economic growth.

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,266
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a Medford, I think, that's stagnating a bit when it comes to economic development.

79
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this is something I want to address.

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,493
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to make our city more prosperous?

81
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:35,278
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to make our city wealthier and a wealth that everybody can have a part in?

82
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:39,640
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do to bring businesses to Medford, for example?

83
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,581
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to promote growth?

84
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that's something I would be able to address if I were elected.

85
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:51,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, just maybe as a third one, just to kind of wrap up, what are the major issues here?

86
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably say it's transparency.

87
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're seeing a significant problem with that currently.

88
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people feel left out.

89
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:03,195
[SPEAKER_00]: People feel like they don't understand what's happening at City Hall.

90
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,538
[SPEAKER_00]: People feel worried about this, concerned, maybe angry, upset.

91
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like information has been hard to get in a lot of circumstances.

92
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,624
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think transparency needs to be addressed.

93
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:17,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need a Councilor who is going to address that.

94
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.

95
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, good answer.

96
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:32,643
[SPEAKER_01]: The transparency, especially, I just feel like a lot of people feel like they're being left out.

97
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you.

98
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you go to City Hall.

99
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:38,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of people go up there and speak.

100
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seems like no one's paying attention.

101
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,635
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's listening.

102
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:52,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think transparency is something that's really key.

103
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you for that answer.

104
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:58,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another good one for you.

105
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,147
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had the ballot questions.

106
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:04,969
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how did you feel about that?

107
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:09,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what was your position on the overrides?

108
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, plain and simple.

109
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,232
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you feel?

110
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,252
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you feel about it?

111
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:13,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

112
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:26,678
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone who's following my speeches at city council or maybe read my op-ed in the Tufts Daily, it's no secret that I was very opposed to all three ballot questions that we were presented with in November.

113
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really kind of

114
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,417
[SPEAKER_00]: made it a point to be outspoken about that because I was deeply concerned about what I was seeing.

115
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,800
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone maybe not familiar, I'll just briefly recap them.

116
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,421
[SPEAKER_00]: There were three.

117
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,085
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was $3.5 million for schools and DPW.

118
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,068
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an override proposition, two and a half override.

119
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:51,253
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a state law that allows taxes to be raised over a certain cap.

120
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,075
[SPEAKER_00]: in a given fiscal year.

121
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:59,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Question 7 was a $4 million one for schools, and then question 8 was slightly different.

122
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:05,461
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called a debt exclusion, essentially a bond, $30 million for a new fire station.

123
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:10,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were the three questions Medford voters had to decide upon for the next election.

124
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,566
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why I was opposed, I had various reasons.

125
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,628
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important, I think, was just the burden this would have on residents.

126
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:23,151
[SPEAKER_00]: This would essentially be a massive tax hike that would really hurt people who are already struggling.

127
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about affordability at the beginning.

128
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:31,316
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, I think, a major contributor to the affordability problems we're seeing today.

129
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:35,558
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of any time we have a problem in the city, let's just raise taxes.

130
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,500
[SPEAKER_00]: That more money thrown at a problem fixes it.

131
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,101
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think there's misperceptions about that.

132
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:46,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tax impact was a big part of my opposition.

133
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:57,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think there was a lot of kind of fear mongering that came behind putting these questions forward, what I call maybe scare tactics, that I don't think was supported by data at all.

134
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a specific example of that.

135
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:02,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was talk of, you know, teacher salaries, for example.

136
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:12,950
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, oh, you know, our teacher salaries won't be competitive, but according to the Department of Education data, Medford salaries for teachers are competitive compared to elsewhere in the state.

137
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is data anyone can look up.

138
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:21,552
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also just a vagueness, too, you know, in terms of what is this money going to be used for specifically.

139
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:23,933
[SPEAKER_00]: We got general categories, like schools, DPW.

140
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:25,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

141
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:29,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire station, but specifically, you know, where was this money going to go?

142
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:38,542
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, I think for voters, you know, they should be entitled to know line item, in a line item manner, where money is going to go, specifically.

143
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:42,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that it was vague, you know, was another reason I felt like I couldn't support.

144
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:46,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing that just cannot be passed aside is just the free cash.

145
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:47,908
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have.

146
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:48,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

147
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:49,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit.

148
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:50,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit.

149
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,450
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone up since the election.

150
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

151
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:53,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny how that happened.

152
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:57,974
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, we had about $25 million, according to the Department of Revenue.

153
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,555
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, that's since gone up.

154
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone who doesn't know what free cash is, obviously, it's not free.

155
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,898
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come from taxpayers.

156
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:13,382
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's essentially over-budgeted money in a given fiscal year that goes into a reserve fund that we're able to use for a broader range of purposes once it's certified.

157
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:23,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So we heard a lot of talk during the override campaign, oh, we can't use free cash to meet, for example, school expenses.

158
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,443
[SPEAKER_00]: But what did I see at a recent city council meeting?

159
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:32,828
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor requested $5 million to repair deficient HVAC and the roofs at the middle schools.

160
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So $5 million that could have been used and is going to be used to

161
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:38,452
[SPEAKER_00]: net fund that.

162
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:38,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

163
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:39,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

164
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:44,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was that same day there was another request for $200,000 for security upgrades across the school.

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,426
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really was misleading for people to say that free cash was just off the table completely.

166
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:50,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

167
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:50,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.

168
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:51,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

169
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:59,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just kind of to wrap this up, I would say growth, right, was another alternative to raising taxes, right?

170
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:04,722
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're increasing the commercial tax base, for example, we're getting more revenue, right?

171
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,144
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use that to meet funding shortages.

172
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:10,547
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ignored new growth as well as an alternative.

173
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:14,691
[SPEAKER_00]: to the overrides.

174
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,714
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think also just of the diversity of our city, economic diversity of our city.

175
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,455
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when taxes go up?

176
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:23,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it drives out lower income people.

177
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:24,859
[SPEAKER_00]: It essentially gentrifies the city.

178
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:31,203
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're concerned about gentrification, supporting tax hikes doesn't solve that problem.

179
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to think of that.

180
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:37,570
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think of how lower-income, middle-income people are going to be affected by tax hikes.

181
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially people on fixed incomes, too.

182
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:45,038
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think of seniors who are really struggling and barely getting by in a lot of circumstances.

183
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,719
[SPEAKER_00]: People with disabilities, as well.

184
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Most affected.

185
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:49,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are the people

186
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:51,904
[SPEAKER_01]: that are most affected by that.

187
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:55,985
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, zoning, zoning, zoning, zoning, zoning.

188
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,166
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much going on with the zoning.

189
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:04,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we could probably, I know you could discuss that subject for hours, but we don't have hours.

190
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:11,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to sort of be more specific on it.

191
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,122
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all hearing about Medford Square now.

192
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,984
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're hearing Salem Street, South Medford, West Medford.

193
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,386
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there's a lot going on.

194
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Another situation, I don't think people are being heard.

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,273
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's your opinion?

196
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how do you feel about Medford Square?

197
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,617
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are the plans?

198
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,360
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see happening with that?

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,341
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about it?

200
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,081
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion?

201
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so another great question.

202
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:45,299
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back to what I said again earlier, this idea of untapped potential.

203
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford is a city that could be much better in a lot of ways.

204
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:52,842
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great now in a lot of respects, but there's so much more we could be doing.

205
00:13:53,462 --> 00:14:14,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone not familiar, recently it was announced that there will be a very big development project coming to Medford Square, essentially three city-owned lots that are going to be transformed, a combination of mixed-use retail and residential, and nobody's denying this is going to fundamentally transform the square in terms of the way it looks, in terms of the way it's structured, who's living there, who's doing business there.

206
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:26,054
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'd say it's quite early, this proposal was only announced very recently, so I think I would need more information to form a definite opinion yet on where I stand on the proposal itself.

207
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:26,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

208
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:38,422
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I talk about maybe the questions I have regarding that proposal, I'll first say I think it's super important that we all dial in on the need to revitalize Medford Square.

209
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:43,625
[SPEAKER_00]: As a guy who's studied a lot of history, Medford Square in the past used to be a very different place.

210
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:46,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking like 100 years ago, and it was.

211
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:47,666
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're not.

212
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:50,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But in decades past, it was a very different place.

213
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:55,768
[SPEAKER_00]: It was much more livelier and more of a kind of gathering spot for the people of our city.

214
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:58,789
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's in very rough shape in a lot of respects.

215
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been improvements, but not enough.

216
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to look also, I always say this to people, you have to look at our neighboring squares and compare them to Medford Square.

217
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of Davis Square, for example.

218
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Square in Cambridge.

219
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard Square in Cambridge.

220
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:13,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Kendall.

221
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:14,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on and on.

222
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can.

223
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:15,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of these.

224
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,811
[SPEAKER_00]: resemble Medford Square?

225
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,091
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

226
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,533
[SPEAKER_00]: These squares, you have a lot of traffic, a lot of activity.

227
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:22,694
[SPEAKER_00]: They're booming in a lot of respects.

228
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:35,983
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you look at Medford Square, where I know people who live the next town over, you know, who move here from other places, and don't even know there's such a thing as Medford Square, you know, because there's so few reasons in a lot of respects to go, because it's difficult to park.

229
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:37,844
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic is horrendous sometimes.

230
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do to support our local businesses there?

231
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,589
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome, they're great, I love spending my money there.

232
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather spend my money there than at the big brand name shops.

233
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:47,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

234
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,214
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to improve them, right?

235
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring traffic to them, business to them.

236
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,539
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, like I said, it's the parking and the traffic.

237
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lack of access by public transit's also an issue too.

238
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:00,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yep.

239
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:02,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I think there's just bus routes at the moment, right?

240
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:02,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

241
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,706
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the other ways we can get people to the square?

242
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:07,688
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I guess just turning to the proposal itself,

243
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:16,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I think it's still early to form a conclusive opinion on it, but there are questions that I have, and I'm just going to go through a few of them that I have.

244
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:21,381
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, referring to the business here, how will this proposal affect the businesses that are already there?

245
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:22,882
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about.

246
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:24,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking, of course.

247
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:26,825
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have to be thinking about parking with any project.

248
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,727
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't ignore parking, period.

249
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another important thing is, you know, if you look at the map, where is this going to be?

250
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,994
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be right next to the senior center in Medford Square, right?

251
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,615
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is this going to impact the senior center?

252
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to pose any safety concerns, for example?

253
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Accessibility concerns to the senior center?

254
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:50,883
[SPEAKER_00]: So seniors who regularly frequent the senior center, they're major stakeholders in this.

255
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:51,984
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to talk to them.

256
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,806
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure their opinions are heard on this project.

257
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we just have to think, you know, how will it look?

258
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the aesthetic impact, right?

259
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:08,960
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to think about how old these buildings are in Medford Square, you know, with this big, new, modern, towering structure, you know, fit with the buildings that are already there.

260
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:13,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, when it comes to looks, we tend to put that lower in our list of priorities, but it's still something to think about.

261
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our community to be beautiful, too.

262
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,093
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the questions I have.

263
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:23,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, my suggestion to the people who are involved with this would be not to rush this process.

264
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to slow down and we need to get adequate community input.

265
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:34,695
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we need to do is not just take community input, but actually actively change our plans based on what people have to say.

266
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:39,072
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was going to be part of my next question.

267
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:40,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned it earlier.

268
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:41,495
[SPEAKER_01]: You just mentioned it again.

269
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:45,240
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't tell you how many people I know.

270
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do know a lot of people.

271
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:50,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here most of my life.

272
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,831
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have concerns.

273
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:58,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just feel like they're not, they're just not being addressed.

274
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,234
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they feel.

275
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,695
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the perception out there.

276
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:09,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what can you do or is there anything, is there a way or how do you feel about that?

277
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, addressing people's concerns like they don't feel like they're being heard.

278
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:32,882
[SPEAKER_00]: any solutions any anything you can offer for that absolutely and like i said at the beginning this is a major aspect of my campaign here is i want to prove transparency in our city okay and i'd say i've included among these people who do feel left out in a lot of ways i think it's something many of us share

279
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:46,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I think we're seeing a lot of ways to try to reduce the ability of the public to participate, right, for the purposes of, I guess you could call it expediency, trying to rush things through and promote an agenda.

280
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:53,971
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to look at the ways, number one, in which public participation was being reduced.

281
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:57,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can give you some very specific examples of that.

282
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:58,614
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a resolution

283
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:20,181
[SPEAKER_00]: uh... last year to reduce the amount of time by several minutes in which people can participate in public comment at city council meetings uh... this is terrible right because it we're now in a position where people go up and they have to rush and say everything they have to say i think it's currently three minutes very very fast they often forget things and

284
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:28,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's pressure from the president of the council to immediately wrap up once that three minutes is reached.

285
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,790
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like he says, oh, you can have a little more time.

286
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, that's what's happening.

287
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:37,174
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing also just the meetings, how late that they're going.

288
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:39,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are going far past midnight.

289
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think of people who have to work the next day.

290
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have to go to school or take care of children.

291
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,663
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different reasons.

292
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,925
[SPEAKER_00]: why, you know, a meeting running really late is not a good thing.

293
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have to look at ways we can try to make it so we don't have that problem.

294
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:08,152
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also seeing some kind of procedural sneakiness, too, with, for example, sticking controversial things at the very end of the agenda so that we don't get to them until midnight.

295
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a resolution against anti-Semitism before the council recently.

296
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,798
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get to that until very, very late in the evening.

297
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:21,201
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's such a huge community issue, you know, it's something, why are we not considering that?

298
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:24,683
[SPEAKER_00]: In any event, it was tabled, so no one had a chance to say anything about it.

299
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,204
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that, yeah.

300
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:40,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember also a recent meeting in which we were talking about the charter and the charter was on the agenda along with other things that merited time but weren't as pressing as getting the charter to Beacon Hill.

301
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ended up happening was one of the Councilors

302
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:49,331
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to take it out of order and didn't even receive a second to do that.

303
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:50,692
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just horrendous.

304
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:54,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if anyone doesn't know what that means, like a second, you're not saying you approve.

305
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,397
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just saying, you know, I'm willing to have the discussion on this now.

306
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:00,599
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wouldn't even do that.

307
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,121
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just horrendous, in my opinion.

308
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:07,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And then immediately after that, someone else proposed a motion to take something else out of order.

309
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, a motion.

310
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,429
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was approved without question.

311
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:17,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just insane, a lot of the things that have been happening.

312
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:18,895
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I want to do things.

313
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:26,701
[SPEAKER_00]: like change the rules to allow the public more opportunities to participate and do something about these like midnight, 1 a.m.

314
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,582
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings.

315
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:32,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should have a chance to come to these meetings and say what they think.

316
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,309
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't have to wait hours and hours and hours to talk for three minutes.

317
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:37,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not right.

318
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,553
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all truth and it all makes sense.

319
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be a little redundant here.

320
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:57,593
[SPEAKER_01]: know, your knowledge, your experience, and I think your approach, you know, what you could bring to the city council, it's very valuable.

321
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:58,234
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow,

322
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:05,878
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you bring this to the city council, and how do you deliver better outcomes?

323
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:10,321
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you definitely have everything it takes.

324
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,202
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you deliver it, you know?

325
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,784
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the question, I would say.

326
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:18,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy to make promises, the hardest part is delivering on them.

327
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,776
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I'm thinking about now.

328
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:25,821
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I'm fortunate enough to get elected, it's something I should be thinking about from day one.

329
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,643
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going to make these things I want to change happen?

330
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:33,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I think the most important facet of it is listening.

331
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:34,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to residents.

332
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:36,810
[SPEAKER_00]: What are residents thinking and feeling?

333
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just pushing them to the side.

334
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:42,515
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have our opinions and beliefs, and we should definitely stick to our principles.

335
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:43,976
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time,

336
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:51,603
[SPEAKER_00]: As an elected leader, we're not, there's some who say, you know, you're elected to make decisions, and that's not false.

337
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:57,749
[SPEAKER_00]: But as an elected representative, you are an agent of the people who vote you in.

338
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,153
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think of as being a lawyer, I mean, what's my job is to represent a client.

339
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:07,518
[SPEAKER_00]: My judgment's entrusted to make decisions for the client, especially legal decisions where there's a knowledge gap.

340
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,800
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I'm working for the client.

341
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,461
[SPEAKER_00]: The client isn't working for me.

342
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:16,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing is true with, I think, being elected representative is you have to do what the people want.

343
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:20,764
[SPEAKER_00]: So listening is a big part of making things happen.

344
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, just common things like hard work, for example.

345
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,787
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires hard work and not laziness.

346
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:35,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Prudence, you know, being smart and listening and learning, teaching, and it's always good to admit when you don't know something.

347
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:35,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

348
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the homework and research, right?

349
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:44,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of, I think, elected leaders, not just in Medford, but everywhere, who say, you know, I know what to do, right?

350
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,445
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they kind of jump to conclusions about things, and they don't take a step back and say, well, maybe I should reevaluate my own perspective.

351
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:52,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's wrong in certain respects.

352
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,568
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to make it better?

353
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:55,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

354
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:57,739
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, you've got to represent all the people.

355
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:58,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

356
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,061
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to do your best to represent all.

357
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,425
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to make everyone happy, but you've got to represent them all, you know.

358
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,269
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now we're going to get down to our last question.

359
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm going to ask you this.

360
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:18,017
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone wants to get in touch with Nick Gileo,

361
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,452
[SPEAKER_01]: How would they go about, how do they do it?

362
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:22,994
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they get in touch with you, Nick?

363
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would they, where do you go, where do you?

364
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:29,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think there's kind of two ways to talk about it.

365
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is like, literally, how do you get in touch with me, right?

366
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here in Medford, obviously, I like to go to events.

367
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:37,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some social media pages for the campaigns.

368
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:40,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Facebook, Nick Trelaya from Medford City Council.

369
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have an Instagram.

370
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:50,319
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been posting regularly about what I've been doing and who I've been talking to on social media.

371
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:53,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have social media, feel free to take a look.

372
00:24:55,222 --> 00:25:03,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, anyone who wants to just talk with me, feel free to just find me, reach out to me, give me a call, send me a text, ask to meet for coffee.

373
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:04,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy, honestly.

374
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:10,610
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, busy guy between what I do for a living and campaign activities, but I'm going to make time for everybody.

375
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Even people who don't agree with me, I encourage us to have conversations, right?

376
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:16,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk.

377
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:20,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to iron out, you know, what we don't agree upon.

378
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:21,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's how it works.

379
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,333
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get things done is you cooperate.

380
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:28,154
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of just the other kind of aspect of your question, I'd say is, you know, where can you find me?

381
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do I like to do in Medford?

382
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:33,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Medford, I honestly do, and that's why I'm running.

383
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one place you'd probably find me is probably the library, right?

384
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:46,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Medford Public Library, all the services it provides, just the space it offers for people who are interested in learning, and I'm a guy who just loves to learn, I love to read.

385
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:57,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to go there a lot, hang out in the local history room, look at the yearbooks, look at the old historical documents, and just learn about Medford and how great a city it is.

386
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Also love being outdoors, enjoying the many beautiful things that Medford has to offer, like the Fells, Brooks Estate, Mystic Lakes, Mystic River.

387
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:07,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Always like being outdoors.

388
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,542
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go on a hike with me?

389
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:09,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free.

390
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:10,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go on a hike.

391
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk politics and hike.

392
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:13,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just enjoy the beauty of nature.

393
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be interesting.

394
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hear you.

395
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:20,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can't not say also, I just love going to Medford businesses as well.

396
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:25,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to the Square, having lunch there, brunch, wherever it is in Medford.

397
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Just love spending my money in my hometown.

398
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:30,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.

399
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:37,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of, Medford Square especially, actually the whole city, but Medford Square, I mean, there's a lot of great restaurants.

400
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,402
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, I mean, there's a lot of good food.

401
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:42,663
[SPEAKER_01]: We know how to eat.

402
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:43,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.

403
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:44,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to eat in this city.

404
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're Italians, of course we do.

405
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:50,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in this city, regardless of ethnic background, we know how to eat in Medford.

406
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,950
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, we do.

407
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

408
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:57,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, I want to thank you, Nick.

409
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:02,536
[SPEAKER_01]: for joining us on Method Happenings.

410
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:07,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you for being a candidate.

411
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:19,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's so important to have people like you run for council, school committee, whatever the position is.

412
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:22,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good thing for Method.

413
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you.

414
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And I enjoyed the show.

415
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:30,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoyed it.

416
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you're going to come back and join us again.

417
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:32,988
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

418
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:34,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me here.

419
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:35,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it was our pleasure.

420
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:37,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank everyone.

421
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a minute.

422
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank everyone who has been watching the show.

423
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,653
