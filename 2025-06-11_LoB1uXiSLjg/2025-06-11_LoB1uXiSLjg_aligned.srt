00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:35,881
Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings, a show far and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,321
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:46,103
The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:53,204
And today, we want to welcome our guest, attorney Nick Jaleo, to Medford Happenings.

5
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:53,964
Welcome, Nick.

6
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:55,705
Glad to have you on the show.

7
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:56,505
Hi, John.

8
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:57,405
Thanks for having me here.

9
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:08,517
So first and foremost, I want to thank Nick on his announcement that he is a candidate for our Method City Council.

10
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:16,684
And I have no doubt that he will do an outstanding job for our city.

11
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,667
So we'll get right into the questions.

12
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,970
Okay, Nick, we're going to start off.

13
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:28,201
By giving us, can you give us some background information?

14
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:30,263
Who is Nick Jaleo?

15
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:31,244
Sure.

16
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:35,808
So, John, I was, I've lived my whole life in Medford.

17
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:41,612
I grew up here from a hardworking family, Italian-American family.

18
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:43,894
I went through the Medford public schools.

19
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:48,838
I attended the Brooks for elementary, then the McGlynn for middle, and then I went to Medford High.

20
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,403
At Medford High, I really focused on academics, so I studied hard.

21
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:57,646
And I was fortunate enough to graduate number one in my class.

22
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:03,531
After that, I decided I would go on to college, so I attended Tufts University.

23
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:07,795
When I was at Tufts, I studied history and I studied international relations.

24
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,556
I also did a minor in Italian.

25
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,859
Graduated from Tufts, magna cum laude.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,785
and then went on to attend law school at Boston College Law.

27
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:22,695
And there I had really excellent professors and a really great course of study.

28
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:26,421
A lot of it was focused on municipal law and zoning and land use.

29
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,316
I also had some clinical experience, too.

30
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:33,077
I worked for a while as a prosecutor with the Malden District Court.

31
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:38,320
And after that, I graduated from law school, and I took the bar exam.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,141
I passed on the first go, and I became a lawyer.

33
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,282
And that's essentially what I do today.

34
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:46,704
I've worked in criminal law a little bit.

35
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:49,185
I worked for a law office in Medford Square for a while.

36
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,087
And today I'm with a law firm in downtown Boston on State Street.

37
00:02:54,387 --> 00:03:04,851
It does primarily medical malpractice in court all the time defending rather prosecuting cases for people who are injured by doctors.

38
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,151
Very nice.

39
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,152
Great background.

40
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:12,534
Highly qualified, I would say, so that's that's always a good thing.

41
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:15,335
Great, great background.

42
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:29,224
You know, so I guess a lot of people would wonder why is Nick running for Medford City Council and, you know, what reasons are making you want to run for the job?

43
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:30,945
It's a good question.

44
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:39,271
I feel like the people who are considering voting for me, they should get an explanation for that because I think it's important to understand why somebody is running for elected office.

45
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:46,096
So it's hard to summarize it in a few words, but to say it in a few words, or at least attempt to, I would say it's because I really do care about Medford.

46
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,397
I love Medford.

47
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,417
I've lived here my whole life.

48
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:51,560
And I want to do, I think, what's best for Medford.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,223
I'm really just passionate about this community, and I feel like it has so much potential.

50
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,867
I feel like a lot of it is untapped potential, so potential we could actualize.

51
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:02,369
So that's a big part of it.

52
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,832
And also, I've just been unhappy, I would say, with the way things have been going with city leadership.

53
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,054
And I feel like we could be doing better.

54
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:15,499
And I feel like I might have the qualifications to improve what's been going on in our city.

55
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:41,077
qualifications primarily I'd say for my education just the fact that I've done a lot of school and I'm a lawyer and I think being a member of any sort of elected body you need to have kind of skills like that that a lawyer might have so I'd say all of that overall has kind of motivated me to run and for me it's very important you know it's easy to complain and say I don't like the way things are going but then we complain we don't take action.

56
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,138
There you go.

57
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:47,742
So for me, I said to myself, it's time to stop complaining and time to do something about that.

58
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,423
So that's why I'm throwing my hat in.

59
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:53,065
Yeah, that happens a lot, a lot of complaining.

60
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:57,068
But you got to offer solutions too.

61
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,550
Okay, so, you know,

62
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:08,720
Myself personally, I think there's a lot of issues right now, major issues concerning Method.

63
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:14,865
What would you consider major issues right now regarding the city of Method?

64
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,347
What are things that you see?

65
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,928
I like what you said at the beginning, that there are a lot of issues.

66
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:27,271
We could sit here all day and talk, but obviously we can't do that, so let's just talk about, I think, what are the major issues, just like you asked.

67
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:33,093
For me, I would say that the number one issue is probably affordability at the moment.

68
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:38,518
We're seeing on the national level just an issue of cost of living.

69
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,820
It's just becoming very expensive to live anywhere.

70
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:49,028
But especially in suburban communities near big successful cities like Medford, it's just becoming really expensive to live in Medford.

71
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,071
And I think there are various reasons why that's the case.

72
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:56,155
So for me, I want to do something about the situation with

73
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,957
affordability in our city.

74
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:05,706
I feel like people are very worried and concerned, you know, how am I going to afford to stay in the home that I've lived in, you know, or my family's lived in, you know, for all our lives.

75
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:07,147
So what can we do about that?

76
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:10,051
How can we make this city an affordable place to live?

77
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:17,799
I would say the next issue in terms of importance would probably be, and I think it's related to affordability, but economic growth.

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,266
We're seeing a Medford, I think, that's stagnating a bit when it comes to economic development.

79
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,650
So for me, this is something I want to address.

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,493
What can we do to make our city more prosperous?

81
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:35,278
What can we do to make our city wealthier and a wealth that everybody can have a part in?

82
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:39,640
So what can we do to bring businesses to Medford, for example?

83
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,581
What can we do to promote growth?

84
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,502
So hopefully that's something I would be able to address if I were elected.

85
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:51,025
And I would say, just maybe as a third one, just to kind of wrap up, what are the major issues here?

86
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,807
I'd probably say it's transparency.

87
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,810
I think we're seeing a significant problem with that currently.

88
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,412
I think people feel left out.

89
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:03,195
People feel like they don't understand what's happening at City Hall.

90
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,538
People feel worried about this, concerned, maybe angry, upset.

91
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,102
And I feel like information has been hard to get in a lot of circumstances.

92
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,624
So I think transparency needs to be addressed.

93
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:17,067
I think we need a counselor who is going to address that.

94
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,368
I agree with you.

95
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,110
I mean, really, good answer.

96
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:32,643
The transparency, especially, I just feel like a lot of people feel like they're being left out.

97
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,126
And I know you.

98
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,827
I've seen you go to City Hall.

99
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:38,869
I've seen a lot of people go up there and speak.

100
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,274
And it just seems like no one's paying attention.

101
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,635
No one's listening.

102
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:52,020
So I think transparency is something that's really key.

103
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,222
And I want to thank you for that answer.

104
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:58,385
So here's another good one for you.

105
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,147
We just had the ballot questions.

106
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:04,969
You know, how did you feel about that?

107
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:09,431
I mean, what was your position on the overrides?

108
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,872
I mean, plain and simple.

109
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,232
What did you feel?

110
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,252
How did you feel about it?

111
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:13,993
Sure.

112
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:26,678
So for anyone who's following my speeches at city council or maybe read my op-ed in the Tufts Daily, it's no secret that I was very opposed to all three ballot questions that we were presented with in November.

113
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,219
So I really kind of

114
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,417
made it a point to be outspoken about that because I was deeply concerned about what I was seeing.

115
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,800
So for anyone maybe not familiar, I'll just briefly recap them.

116
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,421
There were three.

117
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,085
The first one was $3.5 million for schools and DPW.

118
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,068
This would be an override proposition, two and a half override.

119
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:51,253
This is a state law that allows taxes to be raised over a certain cap.

120
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,075
in a given fiscal year.

121
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:59,878
Question 7 was a $4 million one for schools, and then question 8 was slightly different.

122
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:05,461
It was called a debt exclusion, essentially a bond, $30 million for a new fire station.

123
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:10,304
So these were the three questions Medford voters had to decide upon for the next election.

124
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,566
So the reason why I was opposed, I had various reasons.

125
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,628
The most important, I think, was just the burden this would have on residents.

126
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:23,151
This would essentially be a massive tax hike that would really hurt people who are already struggling.

127
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,532
I talked about affordability at the beginning.

128
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:31,316
This was, I think, a major contributor to the affordability problems we're seeing today.

129
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:35,558
This idea of any time we have a problem in the city, let's just raise taxes.

130
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,500
That more money thrown at a problem fixes it.

131
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,101
which I think there's misperceptions about that.

132
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:46,402
So the tax impact was a big part of my opposition.

133
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:57,045
And I also think there was a lot of kind of fear mongering that came behind putting these questions forward, what I call maybe scare tactics, that I don't think was supported by data at all.

134
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,586
I can give you a specific example of that.

135
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:02,066
I mean, there was talk of, you know, teacher salaries, for example.

136
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:12,950
You know, oh, you know, our teacher salaries won't be competitive, but according to the Department of Education data, Medford salaries for teachers are competitive compared to elsewhere in the state.

137
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,110
And this is data anyone can look up.

138
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:21,552
There was also just a vagueness, too, you know, in terms of what is this money going to be used for specifically.

139
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:23,933
We got general categories, like schools, DPW.

140
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:25,113
Right.

141
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:29,016
Fire station, but specifically, you know, where was this money going to go?

142
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:38,542
You know, for me, I think for voters, you know, they should be entitled to know line item, in a line item manner, where money is going to go, specifically.

143
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:42,545
So the fact that it was vague, you know, was another reason I felt like I couldn't support.

144
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:46,588
And then another thing that just cannot be passed aside is just the free cash.

145
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:47,908
that we have.

146
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:48,369
Yes.

147
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:49,249
Quite a bit.

148
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:50,090
Quite a bit.

149
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,450
It's gone up since the election.

150
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,531
Yes.

151
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:53,471
Funny how that happened.

152
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:57,974
At the time, we had about $25 million, according to the Department of Revenue.

153
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,555
But like I said, that's since gone up.

154
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,717
And anyone who doesn't know what free cash is, obviously, it's not free.

155
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,898
It does come from taxpayers.

156
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:13,382
But it's essentially over-budgeted money in a given fiscal year that goes into a reserve fund that we're able to use for a broader range of purposes once it's certified.

157
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:23,221
So we heard a lot of talk during the override campaign, oh, we can't use free cash to meet, for example, school expenses.

158
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,443
But what did I see at a recent city council meeting?

159
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:32,828
The mayor requested $5 million to repair deficient HVAC and the roofs at the middle schools.

160
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,910
So $5 million that could have been used and is going to be used to

161
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:38,452
net fund that.

162
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:38,953
Right.

163
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:39,153
Right.

164
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:44,980
And then there was that same day there was another request for $200,000 for security upgrades across the school.

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,426
So it really was misleading for people to say that free cash was just off the table completely.

166
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:50,207
Right.

167
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:50,968
I hear you.

168
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:51,268
Yep.

169
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:59,757
And then just kind of to wrap this up, I would say growth, right, was another alternative to raising taxes, right?

170
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:04,722
If we're increasing the commercial tax base, for example, we're getting more revenue, right?

171
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,144
And we can use that to meet funding shortages.

172
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:10,547
So we ignored new growth as well as an alternative.

173
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:14,691
to the overrides.

174
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,714
You have to think also just of the diversity of our city, economic diversity of our city.

175
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,455
What happens when taxes go up?

176
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:23,157
Well, it drives out lower income people.

177
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:24,859
It essentially gentrifies the city.

178
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:31,203
So if you're concerned about gentrification, supporting tax hikes doesn't solve that problem.

179
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,085
So we have to think of that.

180
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:37,570
We have to think of how lower-income, middle-income people are going to be affected by tax hikes.

181
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,712
Especially people on fixed incomes, too.

182
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:45,038
You've got to think of seniors who are really struggling and barely getting by in a lot of circumstances.

183
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,719
People with disabilities, as well.

184
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,501
Most affected.

185
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:49,542
I think those are the people

186
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:51,904
that are most affected by that.

187
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:55,985
You know, zoning, zoning, zoning, zoning, zoning.

188
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,166
There's so much going on with the zoning.

189
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:04,308
And, you know, we could probably, I know you could discuss that subject for hours, but we don't have hours.

190
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:11,150
So I want to sort of be more specific on it.

191
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,122
We're all hearing about Meffitt Square now.

192
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,984
You know, we're hearing Salem Street, South Meffitt, West Meffitt.

193
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,386
We know there's a lot going on.

194
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,810
Another situation, I don't think people are being heard.

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,273
But what's your opinion?

196
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,355
I mean, how do you feel about Meffitt Square?

197
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,617
You know, what are the plans?

198
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,360
What do you see happening with that?

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,341
What do you think about it?

200
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,081
What's your opinion?

201
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,758
Yeah, so another great question.

202
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:45,299
I'll go back to what I said again earlier, this idea of untapped potential.

203
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,040
Medford is a city that could be much better in a lot of ways.

204
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:52,842
It's great now in a lot of respects, but there's so much more we could be doing.

205
00:13:53,462 --> 00:14:14,568
So for anyone not familiar, recently it was announced that there will be a very big development project coming to Medford Square, essentially three city-owned lots that are going to be transformed, a combination of mixed-use retail and residential, and nobody's denying this is going to fundamentally transform the square in terms of the way it looks, in terms of the way it's structured, who's living there, who's doing business there.

206
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:26,054
So, I'd say it's quite early, this proposal was only announced very recently, so I think I would need more information to form a definite opinion yet on where I stand on the proposal itself.

207
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:26,575
Right.

208
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:38,422
But before I talk about maybe the questions I have regarding that proposal, I'll first say I think it's super important that we all dial in on the need to revitalize Medford Square.

209
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:43,625
As a guy who's studied a lot of history, Medford Square in the past used to be a very different place.

210
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:46,906
And I'm not talking like 100 years ago, and it was.

211
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:47,666
No, you're not.

212
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:50,427
But in decades past, it was a very different place.

213
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:55,768
It was much more livelier and more of a kind of gathering spot for the people of our city.

214
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:58,789
But now it's in very rough shape in a lot of respects.

215
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,890
And there have been improvements, but not enough.

216
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,739
And you have to look also, I always say this to people, you have to look at our neighboring squares and compare them to Medford Square.

217
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,522
Think of Davis Square, for example.

218
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,764
Central Square in Cambridge.

219
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,467
Harvard Square in Cambridge.

220
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:13,408
Kendall.

221
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:14,350
I could go on and on.

222
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,251
Yes, you can.

223
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:15,892
Do all of these.

224
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,811
resemble Medford Square?

225
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,091
No.

226
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,533
These squares, you have a lot of traffic, a lot of activity.

227
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:22,694
They're booming in a lot of respects.

228
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:35,983
But then you look at Medford Square, where I know people who live the next town over, you know, who move here from other places, and don't even know there's such a thing as Medford Square, you know, because there's so few reasons in a lot of respects to go, because it's difficult to park.

229
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:37,844
The traffic is horrendous sometimes.

230
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,067
So what can we do to support our local businesses there?

231
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,589
They're awesome, they're great, I love spending my money there.

232
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,992
I'd much rather spend my money there than at the big brand name shops.

233
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:47,772
I agree.

234
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,214
What can we do to improve them, right?

235
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,976
Bring traffic to them, business to them.

236
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,539
For me, like I said, it's the parking and the traffic.

237
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,422
I think a lack of access by public transit's also an issue too.

238
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:00,142
Yes, yep.

239
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:02,384
Right, I think there's just bus routes at the moment, right?

240
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:02,724
Yep.

241
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,706
What are the other ways we can get people to the square?

242
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:07,688
But then I guess just turning to the proposal itself,

243
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:16,356
Like I said, I think it's still early to form a conclusive opinion on it, but there are questions that I have, and I'm just going to go through a few of them that I have.

244
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:21,381
For example, referring to the business here, how will this proposal affect the businesses that are already there?

245
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:22,882
That's something to think about.

246
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:24,684
Parking, of course.

247
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:26,825
We always have to be thinking about parking with any project.

248
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,727
We can't ignore parking, period.

249
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,831
And then another important thing is, you know, if you look at the map, where is this going to be?

250
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,994
This is going to be right next to the senior center in Medford Square, right?

251
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,615
So how is this going to impact the senior center?

252
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,257
Is it going to pose any safety concerns, for example?

253
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,399
Accessibility concerns to the senior center?

254
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:50,883
So seniors who regularly frequent the senior center, they're major stakeholders in this.

255
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:51,984
We have to talk to them.

256
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,806
We have to make sure their opinions are heard on this project.

257
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,049
And then also, we just have to think, you know, how will it look?

258
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,871
I mean, the aesthetic impact, right?

259
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:08,960
You got to think about how old these buildings are in Medford Square, you know, with this big, new, modern, towering structure, you know, fit with the buildings that are already there.

260
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:13,945
Obviously, when it comes to looks, we tend to put that lower in our list of priorities, but it's still something to think about.

261
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,627
We want our community to be beautiful, too.

262
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,093
So those are the questions I have.

263
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:23,380
Overall, my suggestion to the people who are involved with this would be not to rush this process.

264
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,385
I think we need to slow down and we need to get adequate community input.

265
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:34,695
One of the things we need to do is not just take community input, but actually actively change our plans based on what people have to say.

266
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:39,072
You know, that was going to be part of my next question.

267
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:40,333
And you mentioned it earlier.

268
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:41,495
You just mentioned it again.

269
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:45,240
You know, I can't tell you how many people I know.

270
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,683
And I do know a lot of people.

271
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:50,146
I've been here most of my life.

272
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,831
You know, they have concerns.

273
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:58,254
And they just feel like they're not, they're just not being addressed.

274
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,234
That's how they feel.

275
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,695
That's the perception out there.

276
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:09,520
I mean, what can you do or is there anything, is there a way or how do you feel about that?

277
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,963
I mean, addressing people's concerns like they don't feel like they're being heard.

278
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:32,882
any solutions any anything you can offer for that absolutely and like i said at the beginning this is a major aspect of my campaign here is i want to prove transparency in our city okay and i'd say i've included among these people who do feel left out in a lot of ways i think it's something many of us share

279
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:46,088
So for me, I think we're seeing a lot of ways to try to reduce the ability of the public to participate, right, for the purposes of, I guess you could call it expediency, trying to rush things through and promote an agenda.

280
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:53,971
But we have to look at the ways, number one, in which public participation was being reduced.

281
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:57,233
So I can give you some very specific examples of that.

282
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:58,614
We saw a resolution

283
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:20,181
uh... last year to reduce the amount of time by several minutes in which people can participate in public comment at city council meetings uh... this is terrible right because it we're now in a position where people go up and they have to rush and say everything they have to say i think it's currently three minutes very very fast they often forget things and

284
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:28,267
Sometimes there's pressure from the president of the council to immediately wrap up once that three minutes is reached.

285
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,790
It's not like he says, oh, you can have a little more time.

286
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,391
Most of the time, that's what's happening.

287
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:37,174
We're seeing also just the meetings, how late that they're going.

288
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:39,876
Many of them are going far past midnight.

289
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,139
And you think of people who have to work the next day.

290
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,162
Maybe they have to go to school or take care of children.

291
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,663
There's all these different reasons.

292
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,925
why, you know, a meeting running really late is not a good thing.

293
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,667
So I think we have to look at ways we can try to make it so we don't have that problem.

294
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:08,152
But we're also seeing some kind of procedural sneakiness, too, with, for example, sticking controversial things at the very end of the agenda so that we don't get to them until midnight.

295
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,855
I mean, there was a resolution against anti-Semitism before the council recently.

296
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,798
We didn't get to that until very, very late in the evening.

297
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:21,201
But that's such a huge community issue, you know, it's something, why are we not considering that?

298
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:24,683
In any event, it was tabled, so no one had a chance to say anything about it.

299
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,204
I remember that, yeah.

300
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:40,382
I can remember also a recent meeting in which we were talking about the charter and the charter was on the agenda along with other things that merited time but weren't as pressing as getting the charter to Beacon Hill.

301
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,987
So what ended up happening was one of the counselors

302
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:49,331
moved to take it out of order and didn't even receive a second to do that.

303
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:50,692
That's just horrendous.

304
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:54,194
I mean, if anyone doesn't know what that means, like a second, you're not saying you approve.

305
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,397
You're just saying, you know, I'm willing to have the discussion on this now.

306
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:00,599
And they wouldn't even do that.

307
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,121
This is just horrendous, in my opinion.

308
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:07,705
And then immediately after that, someone else proposed a motion to take something else out of order.

309
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,847
Sorry, a motion.

310
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,429
And that was approved without question.

311
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:17,334
So it's really just insane, a lot of the things that have been happening.

312
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:18,895
So for me, I want to do things.

313
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:26,701
like change the rules to allow the public more opportunities to participate and do something about these like midnight, 1 a.m.

314
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,582
meetings.

315
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:32,866
Everyone should have a chance to come to these meetings and say what they think.

316
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,309
They shouldn't have to wait hours and hours and hours to talk for three minutes.

317
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:37,230
It's just not right.

318
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,553
That's all truth and it all makes sense.

319
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,215
I'm going to be a little redundant here.

320
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:57,593
know, your knowledge, your experience, and I think your approach, you know, what you could bring to the city council, it's very valuable.

321
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:58,234
But anyhow,

322
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:05,878
How do you bring this to the city council, and how do you deliver better outcomes?

323
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:10,321
You know, you definitely have everything it takes.

324
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,202
How do you deliver it, you know?

325
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,784
That is the question, I would say.

326
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:18,647
It's so easy to make promises, the hardest part is delivering on them.

327
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,776
This is something I'm thinking about now.

328
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:25,821
You know, if I'm fortunate enough to get elected, it's something I should be thinking about from day one.

329
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,643
How am I going to make these things I want to change happen?

330
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:33,107
So for me, I think the most important facet of it is listening.

331
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:34,768
Listening to residents.

332
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:36,810
What are residents thinking and feeling?

333
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,912
And not just pushing them to the side.

334
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:42,515
You know, we have our opinions and beliefs, and we should definitely stick to our principles.

335
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:43,976
But at the same time,

336
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:51,603
As an elected leader, we're not, there's some who say, you know, you're elected to make decisions, and that's not false.

337
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:57,749
But as an elected representative, you are an agent of the people who vote you in.

338
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,153
You know, I think of as being a lawyer, I mean, what's my job is to represent a client.

339
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:07,518
My judgment's entrusted to make decisions for the client, especially legal decisions where there's a knowledge gap.

340
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,800
But at the same time, I'm working for the client.

341
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,461
The client isn't working for me.

342
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:16,983
And the same thing is true with, I think, being elected representative is you have to do what the people want.

343
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:20,764
So listening is a big part of making things happen.

344
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,906
And then, of course, just common things like hard work, for example.

345
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,787
It requires hard work and not laziness.

346
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:35,033
Prudence, you know, being smart and listening and learning, teaching, and it's always good to admit when you don't know something.

347
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:35,513
Right.

348
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,615
And do the homework and research, right?

349
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:44,060
We have a lot of, I think, elected leaders, not just in Medford, but everywhere, who say, you know, I know what to do, right?

350
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,445
You know, they kind of jump to conclusions about things, and they don't take a step back and say, well, maybe I should reevaluate my own perspective.

351
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:52,246
Maybe it's wrong in certain respects.

352
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,568
What can I do to make it better?

353
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:55,377
Right.

354
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:57,739
In other words, you've got to represent all the people.

355
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:58,360
Exactly.

356
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,061
You've got to do your best to represent all.

357
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,425
You're not going to make everyone happy, but you've got to represent them all, you know.

358
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,269
All right, so now we're going to get down to our last question.

359
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,832
And, you know, I'm going to ask you this.

360
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:18,017
If someone wants to get in touch with Nick Gileo,

361
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,452
How would they go about, how do they do it?

362
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:22,994
How do they get in touch with you, Nick?

363
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,557
Where would they, where do you go, where do you?

364
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:29,160
Yeah, so I think there's kind of two ways to talk about it.

365
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,523
Number one is like, literally, how do you get in touch with me, right?

366
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,706
I live here in Medford, obviously, I like to go to events.

367
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:37,709
I do have some social media pages for the campaigns.

368
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:40,792
I have a Facebook, Nick Trelaya from Medford City Council.

369
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,094
I also have an Instagram.

370
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:50,319
So I've been posting regularly about what I've been doing and who I've been talking to on social media.

371
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:53,701
So if you have social media, feel free to take a look.

372
00:24:55,222 --> 00:25:03,268
Of course, anyone who wants to just talk with me, feel free to just find me, reach out to me, give me a call, send me a text, ask to meet for coffee.

373
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:04,148
I'm happy, honestly.

374
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:10,610
you know, busy guy between what I do for a living and campaign activities, but I'm going to make time for everybody.

375
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,951
Even people who don't agree with me, I encourage us to have conversations, right?

376
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:16,472
Let's talk.

377
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:20,413
Let's try to iron out, you know, what we don't agree upon.

378
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:21,593
Because that's how it works.

379
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,333
That's how you get things done is you cooperate.

380
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:28,154
But in terms of just the other kind of aspect of your question, I'd say is, you know, where can you find me?

381
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,415
Like, what do I like to do in Medford?

382
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:33,955
I love Medford, I honestly do, and that's why I'm running.

383
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,916
Number one place you'd probably find me is probably the library, right?

384
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:46,738
I love the Medford Public Library, all the services it provides, just the space it offers for people who are interested in learning, and I'm a guy who just loves to learn, I love to read.

385
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:57,500
So I like to go there a lot, hang out in the local history room, look at the yearbooks, look at the old historical documents, and just learn about Medford and how great a city it is.

386
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,822
Also love being outdoors, enjoying the many beautiful things that Medford has to offer, like the Fells, Brooks Estate, Mystic Lakes, Mystic River.

387
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:07,462
Always like being outdoors.

388
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,542
You want to go on a hike with me?

389
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:09,943
Feel free.

390
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:10,483
Let's go on a hike.

391
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,603
Talk politics and hike.

392
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:13,984
Or just enjoy the beauty of nature.

393
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,024
That would be interesting.

394
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,144
Yeah, I hear you.

395
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:20,345
And then I can't not say also, I just love going to Medford businesses as well.

396
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:25,966
I love going to the Square, having lunch there, brunch, wherever it is in Medford.

397
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,787
Just love spending my money in my hometown.

398
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:30,775
Yeah, I agree.

399
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:37,560
And there's a lot of, Meffitt Square especially, actually the whole city, but Meffitt Square, I mean, there's a lot of great restaurants.

400
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,402
There is, I mean, there's a lot of good food.

401
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:42,663
We know how to eat.

402
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:43,284
Yeah, we do.

403
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:44,204
We know how to eat in this city.

404
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,346
Yeah, we're Italians, of course we do.

405
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:50,989
Everybody in this city, regardless of ethnic background, we know how to eat in Medford.

406
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,950
We do, we do.

407
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,670
I agree.

408
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:57,634
Anyhow, I want to thank you, Nick.

409
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:02,536
for joining us on Method Happenings.

410
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:07,418
And I want to thank you for being a candidate.

411
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:19,162
I think it's so important to have people like you run for council, school committee, whatever the position is.

412
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:22,864
I think it's a good thing for Method.

413
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,004
So I want to thank you.

414
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,186
And I enjoyed the show.

415
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:30,647

00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,608
And I hope you're going to come back and join us again.

417
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:32,988
It was great.

418
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:34,188
Thank you very much for having me here.

419
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:35,569
Yeah, no, it was our pleasure.

So I want to thank everyone.

421
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,850
