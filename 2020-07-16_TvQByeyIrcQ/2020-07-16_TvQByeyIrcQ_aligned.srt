1
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:02,514
All right, it's enough for me.

2
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:09,556
I am going to go ahead and pass this on to a voter in the district, Mr. Greg Nadeau.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,757
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:12,958
My name's Greg.

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:18,620
And 30 years ago, I was legislative aide, campaign manager, then legislative aide for a state rep.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:29,844
Worked in the statehouse and observed firsthand how the concentration of power in both branches really prevented progressive legislation from moving forward.

7
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:44,518
In recent years, I've been pleasantly seeing that the State Senate, ever since Stan Rosenberg has been president, has improved substantially, but the House really hasn't.

8
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:50,541
And so I've been saying for a number of years that you cannot be a progressive and vote for the Speaker.

9
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:57,924
And no matter how many times progressive legislators say that they co-sponsor wonderful things, vote the right way,

10
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:03,971
The only vote that matters is the vote that prevents all progressive legislation from continuing, and that is the vote for the speaker.

11
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:12,658
So, I got a phone call from one of you, I'm not forgetting whom.

12
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:19,743
Someone can identify themselves who called me and I was driving along doing some errands and said, voting for Anna Callahan or support Anna Callahan.

13
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:21,424
And I said, no, I'm with Christine.

14
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:22,565
You know, Christine is a great rep.

15
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:24,427
She's my favorite in the delegation.

16
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:26,276
You know, I like her very much.

17
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,136
I think she's smart.

18
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:28,677
I think she's got integrity, blah, blah, blah.

19
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:35,600
And then, then I just sort of had this pause of like, well, wait a second, you know, from the message that the person said about reforming state house.

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:41,663
I said, well, okay, well, I'll come to a house party, went to a house, you know, attended a house party, um, ask some questions.

21
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:47,706
Um, my son, Max, um, was also there and, um, really, you actually grilled me.

22
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,562
Which was late.

23
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,243
Well, you've completely passed.

24
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:57,285
And then I said I would, and I did talk to Christine a couple of days after that.

25
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:08,092
And Christine did not respond with a firm commitment to oppose the speaker and to dilute the concentration of power in the House that prevents all progressive legislation from falling.

26
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:12,374
So I said that I would now be shifting my support.

27
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,535
So here I am, happy to be involved.

28
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:17,517
I'm pretty involved in Somerville in a lot of ways.

29
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,278
I've been here for 20 years.

30
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:31,414
definitely know every city councilor and school committee member and mayor and everyone else very, very well and tend to talk to all of them and say, look, either you're with the speaker or you're with progressive causes.

31
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,335
There's no in between.

32
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,075
It's like racism.

33
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,675
You cannot be neutral on racism.

34
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:39,996
Either you're actively opposing racism or you are part of the status quo that is perpetuating.

35
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:49,098
And so everyone who is supporting Christine is fundamentally supporting a status quo as preventing climate change, racial justice, and everything else that we care about from progressing.
