[SPEAKER_06]: 20-097 offered by President Falco be it resolved that the administration update the City Council on the precautions and

22
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:23,480
[SPEAKER_06]: The administration is taking a decisive method to protect our residents, in particular, our children, seniors, and first responders from the coronavirus.

00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:26,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

25
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:33,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been receiving many calls from people throughout the community regarding coronavirus.

26
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:41,411
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have basically, if you're online or you're watching TV, everyone is talking about it.

27
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:46,615
[SPEAKER_14]: concern, a real concern throughout our community, throughout our country.

28
00:14:47,255 --> 00:15:02,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we have a number of people here from the administration tonight that would like to speak and give us more information as to what the administration is doing with regard to coronavirus and how we're moving forward and if they could please come forward at this time.

29
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,165
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could have someone from the administration please speak.

30
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:04,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

31
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

32
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

33
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,276
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, good.

34
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:35,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

35
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:36,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody, am I good?

36
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:36,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

37
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,480
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Mr. President, for putting this item on the agenda this evening.

38
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:42,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave Rodriguez, Chief of Staff, Office of the Mayor.

39
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:45,365
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm joined tonight by Mary Ann O'Connor, who's the Director of the Board of Health.

40
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:50,149
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an issue that the mayor's office and the mayor specifically is taking super seriously.

41
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,511
[SPEAKER_16]: We spent a lot of staff time over the past couple of weeks.

42
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,713
[SPEAKER_16]: I was encouraged to see the piece on the agenda this evening.

43
00:15:55,093 --> 00:16:02,419
[SPEAKER_16]: So we got together in order for us to update the community and update the council on some of the things that the administration's doing in order to

44
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,322
[SPEAKER_16]: increase our preparedness with regard to the situation.

45
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:14,286
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll hand it off to Marianne and we can go back and forth, have a conversation about the administration's situational response to the issue.

46
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:17,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

47
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,429
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for having us here this evening.

48
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:34,283
[SPEAKER_21]: So yes, this is a true public health concern, and while here in Medford the risk still remains low, it is certainly something we're taking very, very seriously, and we know it's an evolving situation that could change at any time.

49
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:44,985
[SPEAKER_21]: So for several weeks now, my department has been on weekly phone calls with the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, as well as the Mass.

50
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Department of Public Health, discussing guidance

51
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:51,100
[SPEAKER_21]: and preventing measures we could take.

52
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,523
[SPEAKER_21]: At this point, we're really beyond containment and at mitigation statewide and nationwide.

53
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:16,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously, as you've heard, the best precautions, the best prevention is wash your hands, hand sanitizer, cough etiquette, stay home if you're sick, which we're also talking about in real discussions around what we call non-pharmaceutical interventions.

54
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:20,132
[SPEAKER_21]: The best one of those is what's called social distancing.

55
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:27,395
[SPEAKER_21]: So, examples of social distancing you've seen already in the news, those are your travel restrictions.

56
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:33,397
[SPEAKER_21]: You saw the governor today saying that he's going to halt seminars and conferences and travel.

57
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:41,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Going forward, these are things that we're gonna need to discuss around social distancing and what does that mean for Medford?

58
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:47,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that mean we have to really start looking hard and seriously at canceling some events that may be difficult?

59
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:52,434
[SPEAKER_21]: but certainly necessary for the good of the citizens of Medford and for our safety.

60
00:17:54,294 --> 00:18:10,500
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've also met with local emergency personnel and a couple of weeks ago at a department head meeting, we really started the conversation around what's called continuity of operations and really asked department heads to start thinking about what happens in their department.

61
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:16,210
[SPEAKER_21]: What are the essential functions of their department that we need to continue to do to serve the citizens of Medford?

62
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:26,261
[SPEAKER_21]: But what are those functions that if we get really thin, if absenteeism really hits the roof and we're not able to do, what are those functions that we can temporarily suspend?

63
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:29,865
[SPEAKER_21]: What are those functions that some of your employees could do remotely from home?

64
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:34,333
[SPEAKER_21]: And to really have department heads start thinking about, what if they get sick?

65
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:35,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's in charge?

66
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:37,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's the next in charge?

67
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:38,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's the next after that?

68
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,235
[SPEAKER_21]: So those efforts are underway.

69
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:45,916
[SPEAKER_21]: We're really going to be honing down on department heads to really come up with those plans.

70
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,076
[SPEAKER_21]: They're called COOP plans.

71
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:49,537
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we're working with them on those.

72
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:55,998
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have another meeting scheduled tomorrow with all the emergency management personnel going forward to start making plans.

73
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:04,879
[SPEAKER_21]: been training and talking with first responders and looking to make sure they have the proper equipment as you've all heard.

74
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:09,673
[SPEAKER_21]: masks are scarce, so we've been gathering up what we can.

75
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:20,400
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now we think we're good, but obviously going forward, it was good to hear in the governor's news conference today that they have some PPE coming in from the national stockpile.

76
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:28,085
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully that will trickle down to communities as well, because if this thing keeps evolving, we're probably going to need those supplies.

77
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:33,418
[SPEAKER_21]: The school department we've been in close contact with every day.

78
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,211
[SPEAKER_21]: I have my morning call with the school department.

79
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,173
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you know, you've seen efforts that we've taken there as well.

80
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:46,818
[SPEAKER_21]: And some of those are social distancing efforts, like what happened with the teachers who had returned from those countries.

81
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,581
[SPEAKER_21]: So any other questions, anything I've missed?

82
00:19:50,701 --> 00:20:00,990
[SPEAKER_16]: So just briefly, as it was released today, and we did do some extensive outreach this afternoon, there has been a presumptive positive test for a case in the city of Medford.

83
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,671
[SPEAKER_16]: We release that information, we're certainly not obligated, and we spoke with DPH regarding the release of that information.

84
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:16,133
[SPEAKER_16]: It's our commitment to give the information to the public as much as we can, as quickly as we can, in order to one, make sure that they have the information.

85
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:22,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Second of all, to make sure that they're advised of some of the mitigation and the general precautions, the hand washing, the disinfecting.

86
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:27,320
[SPEAKER_16]: the social distancing, some of those efforts, and also to alleviate concerns.

87
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:39,272
[SPEAKER_16]: We truly understand how much anxiety this is driving for the public in general, and we want to make sure more information is always going to be better than less, and any information that we can give, we want to give.

88
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course there is information we can't.

89
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:48,820
[SPEAKER_16]: There's privacy concerns that are in play, identities, locations, exact circumstances of attraction, stuff to that concern.

90
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,122
[SPEAKER_16]: We work closely together.

91
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:55,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Marianne spent three or four hours in my office today strategizing on these things, working on these things.

92
00:20:56,306 --> 00:21:08,450
[SPEAKER_16]: All department has been instructed in order to do coup planning in order to ensure the delivery of services, identification of essential functions and essential personnel in order to make sure the government keeps running, that we can continue to provide these services.

93
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,371
[SPEAKER_16]: So the mayor is.

94
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,833
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't stress this enough, is that the mayor's commitment to transparency regarding this issue is paramount.

95
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:21,974
[SPEAKER_16]: And every piece of information that we can give, we are going to give as quickly as possible.

96
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:26,036
[SPEAKER_16]: We think that can mitigate and contain the spread.

97
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:29,198
[SPEAKER_16]: It's beyond the point of being able to stop it.

98
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:32,380
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to try to mitigate what's going to happen now.

99
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:50,735
[SPEAKER_16]: So the meeting that's going to take place with emergency management personnel is going to be very important for us tomorrow so that we can rely on the guidance that's been given by Department of Public Health, CDC, the governor's office, the Declaration of the State of Emergency, and analyze that for how we can adapt those plans.

100
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:58,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Public safety dispatchers have been given protocols as to what to do and what questions to ask if somebody calls 911.

101
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:03,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Regarding an issue like this, too, in order to protect the first responders that are responding.

102
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:10,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Protocols have been put in place for fire and police for them as they respond to make sure that they're insured safe.

103
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:12,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Kirkland Washington was a perfect example.

104
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,538
[SPEAKER_16]: We took some really hard lessons from them.

105
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:20,443
[SPEAKER_16]: they have 25 firefighters stuck in a firehouse as quarantine because they all rushed in because that's what they're trained to do.

106
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,125
[SPEAKER_16]: If somebody's in trouble, they want to go help.

107
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:29,891
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to slow things down a little bit in that regard to make sure that the firefighters stay safe, the first responders stay safe, ambulance stay safe.

108
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,773
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to be as thoughtful as we can in this approach.

109
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:37,277
[SPEAKER_21]: And we do have the public information set up on the website.

110
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:41,461
[SPEAKER_21]: We would refer people for more information to go to the city website.

111
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:46,595
[SPEAKER_21]: And as well as the DPH website and the CDC website for guidance.

112
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:49,936
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some very helpful frequently asked questions that are on the website.

113
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:54,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Trying to make it as simple as we can for folks that we brainstorm.

114
00:22:54,938 --> 00:23:03,021
[SPEAKER_16]: What questions would we ask if we were on the outside looking in on some of these issues that we're constantly updating, we're constantly trying to be responsive and kind of adjust.

115
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,981
[SPEAKER_16]: The ground is shifting on us a lot.

116
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:07,442
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're trying to be responsive to that as well.

117
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for your briefing.

118
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:11,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Very informative.

119
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:20,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I watched the school committee last night, the school committee meeting, and that was, they talked about what they were doing in the schools, and that was very informative as well.

120
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,442
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we take a look at, you know, our different public buildings throughout our community.

121
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:27,383
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we take a look at, you take a look at our schools.

122
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:33,546
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they talked about, I think it was a GENEO machine that comes in and sanitizes.

123
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:46,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, they talked about that now it sanitizes the classrooms and stuff like that, which is great And I know they have a they've had one deep cleaning and I think another one scheduled soon Okay, so so which is I

124
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:50,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

125
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:54,203
[SPEAKER_14]: As a parent, that's what I want to hear that, you know, our school spaces are clean.

126
00:23:54,223 --> 00:24:04,456
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what about our other public buildings like City Hall, the library, senior center, those being cleaned as well and scrubbed down and whatnot?

127
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:05,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

128
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:07,682
[SPEAKER_16]: All those buildings are regularly cleaned.

129
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:11,564
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do know that the bathrooms here at City Hall were deep cleaned recently.

130
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:19,427
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is going to be a subject, a point of discussion tomorrow about how we approach that and how we contract out to make sure that gets done.

131
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:19,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

132
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:23,008
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, when I look at the library and I look at the senior center, I look at the

133
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:29,413
[SPEAKER_14]: City Hall, you know, I mean, there's hundreds if not thousands of people utilizing these spaces, you know, on a weekly basis.

134
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:36,438
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we just want to make sure that, you know, we're, you know, keep our schools clean, of course, but also, you know, public spaces or public buildings.

135
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,420
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you very much for your information.

136
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate all your help.

137
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:41,163
[SPEAKER_16]: We are available all the time.

138
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:44,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Please email the mayor's public email address if there is any questions.

139
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,909
[SPEAKER_16]: We're happy to be a resource for the public.

140
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:52,255
[SPEAKER_16]: We understand how much how how concerning this is for the public because we're part of the public.

141
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:53,016
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're concerned, too.

142
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:56,440
[SPEAKER_16]: So we genuinely want to be as informative as we can.

143
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,442
[SPEAKER_21]: People can call my office anytime as well.

144
00:24:58,682 --> 00:24:59,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

145
00:24:59,423 --> 00:25:00,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

146
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,596
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

147
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:09,637
[SPEAKER_26]: Just two quick questions.

148
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:22,505
[SPEAKER_26]: First, how does, you mentioned personal protective equipment and some other stuff, what ways does the Governor's declaration of a state of emergency affect how we were preparing up until this afternoon when he declared it?

149
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:24,407
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as PPE goes?

150
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:25,287
[SPEAKER_26]: Or just in general.

151
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:28,049
[SPEAKER_26]: You mentioned PPE as one example, is there other?

152
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,752
[SPEAKER_21]: So I wanted to say that Monica Burrell, who's the DPH Commissioner, she mentioned on the conference call, the conference

153
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:40,916
[SPEAKER_21]: this afternoon that they had already put in a request to the national stockpile for additional PPE and supposedly was on its way.

154
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,797
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what I was referring to there.

155
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:51,218
[SPEAKER_21]: But we've been basically following the same guidance that has been put out from day one from DPH and CDC.

156
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,359
[SPEAKER_21]: And that guidance has changed and evolved.

157
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,600
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's been constantly monitored and constantly, you know, in touch with them.

158
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,921
[SPEAKER_21]: And any questions we have, they've been very responsive as well.

159
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,538
[SPEAKER_21]: We're all just really keeping a close eye on what's going on.

160
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:12,541
[SPEAKER_26]: So, but just the declaration of emergency is an indication of more resources coming to help, not necessarily.

161
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:27,089
[SPEAKER_21]: For the state it's more, yeah, and it's, it's, uh, it's going to be quicker for the, for the governor to get things done and maybe to waive certain things and to be able to cancel a large assemblies and to be able to act, um, you know, uh, more swift than he would have been able to before.

162
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:27,669
[SPEAKER_26]: Got it.

163
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:28,790
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, and then, um,

164
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:35,878
[SPEAKER_26]: have you discussed or tomorrow are you planning to discuss any guidance for public bodies in terms of meeting.

165
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:38,399
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're all here right now.

166
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:41,160
[SPEAKER_26]: Other committees and groups meet as well.

167
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:51,485
[SPEAKER_26]: So it'll be we'll have a uniform guidance from for the city for bodies and from public health.

168
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:51,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

169
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:52,026
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

170
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:52,826
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much.

171
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Mr. President.

172
00:26:56,933 --> 00:27:00,414
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, there were some concerns earlier.

173
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:10,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there are some limitations, we do have limitations of the information we can give about the person that has already been diagnosed and found to have the virus.

174
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:15,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it safe to say or could we say that it has nothing to do with the schools?

175
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that was one of the concerns.

176
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:23,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think the kids right now, they're feeling anxiety probably more than anybody right now.

177
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:29,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So just making sure if we could just say it has no one to do with the schools and we're safe from the schools.

178
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:34,535
[SPEAKER_16]: has had no contact with school-aged children.

179
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:41,979
[SPEAKER_16]: So a full investigation is normally done with these by the Board of Health and with our partners to ask these tough questions at the time.

180
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,780
[SPEAKER_16]: We check on that individual often every couple hours.

181
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,460
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your fever?

182
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,641
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your temperature?

183
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,301
[SPEAKER_16]: How's your condition?

184
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you had any contact with anybody?

185
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:53,364
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're asking these questions constantly to ensure that specific concern.

186
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

187
00:27:56,806 --> 00:28:00,868
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place this on file, second and by?

188
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

189
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,908
[SPEAKER_06]: My counsel, Dr. Pelley, all those in favor?

190
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:05,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

191
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,192
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're under suspension.

192

[SPEAKER_00]: 2-0, 2-8-2 while under suspension.

[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:51,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Amendment A, classification CAF-15 presently states that it applies as follows.

00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:58,194
[SPEAKER_06]: CAF-15, sealer of weights and measures slash recreation director.

[SPEAKER_06]: The language of CAF-15 shall be amended to read as follows.

205
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:04,896

00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:08,336

[SPEAKER_06]: Amendment B. Classification CAF 11 presently states that it applies as following.

208
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:16,100
[SPEAKER_06]: CAF 11, Assistant City Clerk.

209

[SPEAKER_06]: The language of CAF 11 shall be amended to read as follows.

210
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:23,784
[SPEAKER_06]: CAF 11, Assistant City Clerk, Director of Community Affairs.

211
00:30:24,384 --> 00:30:27,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

212
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:27,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

213
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

214
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:29,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on one second.

215
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:33,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we do have representatives from the administration here,

216
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:37,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on?

217
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on now, okay.

218
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

219
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know we have representatives from the administration here as well.

220
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:53,531
[SPEAKER_04]: In my conversation with the mayor earlier this afternoon, it's my understanding that these two amendments would create classifications that are more in line with the functions and responsibilities that these individuals are performing in their office.

221
00:30:54,411 --> 00:31:00,553
[SPEAKER_04]: The first amendment, amendment A, for director of communications, it's my understanding, would be a reflective title of the position that was held by Ms.

222
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:00,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Devaney.

223
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:02,596
[SPEAKER_04]: under the previous administration.

224
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:08,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also my understanding that the Director of Community Affairs position under Amendment B would be reflective of the position that Ms.

225
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:10,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Fisk held under the previous administration.

226
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:16,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So what this is, Mr. President, is actually bringing their functional titles to be in line with the duties and responsibilities.

227
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But I won't steal Dave's thunder.

228
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Let him give us a brief synopsis of what's going on.

229
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:22,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd appreciate it.

230
00:31:22,452 --> 00:31:23,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't have said it better.

231
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,014
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's exactly right.

232
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:27,636
[SPEAKER_16]: So we took a hard look at this, and this was

233
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,794
[SPEAKER_16]: This is in line with the mayor's vision for the mayor's office, and kind of being more transparent.

234
00:31:33,814 --> 00:31:38,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, you're going to hear me say that quite a bit, of what the duties and responsibilities are.

235
00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:39,318
[SPEAKER_16]: These jobs were both posted.

236
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:42,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Job descriptions are available for anybody that would like to take a look at them.

237
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,242
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's exactly like Councilor Neilsen.

238
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:52,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Mr. President, if I may, I spoke with the mayor last Thursday or Friday about the same issue, requested job descriptions.

239
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:57,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I know she forwarded them to the city clerk's office, and the city clerk had distributed them to the members of the body as well.

240
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:58,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I, for one, Councilor,

241
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:00,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any issue with this paper.

242
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:07,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the mayor deserves the right to be able to surround herself with her own team for what she feels is going to make her time in the corner office successful.

243
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:10,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I move for approval of the paper, Mr. President.

244
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:12,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an ordinance, so it's going to have to go through three readings.

245
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:17,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

246
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to clarify.

247
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So these don't have any impact on the budget as far as these changes.

248
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:25,089
[SPEAKER_03]: These are simply entitled only, and they don't remove any other.

249
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,092
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not replacing any other positions, correct?

250
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,313
[SPEAKER_16]: No, these are lateral.

251
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:32,755
[SPEAKER_16]: So the effect on the budget is to be determined.

252
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,557
[SPEAKER_16]: We're modeling that stuff out now.

253
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:49,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Determine because it's when when there's a transition it's often hard to model exactly how what the year-end is going to look like Based on transitions and vacation buyouts and other issues that are involved with the budget So we're doing our best to model that out and make this as budget Softening as possible.

254
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:50,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

255
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:50,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

256
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:56,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you On the motion by councillor night seconded by councillor Scott Perry.

[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, while we're in the suspension.

274
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:23,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes.

275
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:24,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Paper 20-094.

00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:48,038
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-094 offered by Councilor Marks be it resolved that the waste management contract be discussed regarding condominium participation.

277
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Click your button.

278
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:55,767
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

279
00:33:58,715 --> 00:33:59,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

280
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:00,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

281
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:17,844
[SPEAKER_19]: I put this on tonight's agenda because I had several residents that reside in condos, in particular Maple Park condominiums that reached out to me recently regarding waste pickup.

282
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:30,626
[SPEAKER_19]: And they asked me the question, which I've actually received over the years from other condo people in the community, why don't they pick up my trash, the city?

283
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:39,568
[SPEAKER_19]: We pay the same tax rate that any other good paying taxpayer pays in this community, and we don't get trash service.

284
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:42,229
[SPEAKER_19]: So I did a little homework, Mr. President.

285
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:47,370
[SPEAKER_19]: We have probably about eight or nine residents from Maple Park, and I appreciate they all came out tonight.

286
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:50,407
[SPEAKER_19]: because this issue is very important to them.

287
00:34:51,708 --> 00:35:07,172
[SPEAKER_19]: But I did a little homework, Mr. President, pulled out the contract that was signed by the city of Method and Waste Management back in August of 2010, August 25th to be precise.

288
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:11,393
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a ten year contract which actually ends this year.

289
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:23,977
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's my understanding in talking to DPW, what resulted from the contract back in 2010 was the city went around to all the different condo associations.

290
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:29,979
[SPEAKER_19]: And they touched base with each condo association, saying, we're signing an agreement with waste management.

291
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,859
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a 10-year agreement.

292
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:40,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you interested, as an association, to have either recycle or trash pickup at your building?

293
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:47,955
[SPEAKER_19]: And for a number of different reasons, many associations said, you know what, we are interested in having both.

294
00:35:48,556 --> 00:36:01,509
[SPEAKER_19]: And the city added their condo to the contract, which I have a copy of all the condominium associations and whether or not they get trash, recycle, a combination or none.

295
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,153
[SPEAKER_19]: And so at the time, they went around to all the condos.

296
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:13,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Some condos, like Maple Park Condo, opted at the time not to do trash pickup.

297
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:16,845
[SPEAKER_19]: They currently have recycle pickup, but not trash.

298
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:29,404
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was based on, I guess, the board of directors of the condo association, and they decided not to do it.

299
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:39,193
[SPEAKER_19]: But within the contract, Mr. President, and I won't read it, it's a lengthy contract, but on page six of the contract under section 12,

300
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:51,840
[SPEAKER_19]: It states the contractors shall collect refuse weekly and recyclables every other week from condominiums as listed on exhibit D. And that's what I refer to.

301
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:57,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Exhibit D shows you all the different condo buildings and whether or not they have recycle or trash.

302
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:19,299
[SPEAKER_19]: It says, Exhibit D, as from time to time may be amended subject to compensation as specified in Section 23.3, condominiums will be required to provide rubbish dumpster and recycling cots compatible with contractor's vehicles at their own cost.

303
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:27,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Condominiums that require services greater than specified herein will be directed to purchase additional service

304
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:31,083
[SPEAKER_19]: outside of this agreement from a vendor of their choice.

305
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:40,868
[SPEAKER_19]: So at the time, Mr. President, Maple Park Condo, and like I said, there are other condos that are in the same boat, decided not to do the trash pickup.

306
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:43,429
[SPEAKER_19]: And then some years later, they say, you know what?

307
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,831
[SPEAKER_19]: At this point, we'd like to start trash pickup with the city.

308
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:59,582
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm being told from the DPW department that in order to do so, if Maple Park wanted to join the contract, they can do it one of two ways.

309
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:03,606
[SPEAKER_19]: They can ask during budget period, which is coming up very shortly,

310
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:23,904
[SPEAKER_19]: to have the city, because we have a fixed amount every year that we put into the waste management contract, and if we were going to bring on a new condo association, that would increase the contract amount, naturally, that we would have to add to the budget based on the newcomers into the program.

311
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:25,826
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be the first way.

312
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:33,410
[SPEAKER_19]: If Maple Park and other condos said, you know what, we'd be interested now in joining, please sign us up.

313
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,532
[SPEAKER_19]: The city would have to make compensation within the budget to account for that.

314
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:41,714
[SPEAKER_19]: The second way, Mr. President, is the way of

315
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:43,274
[SPEAKER_19]: The contract ends in 2020.

316
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,195
[SPEAKER_19]: So it ends this year.

317
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:46,576
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a 10-year contract.

318
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:47,696
[SPEAKER_19]: It ends this year.

319
00:38:48,556 --> 00:39:02,722
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not sure how this new administration will go about doing this, but I would assume it might be similar to what they did 10 years ago and reach out once again to all the condo associations in the city and saying, would you like to participate?

320
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:12,327
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can gather a new list at the end of this contract, which is this year, and have the city fund this brand new list.

321
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:22,652
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm being told also in the past, over the last ten years, based on a by request, the past mayors

322
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:33,799
[SPEAKER_19]: If an association went to the previous mayors, they would make their case for why they need recycling or trash pickup through the city, and the mayor would grant it or not grant it.

323
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:43,146
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've been told that in the past, there have been condo associations that have been granted this additional pickup service through the mayor's office.

324
00:39:44,666 --> 00:40:06,652
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm offering tonight, Mr. President, a way that not only Maple Park, but the other condominium associations that I have on this particular list, like Craddock Cove, I think the Regency Condo, Wellington Condo, there's a number of other condos in the city that may opt to participate.

325
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:16,195
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm asking through this resolution, and I'd like to hear from some of the residents also, Mr. President, that the mayor determine how she wants to handle it.

326
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:22,784
[SPEAKER_19]: If she wants to do it in this year's budget, we have to make sure that the condos that want to participate

327
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:37,435
[SPEAKER_19]: make it known and that we add that to the budget or if the mayor feels best that we wait out the five or six or seven months that are left in this 10-year contract and then just see if anyone else wants to join.

328
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:41,998
[SPEAKER_19]: That may be an easier way, Mr. President, but I'll leave that up to the administration.

329
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:43,479
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not up to me to decide.

330
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:54,162
[SPEAKER_19]: But based on my findings, Mr. President, the contract, in my opinion, does call for allowing newcomers into the contract.

331
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:58,323
[SPEAKER_19]: And it does state there'll be an associated cost for a newcomer.

332
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:08,805
[SPEAKER_19]: It also states if you have a large condo and you need more than the one pickup, which may be the case in some of the larger condos, that that's added at your own expense.

333
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:10,686
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's spelled out in the contract.

334
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:16,640
[SPEAKER_19]: But my hope tonight, Mr. President, is really to put everyone on the same playing field.

335
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,701
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we all pay taxes.

336
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:22,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had people in the past say, I pay taxes for school, but I have no school-aged kids.

337
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:26,242
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not how we work in the city of Method, Mr. President.

338
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:27,623
[SPEAKER_19]: We all pay a tax.

339
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,463
[SPEAKER_19]: We all should receive the service.

340
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:39,946
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's no reason why the condo associations and people that live in condos and pay the same tax shouldn't get that same service, Mr. President.

341
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:47,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Another issue too, Mr. President, if you don't have trash pickup, you're not eligible for bulk pickup.

342
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:58,283
[SPEAKER_19]: So someone that lives in a condo that wants to dispose of a bureau or a mattress or something, they're not eligible for the pickup that every other resident is eligible for.

343
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,325
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's unfair too.

344
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:05,670
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll have residents, one resident told me he had to take his mattress over to his friend's house.

345
00:42:07,247 --> 00:42:09,490
[SPEAKER_19]: This gentleman is not a spring chicken, Mr. President.

346
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:14,417
[SPEAKER_19]: And to have him get in his car and bring his mattress over to a friend's house is unacceptable.

347
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:18,182
[SPEAKER_19]: And they should be added, Mr. President, as well to the bulk pickup.

348
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:23,188
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to hear with some of, I know Cindy Watson's here, with a number of residents.

349
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:39,084
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that either suggestion be entertained by the mayor to ensure that Maple Park Condo and any other condo in the city that opts to enter into the program is able to do so.

350
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:40,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

351
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:40,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

352
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:46,191
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, can we please have your name and address for the record?

353
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,531
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street.

354
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:52,133
[SPEAKER_27]: First, I just want to preface this by saying thank you, Michael.

355
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:56,875
[SPEAKER_27]: Michael has had an ongoing dialogue with many of the people at Maple Park.

356
00:42:57,495 --> 00:43:07,100
[SPEAKER_27]: And just by mere fact alone tonight, there are 44 owners, residents at Maple Park, and we have more than 20% represented tonight.

357
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,541
[SPEAKER_27]: So that shows you, illustrates the commitment.

358
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,703
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, again, we're not asking for anything extra.

359
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:16,886
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just sort of an equitable situation that has been overlooked.

360
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:30,757
[SPEAKER_27]: We do have one of the residents who was on the Medford Coalition condo a few years ago and did meet with former Mayor Michael McGlynn, and it was to be resolved that bulk pickup would happen.

361
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:33,179
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, I'm not sure what happened.

362
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,200
[SPEAKER_27]: It went through the loophole.

363
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,381
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't have it.

364
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:47,571
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, just to go back to what Michael said, over 40%, probably closer to 50% of the residents in Maple Park are senior citizens.

365
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:55,898
[SPEAKER_27]: We just had a situation where there was an older couple who just moved in, and it really caused a lot of disharmony because they didn't know the rules.

366
00:43:56,098 --> 00:44:03,164
[SPEAKER_27]: It was about a mattress pickup, and the boat pickup should be something that is allowed for everybody.

367
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:06,506
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, you know, we pay taxes.

368
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:10,907
[SPEAKER_27]: We all have a beneficial interest in being an owner at Maple Park.

369
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:14,608
[SPEAKER_27]: Folks love Maple Park, and I can assure you, we follow the rules.

370
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:19,089
[SPEAKER_27]: When people come to visit me, I say it's a combination of a convent and a prison because we're so quiet.

371
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:20,089
[SPEAKER_27]: We follow the rules.

372
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:29,192
[SPEAKER_27]: We just want to follow the rules, and we want some level of, you know, reciprocal interest back so that we are able to get bulk pickup.

373
00:44:32,393 --> 00:44:32,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

374
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:36,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Would anyone else like to speak on this issue?

375
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:40,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions from the council?

376
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:41,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, don't be shy.

377
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:41,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

378
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:43,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't be shy.

379
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:53,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

380
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:54,623
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is David Eddy.

381
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:57,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a resident at Maple Park Condos.

382
00:44:58,104 --> 00:45:07,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also a co-chair of the Medford Condominium Coalition, which petitioned the city to pick up trash or condominiums throughout the city.

383
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:15,448
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time this contract was signed, we would have had to rent

384
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:25,383
[SPEAKER_01]: two dumpsters from waste management, because our dumpsters apparently are not compatible with the pickup trucks of waste management.

385
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:37,006
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost for renting those two dumpsters exceeded the cost of the private contract that we had for picking up the trash.

386
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:43,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So we still pay property taxes, like all good people do.

387
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:51,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Included in that tax is trash pickup services.

388
00:45:53,842 --> 00:46:01,985
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose to go with the private pickup because of the cost, being less expensive than waste management.

389
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:12,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still paying for trash pickup, and I don't see why we can't have the bulk items picked up at no cost to us.

390
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:16,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

391
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:17,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

392
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Would anyone else like to speak on this issue?

393
00:46:27,863 --> 00:46:28,683
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you again, Michael.

394
00:46:38,568 --> 00:46:40,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Please have your name and address for the record.

395
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:41,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Paul Mulvey.

396
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:44,791
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a resident of 65 Valley Street, Maple Park condos.

397
00:46:45,777 --> 00:46:51,500
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the things I just want, we have rules and regulations as everybody else does.

398
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:56,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And part of our, one of our rules stipulates the trash pickup.

399
00:46:56,483 --> 00:47:00,685
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a whole page and it tells us who to call.

400
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,247
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had this for years.

401
00:47:04,347 --> 00:47:06,609
[SPEAKER_22]: Now we're talking about bulk pickup.

402
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:08,670
[SPEAKER_22]: We may use this

403
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:13,080
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to say at the end, eight times a year.

404
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,900
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd say between six and eight.

405
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,021
[SPEAKER_22]: We pay between $125,000 and $140,000 in taxes.

406
00:47:18,761 --> 00:47:27,062
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're just looking for a little fairness in really what we've had before.

407
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,923
[SPEAKER_22]: Nobody can tell me how it stopped.

408
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:38,005
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we do have something, notes about a meeting with Mayor McGlynn.

409
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:43,059
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is 10 years old.

410
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,760
[SPEAKER_22]: We haven't had any problems.

411
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,281
[SPEAKER_22]: We've called these people.

412
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:52,383
[SPEAKER_22]: They said leave it at the curb, whatever it was, two weeks from then.

413
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:57,684
[SPEAKER_22]: Then all of a sudden, I would say a couple of years ago, nothing.

414
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,046
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's stupid.

415
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:06,488
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds silly that every time we have a problem, we've got to run down to City Hall and get in touch with

416
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:14,828
[SPEAKER_22]: The mayor, if we can't get in touch with anybody else, because these people don't talk to us, they just say no.

417
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:19,490
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, just saying no isn't what we're looking for.

418
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:24,973
[SPEAKER_22]: But we have other documentations and stuff too.

419
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:27,240
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my pitch.

420
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

421
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, just if I could follow up.

422
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:42,810
[SPEAKER_19]: I think part of the issue, from my understanding of talking to DPW, is that the city pays hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just for the bulk pickup contract.

423
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:51,036
[SPEAKER_19]: And at some point, it was determined that if you didn't have trash pickup, that you weren't going to be eligible for bulk pickup.

424
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:56,380
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not sure where that decision was made, if it was a unilateral decision or what.

425
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:03,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't see it in the contract, but I was told by DPW, if you don't have trash pickup, they're not going to pick up bulk.

426
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:10,311
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that was a way of trimming down the exorbitant cost of the bulk items.

427
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:16,276
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe they said they paid $22 an item in the city for bulk pickup, and it's unlimited.

428
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:23,096
[SPEAKER_19]: They only do it during the recycle period, so it's every two weeks they do the bulk pickup.

429
00:49:23,476 --> 00:49:30,244
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think that was a way of cutting cost, and that may have been when they cut the service off to Maple Park during that.

430
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,806
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure exactly when it happened.

431
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:36,211
[SPEAKER_19]: But the reason why I brought up, Mr. President, is to ask these questions.

432
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:44,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And have the administration, we have the chief of staff here, Dave Rodriguez, who I'm sure will take this back to the mayor regarding this issue.

433
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, and we'll be able to get an answer.

434
00:49:47,563 --> 00:49:48,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

435
00:49:49,004 --> 00:49:49,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

436
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:50,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

437
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:56,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I call the roll, would anybody else like to speak on this issue?

438
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:57,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Good?

439
00:49:58,571 --> 00:49:59,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

440
00:49:59,091 --> 00:49:59,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you again.

441
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:01,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for coming down tonight.

442
00:50:02,673 --> 00:50:06,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk Hurtubise, could you please read back the amendment?

443
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:15,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Council marks the amendment is to ensure that Maple Park or other condominiums can enter into the trash pickup agreement with waste management

444
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:23,258
[SPEAKER_17]: And then do you want it delineated by the two different options, or just at the administration's discretion?

445
00:50:23,278 --> 00:50:28,823
[SPEAKER_19]: We can offer those two different options to make, because it could be done in other ways, too.

446
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:31,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the two that were stated to me.

447
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:44,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Adding to this year's budget, or when the contract turns out, which is at the end of this year, that all the economy associations be out with their options.

448
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,315

475
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:17,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

476
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:17,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

477
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:19,260
[SPEAKER_24]: Ellen Brito, Chief of Staff.

478
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:24,144
[SPEAKER_24]: I really like Dave's job.

479
00:52:24,585 --> 00:52:27,208
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm chief assessor.

480
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:28,750
[SPEAKER_24]: I get so nervous up here.

481
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:32,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Alicia's out sick, and so I'm here on behalf of.

482
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:33,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

483
00:52:35,315 --> 00:52:36,676
[SPEAKER_24]: She has been to the doctors.

484
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:37,537
[SPEAKER_24]: She's doing well.

485
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:39,059
[SPEAKER_24]: She'll be back to work on Thursday.

486
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,887
[SPEAKER_24]: But she's following the directive of if you don't feel good, stay home, which is a good point.

487
00:52:44,947 --> 00:52:45,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

488
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:51,215
[SPEAKER_24]: So this item is before you to allow me to

489
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:57,595
[SPEAKER_24]: acquire some items that I need to begin the fiscal 21 certification.

490
00:52:57,635 --> 00:53:02,356
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know it's a fiscal 21 item, but we really do our work this time of year.

491
00:53:03,636 --> 00:53:10,537
[SPEAKER_24]: So primarily, part of this funding is for personal property to finish the full data collection and valuation.

492
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:18,819
[SPEAKER_24]: And the state has mandated that 504 class code properties be valued a new way this year.

493
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:21,279
[SPEAKER_24]: Where I'm in a certification year,

494
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:28,954
[SPEAKER_24]: 504s are our gas distribution of natural gas, electric power transmissions and distribution.

495
00:53:28,994 --> 00:53:33,738
[SPEAKER_24]: So those companies have a new, we have new methodology to value them.

496
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:35,800
[SPEAKER_24]: I need assistance to do that.

497
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,404
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition, I have also, I'm acquiring a full

498
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:46,310
[SPEAKER_24]: blown GIS system for assessors that will also have a public interface.

499
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:55,698
[SPEAKER_24]: This GIS system will provide me with new assessors maps, new neighborhood maps, a new zoning map.

500
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,000
[SPEAKER_24]: Our zoning maps are quite old.

501
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,301
[SPEAKER_24]: We need these updated.

502
00:53:59,901 --> 00:54:06,187
[SPEAKER_24]: And the time to do it is during the reval year, so I have good data as I set the values for fiscal 21.

503
00:54:07,785 --> 00:54:14,509
[SPEAKER_24]: The other two items is NearMap, which is aerial orthographic images of the whole city.

504
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,892
[SPEAKER_24]: NearMap is a company that flies the city three times a year.

505
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:22,255
[SPEAKER_24]: They can provide me with data back to 2014.

506
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,038
[SPEAKER_24]: I met with them this past fall, and with their imagery

507
00:54:30,993 --> 00:54:32,794
[SPEAKER_24]: It's change detection software.

508
00:54:33,254 --> 00:54:44,480
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to take those flyovers and identify properties that have changed since the previous flyover, which is critical to me capturing growth for properties that didn't take out building permits.

509
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:48,222
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a check to make sure I'm doing that work.

510
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:58,427
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's why I'm asking for these funds in the middle of the year to get this work done in preparation for having a successful certification.

511
00:54:59,208 --> 00:54:59,468
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

512
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:01,803
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

513
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:03,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

514
00:55:03,624 --> 00:55:05,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Bernal, thank you for being here this evening.

515
00:55:06,464 --> 00:55:14,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm hearing is that ultimately you're coming before us this evening to ask for the tools that you need to necessarily comply with state mandates.

516
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:15,427
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

517
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:19,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And meet the objectives of the office that have been put forth by the Board of Assessors.

518
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:20,048
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

519
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:21,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, move for approval.

520
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:22,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

521
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:26,529
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears.

522
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

523
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:28,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

524
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a point of curiosity.

525
00:55:31,857 --> 00:55:38,842
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned that when they do these flyovers, they pick out homes that have been improved that didn't pull off building permits.

526
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,665
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens to those homes that didn't do that?

527
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:44,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, they're going to tell me every property.

528
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:49,030
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm going to make sure I've captured the properties that we did have permits for, but also ones without permits.

529
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:50,311
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go out.

530
00:55:50,992 --> 00:55:59,098
[SPEAKER_24]: I can sit at my desk with this technology and add on that deck or addition or new shed and put it right into the property record card

531
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:02,172
[SPEAKER_24]: But we always go out and field check them as well.

532
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,893
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's just going to help me identify them quicker.

533
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:07,734
[SPEAKER_24]: As you know, we do full cyclical cycles.

534
00:56:08,594 --> 00:56:10,455
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's a 10-year cycle.

535
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:15,476
[SPEAKER_24]: We're only about 15% of the whole city done since the last time.

536
00:56:15,856 --> 00:56:18,197
[SPEAKER_24]: This will help me get through it quicker.

537
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:19,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

538
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:20,978
[SPEAKER_24]: And capture growth.

539
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:22,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

540
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

541
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:31,078
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of console night seconded by consulate bears clicker to be please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_07]: And so we are both CCSR student leaders.

561
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:02,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And what CCSR stands for is the Center

562
00:58:03,194 --> 00:58:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Center of Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

563
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:08,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll have Elise talk about our project.

564
00:58:08,841 --> 00:58:11,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of an overview of our project.

565
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:12,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Benches for Duggar.

566
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:15,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to basically implement four benches in Duggar Park.

567
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Because right now the benches there, they're very worn down, chipped, very dirty.

568
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:34,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to implement the four benches each with different themes that kind of like represent Medford as a whole so we have LGBTQ plus diversity the arts and sports and we have a plan to like get students at Medford high to actually like

569
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:43,062
[SPEAKER_08]: put in some applications for art to put on the benches that relate to our themes, because we have many friends that are artists and definitely love to express themselves.

570
00:58:43,522 --> 00:58:48,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And over at Medford High, we have a lot of murals that represent Medford and stuff like that.

571
00:58:48,563 --> 00:58:53,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think that'd be a good idea to add a pop of color and make Medford even more beautiful than it already is.

572
00:58:54,685 --> 00:58:56,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And we already have the benches made.

573
00:58:57,026 --> 00:58:59,688
[SPEAKER_07]: They were donated to us by the New England Carpentry Union.

574
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:01,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have those benches made.

575
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:07,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So the grant money will really just help us get paint and supplies that we need for the benches.

576
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:11,434
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, we want to expand this project after we do Duggar Park.

577
00:59:11,454 --> 00:59:15,936
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to expand the project to other parks in Medford, like Morrison Park and other parks.

578
00:59:19,178 --> 00:59:19,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

579
00:59:19,878 --> 00:59:21,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the councilors have some questions.

580
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:23,360
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start off with Councilor Scarpelli.

581
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:24,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

582
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:26,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

583
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:32,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you coming up, I know that it's a little nerve wracking when you're coming up to speak, but you did a great job in presenting.

584
00:59:34,374 --> 00:59:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we've had some of your student body here before, some of your friends, and they've brought up some great initiatives, and we're so excited that

585
00:59:44,419 --> 00:59:52,904
[SPEAKER_02]: here again, and our goal is really to make Medford beautiful and share what we're truly about.

586
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:57,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the four categories you chose for Duggar Park, I think it's a great

587
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: way to spread that love.

588
01:00:02,038 --> 01:00:03,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you guys have done a great job.

589
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:05,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a great initiative.

590
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that my son John is also doing some great things with a great historian, Mr. Ken Krause.

591
01:00:14,683 --> 01:00:17,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything is nonstop and it's so exciting to see.

592
01:00:17,504 --> 01:00:20,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fully support this paper and move forward for approval.

593
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:22,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

594
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:23,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

595
01:00:24,306 --> 01:00:28,768
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't say it better than Councilor Scarpelli, but it's really great.

596
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:31,677
[SPEAKER_26]: to have you and so many students from Medford High.

597
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:33,459
[SPEAKER_26]: I was in your shoes not that long ago.

598
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:34,600
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm a Medford High grad.

599
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:42,911
[SPEAKER_26]: Just coming down here and voicing what you think we need to do to, I think you said it perfectly, make Medford more beautiful than it already is.

600
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:47,236
[SPEAKER_26]: So I look forward to seeing you work on some other parks too.

601
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:47,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

602
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:49,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

603
01:00:49,494 --> 01:00:49,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

604
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:51,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

605
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:52,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to make a suggestion.

606
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:54,803
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a PACS project.

607
01:00:55,664 --> 01:01:02,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We are well aware that the PACS department does have a revolving account that's open with modern hardware, I do believe, with a

608
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,382
[SPEAKER_04]: do purchase a lot of their paint supplies.

609
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:12,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might make sense to coordinate with IDPW because I believe we do get some bulk purchasing rates versus regular retail rates.

610
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:19,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So this $3,000 might actually end up being $4,500 if we spend it the right way with some of our in-house contacts that we have.

611
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:28,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd suggest that you meet with the PACS Commissioner, Mike Nestor, and speak with him a little bit about whether or not you guys can utilize the account that they have available.

612
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:34,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And use their bulk purchasing to get some of the supplies that you need to get this done But congratulations, wish you the best of luck.

613
01:01:34,918 --> 01:01:42,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give you the money Thank You console and I console morale Thank You mr. President.

614
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:45,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to echo my colleagues and thank you both for coming out I know you're both here early.

615
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:55,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for sticking with us and taking the time to present on this It's it's so great to have another space for public art in the city and then combining it with the actual utility of benches Is is beautiful.

616
01:01:55,372 --> 01:01:56,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for bringing this forth

617
01:01:57,751 --> 01:01:58,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

618
01:01:58,852 --> 01:01:59,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

619
01:01:59,932 --> 01:02:00,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

620
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:04,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank the two young ladies for coming up here for a fine presentation.

621
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:16,359
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to thank Mr. Trotter, Mr. Skorka for developing these young people to come up here every other week for different things and seeing them out in the community and being involved in the community.

622
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:23,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a tribute to their work, to what they've done with all these fine young men and women at the high school.

623
01:02:23,082 --> 01:02:26,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank them also for their leadership of this program.

624
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:27,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

625
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:29,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

626
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,902
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

627
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:36,592
[SPEAKER_19]: The Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, you guys continue to produce.

628
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:40,352
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one after another after another.

629
01:02:40,793 --> 01:02:42,673
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very impressive.

630
01:02:42,794 --> 01:02:50,817
[SPEAKER_19]: And I like the fact that you're getting donations, you're soliciting organizations, and you're doing it on your own.

631
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:53,439
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not saying, hey, how can you help or do this for us?

632
01:02:53,759 --> 01:02:54,839
[SPEAKER_19]: You're taking the initiative.

633
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,600
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that goes a long way.

634
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:00,042
[SPEAKER_19]: I, too, would like to see, you mentioned Morrison Park.

635
01:03:00,662 --> 01:03:02,383
[SPEAKER_19]: potentially doing this in some other parks.

636
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:12,689
[SPEAKER_19]: We in the city of Method are very fortunate to have so many beautiful parks within our neighborhoods, many of which I believe are underutilized.

637
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:19,913
[SPEAKER_19]: And to introduce something like the arts and attracting people to the parks, I think goes a long way.

638
01:03:20,313 --> 01:03:24,956
[SPEAKER_19]: And I appreciate all the effort that you've both put into this, as well as all of your fellow students.

639
01:03:25,236 --> 01:03:25,636
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank you.

640
01:03:27,162 --> 01:03:28,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

641
01:03:28,883 --> 01:03:35,285
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I agree a thousand percent with my colleagues and everything they said, great presentation.

642
01:03:35,385 --> 01:03:40,607
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the project and I think it'd be fabulous if we could roll this out in all of our parks.

643
01:03:40,647 --> 01:03:43,908
[SPEAKER_14]: We have close to probably, you think between 30, I think around 35 parks in our city.

644
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,589
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we could do this in all our parks, I think it would be great.

645
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:50,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can't say enough about the CCSR.

646
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Skorka and Mr. Trotta, they run a great program.

647
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:56,211
[SPEAKER_14]: My kids are involved in the program as well.

648
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:58,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I always say to my kids, I say, it's a FALCO requirement.

649
01:03:58,471 --> 01:03:59,931
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to be part of CCSR.

650
01:04:00,372 --> 01:04:01,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And they all are.

651
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:05,532
[SPEAKER_14]: But I can't say enough good things about the CCSR and the work that they do.

652
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,093

698
01:08:24,984 --> 01:08:28,667
[SPEAKER_26]: However, I was informed by the administration that the nomination deadline has changed.

699
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:30,549
[SPEAKER_26]: It is no longer March 16th.

700
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you have a specific date, Dave?

701
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

702
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor, I'm not sure of the exact date.

703
01:08:43,112 --> 01:08:45,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Aleesha Nunley, who I get is, I'm sorry.

704
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:48,417
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure of the exact date.

705
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:54,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I do know that we were talking about a couple of things regarding the OPEB trust fund, so I will defer to her on the exact date.

706
01:08:54,202 --> 01:08:59,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I can send a communication to you and to the rest of the council with the exact date once she returns from her illness.

707
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:00,747
[SPEAKER_16]: We're expecting this week.

708
01:09:01,448 --> 01:09:02,629
[SPEAKER_26]: That would be great.

709
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:03,930
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, you know,

710
01:09:05,064 --> 01:09:12,649
[SPEAKER_26]: The date would be great, but either way the motion that maybe we can strike the date from the motion and just say notify retirees by mail of the nomination deadline.

711
01:09:12,669 --> 01:09:12,849
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

712
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:19,014
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do know that Alicia has been working on this issue with the retirement board and trying to figure out an exact way to make sure that we do outreach to all the retirees.

713
01:09:19,314 --> 01:09:19,514
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

714
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:20,054
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

715
01:09:20,935 --> 01:09:21,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Sue, thank you very much.

716
01:09:21,755 --> 01:09:26,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Consulate Bears, you'd like to amend the original resolution to strike the date that's listed?

717
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:26,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

718
01:09:27,499 --> 01:09:31,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Just strike the words March 16th and just say retirees by mail of the nomination deadline.

719
01:09:32,062 --> 01:09:32,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Consulate Bears.

720
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:38,082
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

721
01:09:38,202 --> 01:09:38,962
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

722
01:09:39,563 --> 01:09:40,243
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

723
01:09:40,283 --> 01:09:43,445
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

724
01:09:43,465 --> 01:09:45,186
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-0-089, offered by Councilor Knight.

725
01:09:45,326 --> 01:09:51,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas rule 37 of the Medford City Council reads, insofar as these rules are not statutory sources of origin.

726
01:09:53,322 --> 01:10:06,531
[SPEAKER_14]: The same may be amended, repealed, or suspended at any meeting by the vote of four councillors, with the exception of papers to be submitted under suspension, which requires two-thirds approval of council.

727
01:10:07,111 --> 01:10:12,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Any paper to be submitted under suspension shall be read prior to the vote for suspension.

728
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:23,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Any suspension of the rules shall be put on paper prior to the vote of the suspension, so all councillors will be fully informed of the matter on which he or she will vote.

729
01:10:23,942 --> 01:10:34,968
[SPEAKER_14]: If any action is taken inconsistent with these rules, the same shall be construed to have been taken in suspension thereof, provided four counsels concur in such action.

730
01:10:35,688 --> 01:10:42,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council amend Rule 37 by striking this section in its entirety and replacing it with the following.

731
01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:45,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Amendment or suspension of the rules.

732
01:10:46,481 --> 01:11:01,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Insofar as these rules are not statutory sources of origin, the same may be amended, repealed, or suspended at any meeting by the vote of four Councilors, with the exception of papers to be submitted under suspension, which requires two-thirds approval of the counsel.

733
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:07,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Any paper to be submitted under suspension shall be read prior to the vote for suspension.

734
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:17,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Any suspension of the rule shall be put on paper prior to the vote of the suspension so all consulars will be fully informed of the matter on which he or she will vote.

735
01:11:18,225 --> 01:11:28,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, papers offered under suspension for immediate consideration shall be limited to public service announcements, condolences, recognition, celebratory, and emergency matters.

736
01:11:28,776 --> 01:11:52,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two any other papers offered at the suspension of the rule shall be tabled following in duck introduction by the sponsor without Further debate and placed on the agenda for the next regular meeting If any action is taken and consistent with these rules the same shall be construed to have been taken in Suspension there are provided for consulars concur in such action Council night

737
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

738
01:11:53,897 --> 01:12:07,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I bring this paper forward in response to the 223-2020 legal opinion of the acting city solicitor, which responded to a question asked by the President that was prompted from an inquiry from a citizen.

739
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:09,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question was,

740
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:17,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Is a paper offered under suspension, is a resolution offered under suspension a violation of the council rules because it's not on the agenda?

741
01:12:18,123 --> 01:12:23,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question was asked in the broadest of terms and the solicitor answered it in the broadest of terms and the response came back yes.

742
01:12:24,586 --> 01:12:29,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Papers that do not show up on the agenda that are brought up under suspension are violations of the open meeting law.

743
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:39,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the solicitor's response went on to go into specific detail about matters that could be reasonably foreseen and matters that could not be reasonably foreseen and emergency matters, Mr. President.

744
01:12:40,552 --> 01:12:47,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So in an effort to allow us to still raise certain issues under suspension and in review of some open meeting law,

745
01:12:47,714 --> 01:12:50,917
[SPEAKER_04]: determinations that I was able to put my hands on, one of them being the Oxbridge decision.

746
01:12:51,897 --> 01:12:59,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I came up with some language that would allow us hopefully to have the ability to still offer papers under suspension, but still comply with the open meeting law.

747
01:12:59,703 --> 01:13:09,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Because based upon the 310-2020 committee of the whole that we just had, there was a lot of discussion surrounding the solicitor's opinion and what could or could not be offered under suspension.

748
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:20,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, this is an attempt to address the solicitor's opinion and still provide us with the flexibility that's necessary based upon some open meeting law determinations that have been issued by the Office of the Attorney General.

749
01:13:21,444 --> 01:13:27,425
[SPEAKER_04]: As we are all aware, the Office of the Attorney General is the authority that's responsible for compliance with the open meeting law.

750
01:13:27,965 --> 01:13:34,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Any complaints that would be filed against this public body deliberating in violation of the open meeting law would be handled by the Office of the Attorney General, Mr. President.

751
01:13:35,686 --> 01:13:41,259
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'd like to do is ask that this paper be sent to the city solicitor for a legal review to see if it complies with her legal opinion.

752
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:52,661
[SPEAKER_04]: and get a response back, and then potentially take a look at the way that we do business internally to ensure that we have more transparency, but we still also have the ability and availability to bring papers under suspension.

753
01:13:53,502 --> 01:13:58,746
[SPEAKER_04]: The first meeting of this term, Mr. President, I did put a paper forward requesting that we change the night of our meetings from Tuesdays to Wednesdays.

754
01:13:59,286 --> 01:14:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I brought that proposal forward was because, based upon the open meeting law, you need to have 48 hours before your meeting to have the notice posted with the agenda.

755
01:14:08,854 --> 01:14:11,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Because our meetings are on Tuesday, weekends and holidays don't count.

756
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:17,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to have to get our agenda out on Friday morning or Thursday afternoon, dependent on whether or not we had a Monday holiday.

757
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would only allow us a very limited amount of time to put items on the agenda.

758
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:26,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Upon review of items that have been filed on the agenda, it was

759
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:40,589
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty one in every four, every five matters that this council discussed by way of resolution that was getting put on the agenda, was getting put on under suspension and never being actually placed on the agenda and seen by the general public when the notice was posted.

760
01:14:41,289 --> 01:14:48,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So this prompts me to bring forward another proposal for rule changes to allow us to be a little bit more transparent, to allow us to have some items on the agenda.

761
01:14:49,815 --> 01:14:56,559
[SPEAKER_04]: for discussion and deliberation or to put items on the agenda at a future date for discussion and deliberation that come up under suspension.

762
01:14:56,879 --> 01:15:01,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure in moving this matter to the city solicitor's office for a legal review.

763
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about it, Mr. President.

764
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the presentation in a box and bow.

765
01:15:07,325 --> 01:15:07,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

766
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:09,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

767
01:15:09,726 --> 01:15:10,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

768
01:15:11,027 --> 01:15:13,088
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, through the chair, to Councilor Knight.

769
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:16,650
[SPEAKER_02]: In layman's terms, if people can understand,

770
01:15:17,605 --> 01:15:25,453
[SPEAKER_02]: This resolution is really to have the voice of the people heard and not stifled, correct?

771
01:15:26,834 --> 01:15:31,960
[SPEAKER_04]: This has no impact whatsoever at all on the public participation portion of our meetings.

772
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really just related to council action.

773
01:15:34,202 --> 01:15:35,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a councilor can bring forward a resolution.

774
01:15:35,924 --> 01:15:37,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a councilor can make a motion.

775
01:15:37,846 --> 01:15:40,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So this only affects the actual conduct of councilors.

776
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:49,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And in recent, as we can see, we had some discussions about open meeting laws.

777
01:15:49,361 --> 01:16:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I applaud my fellow Councilor to look at these concerns under transparency to make sure that the people are heard and we're giving them the proper forum where we're not stifled and they're not stifled.

778
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:10,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So I applaud you with this resolution and I support it wholeheartedly.

779
01:16:10,257 --> 01:16:10,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

780
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:11,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

781
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Please have your name and address for the record.

782
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:20,043
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

783
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:27,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just looking through the language here and I noticed it was a chance maybe to bring up one of my many pet issues.

784
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:31,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is the use of the word shell.

785
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:45,934
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about making the people more able to interact with the city, and it's actually become part of the plain language federal guidelines at plainlanguage.gov.

786
01:16:46,595 --> 01:16:50,537
[SPEAKER_12]: The word must is the clearest way to convey to your audience that they have to do something.

787
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:52,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Shall is one of those officious words.

788
01:16:53,516 --> 01:16:56,100
[SPEAKER_12]: that has encumbered legal style writing for many years.

789
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,985
[SPEAKER_12]: The message that Shell sends to the audience is, this is deadly material.

790
01:17:00,726 --> 01:17:02,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Shell is also obsolete.

791
01:17:02,248 --> 01:17:04,811
[SPEAKER_12]: When was the last time you heard it used in everyday speech?

792
01:17:05,232 --> 01:17:09,538
[SPEAKER_12]: So just as a friendly amendment, because I'd love to get a small victory on this.

793
01:17:10,956 --> 01:17:12,537
[SPEAKER_12]: issue, where we can understand.

794
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:18,522
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to see, and I see shell appears elsewhere in here.

795
01:17:18,562 --> 01:17:20,103
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to go through and fix them all.

796
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:25,668
[SPEAKER_12]: But it'd be nice as we add language to the code, I think, to replace shell with must.

797
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:29,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

798
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:31,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Peers.

799
01:17:32,373 --> 01:17:33,314
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

800
01:17:34,834 --> 01:17:49,617
[SPEAKER_26]: I wanted to add that I definitely support clarification of the rules based on the opinion and also generally going through the rules and reviewing them for making sure that they're aligned with the law, modernized, and clear to the public to read.

801
01:17:49,737 --> 01:17:51,997
[SPEAKER_26]: So replacing Shiles with Musper, we can.

802
01:17:52,197 --> 01:17:52,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

803
01:17:53,057 --> 01:17:53,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

804
01:17:53,297 --> 01:17:55,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Council members, if you could please have your name and address for the record.

805
01:17:55,798 --> 01:17:56,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly.

806
01:17:56,458 --> 01:17:59,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe Villione, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Mass.

807
01:17:59,678 --> 01:18:02,419
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to see this council again.

808
01:18:05,538 --> 01:18:09,081
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my readers said it's an incorrect reading of the AG's opinion.

809
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:13,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this reader gave me permission to say this and was a former government official here.

810
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:19,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't this same issue brought to the council in April of 2019 by the same city councilor?

811
01:18:20,852 --> 01:18:22,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it the same exact wording?

812
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:28,612
[SPEAKER_11]: April 2019 and it was shot down by the council.

813
01:18:29,233 --> 01:18:37,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I do believe that pursuant to the council rules, every 90 days you can introduce a paper that's been deliberated on and addressed and deliberated to conclusion.

814
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:39,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really not too sure what he's getting at.

815
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:41,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, the city solicitor issued an opinion.

816
01:18:41,878 --> 01:18:43,039
[SPEAKER_04]: That opinion came out on February 23rd, 2020.

817
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:50,942
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not disputing that.

818
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:52,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly know the council rules.

819
01:18:54,203 --> 01:19:00,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I say respectfully, I just find it interesting that it's coming back when it was shut down.

820
01:19:00,685 --> 01:19:02,146
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's chilling free speech.

821
01:19:02,406 --> 01:19:02,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do.

822
01:19:02,766 --> 01:19:05,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm in disagreement with Councilor Scarpelli on this.

823
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:14,370
[SPEAKER_11]: When city councillors use suspension of the rules so that petitioners, many petitioners, speak at the end of the night, I find it

824
01:19:16,378 --> 01:19:18,400
[SPEAKER_11]: a kind of a quasi-censorship, if you will.

825
01:19:18,781 --> 01:19:20,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So this one concerns me a bit.

826
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you know, I run magazines.

827
01:19:22,564 --> 01:19:25,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually brought a magazine into the city just two weeks ago.

828
01:19:25,888 --> 01:19:32,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And it worked very hard to bring transparency and free speech to the city by having another newspaper here.

829
01:19:33,455 --> 01:19:35,557
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very dear to my heart, as you all know.

830
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:39,822
[SPEAKER_11]: So having the council voting on suspension of the rules,

831
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:46,870
[SPEAKER_11]: It just seems like the council wants more power and more power, and the people should have the ability to speak.

832
01:19:46,930 --> 01:20:00,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the council should consider a new rule where petitioners speak first at the city council at 7 o'clock, and then after a half hour or more, then the city council begins, and then they can suspend the rules and do whatever they want.

833
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:01,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just suggesting something.

834
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,463
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of my readers are in conflict with this, and they are very upset.

835
01:20:05,943 --> 01:20:07,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want that on the record.

836
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:08,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

837
01:20:08,245 --> 01:20:08,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

838
01:20:11,169 --> 01:20:11,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Move the question.

839
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:13,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

840
01:20:14,237 --> 01:20:14,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

841
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:17,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank Councilor Layton for bringing this forward.

842
01:20:17,986 --> 01:20:18,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's obvious that

843
01:20:20,314 --> 01:20:24,276
[SPEAKER_06]: This council has been in violation for many years, and I don't think there was any malice intended.

844
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:40,325
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has been brought to our attention that we are in violation, and we are trying to correct the rules to make sure that we are in line with the Attorney General's decision and our solicitor's opinion also.

845
01:20:40,365 --> 01:20:46,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do support sending this to the solicitor for interpretation.

846
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

847
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:48,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

848
01:20:48,925 --> 01:20:49,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

849
01:20:49,806 --> 01:20:51,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

850
01:20:52,107 --> 01:20:57,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe sending to the city solicitor, the acting city solicitor for an opinion on this change is the right thing to do.

851
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:09,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree that this is done in an effort to actually increase participation and that people can understand what's going to be on the agenda and what they can come to speak on and make plans to actually come out to the council to speak on those items.

852
01:21:10,017 --> 01:21:11,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

853
01:21:11,297 --> 01:21:12,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

854
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:20,935
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello to move this paper to the city solicitor for legal review.

855
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,237
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, all those in favor?

856
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:23,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

857
01:21:24,117 --> 01:21:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

858
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,199
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

859
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,118
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-090, offered by Council of the Night.

860
01:21:31,698 --> 01:21:34,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Ordinance establishing an extended illness leave bank.

861
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,323
[SPEAKER_14]: There shall be an extended illness leave bank for employees of the city who participate therein.

862
01:21:40,903 --> 01:21:44,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Extended illness advisory board appointment eligibility term.

863
01:21:44,805 --> 01:21:47,907
[SPEAKER_14]: There shall be an extended illness leave bank advisory board.

864
01:21:48,307 --> 01:21:55,492
[SPEAKER_14]: This board shall consist of five members that are city employees appointed by the mayor no later than 30 days following passage.

865
01:21:56,252 --> 01:21:59,213
[SPEAKER_14]: These appointments shall be subject to council approval.

866
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:05,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members will serve a term of 24 months from the date of council confirmation.

867
01:22:06,056 --> 01:22:10,458
[SPEAKER_14]: No more than two board members shall be employees at will.

868
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:11,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Administration.

869
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:23,384
[SPEAKER_14]: The director of personnel shall administer the bank in accord with the rules and regulations established by the Extended Illness Leave Bank Advisory Board and shall be precluded

870
01:22:23,744 --> 01:22:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: from serving as a member of this board.

871
01:22:27,145 --> 01:22:29,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Implementation, participation requirements.

872
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:39,788
[SPEAKER_14]: The Extended Illness Advisory Board shall prescribe regulations governing its operation no later than 60 days following confirmation of its fifth member.

873
01:22:40,268 --> 01:22:50,070
[SPEAKER_14]: The Extended Illness Advisory Board may alter, amend, and update these regulations from time to time thereafter by majority vote of its members.

874
01:22:56,688 --> 01:23:02,975
[SPEAKER_14]: This shall make one-time investment of 75 leave days to establish the Extended Illness Leave Bank.

875
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:15,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Thereafter, any employee of the City who has completed one year of service may participate by donating to said bank any earned sick, personal, or vacation leave time in such amount

876
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:24,757
[SPEAKER_14]: with such frequency as said regulation shall permit to maintain a sufficient balance in the bank, but not less frequently than annually.

877
01:23:25,577 --> 01:23:34,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Upon medical verification pursuant to such regulations, a participating employee with an extended illness who has exhausted all other earned leave

878
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:46,479
[SPEAKER_14]: And who has been on leave because of such extended illness for not less than 20 consecutive work days may obtain from said bank additional paid leave or not more than 120 days in any two year period.

879
01:23:50,031 --> 01:24:03,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Current employees with all other earned leave exhausted who have been on leave because of extended illness shall be eligible to seek benefits from the Extended Illness Leave Bank retroactively to January 1st, 2020.

880
01:24:06,252 --> 01:24:14,035
[SPEAKER_14]: It shall not be required to donate to said bank any earned sick, personal, or vacation leave time to participate.

881
01:24:14,695 --> 01:24:23,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Said regulations shall provide safeguards against use of said bank by employees who have improperly used existing sick leave.

882
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:32,883
[SPEAKER_14]: The head of each city department shall not less than twice annually provide written notice to each employee of the opportunity to participate in said bank.

883
01:24:33,877 --> 01:24:46,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Upon receipt of the first such notice, each employee shall be required to sign a form issued by the city indicating that such employee has been informed of the opportunity to participate in said bank.

884
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:57,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing contained herein shall affect existing collective bargaining agreements containing provisions relating to the establishment of extended illness leave banks.

885
01:25:00,407 --> 01:25:00,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

886
01:25:01,321 --> 01:25:03,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

887
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:08,976
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an attempt to establish an extended illness leave bank by ordinance for all city and school department employees.

888
01:25:09,837 --> 01:25:16,922
[SPEAKER_04]: An extended illness leave bank is a bank where existing employees can donate one of their leave days to a pool.

889
01:25:17,642 --> 01:25:25,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And if one of their co-workers suffers a catastrophic injury or illness, they're able to draw down upon those leave days if they've exhausted all of their own.

890
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:33,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are certain parameters and requirements that are in place to be sure the people that become eligible to draw down these extended illness leave days aren't sick leave abusers.

891
01:25:35,185 --> 01:25:43,286
[SPEAKER_04]: The state has a very similar program, and when I say very similar, I copied the language from Massachusetts General Law Chapter 4, Section 7P.

892
01:25:43,646 --> 01:25:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Chapter 7, Section 4P, to create this ordinance.

893
01:25:47,407 --> 01:25:54,708
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just put in that advisory council language, Mr. President, how we're going to administer this sick leave bank.

894
01:25:55,148 --> 01:26:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'd ask is that we obviously have a committee of the whole on a piece of legislation that's this wordy with the city solicitor and the director of personnel.

895
01:26:04,509 --> 01:26:09,072
[SPEAKER_04]: to determine what steps we can take to establish an extended illness leave bank.

896
01:26:09,112 --> 01:26:18,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that we should first make a 75 day investment in the bank to get it up and running to allow existing employees that are out on extended leave to begin to draw down on the bank.

897
01:26:18,857 --> 01:26:26,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can establish an extended illness leave bank advisory council that will be able to come up with rules, regulations, monitor the program and

898
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:32,584
[SPEAKER_04]: The Director of Personnel is the Program Administrator, Mr. President.

899
01:26:32,644 --> 01:26:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is really an attempt to try to put something in place to do something good for the residents, for the workers here in the city.

900
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:46,369
[SPEAKER_04]: When you sit back and you think about people that have suffered from catastrophic injury and catastrophic illness here in the city of Medford, you think of people like Richard Lee,

901
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: fought a very, very public battle with pancreatic cancer and wasn't able to beat it, Mr. President.

902
01:26:53,456 --> 01:26:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But had 40 years of service here in this building, but was still out for an extended period of time.

903
01:26:59,723 --> 01:27:06,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk about someone like Joe Conway or Brian Rabbit, who we all

904
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:13,663
[SPEAKER_04]: stood beside and wished him well wishes when he's going through a very public battle with pancreatic cancer right now, Mr. President.

905
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:19,665
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that'll help employees that have been good public servants here in the community, that have given their all to the community.

906
01:27:19,825 --> 01:27:30,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that we can put something in place that provides a protection and a safeguard for these employees, so that if something unforeseen and catastrophic does happen related to their health or their physical well-being, that there's a safety net that's there for them.

907
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We value our employees, and I think that we should make steps to show it.

908
01:27:35,812 --> 01:27:36,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

909
01:27:37,321 --> 01:27:42,442
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Bears.

910
01:27:44,182 --> 01:27:45,103
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

911
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:49,343
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to say thank you to Councilor Knight for directing this, and that I strongly support it.

912
01:27:50,584 --> 01:27:54,745
[SPEAKER_26]: In my past, I was a federal employee, and I believe we had a similar program.

913
01:27:55,185 --> 01:28:03,386
[SPEAKER_26]: And I also know that the state has that same program, and it's incredibly helpful and important to folks who are going through difficult extended illnesses.

914
01:28:03,406 --> 01:28:04,487
[SPEAKER_26]: So I strongly support this.

915
01:28:04,527 --> 01:28:06,447
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, thank you and support the motion.

916
01:28:06,837 --> 01:28:07,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you Councilor Bears.

917
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpel.

918
01:28:09,723 --> 01:28:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I too applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

919
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:15,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as a municipal worker.

920
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:36,426
[SPEAKER_02]: who's someone who doesn't take sick days, people that are out there might question even with this intent, you know, that this is compromising city funding, but what they make sure they understand the way that it works is when people retire with the bank of sick days, they're then bought out.

921
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:43,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you could look at, we're going through that right now where we have a custodian that is battling

922
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:58,794
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, and he has a family of four, and he looks like, thank God, he's going to pull through, but without the sick bank process that we have in the community that I work in, that individual would have lost his home.

923
01:28:58,894 --> 01:29:05,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are real issues, and this is what I think what Medford's all about, in helping your neighbor and your

924
01:29:06,176 --> 01:29:11,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually shocked that I didn't know that we didn't have it in place.

925
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:14,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So I applaud Councilor Knight and I second the resolve, so thank you.

926
01:29:14,823 --> 01:29:15,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

927
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:16,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

928
01:29:16,925 --> 01:29:17,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

929
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.

930
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:25,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a good thing to have people who do exhaust their leave.

931
01:29:25,452 --> 01:29:26,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I have just one question.

932
01:29:26,613 --> 01:29:34,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a maximum on what other people can donate into the bank or just anything you want?

933
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:57,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Based upon the language of the ordinance that is proposed, it gives discretionary authority to the extended on this lead bank advisory committee to come up with the regulations to determine what will work for both the workers in the community, what will work for the city in the school department, because we don't want to obviously also have a financial situation.

934
01:29:57,970 --> 01:30:05,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much, aside from the 75 days that first get dumped into the pool by the government, after that, it's all donated days.

935
01:30:05,738 --> 01:30:09,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And the parameters would be established by the extended illness leave bank advisory committee.

936
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:13,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So no parameters has been established on how many days people can put in?

937
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:14,347
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

938
01:30:15,188 --> 01:30:19,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the language says, and it's right in the second paragraph, I think.

939
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:40,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Any employees completed one day of service may participate by donating to said bank any earned, sick, personal, or vacation leave time in such an amount and with such frequency as said regulations shall permit to maintain a sufficient balance in the bank, but not less frequently than annually.

940
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:43,060
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

941
01:30:43,181 --> 01:30:48,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So the board will convene to establish the parameters of this also, correct?

942
01:30:48,064 --> 01:30:50,225
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the power to promulgate rules and regulations, yes.

943
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:50,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

944
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:52,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

945
01:30:54,244 --> 01:30:55,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing this forward.

946
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:58,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's long overdue.

947
01:30:58,048 --> 01:31:00,270
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad that you brought this forward tonight.

948
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:09,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to move this to Committee of the Whole meeting, and we will invite the city solicitor and the director of personnel.

949
01:31:10,854 --> 01:31:12,596
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, all those in favor?

950
01:31:13,036 --> 01:31:13,697
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

951
01:31:13,717 --> 01:31:14,578
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

952
01:31:14,598 --> 01:31:23,848
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-091, offered by Councilor Knight, whereas Rule 18 of the rules of the Medford City Council reads, every order and resolution must be endorsed.

953
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:31,336
[SPEAKER_14]: No order or resolution shall be received or acted upon unless endorsed by a member of the Council.

954
01:31:33,092 --> 01:31:39,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council amend Rule 18 by striking the section and replacing it with the following.

955
01:31:39,874 --> 01:31:41,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Every order and resolution must be endorsed.

956
01:31:42,674 --> 01:31:43,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Filing of petitions.

957
01:31:44,495 --> 01:31:48,896
[SPEAKER_14]: For the purposes of the section, the following definitions shall apply.

[SPEAKER_14]: Only petitions filed

964
01:32:31,877 --> 01:32:36,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Only petitions filed meeting this criteria shall be assigned a council paper number.

965
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:45,405
[SPEAKER_14]: All other petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda and not assigned a council paper number.

966
01:32:45,986 --> 01:32:46,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

967
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:48,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

968
01:32:48,828 --> 01:32:54,451
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a companion paper to the one relative to the rules that we discussed earlier, 20089.

969
01:32:56,868 --> 01:33:02,990
[SPEAKER_04]: What this paper does is it defines what an order is, what a resolution is, what a petition is, and establishes a process, Mr. President.

970
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:17,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we've seen, especially around election time, the inordinate number of petitions that get filed at the rail to discuss issues that aren't necessarily something that requires a council vote, a special permit, a signed reversal, grant a location, and the like, Mr. President.

971
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:21,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So only a Councilor can file a resolution pursuant to our laws.

972
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:26,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a Councilor can file an order or an ordinance pursuant to council resolutions in the law.

973
01:33:26,737 --> 01:33:31,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So what this does is it just defines what a petition is, it defines who's an appropriate petitioner and who isn't.

974
01:33:31,623 --> 01:33:47,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone that's not an appropriate petitioner would still have the ability to come up to the council and discuss anything that they want to discuss with the council and appear before the council when the time is right at the meeting, during the public participation portion of the meeting, wherever that may be, because it seems like there's an appetite to move that based upon the discussion that we've had surrounding the rules.

975
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:48,441
[SPEAKER_04]: in recent days.

976
01:33:49,102 --> 01:34:06,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, this is nothing more than an attempt to provide a little bit more order, a little bit more transparency, and streamlining the process for the way that we do things so that we don't run into a situation that we discussed earlier in our committee of the whole meeting, violations of the open meeting law and circus-like atmospheres coming up here at the council meetings.

977
01:34:07,068 --> 01:34:09,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the intent of the resolution.

978
01:34:09,388 --> 01:34:10,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm bringing it forward.

979
01:34:10,529 --> 01:34:13,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, every order and resolution must be endorsed by a Councilor.

980
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:19,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the council rules also say that any paper that's on the agenda has to be disposed up to a conclusion.

981
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:27,581
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone files a petition, but they don't have official business before the council that requires the council to vote statutorily, it's in essence the filing of a resolution.

982
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:30,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be placed in the public participation portion of the agenda.

983
01:34:31,204 --> 01:34:38,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar to the matter that we have on the agenda here this evening, I do believe, under 20099.

984
01:34:40,352 --> 01:34:42,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.

985
01:34:43,473 --> 01:34:44,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

986
01:34:44,253 --> 01:34:44,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

987
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:46,674
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

988
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:53,216
[SPEAKER_26]: I think assessing our rules, making sure they're good definitions, strong definitions and processes are important.

989
01:34:54,956 --> 01:35:07,940
[SPEAKER_26]: One, whatever the point of action is going forward, I think part of the conversation for me would be on making, addressing rule 33, which is what is the rule that addresses the structure of council agendas and kind of aligning out with this.

990
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:08,480
[SPEAKER_26]: And then also

991
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:20,523
[SPEAKER_26]: making sure we have clear definitions of public participation as relates to the council rules and also that those are clearly explained to the public through the city website and other means.

992
01:35:22,243 --> 01:35:28,505
[SPEAKER_26]: And just making sure that we are providing equal public participation to what we provide now, I think is important.

993
01:35:28,845 --> 01:35:33,627
[SPEAKER_26]: So as discussion goes forward, I think it's important to keep those things in mind.

994
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:35,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

995
01:35:36,548 --> 01:35:38,088
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

996
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, Joe Viglione, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Mass.

997
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,626
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm somewhat in agreement with Mr. Knight.

998
01:35:44,766 --> 01:35:47,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like having specifics.

999
01:35:47,429 --> 01:35:47,989
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.

1000
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:49,911
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a slippery slope, though.

1001
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:58,620
[SPEAKER_11]: If people are coming up here and it's election time and they want to give information, how do we work with that?

1002
01:35:58,660 --> 01:35:59,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take an example.

1003
01:36:01,002 --> 01:36:02,263
[SPEAKER_11]: With the new rules for

1004
01:36:05,146 --> 01:36:08,549
[SPEAKER_11]: filing and for the petitions and such.

1005
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:16,094
[SPEAKER_11]: What if a city council uses condolences and birthdays for people that aren't as recognizable as others?

1006
01:36:16,214 --> 01:36:17,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that considered campaigning?

1007
01:36:17,955 --> 01:36:23,699
[SPEAKER_11]: So where you have on one hand the condolences and birthdays are allowed under suspension of the rules,

1008
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:30,624
[SPEAKER_11]: A council can abuse that and file more of those than actual motions and resolutions.

1009
01:36:30,944 --> 01:36:32,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is a slippery slope.

1010
01:36:32,385 --> 01:36:37,268
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do love the idea of having petitioners come up because I like free speech and want to see more people.

1011
01:36:37,308 --> 01:36:40,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could start the council at 6 or 7 p.m.

1012
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:44,832
[SPEAKER_11]: and have a public participation, do what you want with the rest of the night.

1013
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:45,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1014
01:36:45,893 --> 01:36:46,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1015
01:36:46,874 --> 01:36:47,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Council night.

1016
01:36:48,440 --> 01:37:01,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe the term is referred to as bully pulpit, Mr. President, and when you become an elected councilor, you have the right to file any resolution or order that you'd like, and it comes up to the rest of your colleagues to determine whether or not they feel as though that's something that they want to pass on.

1017
01:37:01,244 --> 01:37:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I thank the gentleman for coming up here and agreeing with me, and I hope we can move forward on the issue.

1018
01:37:06,006 --> 01:37:06,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1019
01:37:08,867 --> 01:37:10,407
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1020
01:37:10,427 --> 01:37:11,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I second.

1021
01:37:11,548 --> 01:37:13,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

1022
01:37:13,068 --> 01:37:13,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1023
01:37:14,008 --> 01:37:14,609
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1024
01:37:15,249 --> 01:37:15,969
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1025
01:37:19,155 --> 01:37:19,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the motion, yeah.

1026
01:37:20,296 --> 01:37:21,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion for, yeah, approval.

1027
01:37:23,857 --> 01:37:26,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that was approval of a rule change.

1028
01:37:26,839 --> 01:37:28,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, sorry, but thank you for clarifying.

1029
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:32,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

1030
01:37:36,964 --> 01:37:41,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I was not under the impression we were voting for a rule change, so I may have missed that.

1031
01:37:43,587 --> 01:37:47,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, are you asking that we

1032
01:37:48,223 --> 01:37:49,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Asking for reconsideration?

1033
01:37:49,765 --> 01:37:51,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I would ask that at this time, Mr. President.

1034
01:37:51,488 --> 01:37:51,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1035
01:37:51,788 --> 01:37:54,872
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Consular Marks to reconsider that vote.

1036
01:37:56,174 --> 01:37:56,754
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1037
01:37:56,775 --> 01:37:56,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1038
01:37:58,897 --> 01:37:59,518
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1039
01:37:59,538 --> 01:37:59,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1040
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,361
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1041
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,640
[SPEAKER_14]: The vote for reconsideration is successful.

1042
01:38:05,301 --> 01:38:07,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1043
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:08,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:18,023
[SPEAKER_19]: The reason why I state that, I don't know, I was under the impression this was going the way of every other request, either sending it to the Rules Committee or being properly vetted.

1045
01:38:18,683 --> 01:38:22,284
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really don't think this has been properly vetted, in my opinion.

1046
01:38:22,324 --> 01:38:23,864
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it has all good intention.

1047
01:38:24,905 --> 01:38:25,965
[SPEAKER_19]: However, Mr. President,

1048
01:38:26,645 --> 01:38:33,527
[SPEAKER_19]: The filing of a petition by a resident is requesting council action.

1049
01:38:35,268 --> 01:38:39,129
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is, it complies with the open meeting law.

1050
01:38:39,689 --> 01:38:40,789
[SPEAKER_19]: It appears on the agenda.

1051
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:51,893
[SPEAKER_19]: And from what I gather from this, it does state the following petition shall be reserved only for matters requiring council action per law.

1052
01:38:53,171 --> 01:39:02,120
[SPEAKER_19]: So there may be an item when someone's coming up for council help, but it's not a requirement of the council action.

1053
01:39:03,962 --> 01:39:11,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Not as was stated, special permits, grants of location, sign variance, those require council action.

1054
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:12,371
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no way around it.

1055
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:33,344
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think this is kind of a slippery slope, Mr. President, that it limits speech of residents that want to come up and not only come up like they would under suspension, which gives zero notification, but give proper notification and look for council relief.

1056
01:39:33,925 --> 01:39:39,487
[SPEAKER_19]: And that council relief may not be something that's under our jurisdiction,

1057
01:39:41,257 --> 01:39:45,941
[SPEAKER_19]: But something that residents feel that they can get relief from the council by coming up.

1058
01:39:46,442 --> 01:39:50,305
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't want to limit that, Mr. President, and I think this language would limit that.

1059
01:39:51,547 --> 01:40:02,517
[SPEAKER_19]: So I cannot support that, Mr. President, unless this is properly vetted out to make sure that we're not limiting residents in the ability to come up here and speak or file a petition.

1060
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:04,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1061
01:40:05,071 --> 01:40:05,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1062
01:40:06,092 --> 01:40:14,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe if the gentleman reads down to the next sentence, all of the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda and not assigned to council paper number.

1063
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody that does file a petition that doesn't comply with the statutory mandates that require council action would then be placed on public participation and still have the opportunity to show up on the agenda under public participation, still have the opportunity to appear before this body and speak just like they have in the past.

1064
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:42,387
[SPEAKER_04]: just whether or not they get assigned a council paper number because it's really filing of a resolution if you're getting assigned a paper number because our council rules require us to dispose of all items on the agenda.

1065
01:40:43,067 --> 01:40:49,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what my intent was, Mr. President, to clarify and streamline.

1066
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:51,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1067
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:52,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1068
01:40:52,461 --> 01:41:12,374
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, I understand Councilor Marks' hesitation, but I think the meeting we just had in the subcommittee that outlined the limitations we have as a council now that limits our residents to come up and speak, I support this for the fact that being sponsored and having

1069
01:41:13,815 --> 01:41:21,300
[SPEAKER_02]: an avenue to make sure that the constituent has a voice and is on the agenda as we move forward.

1070
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:28,145
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think this is going to be a huge culture change in understanding what we can talk about.

1071
01:41:28,545 --> 01:41:43,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Councilman Mark said, I know that the biggest issue we had in subcommittees where in the past a resident would come up, have a concern, a serious concern, but we would support that by having a dialogue.

1072
01:41:44,155 --> 01:41:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: by the rule now, that violating the open meeting law, that limits that now.

1073
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:53,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It eliminates that completely.

1074
01:41:54,103 --> 01:42:05,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't talk about it, so Mrs. Jones comes up and talks about some serious issue that we need the police involved in, something that I believe was emergency or

1075
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:09,278
[SPEAKER_02]: natural disaster that we can speak on at the meeting.

1076
01:42:09,799 --> 01:42:12,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So it limits different speaking points.

1077
01:42:12,725 --> 01:42:14,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this, I support it for the fact that

1078
01:42:16,095 --> 01:42:25,223
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's an issue, we have a constituent that has a problem, we assign the number to it, we sponsor it as a council, and make sure that that issue is presented.

1079
01:42:25,263 --> 01:42:28,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is why I feel that it's needed.

1080
01:42:28,305 --> 01:42:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all in the same breath.

1081
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:34,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all looking at making sure that our constituents are heard.

1082
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:39,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And understand again that this is going to be a big change for what we're used to.

1083
01:42:41,084 --> 01:42:58,357
[SPEAKER_02]: when doing business, when people come to that podium, because what we were told by ruling of the attorney general is that we can't talk to you as a council in fear of violating the open meeting law on concerns and issues that are brought to that podium.

1084
01:42:58,837 --> 01:43:04,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether we like it or not, this is the reason why I support Councilor Knight's motion.

1085
01:43:04,962 --> 01:43:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, thank you.

1086
01:43:07,164 --> 01:43:08,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1087
01:43:08,284 --> 01:43:08,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1088
01:43:09,912 --> 01:43:10,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1089
01:43:10,713 --> 01:43:11,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I just want to reiterate.

1090
01:43:11,873 --> 01:43:15,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is really just the changing of how numbers are assigned.

1091
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:16,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not limiting speech.

1092
01:43:17,057 --> 01:43:28,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And to Councilor Behr's point, the gentleman's point, and just discussions we had about perhaps looking at our rules in general, maybe it is an option to move that public participation to the beginning of the meeting and in the interest of the community.

1093
01:43:28,446 --> 01:43:30,287
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not limiting speech.

1094
01:43:30,327 --> 01:43:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simply just procedural.

1095
01:43:32,048 --> 01:43:33,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So I support it.

1096
01:43:33,509 --> 01:43:34,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1097
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:35,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1098
01:43:36,107 --> 01:43:37,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the motion.

1099
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:51,413
[SPEAKER_26]: If it's still going to be moved for approval, I'd like to amend it or add a B paper that at a future committee of the whole meeting, we review the rules for public participation and review the order of the agenda pursuant to rule 33.

1100
01:43:51,453 --> 01:43:51,693
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

1101
01:43:51,733 --> 01:43:52,913
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1102
01:43:56,301 --> 01:43:56,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Council peers.

1103
01:43:56,822 --> 01:43:58,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you repeat that for the coat?

1104
01:43:58,643 --> 01:44:19,377
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure that we review any rules pursuant to public participation and also that we review and update rule 33 which outlines the Order of how we address things on the council agenda Yes, yes committee the whole correct

1105
01:44:20,174 --> 01:44:24,517
[SPEAKER_26]: And it could be the same committee of the whole as rules review in general.

1106
01:44:24,698 --> 01:44:25,558
[SPEAKER_26]: Get it done all at once.

1107
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1108
01:44:31,783 --> 01:44:35,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So Councilor Bears has offered a B paper, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1109
01:44:36,327 --> 01:44:37,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1110
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:40,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1111
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:46,535
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is petitions, presentation, and similar papers, right?

1112
01:44:46,595 --> 01:44:48,216
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what the section it falls under.

1113
01:44:52,708 --> 01:45:04,772
[SPEAKER_19]: So if someone wants to come up and make a presentation that the council has no bearing on, that would come under public participation or petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

1114
01:45:05,152 --> 01:45:14,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Or are we amending or eventually going to amend this to have what my colleagues are stating, having the agenda coincide with what we're trying to do?

1115
01:45:16,495 --> 01:45:18,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, do you want to comment on that?

1116
01:45:19,759 --> 01:45:25,183
[SPEAKER_04]: If the paper doesn't fall within the parameters of what a petition is defined as, then it would be pushed into public participation.

1117
01:45:26,764 --> 01:45:30,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't propose any order of business changes to the council rules.

1118
01:45:30,947 --> 01:45:34,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to put something together and offer that next week if you guys want me to.

1119
01:45:34,409 --> 01:45:35,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like I'm on fire.

1120
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:42,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know it's the plain language reads.

1121
01:45:42,235 --> 01:46:01,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You know if it's not something that the council is required to act on by law It's not if we if it's something that you know if we don't act on it's going to be constructively accepted Then it will go to public participation presentations and all of that can go right to public participation unless they're requested by a council of a council at sponsoring someone to come and do a presentation and

1122
01:46:03,772 --> 01:46:11,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. President, I think if the council takes a vote to say we want INSTA to come and do a presentation on the pipeline project, that's one thing.

1123
01:46:11,537 --> 01:46:17,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But if someone shows up and says, I want to talk about the Red Sox middle relievers, you know what I mean?

1124
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That goes to public participation.

1125
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:21,263
[SPEAKER_04]: We're asking someone to come and give us a presentation.

1126
01:46:21,283 --> 01:46:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing.

1127
01:46:21,723 --> 01:46:24,745
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone wants to discuss with us what's going on, that should happen in public participation.

1128
01:46:26,866 --> 01:46:29,228
[SPEAKER_19]: So is the issue that it's assigned a number?

1129
01:46:29,808 --> 01:46:30,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that what the issue is?

1130
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:40,454
[SPEAKER_04]: In just in looking at the rules when I was reviewing the suspension of the rule stuff and then I saw the petition as well and you know no order or resolution should be

1131
01:46:41,809 --> 01:46:43,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be filed by anybody but a councilor.

1132
01:46:43,531 --> 01:46:47,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So once that paper gets filed and it gets a number on it, that's a resolution number.

1133
01:46:47,675 --> 01:46:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a council paper number.

1134
01:46:49,097 --> 01:46:51,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's someone filing an ordinance that's not a member of the board or the body.

1135
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:52,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1136
01:46:53,181 --> 01:46:55,283
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1137
01:46:55,303 --> 01:46:58,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have to dispose of all items on the agenda that are given a board number.

1138
01:46:58,427 --> 01:47:02,171
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's a distinction between a resolution and a petition, correct?

1139
01:47:02,898 --> 01:47:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to dispose of all items on the agenda, regardless.

1140
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Only a council can file something.

1141
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:07,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Receive and place on file.

1142
01:47:08,302 --> 01:47:10,064
[SPEAKER_19]: This council's been doing that for 100 years.

1143
01:47:10,564 --> 01:47:11,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's how we dispose of things.

1144
01:47:11,885 --> 01:47:12,526
[SPEAKER_19]: So if someone comes up.

1145
01:47:12,546 --> 01:47:13,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one way to do it.

1146
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:20,412
[SPEAKER_19]: If someone comes up and it has no bearing on the council, Mr. President, or doesn't require a council vote, you'll hear that saying all the time.

1147
01:47:20,452 --> 01:47:22,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Receive and place on file.

1148
01:47:22,874 --> 01:47:32,241
[SPEAKER_19]: I just feel that this is, Mr. President, a way of restricting people from coming up, putting something which is valid on the agenda,

1149
01:47:32,641 --> 01:47:35,904
[SPEAKER_19]: it gets signed the number as a petition, not as a resolution.

1150
01:47:36,404 --> 01:47:37,065
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a petition.

1151
01:47:37,425 --> 01:47:38,566
[SPEAKER_19]: They're two very different things.

1152
01:47:38,906 --> 01:47:41,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And a petition is requesting council action.

1153
01:47:41,849 --> 01:47:57,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if they put something on the agenda that they believe requires council action and it doesn't, that's when the council can make a decision to receive and place on file or state clearly that this doesn't require council action and hear out whatever their concern is, Mr. President.

1154
01:47:58,102 --> 01:47:59,583
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't see the reason

1155
01:48:00,484 --> 01:48:01,125
[SPEAKER_19]: to eliminate it.

1156
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:02,326
[SPEAKER_19]: I really don't.

1157
01:48:03,707 --> 01:48:05,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see the reasoning behind that.

1158
01:48:05,608 --> 01:48:09,792
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see how that, how does that increase public participation or make it easier?

1159
01:48:10,212 --> 01:48:11,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Can anyone state that to me?

1160
01:48:11,353 --> 01:48:14,816
[SPEAKER_19]: How does this make it easier for public participation?

1161
01:48:14,836 --> 01:48:17,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It streamlines our internal operations.

1162
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:17,378
[SPEAKER_19]: How?

1163
01:48:17,979 --> 01:48:18,119
[SPEAKER_19]: How?

1164
01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:26,246
[SPEAKER_19]: If someone can explain that to me, by eliminating this, the ability for some resident to come up and put this in advance on the agenda,

1165
01:48:27,014 --> 01:48:30,398
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's open and notorious, and everyone knows what they want to discuss.

1166
01:48:31,639 --> 01:48:35,384
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see how that, Mr. President, this enhances anything.

1167
01:48:37,918 --> 01:48:42,821
[SPEAKER_19]: warrants additional discussion rather than just approving a council rule.

1168
01:48:43,122 --> 01:48:49,266
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not often in my years on the council that you ever see a council rule come up, Mr. President, and approve the same night.

1169
01:48:50,887 --> 01:48:52,968
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't recall the last time it happened, Mr. President.

1170
01:48:53,328 --> 01:48:54,269
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't happen often.

1171
01:48:54,809 --> 01:48:57,491
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think this hasn't been properly vetted, Mr. President.

1172
01:48:58,132 --> 01:49:07,298
[SPEAKER_19]: And I realize that we're looking to address our maybe open meeting violations and so forth.

1173
01:49:07,998 --> 01:49:11,539
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure this accomplishes anything in that realm, Mr. President.

1174
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:18,000
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I've heard people say this doesn't do anything to decrease public participation.

1175
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,960
[SPEAKER_19]: What does it do to increase public participation?

1176
01:49:22,401 --> 01:49:23,021
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't heard that.

1177
01:49:24,741 --> 01:49:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as I stated in my presentation, Mr. President, this is more about defining the parameters of what it is that we're trying to do and streamlining the way that we do it so that our meetings don't turn into a circus-like atmosphere and environment.

1178
01:49:36,176 --> 01:49:39,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the more that we know, the more that we have it defined, the better off we are, in my opinion.

1179
01:49:40,338 --> 01:49:42,218
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's where I'm coming from.

1180
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:44,159
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no nefarious intent here, Mr. President.

1181
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:45,220
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1182
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:48,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to make sure that we do things properly and that we streamline things.

1183
01:49:48,221 --> 01:49:52,563
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten an opinion from the city solicitor that I think should be given a little bit of attention.

1184
01:49:52,743 --> 01:50:00,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, you know, a little bit serious when the solicitor gives us an opinion that says that any time you take something up that's not on the agenda or under suspension, that it's a violation of the open meeting law.

1185
01:50:01,446 --> 01:50:07,292
[SPEAKER_04]: then all the talk that surrounded that suspension talk was whether or not people were going to have the opportunity to come up to the podium and speak.

1186
01:50:07,672 --> 01:50:14,318
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a dedicated section in our agenda for people to come up to speak on any topic they want, whenever they want, however they want.

1187
01:50:14,799 --> 01:50:18,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not seeing how this is having any impact on anything.

1188
01:50:18,622 --> 01:50:21,445
[SPEAKER_04]: All it is is internal controls for the council and how the council operates.

1189
01:50:22,106 --> 01:50:23,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I could.

1190
01:50:23,976 --> 01:50:26,777
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could, and this is, I'm not directing this at Councilor Knight.

1191
01:50:26,797 --> 01:50:28,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think, and I'm not taking that away Councilor at all.

1192
01:50:28,598 --> 01:50:29,699
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not taking it that way at all.

1193
01:50:29,979 --> 01:50:31,800
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to, council rules are very important.

1194
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:32,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1195
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:41,025
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want to make sure that they're properly vetted and you know, public participation as Councilor Knight said, you can come up at any time and speak on anything.

1196
01:50:42,537 --> 01:50:52,141
[SPEAKER_19]: However, what wasn't stated is now under the open meeting law, Mr. President, you may be able to come up, but the council cannot deliberate now under the open meeting law.

1197
01:50:52,541 --> 01:51:02,644
[SPEAKER_19]: So if a resident wants to come up and speak on an issue, someone popped up tonight and wanted to speak on an issue, we can hear them out, Mr. President, but we can't deliberate.

1198
01:51:03,065 --> 01:51:05,065
[SPEAKER_19]: We cannot until they're placed on the agenda.

1199
01:51:05,566 --> 01:51:05,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Hence.

1200
01:51:07,284 --> 01:51:16,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters appears on the agenda, gives the 48-hour notice that's required by the open meeting law and the Attorney General.

1201
01:51:16,591 --> 01:51:20,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Hence, we can deliberate on something they're discussing, Mr. President.

1202
01:51:20,693 --> 01:51:22,535
[SPEAKER_19]: They're two completely different things.

1203
01:51:23,766 --> 01:51:41,742
[SPEAKER_19]: So if the council feels comfortable with doing away with a section of our agenda that allows people to come up and pre-advance, put on the agenda what they want to speak about, and hopefully have the council deliberate on it, that's petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1204
01:51:43,254 --> 01:52:02,008
[SPEAKER_19]: If we want to do away with that and say, you know what, the only one that can offer that now is anyone having business that deals with signage and so forth that requires a council vote, or variances, or whatever it might be, that's very different, Mr. President, than a resident coming up.

1205
01:52:02,689 --> 01:52:10,175
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we eliminate residents from coming up under this section and require them to come under public participation, we may be telling residents that come up

1206
01:52:11,977 --> 01:52:13,718
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't deliberate tonight, sorry.

1207
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:14,819
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see you next week.

1208
01:52:14,939 --> 01:52:15,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1209
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:17,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1210
01:52:17,421 --> 01:52:21,964
[SPEAKER_04]: The proposal says that all the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda.

1211
01:52:22,465 --> 01:52:24,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't understand why we wouldn't be able to deliberate on it.

1212
01:52:24,887 --> 01:52:26,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still on the council agenda.

1213
01:52:26,648 --> 01:52:27,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's just make sure.

1214
01:52:27,709 --> 01:52:28,589
[SPEAKER_14]: When does that happen?

1215
01:52:28,689 --> 01:52:29,950
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, if I may.

1216
01:52:30,291 --> 01:52:34,734
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you're saying is beyond the public participation, it'd be listed with no number or are you saying it's

1217
01:52:34,974 --> 01:52:36,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter if it has a number or not.

1218
01:52:36,675 --> 01:52:37,936
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's on the agenda, it's on the agenda.

1219
01:52:37,956 --> 01:52:44,519
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is that it shouldn't be assigned a number because all papers on the agenda need to be disposed of in one fashion or another.

1220
01:52:44,619 --> 01:52:46,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a consulate can file an order of resolution.

1221
01:52:47,641 --> 01:52:56,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end of the day, if someone files a petition that doesn't comply with the proposed rule change, they get put on the agenda under public participation, the section that it's appropriate for.

1222
01:53:00,558 --> 01:53:08,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But as long as it shows up on the agenda, based on the solicitor's opinion, I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to deliberate, discern, or take any further action as a body.

1223
01:53:09,512 --> 01:53:10,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's on the agenda.

1224
01:53:12,635 --> 01:53:18,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, so effectively, you're going to have someone in the city clerk's office, with all due respect, making that determination.

1225
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:33,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Whether it falls under the criteria, which was based over here, limited to special permits, grants, locations, sign variance, and common vituals license, only petitions filed meeting this criteria shall be assigned a council paper number.

1226
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:36,793
[SPEAKER_19]: All other petitions shall be placed on the public participation.

1227
01:53:37,213 --> 01:53:41,356
[SPEAKER_19]: So in effect, what we're doing is having the city clerk's office figure out

1228
01:53:41,736 --> 01:53:43,777
[SPEAKER_19]: what's going to be a petition and what's not a petition.

1229
01:53:44,797 --> 01:53:47,298
[SPEAKER_19]: And that goes under public participation.

1230
01:53:47,979 --> 01:53:54,361
[SPEAKER_04]: The city clerk is well aware of the fact that, you know, if someone applies for a grant of location, we're an administrative authority, we're a tribunal.

1231
01:53:54,881 --> 01:54:09,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an application that's necessary to be filed in the clerk's office for any of these actions to take place, whether it's a grant of location, a conviction was licensed, a sign reversal, there has to be some sort of application action that takes place in the clerk's office to prompt that to come here from an administrative standpoint in government.

1232
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1233
01:54:14,221 --> 01:54:16,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell would like to speak.

1234
01:54:16,502 --> 01:54:17,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1235
01:54:17,723 --> 01:54:24,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as I understand, I mean, the big issue with this change is just saying that this is reserved for only matters requiring council action per law.

1236
01:54:25,007 --> 01:54:29,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's just clarifying the response people can expect.

1237
01:54:29,069 --> 01:54:34,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they fall under these categories, they can expect that we can act on it as required by law as opposed to

1238
01:54:36,212 --> 01:54:42,918
[SPEAKER_03]: issue of another sort that we might not even be, we can deliberate on, but the action we can take is limited to, you know, maybe asking the administration to do something.

1239
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:44,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not under our purview by law.

1240
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:52,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is just adding clarification and helping set expectations to the public that already exist, but just being very clear about the process.

1241
01:54:52,848 --> 01:54:56,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, not about limiting speech, but just being clear about procedural things.

1242
01:54:57,151 --> 01:54:59,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I voted in favor of it.

1243
01:54:59,654 --> 01:55:01,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1244
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:07,811
[SPEAKER_13]: continue on.

1245
01:55:07,871 --> 01:55:16,814
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just wondering maybe if the council defined this petition was that where was that definition is that just part of our rules or is that part of a definition?

1246
01:55:16,834 --> 01:55:18,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1247
01:55:30,014 --> 01:55:33,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, so that definition is not a legal definition.

1248
01:55:33,035 --> 01:55:47,100
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a definition that was created by a legislature somewhere, a town council, board of aldermen, someone that said that only a petition is defined as a council action that only requires action by law.

1249
01:55:48,441 --> 01:55:54,783
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's just a made up, that's a made up term, Mr. President.

1250
01:55:57,069 --> 01:55:58,650
[SPEAKER_19]: A petition is exactly what it is.

1251
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:01,010
[SPEAKER_19]: It's requesting the council to do something.

1252
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:03,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Why does it have to be something that's required by law?

1253
01:56:07,432 --> 01:56:08,953
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't understand.

1254
01:56:09,013 --> 01:56:09,873
[SPEAKER_19]: To me, that limits.

1255
01:56:10,373 --> 01:56:12,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do we want to limit people to come up?

1256
01:56:12,514 --> 01:56:19,877
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the only... Point of information, council and I. It's about stuff that requires the council to take action.

1257
01:56:19,917 --> 01:56:20,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Official business matters.

1258
01:56:22,848 --> 01:56:26,110
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we had a Kino license that sat on the table for a number of days.

1259
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:28,872
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kino license was in our Zoning Act.

1260
01:56:29,532 --> 01:56:34,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's in our Zoning Act and we're the special permit granting authority, it falls under Chapter 48, Section 5.

1261
01:56:34,455 --> 01:56:37,197
[SPEAKER_04]: There are actions that we need to take and we need to act in a certain amount of time.

1262
01:56:37,597 --> 01:56:39,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the amount of time was 90 days.

1263
01:56:39,698 --> 01:56:46,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Failure to act within that 90-day period results in a constructive acceptance of the Kino license at that location.

1264
01:56:46,322 --> 01:56:49,985
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't take a vote on it, it's a constructive acceptance.

1265
01:56:50,025 --> 01:56:51,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It also opens us up to legal

1266
01:56:52,879 --> 01:56:56,684
[SPEAKER_04]: action because it's within our zoning act and we failed to act as a special permit granting authority.

1267
01:56:57,465 --> 01:57:07,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm trying to do, Mr. President, is delineate items that are under council purview and require council action and items that aren't under council purview and that council can't effectuate.

1268
01:57:08,382 --> 01:57:10,525
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of taking a vote and it's happening tomorrow.

1269
01:57:10,545 --> 01:57:12,827
[SPEAKER_04]: You're approved, it's done, expect to have it tomorrow.

1270
01:57:13,408 --> 01:57:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: There are certain items that come before this body that we can't do that on.

1271
01:57:17,132 --> 01:57:19,795
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of items we're asking people across the hall to do stuff for us.

1272
01:57:20,216 --> 01:57:27,064
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is if in fact we're going to have a petition that gets filed, the petition should be for something that requires council action by law so that

1273
01:57:27,284 --> 01:57:32,507
[SPEAKER_04]: We're aware that this is something that's serious business, that's part of our job, that we're required to take action on.

1274
01:57:32,527 --> 01:57:36,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that public participation is something that shouldn't happen, Mr. President.

1275
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that that section should be eliminated.

1276
01:57:39,092 --> 01:57:43,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that people should not be allowed to participate in public at all.

1277
01:57:43,314 --> 01:57:45,076
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is let's streamline the processes.

1278
01:57:45,116 --> 01:57:46,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's define what a petition is.

1279
01:57:46,657 --> 01:57:47,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say this is what a petition is.

1280
01:57:48,057 --> 01:57:51,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that requires council action because if we let the ball drop on a petition,

1281
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:54,301
[SPEAKER_04]: we open ourselves up to certain legal ramifications.

1282
01:57:54,341 --> 01:57:57,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We have certain obligations based upon the oath that we took, Mr. President.

1283
01:57:57,582 --> 01:58:00,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those things are duties and responsibilities that were required to execute.

1284
01:58:01,723 --> 01:58:20,429
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of those duties and responsibilities that come before this council that were required to execute by statute of law comes in the form of a petition by way of an application for action by the council pursuant to some sort of established and enabled legislation, whether it be the granting of locations, the reversal of signs, the issuance of convictual licenses.

1285
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:21,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1286
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:26,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So all I'm saying is a petition is reserved for those matters that require council action.

1287
01:58:26,943 --> 01:58:30,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't take it, then we're in violation and everything else can go into public participation.

1288
01:58:31,145 --> 01:58:33,307
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone wants to come before the council and speak, that's fine.

1289
01:58:33,347 --> 01:58:34,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Come before the council and speak.

1290
01:58:34,788 --> 01:58:35,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do it at the right spot of the meeting.

1291
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:38,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1292
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:39,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1293
01:58:42,512 --> 01:58:43,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Please have your name and address for the record.

1294
01:58:44,574 --> 01:58:47,395
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1295
01:58:49,257 --> 01:58:52,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I share some of Councilor Mark's concerns.

1296
01:58:52,338 --> 01:58:56,579
[SPEAKER_12]: In particular, I think that this could use a bit more vetting.

1297
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:10,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a bit confusing, because as you've been debating, sometimes it's not clear if we're debating substance, or do we like this, or is it clear?

1298
01:59:10,663 --> 01:59:12,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And so to me, that indicates it's not clear.

1299
01:59:13,163 --> 01:59:15,924
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to say that we have this phrase,

1300
01:59:16,424 --> 01:59:19,146
[SPEAKER_12]: The public participation portion of the agenda.

1301
01:59:19,706 --> 01:59:21,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I looked through my agenda.

1302
01:59:22,348 --> 01:59:23,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't see such a portion.

1303
01:59:24,549 --> 01:59:26,270
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know where it's going to be placed.

1304
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:31,613
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we need, you know, if it went to committee, perhaps they could add some language.

1305
01:59:31,653 --> 01:59:33,754
[SPEAKER_12]: There shall be a portion of the agenda.

1306
01:59:34,394 --> 01:59:34,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1307
01:59:34,695 --> 01:59:36,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Council Knight.

1308
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:38,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Rule 33, order of business, item 10, public participation.

1309
01:59:40,578 --> 01:59:41,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outlined in the rules.

1310
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:45,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't show up on the agenda because there is no public participation paper on the agenda this evening.

1311
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:48,422
[SPEAKER_04]: but it is outlined in the order of business under rule 33.

1312
01:59:48,502 --> 01:59:51,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's, that's good.

1313
01:59:52,406 --> 01:59:53,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for addressing that concern.

1314
01:59:55,048 --> 02:00:05,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Another concern is that, um, and obviously I, I, uh, maybe you should have known that in some sense, but in another sense, this should be accessible, I think, to the community that we understand it.

1315
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:07,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah.

1316
02:00:09,572 --> 02:00:12,373
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's also sort of a logical error here.

1317
02:00:12,893 --> 02:00:15,635
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is, again, if I went to committee, I suspect they'd resolve this.

1318
02:00:16,295 --> 02:00:20,657
[SPEAKER_12]: You define a petition as an application requesting council action as acquired by law.

1319
02:00:21,377 --> 02:00:29,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it says, skipping a paragraph, the filing of petitions shall be reserved only for matters requiring council action per law.

1320
02:00:30,041 --> 02:00:31,501
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it gives some examples, et cetera.

1321
02:00:31,801 --> 02:00:34,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is sort of repeating the definition of petition.

1322
02:00:35,723 --> 02:00:38,144
[SPEAKER_12]: But then we have a phrase, all other petitions,

1323
02:00:40,401 --> 02:00:45,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if it doesn't meet that definition, it's not a petition per the definition of the word petition.

1324
02:00:45,805 --> 02:00:51,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it's not a petition, why are we referring it to as all other petitions, you know what I mean?

1325
02:00:52,110 --> 02:00:58,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not gonna suggest any, yeah.

1326
02:00:58,215 --> 02:01:00,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The filing of petitions.

1327
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,481
[SPEAKER_04]: shall be reserved for these matters.

1328
02:01:02,761 --> 02:01:05,723
[SPEAKER_04]: All other petitions filed shall be placed in this portion of the agenda.

1329
02:01:05,743 --> 02:01:10,706
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, but it says a petition is defined as an application requesting council action as required by law.

1330
02:01:11,066 --> 02:01:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and how many times do you think people fill out a petition that don't actually have the requirement for council action by law that still file the petition?

1331
02:01:20,332 --> 02:01:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone's going to file a petition, right, and the clerk's going to have it.

1332
02:01:23,274 --> 02:01:26,856
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk's going to look at it and go, yeah, this isn't something that's required by law.

1333
02:01:27,316 --> 02:01:28,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that on public participation.

1334
02:01:29,675 --> 02:01:30,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.

1335
02:01:30,617 --> 02:01:32,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think it's a fine thing.

1336
02:01:32,379 --> 02:01:35,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that if it went to committee, you'd come up with something a little clearer.

1337
02:01:36,143 --> 02:01:36,964
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my opinion.

1338
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:41,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Because as it is, somebody reading this, they're going, OK, we got petitions.

1339
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:43,451
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm filing a petition.

1340
02:01:44,512 --> 02:01:50,059
[SPEAKER_12]: So for example, if a person reads through this, and they have something that's not required by law, and they want it discussed,

1341
02:01:51,688 --> 02:01:56,375
[SPEAKER_12]: should they deliberately file a petition that they know isn't a petition by definition?

1342
02:01:56,395 --> 02:01:57,296
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little strange.

1343
02:01:58,037 --> 02:02:04,165
[SPEAKER_12]: But that is what I would think I would do under, you know, reading through the statute, through the rule.

1344
02:02:09,309 --> 02:02:15,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, that's just a non-expert perspective who isn't familiar with every line of the city code.

1345
02:02:15,431 --> 02:02:22,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And I suspect that could be made a lot more clear if it went to committee, got vetted, and so forth, the process that Councilor Marks is suggesting.

1346
02:02:22,933 --> 02:02:23,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks a lot.

1347
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:24,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1348
02:02:25,734 --> 02:02:26,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1349
02:02:27,256 --> 02:02:32,442
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you can cross 50 mystic street just a thought that came to mind listening to this.

1350
02:02:32,502 --> 02:02:38,788
[SPEAKER_25]: I think primarily the process for public participation is going to be unchanged.

1351
02:02:38,848 --> 02:02:42,112
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just going to be called something a little bit different.

1352
02:02:42,152 --> 02:02:47,477
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm wondering from a practical standpoint and maybe the city clerk has a thought about this is.

1353
02:02:48,138 --> 02:02:56,625
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's value to having a number assigned to a petition for tracking purposes, for example.

1354
02:02:57,366 --> 02:03:09,736
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you're going back to try to recheck on something that happened rather than saying, you know, remember last February they were talking about coyotes and you have to search through all these

1355
02:03:11,263 --> 02:03:14,124
[SPEAKER_25]: council agendas to try to find the one you were thinking about.

1356
02:03:14,464 --> 02:03:29,989
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm wondering if there might be some value to consider if someone has a petition, it's determined it's a petition, not an item that would require council action, to designate that as P02001 or something like that.

1357
02:03:30,009 --> 02:03:30,609
[SPEAKER_25]: The other

1358
02:03:34,102 --> 02:03:42,846
[SPEAKER_25]: resolutions and motions and things that are presented by the body, members of the council, have the numbers that they have now.

1359
02:03:42,926 --> 02:03:44,487
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm not trying to complicate it anymore.

1360
02:03:44,507 --> 02:03:52,131
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm trying to make it so it's not considered less than because currently it is assigned a number.

1361
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:59,277
[SPEAKER_25]: And it seems like there's some concern about that it's less legitimate because it doesn't have a number anymore.

1362
02:03:59,617 --> 02:04:01,158
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just under public participation.

1363
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:19,113
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just thought maybe having a system where a petition got a certain number with a prefix P, another resolution that was a normal one from the council had its own number, and maybe that would alleviate any concern that it's being diminished in terms of its importance, and it would also be easier to track just from a practical standpoint.

1364
02:04:19,553 --> 02:04:19,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1365
02:04:20,013 --> 02:04:20,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1366
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:30,241
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that I envision this, Mr. President, would be Mr. Krause gets up and he's, you know, filed for to be on the agenda during the public participation portion of the agenda.

1367
02:04:30,301 --> 02:04:35,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Krause gets up and he speaks about something that he cares a lot about, which would be a scoreboard at Playstead Park.

1368
02:04:35,743 --> 02:04:39,524
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's say, you know, we're trying to push for a scoreboard at Playstead Park.

1369
02:04:39,564 --> 02:04:41,884
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the steps we've taken to get the scoreboard at Playstead Park.

1370
02:04:42,164 --> 02:04:43,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking for the council help.

1371
02:04:44,665 --> 02:04:45,605
[SPEAKER_04]: What can the council do?

1372
02:04:46,525 --> 02:04:48,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, motion to, uh,

1373
02:04:49,434 --> 02:04:59,719
[SPEAKER_04]: make an amendment relative to motion to make a resolution on behalf of Mr. Crouch's speech that the city of Medford take the following steps to affirmatively secure the school board a place to park.

1374
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:01,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1375
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:01,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You made a motion.

1376
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:02,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody agree with that?

1377
02:05:02,801 --> 02:05:02,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1378
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:03,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1379
02:05:03,381 --> 02:05:04,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It's assigned a paper number.

1380
02:05:04,301 --> 02:05:04,722
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1381
02:05:04,922 --> 02:05:05,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow up.

1382
02:05:06,943 --> 02:05:11,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor just took the council just took ownership of that issue, put their name on it, said, this is mine.

1383
02:05:11,725 --> 02:05:12,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making this motion.

1384
02:05:12,706 --> 02:05:13,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm owning this.

1385
02:05:13,266 --> 02:05:14,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting ownership on this issue.

1386
02:05:15,387 --> 02:05:16,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information.

1387
02:05:16,307 --> 02:05:17,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1388
02:05:19,029 --> 02:05:31,292
[SPEAKER_19]: If Mr. Krause came up tonight and wanted to do what Councilor Knight was talking about, and he is not in any violation because the open meeting law only applies to deliberative bodies.

1389
02:05:31,852 --> 02:05:37,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Krause wouldn't be in any violation of bringing up the issue, so he can appear before us and bring up the issue.

1390
02:05:38,293 --> 02:05:44,374
[SPEAKER_19]: However, we would be in violation by deliberating saying, you know what, Mr. Krause, that's a great idea.

1391
02:05:44,854 --> 02:05:46,595
[SPEAKER_19]: That's asked the mayor to get 20,000 for the school board.

1392
02:05:48,274 --> 02:06:01,967
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I'm saying, Mr. President, having something, if I could just finish, having something assigned a petition number, Mr. President, is a way of getting around, because a lot of people will come up, Mr. President, and want to speak before us that night.

1393
02:06:02,708 --> 02:06:06,251
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're not in violation, we would be in violation for deliberating.

1394
02:06:06,671 --> 02:06:10,295
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think what Mr. Krause raises is a valid point, even with the numbering.

1395
02:06:10,675 --> 02:06:12,717
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a great idea, Mr. President.

1396
02:06:14,359 --> 02:06:20,326
[SPEAKER_19]: I think having the ability to do that and also having public participation, that to me opens up the process.

1397
02:06:21,167 --> 02:06:23,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Eliminating one is exactly what it does.

1398
02:06:23,269 --> 02:06:24,551
[SPEAKER_19]: It eliminates the option.

1399
02:06:25,071 --> 02:06:29,456
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't see how that is open and transparent and adds to discussion.

1400
02:06:29,516 --> 02:06:29,997
[SPEAKER_19]: I really don't.

1401
02:06:30,337 --> 02:06:30,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1402
02:06:30,637 --> 02:06:31,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

1403
02:06:32,499 --> 02:06:40,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say that I prefaced my comments with Mr. Krause, and I said, say that he had put the paper on for public participation.

1404
02:06:40,861 --> 02:06:41,761
[SPEAKER_13]: So you did it in advance.

1405
02:06:41,781 --> 02:06:44,222
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it in advance, because we all- What if he didn't?

1406
02:06:44,862 --> 02:06:48,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can't talk about it, because the city solicitor gave us the opinion already.

1407
02:06:48,563 --> 02:06:56,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of whether or not we change petition or don't change petition, we can't talk about it, because the solicitor already said it'd be a violation of the open meeting law the minute the body deliberates on a matter that's not on the agenda.

1408
02:06:57,005 --> 02:06:58,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Not if they were allowed to do a petition.

1409
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:00,311
[SPEAKER_04]: It would still be on the agenda.

1410
02:07:00,832 --> 02:07:01,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1411
02:07:01,372 --> 02:07:02,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the agenda.

1412
02:07:02,072 --> 02:07:03,793
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be in public participation.

1413
02:07:03,813 --> 02:07:04,293
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the difference?

1414
02:07:04,313 --> 02:07:05,274
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1415
02:07:05,294 --> 02:07:06,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a different section of the agenda.

1416
02:07:07,035 --> 02:07:11,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So if he's on the agenda under public participation, he has the right to come up and talk.

1417
02:07:11,056 --> 02:07:13,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Then a councillor can say, this is my issue and adopt it.

1418
02:07:13,438 --> 02:07:14,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they can take ownership of the issue.

1419
02:07:15,218 --> 02:07:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, instead of having someone comes up to the podium and we're going to have the seven competing people step over each other to see who's going to do the most with this person when we're all here.

1420
02:07:22,782 --> 02:07:23,342
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1421
02:07:23,863 --> 02:07:24,343
[SPEAKER_04]: At the meeting.

1422
02:07:24,663 --> 02:07:25,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it dies.

1423
02:07:25,564 --> 02:07:26,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1424
02:07:26,584 --> 02:07:27,665
[SPEAKER_04]: We can take ownership of the issue.

1425
02:07:27,705 --> 02:07:28,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We can say, hey, look.

1426
02:07:28,725 --> 02:07:28,966
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1427
02:07:29,606 --> 02:07:33,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I put this proposal forward on behalf of Mr. Krause to get $15,000.

1428
02:07:33,188 --> 02:07:34,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get him the answer.

1429
02:07:34,649 --> 02:07:35,889
[SPEAKER_04]: As opposed to, oh, that's a great idea.

1430
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:36,590
[SPEAKER_04]: This person was up there.

1431
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:37,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with this person.

1432
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:38,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that person.

1433
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Send it forward.

1434
02:07:38,911 --> 02:07:39,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1435
02:07:39,432 --> 02:07:40,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Send it to the mayor.

1436
02:07:40,732 --> 02:07:42,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it streamlines the process a little bit.

1437
02:07:42,253 --> 02:07:43,414
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're no longer a body.

1438
02:07:43,454 --> 02:07:44,194
[SPEAKER_19]: We're individuals.

1439
02:07:44,554 --> 02:07:45,275
[SPEAKER_19]: When someone comes up.

1440
02:07:45,655 --> 02:07:46,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm going to do that.

1441
02:07:46,456 --> 02:07:47,276
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, I'm going to do that.

1442
02:07:47,296 --> 02:07:47,997
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1443
02:07:48,157 --> 02:07:49,318
[SPEAKER_19]: You can do whatever action you want.

1444
02:07:49,659 --> 02:07:50,840
[SPEAKER_19]: You're an individual Councilor.

1445
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:52,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I think independently.

1446
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:53,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a body.

1447
02:07:53,322 --> 02:07:55,403
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not individuals.

1448
02:07:55,864 --> 02:07:56,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1449
02:07:56,885 --> 02:07:58,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm an individual.

1450
02:07:58,446 --> 02:08:00,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a member of this body, but I think as an individual.

1451
02:08:00,608 --> 02:08:04,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1452
02:08:04,431 --> 02:08:07,594
[SPEAKER_12]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1453
02:08:07,954 --> 02:08:11,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I have sort of an idea that might, because as you were discussing, I was thinking,

1454
02:08:12,987 --> 02:08:16,389
[SPEAKER_12]: that I was wondering, I was just thinking of ideas, all right, basically.

1455
02:08:17,069 --> 02:08:21,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was reminded of the fact that I saw a bill on the Massachusetts state legislature.

1456
02:08:22,011 --> 02:08:24,293
[SPEAKER_12]: It's from the 187th session, 2011-2012.

1457
02:08:24,433 --> 02:08:26,694
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Bill H2546.

1458
02:08:27,314 --> 02:08:34,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody from somewhere out in western Massachusetts wanted to get a land value tax, like I sometimes talk about.

1459
02:08:35,038 --> 02:08:38,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And he got it into the legislature.

1460
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:40,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have a thing here.

1461
02:08:41,661 --> 02:08:45,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Presenting legislator is not a sponsor of this measure.

1462
02:08:45,725 --> 02:08:51,471
[SPEAKER_12]: There were no sponsors or co-sponsors of this measure, but this resident citizen believes strongly in it.

1463
02:08:51,531 --> 02:08:54,894
[SPEAKER_12]: He got it onto the whatever you call it.

1464
02:08:54,914 --> 02:08:56,856
[SPEAKER_12]: He got it a number.

1465
02:08:58,177 --> 02:08:59,618
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if perhaps

1466
02:09:01,035 --> 02:09:11,800
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, if somebody like Councilor Barks wants to be sort of a rubber stamp to let everybody on the agenda without having to claim all these things as his own, maybe he thinks they're ridiculous, but he still wants to talk about them.

1467
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:18,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder, maybe the city council could have language like this, this sort of presenting legislator is not a sponsor of this measure.

1468
02:09:19,103 --> 02:09:26,086
[SPEAKER_12]: That way, you know, put lots of crap on the agenda, even if nobody, you know, just because you want to give a chance to hear about it.

1469
02:09:26,807 --> 02:09:27,667
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an idea I have.

1470
02:09:28,247 --> 02:09:28,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1471
02:09:29,741 --> 02:09:31,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we have the B paper first.

1472
02:09:31,502 --> 02:09:35,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And the B paper was offered by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1473
02:09:35,823 --> 02:09:37,864
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was to have a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1474
02:09:37,884 --> 02:09:40,665
[SPEAKER_01]: To review any rules.

1475
02:09:41,286 --> 02:09:42,366
[SPEAKER_14]: To review any rules.

1476
02:09:43,747 --> 02:09:45,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Pursuant to public participation.

1477
02:09:45,567 --> 02:09:46,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Pursuant to public participation.

1478
02:09:47,208 --> 02:09:48,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And review and update rule 33.

1479
02:09:48,488 --> 02:09:49,169
[SPEAKER_14]: And review and update rule 33.

1480
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:52,710
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1481
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:53,611
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1482
02:09:53,631 --> 02:09:53,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1483
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:55,431
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1484
02:09:56,312 --> 02:09:57,132
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1485
02:09:57,648 --> 02:09:59,669
[SPEAKER_14]: on the main resolution offered by Councilor Knight.

1486
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:01,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by?

1487
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:07,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1488
02:10:08,115 --> 02:10:11,678
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is to adopt the rule change that was proposed by Councilor Knight.

1489
02:10:17,181 --> 02:10:18,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1490
02:10:32,364 --> 02:10:35,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one of the negative, the motion passes.

1491
02:10:41,204 --> 02:10:43,886
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-092 offered by Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Knight.

1492
02:10:44,506 --> 02:10:50,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council sends its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Priscilla Morse on her recent passing.

1493
02:10:51,311 --> 02:10:53,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Her presence in our community will be deeply missed.

1494
02:10:53,913 --> 02:10:59,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1495
02:10:59,698 --> 02:11:00,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1496
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:11,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Priscilla Morse has two very wonderful sons that she produced for this community.

1497
02:11:12,163 --> 02:11:18,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And those two boys learned from this woman how to be good contributors to our community.

1498
02:11:18,546 --> 02:11:25,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've only met Mrs. Morse on a couple of occasions, but she's a good person.

1499
02:11:26,470 --> 02:11:30,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm saddened by her passing, so I wish her family well.

1500
02:11:31,652 --> 02:11:32,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1501
02:11:32,753 --> 02:11:33,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1502
02:11:36,417 --> 02:11:37,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1503
02:11:37,758 --> 02:11:41,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I echo Councilor Caraviello's sentiments regarding Mrs. Moss.

1504
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:48,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the good fortune of being very close friends with Hank and Dennis, and they're two of the finest individuals you'll ever meet.

1505
02:11:49,223 --> 02:11:53,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And their mom did a great job raising them as a father of two sons, I hope.

1506
02:11:54,077 --> 02:11:59,718
[SPEAKER_04]: and pray that when my kids reach adulthood that they are of the same character and integrity that Hank and Dennis have.

1507
02:12:00,379 --> 02:12:06,260
[SPEAKER_04]: They're two great individuals and they're a certain and absolute reflection of the work that their parents put in.

1508
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:13,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I just want to join Councilor Caraviello and hopefully my council colleagues in extending a deep and sincere condolence to the Morse family.

1509
02:12:15,863 --> 02:12:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Priscilla will be sadly missed and she did a lot of good for this community and that good carries on in her children and grandchildren.

1510
02:12:22,955 --> 02:12:26,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in supporting this measure.

1511
02:12:27,582 --> 02:12:28,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1512
02:12:28,824 --> 02:12:29,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1513
02:12:30,463 --> 02:12:31,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1514
02:12:31,724 --> 02:12:33,145
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to echo my colleagues.

1515
02:12:34,266 --> 02:12:45,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Morris was the matriarch of the family and truly was someone that had strong moral values.

1516
02:12:46,315 --> 02:12:55,803
[SPEAKER_19]: And as Councilor Knight mentioned, raised two boys that really impeccable people of character and she will be sorely missed.

1517
02:12:56,523 --> 02:12:57,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1518
02:12:58,044 --> 02:12:58,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1519
02:13:00,114 --> 02:13:09,021
[SPEAKER_26]: just want to echo, uh, my colleagues and send my condolences to the Morse family and, uh, thank all members of the Morse family for their continuing service to the community.

1520
02:13:09,461 --> 02:13:09,782
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1521
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:10,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1522
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:10,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Council appears.

1523
02:13:10,863 --> 02:13:11,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1524
02:13:12,744 --> 02:13:27,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, being close friends with both, um, the Morse brothers and understanding that, uh, what Mr. and Mrs. Morse have done left, uh, with, uh, teaching their children, uh, that community is very important.

1525
02:13:28,454 --> 02:13:40,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And to lose her was a great loss to Dennis and Hank, but I know that we wish them well and share our support with their family.

1526
02:13:40,598 --> 02:13:41,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1527
02:13:41,898 --> 02:13:43,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1528
02:13:43,298 --> 02:13:47,740
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I may add, I've had the pleasure of knowing Hank and Dennis most of my life.

1529
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:50,401
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mrs. Morse did a

1530
02:13:52,116 --> 02:13:55,259
[SPEAKER_14]: And her husband did a fabulous job raising Hank and Dennis.

1531
02:13:55,299 --> 02:13:57,020
[SPEAKER_14]: They're two of the finest people I know.

1532
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:00,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And our thoughts and prayers go out to the Morse family.

1533
02:14:00,543 --> 02:14:03,966
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1534
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:21,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1535
02:14:29,345 --> 02:14:43,179
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-093 offered by Council and I be it ordered that the Medford City Council hereby establish a minimum wage for all individuals in the employee of the school district and city of Medford by adopting the following ordinance.

1536
02:14:44,121 --> 02:14:48,005
[SPEAKER_14]: There shall be a minimum wage for all city and school district employees.

1537
02:14:48,086 --> 02:14:52,250
[SPEAKER_14]: This minimum wage shall be set at no less than $15 per hour.

1538
02:14:52,751 --> 02:15:01,541
[SPEAKER_14]: In the event the Massachusetts minimum wage exceeds $15 per hour, the employee shall receive the state minimum hourly wage.

1539
02:15:02,482 --> 02:15:02,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1540
02:15:04,449 --> 02:15:05,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1541
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:08,491
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a relatively self-explanatory proposal.

1542
02:15:09,072 --> 02:15:13,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to refer this to the city solicitor for validation of form and codification, Mr. President.

1543
02:15:13,794 --> 02:15:16,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we're going to put it in the ordinance isn't to be sure that it's in proper form.

1544
02:15:17,356 --> 02:15:21,158
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in looking at it, ultimately, there's been a fight for 15 across the country.

1545
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:26,641
[SPEAKER_04]: To live in the city of Medford and make less than $15, you're not going to be able to make it.

1546
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:28,640
[SPEAKER_04]: to live in the city of Medford and make $15.

1547
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:29,961
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have $15 now.

1548
02:15:30,001 --> 02:15:32,102
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have a very difficult time trying to make it.

1549
02:15:32,783 --> 02:15:45,031
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an opportunity for us to show that we value our employees, that we believe in the work that they do, that we feel as though our public servants provide a high-quality level of service to the community, and they should be compensated accordingly.

1550
02:15:45,651 --> 02:15:50,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I raise this measure and bring it forward for further debate and discussion.

1551
02:15:50,695 --> 02:15:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask that the city solicitor put this in proper form and codification, and then we can, again, reconvene on it upon conclusion of legal review.

1552
02:15:57,790 --> 02:15:58,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1553
02:15:58,850 --> 02:15:59,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1554
02:16:00,211 --> 02:16:07,232
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you to Councilor Knight again for putting forward this proposal.

1555
02:16:07,432 --> 02:16:13,834
[SPEAKER_26]: The organization that I run was part of the Raise Up Mass Coalition that passed the Fight for 15 law here in Massachusetts.

1556
02:16:14,594 --> 02:16:19,055
[SPEAKER_26]: And sadly, due to how the state constitution and state laws work, we

1557
02:16:19,958 --> 02:16:23,359
[SPEAKER_26]: exempted municipalities from that because it's technically an unfunded mandate.

1558
02:16:23,399 --> 02:16:29,681
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think it's really important that Medford steps up and says that we're going to follow along with what the state minimum wage is.

1559
02:16:29,701 --> 02:16:42,506
[SPEAKER_26]: And I also think just from the clear purposes of making sure we can hire folks, if you can make $3, $4, $5 more an hour, go work at Subway or some other organization or group rather than working for the city, that's going to present a problem now and down the road.

1560
02:16:42,566 --> 02:16:48,088
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think it's incredibly important both from a justice perspective and from a practical hiring perspective that we do this.

1561
02:16:49,241 --> 02:16:50,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1562
02:16:50,142 --> 02:16:50,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1563
02:16:51,743 --> 02:16:52,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Lifeguards.

1564
02:16:53,905 --> 02:16:54,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Camp Councilors.

1565
02:16:55,526 --> 02:16:56,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Park police.

1566
02:16:56,907 --> 02:16:57,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Substitute teachers.

1567
02:16:58,268 --> 02:17:01,010
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the people that will be impacted and affected by this, Mr. President.

1568
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:04,793
[SPEAKER_04]: People that provide a very valuable service to the city.

1569
02:17:05,173 --> 02:17:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about lifeguards, it writes point.

1570
02:17:09,158 --> 02:17:21,369
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty happy to say that I haven't heard about any type of situation up at Wright's Pond in a very long time, because we do a great job training our lifeguards up there, and we have full complement to staff, and we want to keep it that way.

1571
02:17:21,769 --> 02:17:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about the parks police, Mr. President.

1572
02:17:24,171 --> 02:17:28,595
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can remember a time when I was a child where the parks were crazy.

1573
02:17:29,596 --> 02:17:32,278
[SPEAKER_04]: When the sun went down, the parks turned into war zones.

1574
02:17:32,499 --> 02:17:37,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, as you drive through the city and you see the parks in the summertime and the park police are on board,

1575
02:17:38,311 --> 02:17:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not seeing those same problems that we used to have.

1576
02:17:40,873 --> 02:17:45,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just think it's very important to point out who would be impacted and affected by this.

1577
02:17:45,275 --> 02:17:49,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only city and school department employees, and it's only ones that make less than $15 an hour.

1578
02:17:51,218 --> 02:18:01,624
[SPEAKER_04]: During budget deliberations and over the course of the past term, all of the collective bargaining agreements in both the school department and the city side, at one point or another, reached a conclusion and got wrapped up.

1579
02:18:02,210 --> 02:18:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: all contractual employees were receiving a wage that was above $15 an hour, with the exception of those few that I've just mentioned.

1580
02:18:09,334 --> 02:18:21,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I don't think this is gonna be something that's gonna have a major impact on the bottom line, but it will certainly have a major impact on the lives of those individuals that are working here and the employee of the city of Medford, and they're gonna be benefits of a fair wage.

1581
02:18:22,761 --> 02:18:23,261
[SPEAKER_14]: You are correct.

1582
02:18:23,421 --> 02:18:24,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing that forward.

1583
02:18:25,663 --> 02:18:27,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Please have your name and address for the record, please.

1584
02:18:27,704 --> 02:18:30,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Jacob Sommer, 36 Amaranth Place, Medford.

1585
02:18:31,112 --> 02:18:32,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And I heard the proposal.

1586
02:18:33,014 --> 02:18:37,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear anything about whether this would be perhaps indexed to inflation.

1587
02:18:39,939 --> 02:18:40,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a chance of that?

1588
02:18:42,121 --> 02:18:42,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Councilor Knight.

1589
02:18:45,324 --> 02:18:51,589
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Massachusetts minimum wage exceeds $15 an hour, then the employee shall receive the Massachusetts minimum hourly wage.

1590
02:18:51,629 --> 02:18:58,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the state sets it is how our employees will get it based upon this proposal.

1591
02:18:59,414 --> 02:19:06,199
[SPEAKER_09]: But if Massachusetts does not do an index to increase based on inflation, we would not either in Medford.

1592
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1593
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,382
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let the state dictate and we're going to follow.

1594
02:19:11,063 --> 02:19:15,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That would mean that the city council would have to revisit this in several years.

1595
02:19:19,129 --> 02:19:19,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1596
02:19:19,669 --> 02:19:19,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1597
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:20,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1598
02:19:25,103 --> 02:19:25,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

1599
02:19:25,784 --> 02:19:28,147
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1600
02:19:28,187 --> 02:19:29,028
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1601
02:19:29,048 --> 02:19:29,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1602
02:19:29,748 --> 02:19:30,389
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1603
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:31,650
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1604
02:19:35,154 --> 02:19:35,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Referral to the solicitor.

1605
02:19:35,955 --> 02:19:41,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and that's for the referral to the city solicitor to review for pro forma and codification.

1606
02:19:43,764 --> 02:19:44,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1607
02:19:55,380 --> 02:20:10,783
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-095 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hereby amend 94-141B, parentheses three, by striking this section in adopting the following language, 94-191B3.

1608
02:20:11,283 --> 02:20:23,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Parking spaces not enclosed in a structure may be provided anywhere on the lot except in inner court, except that no parking may be provided within the required front yards in

1609
02:20:24,326 --> 02:20:26,949
[SPEAKER_14]: SF1, SF2, and GR district.

1610
02:20:27,489 --> 02:20:38,961
[SPEAKER_14]: In the event that existing on-street parking is removed, eliminated, or made unavailable through government action, direct abutters impacted by the removal of parking shall have the right to install

1611
02:20:40,623 --> 02:20:45,385
[SPEAKER_14]: parking within the required front yards in SF1, SF2, and GR district.

1612
02:20:45,925 --> 02:21:04,110
[SPEAKER_14]: When parking is provided in a front yard, buffer strips at least three feet in width and planted with dense planting material or an opaque fence or uniform appearance should be provided on the sides of the parking area visible from the abutting streets and lots.

1613
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:05,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1614
02:21:06,150 --> 02:21:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1615
02:21:07,391 --> 02:21:11,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I find this to be a rather self-explanatory resolution, ordinance change rather.

1616
02:21:11,854 --> 02:21:18,539
[SPEAKER_04]: In looking at it for my council colleagues, the language in bold would be the new language being added to the existing section.

1617
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:24,364
[SPEAKER_04]: The remaining language in the section would continue to remain in full force and effect.

1618
02:21:25,044 --> 02:21:30,428
[SPEAKER_04]: A few weeks back, we had some discussion about the removal of a number of parking spots along High Street and

1619
02:21:31,929 --> 02:21:35,374
[SPEAKER_04]: discussing the issue with residents in the neighborhood that were impacted by it.

1620
02:21:35,434 --> 02:21:42,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this might be an interesting compromise, a way that we could address some of the neighborhood concerns, but also move forward with the project, Mr. President.

1621
02:21:42,645 --> 02:21:43,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with that being said.

1622
02:21:44,591 --> 02:21:50,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I would request that this paper be sent to the building commissioner as well as the code enforcement officer for review and recommendation.

1623
02:21:51,394 --> 02:21:58,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it's a zoning ordinance, it does have further ramifications than just this 94-151 section.

1624
02:21:58,757 --> 02:22:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's another section on zoning code that talks about what a suitable parking spot would be and what the parameters of that parking spot would be.

1625
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:12,765
[SPEAKER_04]: had conversation with John Bovuso from the building commissioner's office and he's asked for the opportunity to take a look at this.

1626
02:22:13,365 --> 02:22:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm requesting that my council colleagues join me in moving forward with sending this to the building commissioner's office for review from the building commissioner and the code enforcement officer for recommendations.

1627
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:25,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can have a future discussion on it after those come back.

1628
02:22:25,954 --> 02:22:26,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1629
02:22:28,135 --> 02:22:28,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

1630
02:22:29,585 --> 02:22:30,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1631
02:22:30,927 --> 02:22:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a number of concerns with this text amendment.

1632
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:47,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand your request to send to the building commissioner, but I see it as being overly broad and really runs the risk of implying that the public asset of street parking is actually owned by individuals who are closest to it, which, of course, is not the case.

1633
02:22:48,717 --> 02:22:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: By adding curb cuts, we are further limiting parking, and with this being overly broad, it's unclear.

1634
02:22:54,121 --> 02:23:02,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Does someone several houses down from where this was taken, if they haven't had parking in front of their house for decades, are they allowed to apply for this?

1635
02:23:03,367 --> 02:23:07,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But none of this speaks to the fact that this would have an environmental impact.

1636
02:23:09,131 --> 02:23:12,676
[SPEAKER_03]: It would increase the amount of impervious surface in the city.

1637
02:23:13,057 --> 02:23:22,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Pervious surface and green infrastructure such as trees and dirt and soil are really important to mitigate the amount of stormwater drain off that goes into the Mystic River.

1638
02:23:22,750 --> 02:23:25,935
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have flooding issues in the city by adding more pavement.

1639
02:23:26,226 --> 02:23:29,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We run the risk of exacerbating them.

1640
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:36,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I do worry that also because of this, mature and significant trees will be under threat as people seek to make space to lay down asphalt.

1641
02:23:37,433 --> 02:23:39,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have concerns that the buffer zones referenced are too vague.

1642
02:23:39,995 --> 02:23:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look around the city at buffer zones that already exist.

1643
02:23:42,837 --> 02:23:44,878
[SPEAKER_03]: There's maybe some mulch, maybe one tiny bush.

1644
02:23:45,939 --> 02:23:47,320
[SPEAKER_03]: This definitely looks to

1645
02:23:48,564 --> 02:23:55,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of impact neighbors who are around that suddenly their neighbors are parking with their headlights on what was formerly a front yard.

1646
02:23:56,488 --> 02:23:57,608
[SPEAKER_03]: They have headlights in their window.

1647
02:23:57,808 --> 02:24:02,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, often we talk about beautification in this chamber and beautification of the city.

1648
02:24:02,811 --> 02:24:09,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I feel that parking on your front lawn, adding asphalt to formerly green,

1649
02:24:10,558 --> 02:24:14,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And green infrastructure hardly goes far in the way of beautification of this city.

1650
02:24:14,823 --> 02:24:18,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, I have a number of concerns on this proposed text amendment.

1651
02:24:19,389 --> 02:24:19,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1652
02:24:20,791 --> 02:24:21,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1653
02:24:21,091 --> 02:24:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Council morale.

1654
02:24:21,852 --> 02:24:22,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Council of Bears.

1655
02:24:23,574 --> 02:24:25,116
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, sure.

1656
02:24:25,176 --> 02:24:28,560
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of the many of the concerns of Councilor morale.

1657
02:24:29,161 --> 02:24:29,902
[SPEAKER_26]: I also think we need to

1658
02:24:31,556 --> 02:24:38,779
[SPEAKER_26]: make sure that we're not either implying or otherwise that any projects under consideration might be contingent on something like this moving forward.

1659
02:24:38,799 --> 02:24:42,681
[SPEAKER_26]: I wouldn't support this in that case.

1660
02:24:43,301 --> 02:24:57,807
[SPEAKER_26]: If we're going to move forward with it, I would propose an amendment that the parking that's created have pervious surfaces, permeable surfaces, allowing water to come through and not becoming another asphalt where water is potentially causing flooding.

1661
02:24:57,827 --> 02:24:59,668
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's the first part of it.

1662
02:25:01,451 --> 02:25:17,405
[SPEAKER_26]: make sure that if parking's installed, there's protection for mature trees, making sure that code enforcement or the city or whoever's responsible for the buffer strips, that they are sufficient and maintained well, and then also limiting it to one spot.

1663
02:25:19,026 --> 02:25:19,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1664
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:25,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Council appears we might need to repeat that last part.

1665
02:25:25,863 --> 02:25:28,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have anything beyond mature trees.

1666
02:25:29,007 --> 02:25:30,048
[SPEAKER_26]: And then limiting the

1667
02:25:56,778 --> 02:25:58,338
[SPEAKER_26]: And limiting to one spot, you've got that.

1668
02:25:59,319 --> 02:26:00,639
[SPEAKER_26]: Limiting to one spot.

1669
02:26:01,999 --> 02:26:04,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Limited to one spot, correct?

1670
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:04,900
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, correct.

1671
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:05,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1672
02:26:10,161 --> 02:26:10,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1673
02:26:13,802 --> 02:26:14,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1674
02:26:14,782 --> 02:26:24,664
[SPEAKER_04]: May I be so bold, Mr. President, to amend the paper to request that in the discernment, the building department also look at the green space requirements associated with intercourt parking.

1675
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:27,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And I offer that in the form of an amendment.

1676
02:26:28,231 --> 02:26:29,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you repeat that again, please?

1677
02:26:29,832 --> 02:26:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That the Building Commissioner's Office also review during the discernment the green space requirements.

1678
02:26:48,303 --> 02:26:49,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1679
02:26:51,184 --> 02:26:51,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1680
02:26:53,385 --> 02:26:54,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1681
02:26:54,726 --> 02:27:02,989
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate the fact that Councilman Knight's trying to get creative with the concern about potential loss on street parking.

1682
02:27:03,489 --> 02:27:16,374
[SPEAKER_19]: However, it flies in the face of everything I've spoken about over the last several years regarding properties on Salem Street and Riverside Ave that have turned their front yards into parking lots, Mr. President.

1683
02:27:17,054 --> 02:27:21,777
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think it's very pleasing aesthetically, Mr. President.

1684
02:27:22,457 --> 02:27:35,025
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would hate to see a practice, any practice that promotes such, even though it's called inner core and sounds great, the inner core is the outer core of our city and how our city looks.

1685
02:27:35,746 --> 02:27:38,287
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think it does anything for our community.

1686
02:27:38,627 --> 02:27:40,449
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would not support this, Mr. President.

1687
02:27:40,689 --> 02:27:41,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1688
02:27:42,990 --> 02:27:43,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello.

1689
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:44,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1690
02:27:47,162 --> 02:27:52,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Parking in a front yard, I think, right now is currently not allowed by our ordinance.

1691
02:27:52,145 --> 02:27:54,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm correct with that.

1692
02:27:55,808 --> 02:28:00,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it takes away from the value of a house when you start parking one or two cars on the front lawn.

1693
02:28:01,832 --> 02:28:04,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes away the beauty, especially if you have a single family house.

1694
02:28:05,975 --> 02:28:13,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I go by every day, by a house on the Mississippi Valley Parkway, single family, and there's a pickup truck parked on the front lawn.

1695
02:28:14,461 --> 02:28:15,622
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look very good.

1696
02:28:16,141 --> 02:28:23,786
[SPEAKER_06]: As people drive by, and again, I don't know if I can support taking up yards and putting down huts up.

1697
02:28:24,767 --> 02:28:30,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in previous services, even parking cars in your front yard, I don't think does it for me.

1698
02:28:31,051 --> 02:28:37,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if I could support this either, even with some planting or things.

1699
02:28:37,256 --> 02:28:41,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it takes away from the beauty of the neighborhood and the home.

1700
02:28:42,419 --> 02:28:43,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1701
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:44,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1702
02:28:45,492 --> 02:29:08,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I can understand Councilor Knight's presentation, the understanding that we've had some recent, uh, recent concerns, but I, I too, with Council Marks, I know that the Felsway has turned into, um, you know, front yard, um, parking areas and it does take away the appearance of the community.

1703
02:29:08,619 --> 02:29:13,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, um, although in good intention, I don't think I can support this either.

1704
02:29:13,681 --> 02:29:14,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1705
02:29:15,299 --> 02:29:16,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1706
02:29:18,921 --> 02:29:21,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Please have your name and address for the record.

1707
02:29:21,063 --> 02:29:23,124
[SPEAKER_12]: 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1708
02:29:24,285 --> 02:29:26,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally don't really care where people park.

1709
02:29:26,947 --> 02:29:28,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't mind parking in the front yard.

1710
02:29:28,488 --> 02:29:29,709
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't bother me.

1711
02:29:31,590 --> 02:29:36,173
[SPEAKER_12]: And if as part of a project you want to zone for that, let people park.

1712
02:29:36,213 --> 02:29:38,235
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're in a bike lane, I think that's fine.

1713
02:29:39,878 --> 02:29:55,724
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that perhaps the brevity of Councilor Burrell's point sort of belies its extreme importance, and that is that you do not, as a nearby owner,

1714
02:29:57,392 --> 02:29:59,795
[SPEAKER_12]: As of we understand things now, you do not own the street.

1715
02:30:00,756 --> 02:30:08,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really dangerous to have anything approaching what we might call a property right over on-street parking.

1716
02:30:08,284 --> 02:30:13,129
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's really dangerous and I want to commend Councilor Morell for making that point.

1717
02:30:13,189 --> 02:30:14,270
[SPEAKER_12]: It's extremely important.

1718
02:30:14,310 --> 02:30:17,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the Council hears it.

1719
02:30:17,654 --> 02:30:17,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1720
02:30:21,127 --> 02:30:32,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Bears and Councilor Knight, to send this paper to the Building Commissioner and Code Enforcement Officer for their review.

1721
02:30:35,114 --> 02:30:35,875
[SPEAKER_14]: You withdraw the paper?

1722
02:30:35,895 --> 02:30:38,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the paper has been withdrawn.

1723
02:30:40,998 --> 02:30:42,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1724
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:45,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, if we can.

1725
02:30:45,834 --> 02:30:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion to suspend the rules.

1726
02:30:47,074 --> 02:30:52,016
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, to suspend the rules, to take a paper on order.

1727
02:30:52,816 --> 02:30:53,537
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1728
02:30:53,557 --> 02:30:53,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1729
02:30:54,057 --> 02:30:55,257
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1730
02:30:55,798 --> 02:30:57,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes and the rules are suspended.

1731
02:30:58,438 --> 02:30:59,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1732
02:30:59,339 --> 02:31:01,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

1733
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we've had a petitioner here waiting patiently.

1734
02:31:04,901 --> 02:31:04,921
[SPEAKER_02]: 20-100.

1735
02:31:05,081 --> 02:31:06,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

1736
02:31:06,601 --> 02:31:07,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1737
02:31:17,279 --> 02:31:24,489
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-100, petition for common vigilance license by Freddie Alonzo, Melgar Alvarado.

1738
02:31:25,618 --> 02:31:51,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Alvarado 3 1 0 3 Washington Street Roxbury Mass 0 2 1 1 9 in Milton Antonio Melgar 48 Albion Street number 1 Somerville, Massachusetts 0 2 1 4 3 4 casa pizza 62 Lambert Street Medford, Massachusetts 0 2 1 5 5 on file business certificate 0 5 1 building department fire department police traffic impact health department treasurer letter of compliance and

[SPEAKER_14]: state tax ID, workman's compensation, and petition.

1740
02:31:56,083 --> 02:31:59,946
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I turn it over to the chairperson on licensing, Councilor Scarpelli.

1741
02:32:00,327 --> 02:32:02,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, and forgive us for...

1742
02:32:05,386 --> 02:32:06,366
[SPEAKER_02]: having you sit so long.

1743
02:32:06,426 --> 02:32:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that all the paperwork is in order.

1744
02:32:10,209 --> 02:32:11,250
[SPEAKER_02]: You have everything in order.

1745
02:32:11,710 --> 02:32:14,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this is a Lambert Street location.

1746
02:32:16,573 --> 02:32:18,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you worked in the field before?

1747
02:32:18,735 --> 02:32:19,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been in the business before?

1748
02:32:19,916 --> 02:32:20,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1749
02:32:20,816 --> 02:32:20,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1750
02:32:21,277 --> 02:32:22,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1751
02:32:22,338 --> 02:32:25,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And what type of food do you bring to this location?

1752
02:32:26,621 --> 02:32:27,901
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Italian pizza.

1753
02:32:28,582 --> 02:32:29,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just pizza or is it?

1754
02:32:30,143 --> 02:32:31,044
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some like

1755
02:32:32,022 --> 02:32:33,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of seafood, too.

1756
02:32:33,563 --> 02:32:33,863
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1757
02:32:34,064 --> 02:32:35,004
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1758
02:32:35,024 --> 02:32:36,386
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people will be working for you?

1759
02:32:36,666 --> 02:32:38,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's a small business.

1760
02:32:38,307 --> 02:32:39,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two people.

1761
02:32:39,208 --> 02:32:40,409
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1762
02:32:40,489 --> 02:32:41,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Hours of operation?

1763
02:32:43,091 --> 02:32:45,233
[SPEAKER_00]: It's between 10 to 11.

1764
02:32:45,333 --> 02:32:45,653
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 11.

1765
02:32:46,414 --> 02:32:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1766
02:32:47,414 --> 02:32:48,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So that falls on the premise.

1767
02:32:48,555 --> 02:32:49,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I have no other questions.

1768
02:32:49,956 --> 02:32:50,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I move approval.

1769
02:32:52,745 --> 02:32:56,386
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Bears, for approval.

1770
02:32:56,926 --> 02:32:57,686
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1771
02:32:57,806 --> 02:32:57,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1772
02:32:58,287 --> 02:32:59,007
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1773
02:32:59,487 --> 02:33:00,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1774
02:33:00,807 --> 02:33:01,487
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been approved.

1775
02:33:01,707 --> 02:33:02,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations and good luck.

1776
02:33:02,988 --> 02:33:03,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to the community.

1777
02:33:03,988 --> 02:33:04,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck.

1778
02:33:04,248 --> 02:33:04,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1779
02:33:06,809 --> 02:33:07,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1780
02:33:07,029 --> 02:33:10,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Revert back to the regular order of business, Mr. President.

1781
02:33:12,130 --> 02:33:16,131
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Bears, to revert back to the regular order of business.

1782
02:33:16,191 --> 02:33:16,852
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1783
02:33:16,892 --> 02:33:16,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1784
02:33:17,472 --> 02:33:18,032
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1785
02:33:18,052 --> 02:33:18,852
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1786
02:33:18,892 --> 02:33:21,273
[SPEAKER_14]: We will now revert back to the regular order of business.

1787
02:33:23,232 --> 02:33:27,555
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-096 offered by Vice President Councilor Caraviello.

1788
02:33:27,575 --> 02:33:35,261
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-098 offered by Councilor Knight.

1789
02:33:35,681 --> 02:33:48,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council Subcommittee on Zoning convene for the purpose of finalizing the Safe Access to Medical and Adult Use Marijuana Draft Ordinance for future deliberation before a committee of the whole meeting.

1790
02:33:51,803 --> 02:33:52,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1791
02:33:52,983 --> 02:33:54,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1792
02:33:54,804 --> 02:34:04,426
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been something that we've been kicking around now for what seems like four and a half, maybe five years, where the mayor's taken a public position that she's going to be recusing herself from the issue.

1793
02:34:05,306 --> 02:34:14,209
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a zoning subcommittee that's ready, willing, and able to finish up the draft and bring it forward to the committee of the whole for future deliberations and discussion.

1794
02:34:14,429 --> 02:34:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd ask that the council colleagues support this resolution in moving forward with the issue.

1795
02:34:20,486 --> 02:34:22,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, Councilor Bears.

1796
02:34:22,567 --> 02:34:26,630
[SPEAKER_26]: I strongly support moving forward as quickly as possible as well as we are.

1797
02:34:27,370 --> 02:34:32,653
[SPEAKER_26]: Four years out now almost since the ballot question in 2016 that started this whole process.

1798
02:34:32,673 --> 02:34:34,655
[SPEAKER_26]: I do have one kind of question.

1799
02:34:35,355 --> 02:34:44,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Are we able to amend this to say that this meeting should happen within the next month or is that a... All right, then no need for an amendment.

1800
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:45,541
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have this sooner than later.

1801
02:34:45,581 --> 02:34:46,482
[SPEAKER_26]: Great, thank you very much.

1802
02:34:46,642 --> 02:34:46,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1803
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:51,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1804
02:34:51,922 --> 02:34:58,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Being part of this committee that we worked on this for some years, it is long overdue that we're getting it out there.

1805
02:34:58,946 --> 02:35:05,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We are, from what I'm told, the last community in Massachusetts that has not passed out the ordinance.

1806
02:35:07,452 --> 02:35:13,975
[SPEAKER_06]: The Attorney General's Office gave the state until December of 19 to get these done.

1807
02:35:14,015 --> 02:35:20,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're three months after the deadline put out by the Attorney General's Office.

1808
02:35:20,778 --> 02:35:27,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other issue is this is voted on by the residents of Medford, whether we like it or don't like it.

1809
02:35:27,441 --> 02:35:30,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that they asked for and we're not doing.

1810
02:35:30,702 --> 02:35:34,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're leaving millions of dollars on the table at the moment.

1811
02:35:35,864 --> 02:35:43,973
[SPEAKER_06]: These small town like Belchertown has already collected over $5 million in revenue from these establishments.

1812
02:35:44,413 --> 02:35:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that we're leaving a lot of money on the table here.

1813
02:35:48,557 --> 02:35:52,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it's overdue and we're in violation of the law also on this.

1814
02:35:53,022 --> 02:35:58,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So the sooner we get this out there and get it done, let's get it over with.

1815
02:36:01,169 --> 02:36:02,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1816
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:03,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1817
02:36:03,570 --> 02:36:04,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1818
02:36:05,111 --> 02:36:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Just public for the viewing public, I know that I've received some emails from constituents that are totally against this.

1819
02:36:12,136 --> 02:36:17,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, to their understandings that this is something that was voted on in 2016.

1820
02:36:18,299 --> 02:36:26,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are required as a city council and a city to provide, I believe, at least three licenses.

1821
02:36:28,749 --> 02:36:39,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're for it or against it, I just wanted to reiterate that this is a mandate after the vote that was taken and moving forward with it.

1822
02:36:39,298 --> 02:36:49,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that Councilor Knight has already contacted us to move forward quickly and get a resolve and move this petition forward, so thank you.

1823
02:36:49,607 --> 02:36:50,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1824
02:36:50,888 --> 02:36:53,070
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1825
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:53,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

1826
02:36:54,471 --> 02:36:55,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1827
02:36:56,505 --> 02:36:57,105
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1828
02:36:57,125 --> 02:36:57,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1829
02:36:57,646 --> 02:36:58,286
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1830
02:36:58,306 --> 02:36:59,126
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1831
02:36:59,146 --> 02:37:02,448
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-096, offered by Vice President Caraviello.

1832
02:37:02,628 --> 02:37:08,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council sends its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Tony Anzalone.

1833
02:37:08,231 --> 02:37:12,953
[SPEAKER_14]: On his recent passing, Tony operated Tony's Barbershop in South Medford for 35 years.

1834
02:37:13,533 --> 02:37:20,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony was a longtime volunteer at the Medford Senior Center, where he was known for his singing of Frank Sinatra songs at many events.

1835
02:37:21,837 --> 02:37:23,858
[SPEAKER_14]: His presence in our community will be missed.

1836
02:37:24,598 --> 02:37:25,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caraviello.

1837
02:37:25,984 --> 02:37:26,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1838
02:37:26,844 --> 02:37:31,685
[SPEAKER_06]: As we move along here, icons in our community are passing along.

1839
02:37:32,965 --> 02:37:40,067
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were from the South Medford neighborhood, Tony operated the barbershop there for many, many, many years, 35 years.

1840
02:37:40,747 --> 02:37:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was a staple on Main Street there, and he recently passed away.

1841
02:37:46,608 --> 02:37:50,509
[SPEAKER_06]: But Tony was also, him and his wife volunteered

1842
02:37:51,329 --> 02:37:53,130
[SPEAKER_06]: every day at the senior center.

1843
02:37:54,191 --> 02:38:06,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, after his retirement, he continued to volunteer at the center, but he was also known, he did his Frank Sinatra impersonations, and he was very popular with the people over there.

1844
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:10,402
[SPEAKER_06]: For many, many years, he entertained the crowd over there.

1845
02:38:10,422 --> 02:38:19,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, another icon in the community has passed away, and his presence is gonna be missed, so condolences to his family.

1846
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:21,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1847
02:38:23,766 --> 02:38:26,812
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1848
02:38:48,439 --> 02:38:49,319
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

1849
02:38:49,339 --> 02:38:52,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, we actually have our first request for a suspension of the rules.

1850
02:38:53,680 --> 02:39:01,763
[SPEAKER_19]: A resident that's here tonight would like to speak on crosswalks on Salem Street, which he considers a public safety concern.

1851
02:39:02,003 --> 02:39:07,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, please come forward.

1852
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:09,125
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

1853
02:39:09,805 --> 02:39:12,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, it's Frank Neri from 6 Everett Street, Medford.

1854
02:39:13,786 --> 02:39:18,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to say welcome back to the five councilors and welcome to the two new councilors.

1855
02:39:19,151 --> 02:39:32,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I put in a request, uh, just around the beginning of the winter, but now that winter is almost over and spring is coming at the corner of Salem street and Everett street, we have

1856
02:39:33,342 --> 02:39:41,148
[SPEAKER_10]: The new three-story building that's going up on one corner of Salem and Everett, and a three-family house on Salem and Everett.

1857
02:39:41,268 --> 02:39:45,712
[SPEAKER_10]: And across the street, we have the tailor shop and a karate shop.

1858
02:39:47,532 --> 02:39:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's two or three school buses that are stopping in the afternoon to lift kids off going both east and west on Salem Street.

1859
02:39:56,999 --> 02:40:08,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And I sent a picture to Councilor Marks, and if he can share it with you or I can share it with you, it shows four, five, or six kids getting off a bus this way going across Salem Street.

1860
02:40:09,449 --> 02:40:10,770
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just can't believe that

1861
02:40:12,932 --> 02:40:23,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And the entrance of public safety that we can't get a crosswalk put there, going across Salem Street, north and south, and on Everett Street, east and west.

1862
02:40:24,295 --> 02:40:32,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like we have at Salem Street and Fulton Street or Salem Street and Court Street for the kids to cross the school, going to the school in the morning at the Roberts.

1863
02:40:34,042 --> 02:40:49,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I take my granddaughter across the street and it's a nightmare to get across the street with the school buses that stop there and the kids that are trying to come for an afternoon daycare session or karate school in the afternoon.

1864
02:40:50,307 --> 02:40:51,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody's going to get hit there.

1865
02:40:51,888 --> 02:40:58,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think if we can put blinking lights at nappies and blinking lights down here at this corner that we should be able to look into the

1866
02:41:00,731 --> 02:41:05,813
[SPEAKER_10]: procedure of getting a crosswalk at Salem and Everett, the L-shape, just like the other corners have.

1867
02:41:06,614 --> 02:41:07,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1868
02:41:07,154 --> 02:41:07,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1869
02:41:08,035 --> 02:41:20,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I could, in the interest of public safety, request that this be sent to the Traffic Commission in the interest of public safety, that they review a crosswalk at the intersection of Everett and Salem.

1870
02:41:21,041 --> 02:41:21,301
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1871
02:41:21,941 --> 02:41:22,342
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do that.

1872
02:41:22,902 --> 02:41:23,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1873
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:31,332
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I tried to get to the traffic commission meeting today at 2 o'clock, but I just couldn't get there at 2 in the afternoon.

1874
02:41:31,432 --> 02:41:36,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was home and I heard, you can, you can't, you can, you can't, come and speak before the council.

1875
02:41:36,933 --> 02:41:41,235
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just had to come down to say, I've got to get something in.

1876
02:41:41,495 --> 02:41:42,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1877
02:41:42,055 --> 02:41:42,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1878
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:58,062
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any papers.

1879
02:41:58,102 --> 02:42:00,843
[SPEAKER_14]: That needs to be posted.

1880
02:42:00,863 --> 02:42:01,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll introduce the paper.

1881
02:42:02,044 --> 02:42:04,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll introduce the paper.

1882
02:42:19,684 --> 02:42:34,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the city, Medford City Council requests that the building department report to the city council the status of the unfinished project on Winthrop Street regarding the hole in the rock.

1883
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:35,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1884
02:42:35,771 --> 02:42:38,392
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we will do is we will put that on the agenda for next week.

1885
02:42:38,572 --> 02:42:39,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1886
02:42:39,052 --> 02:42:40,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1887
02:42:44,486 --> 02:42:45,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes, yes, correct.

1888
02:42:46,328 --> 02:42:47,389
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been ruled out of order.

1889
02:42:47,409 --> 02:42:48,370
[SPEAKER_14]: It needs to go on the agenda.

1890
02:42:48,390 --> 02:42:49,651
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be on the agenda next week.

1891
02:42:50,172 --> 02:42:52,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please add that to the agenda for the next week.

1892
02:42:52,915 --> 02:42:54,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Greatly appreciate it, thank you.

1893
02:42:54,056 --> 02:42:58,822
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the only paper we have that's in the hands of the clerk, correct?

1894
02:43:00,198 --> 02:43:27,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 20-099, petition by Joseph A. Viglione, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Massachusetts, 02148, for 10 minutes to discuss moving the public access TV station to a central location and issues regarding station management, outreach and facilitation of programming, the TV website, the issuing authority, the query check issue, financing issues, accessibility, and a broad range of access

1895
02:43:28,264 --> 02:43:30,685
[SPEAKER_14]: television issues including membership.

1896
02:43:31,046 --> 02:43:35,448
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could please have your name and address for the record, and you do have 10 minutes, up to 10 minutes.

1897
02:43:35,708 --> 02:43:40,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Joe Villione, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Mass.

1898
02:43:42,471 --> 02:43:45,253
[SPEAKER_11]: May I wait until we can start after the council is finished?

1899
02:43:45,593 --> 02:43:47,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Please continue.

1900
02:43:47,934 --> 02:43:52,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I like, I respected him while he was speaking, so I'd like respect while I'm speaking.

1901
02:43:54,844 --> 02:44:04,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember a couple years ago, my friend Jean, paper was being torn up in the microphone when she was trying to speak, and this is about free speech.

1902
02:44:04,248 --> 02:44:16,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I think millions of dollars in public access is relevant, and Mr. Knight needs to stop harassing people while they were coming up to speak.

1903
02:44:16,433 --> 02:44:17,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the last person of the evening.

1904
02:44:18,154 --> 02:44:20,234
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not by accident, and that is not a coincidence.

1905
02:44:20,675 --> 02:44:21,555
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could please continue.

1906
02:44:24,804 --> 02:44:25,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Please continue.

1907
02:44:25,324 --> 02:44:25,705
[SPEAKER_11]: You have 10 minutes.

1908
02:44:25,725 --> 02:44:27,026
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'd like to start my 10 minutes.

1909
02:44:27,266 --> 02:44:37,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Crousy, I'd like to start my 10 minutes when this individual shows some respect to a petitioner, because he loves to make noise, and that's what public access and free speech is all about.

1910
02:44:37,954 --> 02:44:39,195
[SPEAKER_11]: People having the right to talk.

1911
02:44:39,215 --> 02:44:41,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Cruz, Mr. President, I'd like to call the meeting to order.

1912
02:44:42,918 --> 02:44:43,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1913
02:44:43,598 --> 02:44:45,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Viglione, please continue.

1914
02:44:46,040 --> 02:44:48,562
[SPEAKER_14]: You have 10 minutes, and you've already blown through, like, two.

1915
02:44:48,822 --> 02:44:50,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've asked the council for a seat.

1916
02:44:50,944 --> 02:44:52,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this individual wants to.

1917
02:44:52,245 --> 02:44:53,466
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd ask you to please continue.

1918
02:44:54,406 --> 02:44:57,548
[SPEAKER_11]: It's difficult to continue when someone is harassing and abusing someone.

1919
02:44:57,588 --> 02:44:58,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not do that to him.

1920
02:44:59,128 --> 02:44:59,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Bigelow, please.

1921
02:45:00,669 --> 02:45:03,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, a motion to table the matter.

1922
02:45:03,911 --> 02:45:07,592
[SPEAKER_14]: On a motion of Consul Knight to table the matter, seconded by Consul Caraviello.

1923
02:45:08,693 --> 02:45:09,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So do I not get to speak?

1924
02:45:11,534 --> 02:45:12,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I've waited all night.

1925
02:45:12,195 --> 02:45:12,875
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor.

1926
02:45:12,895 --> 02:45:13,575
[SPEAKER_14]: This is part of the process.

1927
02:45:13,595 --> 02:45:14,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he harassed me.

1928
02:45:14,656 --> 02:45:16,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I want to sanction him, because I warned him.

1929
02:45:16,397 --> 02:45:19,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, you don't have to do that, Mr. President.

1930
02:45:19,118 --> 02:45:21,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk Hurtubise, remember I wrote a note that I would be harassed?

1931
02:45:23,141 --> 02:45:26,303
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor, it's been seconded, a vote is going to happen.

1932
02:45:26,564 --> 02:45:28,685
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, other people want to speak from the community.

1933
02:45:28,745 --> 02:45:30,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that, but a motion has been made.

1934
02:45:30,806 --> 02:45:32,407
[SPEAKER_14]: So this needs to be voted on.

1935
02:45:32,487 --> 02:45:34,128
[SPEAKER_14]: If you do not want to table it, that is fine.

1936
02:45:34,708 --> 02:45:38,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to table by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1937
02:45:40,072 --> 02:45:41,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1938
02:45:42,493 --> 02:45:43,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Bears?

1939
02:45:43,254 --> 02:45:43,414
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1940
02:45:44,454 --> 02:45:45,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello?

1941
02:45:45,535 --> 02:45:45,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1942
02:45:46,375 --> 02:45:46,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight?

1943
02:45:46,896 --> 02:45:47,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1944
02:45:47,696 --> 02:45:48,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Martz?

1945
02:45:48,417 --> 02:45:48,597
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1946
02:45:49,397 --> 02:45:49,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Morell?

1947
02:45:49,978 --> 02:45:50,258
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1948
02:45:55,475 --> 02:45:56,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1949
02:45:59,016 --> 02:45:59,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1950
02:46:04,458 --> 02:46:06,779
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor to table.

1951
02:46:12,782 --> 02:46:14,202
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor to table.

1952
02:46:15,923 --> 02:46:16,743
[SPEAKER_14]: To table the conversation.

1953
02:46:16,763 --> 02:46:16,803
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1954
02:46:22,980 --> 02:46:24,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Three yes, four no.

1955
02:46:24,241 --> 02:46:24,962
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion fails.

1956
02:46:25,022 --> 02:46:25,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Please continue.

1957
02:46:25,763 --> 02:46:27,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Councilor Falco.

1958
02:46:28,205 --> 02:46:28,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I like you.

1959
02:46:29,426 --> 02:46:38,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving the TV station to a central location is something that Mayor McGlynn's tribunal said prior to the building of a station.

1960
02:46:38,853 --> 02:46:42,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I love that the high school has an exquisite TV station.

1961
02:46:42,136 --> 02:46:43,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's long overdue.

1962
02:46:44,117 --> 02:46:49,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are past councillors and even present councillors that agree with me that we need

1963
02:46:50,595 --> 02:46:54,937
[SPEAKER_11]: We need not to have grandma go up a dark road on the border of Winchester.

1964
02:46:56,298 --> 02:47:08,044
[SPEAKER_11]: The kids at the school, from what I understand, have the full reign of the station, so the citizens get less time.

1965
02:47:09,457 --> 02:47:11,178
[SPEAKER_11]: The station manager is here tonight.

1966
02:47:11,218 --> 02:47:14,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope there's a staffer over at the station in case people want to join.

1967
02:47:14,919 --> 02:47:15,640
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing.

1968
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:19,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford has never had a functional access station.

1969
02:47:19,021 --> 02:47:25,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So after TV3 was shut down, the city is now operating City Access TV.

1970
02:47:25,664 --> 02:47:36,188
[SPEAKER_11]: We still need to do, as Councilor Mark said earlier with another issue here, what does it take

1971
02:47:37,250 --> 02:47:39,432
[SPEAKER_11]: to increase public participation.

1972
02:47:39,852 --> 02:47:42,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So membership over at TV3.

1973
02:47:42,795 --> 02:47:43,936
[SPEAKER_11]: They claim 81 members.

1974
02:47:44,096 --> 02:47:46,719
[SPEAKER_11]: One has doubled, many politicians.

1975
02:47:47,319 --> 02:47:50,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a vision of 500 people joining the station by the end of 2020.

1976
02:47:51,977 --> 02:47:52,757
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll look towards 2000.

1977
02:47:54,198 --> 02:48:04,981
[SPEAKER_11]: As many of you may know, and some of you may not, the FCC, under this current inhabitant of the White House, is trying to take away certain monies for public access TV.

1978
02:48:05,541 --> 02:48:06,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Other people are cutting the cord.

1979
02:48:07,762 --> 02:48:18,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So the monies that were available five years ago, ten years ago, when we had a station that wasn't operating properly, there were color bars, they were at Riverside Avenue, there was no connectivity.

1980
02:48:18,812 --> 02:48:20,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have the opportunity to bring people in.

1981
02:48:21,575 --> 02:48:27,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And those young ladies that were up here earlier, that everyone really enjoyed their presentation.

1982
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:29,042
[SPEAKER_11]: What's not to like about it?

1983
02:48:29,949 --> 02:48:34,112
[SPEAKER_11]: A functional access TV station can enhance what those young ladies are doing.

1984
02:48:34,772 --> 02:48:43,858
[SPEAKER_11]: The school can interact with public access in a whole different way, because they can have their school channel, we have the government channel, we have the public channel, when they relate together.

1985
02:48:44,139 --> 02:48:45,139
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been doing this since 1979.

1986
02:48:46,941 --> 02:48:49,742
[SPEAKER_11]: When it all works together, you have wonderful access.

1987
02:48:50,083 --> 02:48:57,007
[SPEAKER_11]: You have, in Reading, they have the senior citizens hang out in the front of the access station, which is an old movie theater.

1988
02:48:57,568 --> 02:48:59,129
[SPEAKER_11]: They hang out and have coffee on Saturdays.

1989
02:48:59,409 --> 02:49:02,213
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not doing public access, it's a community media center.

1990
02:49:02,633 --> 02:49:05,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, here's the power of public access.

1991
02:49:05,476 --> 02:49:08,861
[SPEAKER_11]: In October, I interviewed a publisher who had a book out.

1992
02:49:10,542 --> 02:49:12,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And he asked me to write for his newspaper.

1993
02:49:13,264 --> 02:49:16,446
[SPEAKER_11]: And as many of you know, for 10 years, we've been wanting to bring a newspaper in.

1994
02:49:16,786 --> 02:49:24,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So my vision is public access, a radio station, which former Mayor Muccini-Burke really liked the idea before she became mayor.

1995
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:25,631
[SPEAKER_11]: We were talking about it.

1996
02:49:25,651 --> 02:49:31,814
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, Joe, I can get Homeland Security to put some money in for an emergency AM 1570 in expanded band.

1997
02:49:32,335 --> 02:49:35,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm talking about it all working together because there are some people that don't have internet.

1998
02:49:36,497 --> 02:49:42,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we have an emergency channel, Chief Buckley, Chief Gilberti, now they have a tool that they don't have currently.

1999
02:49:43,199 --> 02:49:49,461
[SPEAKER_11]: They have AM radio, we can get a low power FM, we have the newspaper, we have public access, we have the internet.

2000
02:49:49,761 --> 02:49:50,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's covered.

2001
02:49:50,781 --> 02:49:54,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the close to 60,000 people in Medford have something.

2002
02:49:55,022 --> 02:49:56,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to work with the mayor.

2003
02:49:57,003 --> 02:49:59,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to work with the city council.

2004
02:49:59,384 --> 02:50:03,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I want us to move forward with access television in a bright and exciting way.

2005
02:50:04,565 --> 02:50:07,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Gordon is very well versed over there at the high school.

2006
02:50:07,646 --> 02:50:09,267
[SPEAKER_11]: He can run the high school channel.

2007
02:50:09,487 --> 02:50:11,787
[SPEAKER_11]: But we build a new entity.

2008
02:50:12,267 --> 02:50:24,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I believe there's something going through the legislature in Boston to try to get funding from streaming to replace the funding that's going to go away when Comcast and Verizon get what they want.

2009
02:50:24,831 --> 02:50:25,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what they want.

2010
02:50:25,672 --> 02:50:32,334
[SPEAKER_11]: First, they want Beacon Hill to dictate to all the cities and towns, it all go through Boston, so you people no longer have an ascertainment hearing.

2011
02:50:33,234 --> 02:50:34,515
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they're lobbying for.

2012
02:50:35,016 --> 02:50:38,899
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to have a real public access station for the city.

2013
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:48,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And all due respect to Patrick, he's doing a great job over at the high school, but he does not understand the vision for access that I've had for the past 40 years.

2014
02:50:49,369 --> 02:50:52,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know that I've worked on Medford access issues since 2002.

2015
02:50:53,974 --> 02:50:55,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm passionate about this.

2016
02:50:56,016 --> 02:50:56,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the knowledge.

2017
02:50:56,836 --> 02:50:57,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the expertise.

2018
02:50:58,658 --> 02:51:00,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I would also like my show on the air.

2019
02:51:00,899 --> 02:51:07,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm living in Malden now, but I believe if you don't live in the city, you can still air on TV3 Medford.

2020
02:51:07,541 --> 02:51:08,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on many, many stations.

2021
02:51:09,301 --> 02:51:10,822
[SPEAKER_11]: We just had the Cars biographer.

2022
02:51:11,262 --> 02:51:18,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And because of my access show and interviewing this publisher, we now have a new newspaper in Medford that you're all invited to write for.

2023
02:51:19,604 --> 02:51:27,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Pure free speech and and it's everywhere and it's very exciting because I'm seeing people reading it on the bus I'm seeing people picking it up and getting very excited.

2024
02:51:28,029 --> 02:51:31,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I work very hard to do this I thank the City Council for listening to me.

2025
02:51:31,551 --> 02:51:41,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to raise membership I think we could do 500 by the end of the year, but we have to work together Thank you Name an address for the record.

2026
02:51:42,297 --> 02:51:47,940
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, thank you Ken Krause 50 mystic Street Medford unlike the

2027
02:51:48,933 --> 02:51:51,715
[SPEAKER_25]: The person who just spoke, I am a Medford resident.

2028
02:51:51,815 --> 02:51:54,476
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been a Medford resident for 20 years.

2029
02:51:54,676 --> 02:51:57,918
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm a Medford residential taxpayer.

2030
02:52:01,246 --> 02:52:07,511
[SPEAKER_25]: Comcast cable subscriber, and I'm a member of Medford Community Media.

2031
02:52:07,991 --> 02:52:20,041
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would like to share some information with the viewing public about what is happening at Medford Community Media and not what is not happening at Medford Community Media.

2032
02:52:21,482 --> 02:52:24,584
[SPEAKER_25]: The station director has been doing an excellent job.

2033
02:52:24,744 --> 02:52:26,045
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a staff of one person.

2034
02:52:27,901 --> 02:52:29,382
[SPEAKER_25]: doing a tremendous amount of work.

2035
02:52:29,663 --> 02:52:34,127
[SPEAKER_25]: They could use multiple people there, but that's to be determined in future budgets.

2036
02:52:35,749 --> 02:52:37,210
[SPEAKER_25]: Just three things I want to mention.

2037
02:52:37,490 --> 02:52:44,197
[SPEAKER_25]: One is there's a fantastic show being presented, started last fall called Medford

2038
02:52:45,818 --> 02:52:51,123
[SPEAKER_25]: It was started by Melanie McLaughlin, who now is a member of the Medford School Committee.

2039
02:52:51,623 --> 02:52:55,306
[SPEAKER_25]: And it focuses on issues related to education in Medford.

2040
02:52:55,346 --> 02:53:03,413
[SPEAKER_25]: The first three shows were on food insecurity, which is a big issue for families and students in the schools.

2041
02:53:04,074 --> 02:53:09,098
[SPEAKER_25]: The second program was on vaping, which is another huge issue.

2042
02:53:09,562 --> 02:53:21,887
[SPEAKER_25]: issue in the schools, and the third program was on CCSR, the Center for Social Responsibility and Citizenship, which we just heard about tonight and we hear about frequently.

2043
02:53:23,167 --> 02:53:27,409
[SPEAKER_25]: Melanie started the show, she's a documentary filmmaker of some regard.

2044
02:53:28,289 --> 02:53:40,401
[SPEAKER_25]: And started the show with the idea of getting it off the ground using a lot of student assistance on the production, but ultimately turning the show over to the students to present.

2045
02:53:40,961 --> 02:53:45,646
[SPEAKER_25]: And the most recent show actually was the first one that a student hosted.

2046
02:53:46,446 --> 02:53:48,388
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, CCSR, there's a,

2047
02:53:49,633 --> 02:54:04,112
[SPEAKER_25]: A group of CCSR students working currently on a project that looks at 50 years of environmental advocacy over at the Medford High School, and interestingly enough, the types of advocacy you've seen recently

2048
02:54:05,293 --> 02:54:19,429
[SPEAKER_25]: from CCSR students such as the presentation about getting styrofoam banned actually dates back to the 70s when students at Medford High School came before the city council to request that the city start buying recycled paper.

2049
02:54:20,570 --> 02:54:25,093
[SPEAKER_25]: that they clean up certain derelict properties in the city, a number of things.

2050
02:54:25,133 --> 02:54:30,697
[SPEAKER_25]: So Medford has a long legacy at the high school and throughout the community of environmental advocacy.

2051
02:54:30,717 --> 02:54:44,066
[SPEAKER_25]: So these students are producing a number of things, that television show will be one of them, to demonstrate that and to document it and to kind of create a legacy that the future students can follow.

2052
02:54:44,406 --> 02:54:47,528
[SPEAKER_25]: But so a student hosted that show, who's part of that committee.

2053
02:54:48,269 --> 02:54:49,750
[SPEAKER_25]: A student operated the camera.

2054
02:54:50,970 --> 02:54:58,995
[SPEAKER_25]: And three students were in the production booth doing all the production and the graphics with the assistance of Patrick Gordon.

2055
02:54:59,335 --> 02:55:01,796
[SPEAKER_25]: The show was done in about five days.

2056
02:55:02,296 --> 02:55:03,117
[SPEAKER_25]: It's online now.

2057
02:55:03,157 --> 02:55:03,857
[SPEAKER_25]: It can be watched.

2058
02:55:04,337 --> 02:55:05,318
[SPEAKER_25]: It'll be on YouTube.

2059
02:55:05,358 --> 02:55:08,179
[SPEAKER_25]: It'll be on the in the rotation of the

2060
02:55:09,912 --> 02:55:11,573
[SPEAKER_25]: television station for everybody to view.

2061
02:55:12,093 --> 02:55:16,454
[SPEAKER_25]: And I really recommend people to watch that show because it's excellent and there'll be future ones coming.

2062
02:55:16,474 --> 02:55:17,395
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's just one example.

2063
02:55:17,795 --> 02:55:27,758
[SPEAKER_25]: The second thing that Patrick Gordon is doing is he's been heavily involved with Words and Music, which is a first Friday of the month program at the West Medford Community Center.

2064
02:55:27,818 --> 02:55:30,859
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, if you haven't heard of it, I would recommend you go watch it.

2065
02:55:30,939 --> 02:55:33,600
[SPEAKER_25]: Watch the archive programs that are all available online.

2066
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:40,923
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a show every first Friday where they take the first hour and they discuss with a panel of people a topic of community interest.

2067
02:55:41,423 --> 02:55:43,563
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the second hour is live music.

2068
02:55:44,604 --> 02:55:51,826
[SPEAKER_25]: Patrick Gordon and the staff is there every first Friday and also uses it as a training ground for people in the community.

2069
02:55:52,327 --> 02:55:58,309
[SPEAKER_25]: This past Friday there were adults manning the cameras, working on the other equipment there.

2070
02:55:58,489 --> 02:56:01,310
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a very great learning experience and it, again,

2071
02:56:02,190 --> 02:56:17,390
[SPEAKER_25]: presents to the community the value of public access, the outreach is being done, and the proof and the product is people are learning how to do this and will hopefully continue to be engaged in future programs of that nature.

2072
02:56:18,891 --> 02:56:38,461
[SPEAKER_25]: The third example I would give you is last fall there was a program that I happened to be on as a guest and afterward Patrick, who knew I'm involved with the arts community, asked me if I knew of anybody who he could contact about trying to establish an art exhibit in the

2073
02:56:39,581 --> 02:56:40,542
[SPEAKER_25]: studio space.

2074
02:56:40,602 --> 02:56:46,206
[SPEAKER_25]: There were two blank walls that he thought were underutilized and elsewhere he had seen that had been done.

2075
02:56:46,606 --> 02:56:49,268
[SPEAKER_25]: So I gave him a couple of names and that was it.

2076
02:56:49,688 --> 02:57:07,741
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, he worked on it all through the winter and last month the Medford Community Media Center had its first art exhibit during which the artists were interviewed for a future program and there's going to be rotating art exhibits going forward throughout the year and future programs on

2077
02:57:08,982 --> 02:57:11,104
[SPEAKER_25]: the arts community in Medford.

2078
02:57:11,184 --> 02:57:21,635
[SPEAKER_25]: So those are just three examples that I've seen as a member, as a resident of what we're getting out of the work of the community access station.

2079
02:57:22,235 --> 02:57:24,478
[SPEAKER_25]: And it really bothers me when

2080
02:57:26,368 --> 02:57:32,470
[SPEAKER_25]: the perception of the station is presented in a way that's not accurate.

2081
02:57:32,630 --> 02:57:40,052
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I just hope people will take the time to look at some of these programs that are being offered at the station.

2082
02:57:40,692 --> 02:57:42,072
[SPEAKER_25]: They are very good quality.

2083
02:57:42,653 --> 02:57:44,253
[SPEAKER_25]: The support is there.

2084
02:57:44,953 --> 02:57:46,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone is welcome.

2085
02:57:47,034 --> 02:57:51,575
[SPEAKER_25]: And I encourage you to get involved with the public access station because it is a great asset.

2086
02:57:51,835 --> 02:57:54,756
[SPEAKER_25]: The station itself is very well equipped.

2087
02:57:55,506 --> 02:58:14,639
[SPEAKER_25]: The support is there, and I hope when the budget comes around in the few months ahead that we can look at adding some additional money for the station, whether through the cable access fees or some other way where perhaps additional staffing could be used, because that will only help the station be more effective in serving the community.

2088
02:58:14,679 --> 02:58:15,199
[SPEAKER_25]: So, thank you.

2089
02:58:15,219 --> 02:58:16,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2090
02:58:19,002 --> 02:58:20,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you please have your name and address for the record?

2091
02:58:21,621 --> 02:58:26,089
[SPEAKER_23]: Laura Duggan, 31, Hickory Ave., in the Heights, Medford Heights.

2092
02:58:27,070 --> 02:58:35,605
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of station manager Patrick Gordon of Medford Community Media, Medford's local cable channel.

2093
02:58:36,542 --> 02:58:48,089
[SPEAKER_23]: As the hostess of a MCM show entitled, Looking Back at Medford History, for almost two years, I've had the opportunity to see Mr. Gordon at work.

2094
02:58:48,810 --> 02:58:56,835
[SPEAKER_23]: He has proved to be an excellent, on all accounts, demonstrating a professionalism that is a credit to the city of Medford.

2095
02:58:57,495 --> 02:59:00,137
[SPEAKER_23]: He is a friendly guy and very helpful.

2096
02:59:01,177 --> 02:59:04,359
[SPEAKER_23]: Under the management of Patrick Gordon, MCM has flourished.

2097
02:59:04,759 --> 02:59:19,408
[SPEAKER_23]: Many new and entertaining shows are now available for the viewing public, and Medford High School students have had the opportunity to develop programming due to the close proximity of the station to the high school.

2098
02:59:20,088 --> 02:59:26,412
[SPEAKER_23]: The necessity to quarry members of MCM is not a problem for those who have nothing to hide, would you agree?

2099
02:59:28,224 --> 02:59:38,388
[SPEAKER_23]: As far as outreach, station manager Patrick Gordon has established an off-site location at West Medford Community Center.

2100
02:59:38,868 --> 02:59:43,190
[SPEAKER_23]: Weekly programming from there is shared with the entire community.

2101
02:59:44,010 --> 02:59:51,413
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition to excellent programming, we now have a wonderful webpage which offers easy access to membership.

2102
02:59:52,193 --> 02:59:58,355
[SPEAKER_23]: training, program scheduling, and to see any of the programs that have already aired.

2103
02:59:58,955 --> 03:00:15,399
[SPEAKER_23]: Many of the people I have interviewed on my show, I've been doing this for two years, I don't know, it might be 20, 25 interviews now, who might be from, not Medford, can have their friends watch it, and are watching it, and they're learning now more about Medford through these interviews, and also it's out there.

2104
03:00:15,439 --> 03:00:18,020
[SPEAKER_23]: But my show is just one of many new shows.

2105
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:19,421
[SPEAKER_23]: Another thing is,

2106
03:00:21,301 --> 03:00:27,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Medford citizens have been able to see and hear the candidates that were running in the last local election.

2107
03:00:28,104 --> 03:00:38,348
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't remember when I ever saw that available to the public, where you could watch everyone make a statement about where they were and then watch the debate, the mayoral debate.

2108
03:00:39,208 --> 03:00:43,790
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I think that was the highest form of public service to the city of Medford.

2109
03:00:44,430 --> 03:00:47,872
[SPEAKER_23]: And Mr. Gordon made sure that happened.

2110
03:00:49,156 --> 03:01:00,979
[SPEAKER_23]: So if, and also if you don't want, if someone doesn't want to leave the comfort of their home and on a night that's a city council meeting is happening, they can catch it on MCM.

2111
03:01:01,739 --> 03:01:04,300
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's also another service to the public.

2112
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:10,262
[SPEAKER_23]: Medford is lucky to have Patrick at the helm of Medford Community Media.

2113
03:01:10,942 --> 03:01:13,643
[SPEAKER_23]: He needs to be commended at the very least.

2114
03:01:13,963 --> 03:01:14,743
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

2115
03:01:15,563 --> 03:01:15,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2116
03:01:17,524 --> 03:01:18,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

2117
03:01:18,561 --> 03:01:19,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2118
03:01:19,421 --> 03:01:27,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank the two residents who got up and spoke about all the positive things that are happening at the station.

2119
03:01:28,547 --> 03:01:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't also know that the new equipment that we have here and the streamline that we have from all our council hall meetings and the subcommittee meetings are all done because of Patrick.

2120
03:01:41,257 --> 03:01:45,018
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the one that set this up and taught us how to use these things.

2121
03:01:45,498 --> 03:01:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And say, this station is moving forward.

2122
03:01:47,879 --> 03:01:52,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not moving backwards, as some people will lead you to believe.

2123
03:01:53,020 --> 03:01:58,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And to say, during the last two election cycles, Mr. Gordon was there with every candidate.

2124
03:01:59,561 --> 03:02:04,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And so every candidate had a chance to be interviewed for AXS TV like everyone else.

2125
03:02:05,083 --> 03:02:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

2126
03:02:07,365 --> 03:02:09,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Has has done his own show on there.

2127
03:02:09,428 --> 03:02:18,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I say things are happening there and mr. Gordon is doing a good job In the station there Thank You Councilor Caraviello Councilor Marks

2128
03:02:19,707 --> 03:02:20,748
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2129
03:02:22,568 --> 03:02:25,610
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the opportunity to work with Patrick for close to a year.

2130
03:02:26,650 --> 03:02:29,752
[SPEAKER_19]: He's the one that welcomed me up to Channel 3, the new facility.

2131
03:02:30,252 --> 03:02:34,694
[SPEAKER_19]: I was one of the first local access programs to air, Mr. President.

2132
03:02:35,875 --> 03:02:38,056
[SPEAKER_19]: He was very professional in my dealings with him.

2133
03:02:38,876 --> 03:02:42,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Always had a vision to expand local community access.

2134
03:02:43,118 --> 03:02:49,661
[SPEAKER_19]: to invite new people into Community Access, to actually, years ago, there used to be a fee to get into Community Access.

2135
03:02:50,001 --> 03:02:53,102
[SPEAKER_19]: There is no longer a fee to join Community Access.

2136
03:02:53,542 --> 03:02:55,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone can go up and start a show.

2137
03:02:56,283 --> 03:02:57,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone can get involved.

2138
03:02:57,884 --> 03:03:03,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone can go out and tape their own and bring it to the station and do editing and so forth.

2139
03:03:03,526 --> 03:03:06,168
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe the station is on the rise.

2140
03:03:07,088 --> 03:03:08,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Would I like to see more membership?

2141
03:03:08,829 --> 03:03:09,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

2142
03:03:09,749 --> 03:03:11,870
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think it'll come over time, Mr. President.

2143
03:03:12,270 --> 03:03:22,476
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it will come over time that you will see some more local programming and as was mentioned by some of the speakers, you know, we're running an operation in a city of 58,000 people with one person.

2144
03:03:25,742 --> 03:03:32,971
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go to Community Access in Malden, Somerville, they have upwards of 7, 8, 9, 10 people running Community Access.

2145
03:03:33,332 --> 03:03:35,715
[SPEAKER_19]: We have one person, Mr. President.

2146
03:03:36,436 --> 03:03:40,081
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think he's doing the best he can with what he has, Mr. President.

2147
03:03:40,802 --> 03:03:43,185
[SPEAKER_19]: And I only see good things for Community Access.

2148
03:03:43,565 --> 03:03:45,267
[SPEAKER_19]: I see more community participation.

2149
03:03:45,687 --> 03:03:50,792
[SPEAKER_19]: They are very welcoming in my experience and in talking to other people that have produced.

2150
03:03:50,812 --> 03:03:51,853
[SPEAKER_19]: I've watched Laura's show.

2151
03:03:52,113 --> 03:03:53,214
[SPEAKER_19]: She has an excellent show.

2152
03:03:53,754 --> 03:03:56,196
[SPEAKER_19]: And they are very welcoming up there.

2153
03:03:56,577 --> 03:03:58,398
[SPEAKER_19]: They're willing to pick up the camera and help.

2154
03:03:59,099 --> 03:04:11,889
[SPEAKER_19]: because it's not a matter of just creating a show, it's a matter of editing, having a producer, and Patrick served in all those functions at one point or another to make sure that we were able to get local programs on.

2155
03:04:12,409 --> 03:04:15,111
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, does more need to happen?

2156
03:04:15,291 --> 03:04:15,791
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

2157
03:04:15,811 --> 03:04:16,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Will it happen?

2158
03:04:16,852 --> 03:04:18,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely, Mr. President.

2159
03:04:18,133 --> 03:04:22,276
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have confidence that we're going in the right direction with community access.

2160
03:04:22,877 --> 03:04:23,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2161
03:04:23,757 --> 03:04:24,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Bears.

2162
03:04:25,007 --> 03:04:25,867
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2163
03:04:25,927 --> 03:04:29,789
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to commend Patrick and the membership of Medford Community Media.

2164
03:04:29,869 --> 03:04:32,270
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd like to make a motion to receive this and place it on file.

2165
03:04:32,550 --> 03:04:32,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

2166
03:04:33,911 --> 03:04:39,393
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Council of Bears to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2167
03:04:41,254 --> 03:04:43,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make a clarification about something said about me.

2168
03:04:44,716 --> 03:04:45,096
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

2169
03:04:46,118 --> 03:04:49,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, my late partner and I gave a quarter of a million dollars to Medford.

2170
03:04:50,102 --> 03:04:54,407
[SPEAKER_11]: My father lived here back in the 30s, so on Park Street, right near where I live.

2171
03:04:54,447 --> 03:04:58,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mayor Lungo-Koehn has my background clearance form.

2172
03:04:59,091 --> 03:05:02,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in a management position, so I have a background clearance form.

2173
03:05:02,515 --> 03:05:03,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I have nothing to hide.

2174
03:05:03,656 --> 03:05:05,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a very happy guy that fights for access rights.

2175
03:05:06,097 --> 03:05:07,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And thirdly, I was very positive.

2176
03:05:08,058 --> 03:05:09,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I said good things about Pat Gordon.

2177
03:05:09,879 --> 03:05:11,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need one person at the school, I do.

2178
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:17,423
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was saying that we need to do what Mayor McGlynn's tribunal said, centrally located.

2179
03:05:17,843 --> 03:05:19,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Not West Medford, not at the senior center.

2180
03:05:20,144 --> 03:05:22,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Pat's doing a great job at the high school.

2181
03:05:22,665 --> 03:05:23,706
[SPEAKER_11]: They mentioned the children.

2182
03:05:24,186 --> 03:05:25,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about the public.

2183
03:05:25,527 --> 03:05:26,687
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a very positive speech.

2184
03:05:26,807 --> 03:05:27,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2185
03:05:27,428 --> 03:05:27,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2186
03:05:28,629 --> 03:05:33,190
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight, to receive and place on file.

2187
03:05:33,210 --> 03:05:34,651
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

2188
03:05:35,231 --> 03:05:35,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2189
03:05:37,092 --> 03:05:37,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2190
