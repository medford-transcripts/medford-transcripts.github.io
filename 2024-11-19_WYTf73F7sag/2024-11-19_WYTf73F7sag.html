    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=934.536s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=935.497s">Everybody,</a>  am I good? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=936.478s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=937.059s">And</a>  thank you, Mr. President, for putting this item on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=940.141s">Dave</a>  Rodriguez, Chief of Staff, Office of the Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=942.543s">I'm</a>  joined tonight by Mary Ann O'Connor, who's the Director of the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=946.086s">This</a>  is an issue that the mayor's office and the mayor specifically is taking super seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=950.809s">We</a>  spent a lot of staff time over the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=952.571s">I</a>  was encouraged to see the piece on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=955.093s">So</a>  we got together in order for us to update the community and update the council on some of the things that the administration's doing in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=963.559s">increase</a>  our preparedness with regard to the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=967.362s">So</a>  I'll hand it off to Marianne and we can go back and forth, have a conversation about the administration's situational response to the issue.</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=977.467s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=978.588s">Thank</a>  you for having us here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=981.161s">So</a>  yes, this is a true public health concern, and while here in Medford the risk still remains low, it is certainly something we're taking very, very seriously, and we know it's an evolving situation that could change at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=995.464s">So</a>  for several weeks now, my department has been on weekly phone calls with the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, as well as the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1005.005s">Department</a>  of Public Health, discussing guidance <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1009.119s">and</a>  preventing measures we could take. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1011.72s">At</a>  this point, we're really beyond containment and at mitigation statewide and nationwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1019.264s">Obviously,</a>  as you've heard, the best precautions, the best prevention is wash your hands, hand sanitizer, cough etiquette, stay home if you're sick, which we're also talking about in real discussions around what we call non-pharmaceutical interventions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1037.611s">The</a>  best one of those is what's called social distancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1040.572s">So,</a>  examples of social distancing you've seen already in the news, those are your travel restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1047.695s">You</a>  saw the governor today saying that he's going to halt seminars and conferences and travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1054.838s">Going</a>  forward, these are things that we're gonna need to discuss around social distancing and what does that mean for Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1061.641s">Does</a>  that mean we have to really start looking hard and seriously at canceling some events that may be difficult? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1067.912s">but</a>  certainly necessary for the good of the citizens of Medford and for our safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1074.294s">So</a>  we've also met with local emergency personnel and a couple of weeks ago at a department head meeting, we really started the conversation around what's called continuity of operations and really asked department heads to start thinking about what happens in their department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1091.044s">What</a>  are the essential functions of their department that we need to continue to do to serve the citizens of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1097.091s">But</a>  what are those functions that if we get really thin, if absenteeism really hits the roof and we're not able to do, what are those functions that we can temporarily suspend? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1106.841s">What</a>  are those functions that some of your employees could do remotely from home? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1110.752s">And</a>  to really have department heads start thinking about, what if they get sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1114.733s">Who's</a>  in charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1115.913s">Who's</a>  the next in charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1117.434s">Who's</a>  the next after that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1120.314s">So</a>  those efforts are underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1122.295s">We're</a>  really going to be honing down on department heads to really come up with those plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1125.936s">They're</a>  called COOP plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1127.756s">And</a>  so we're working with them on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1130.257s">We</a>  also have another meeting scheduled tomorrow with all the emergency management personnel going forward to start making plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1139.608s">been</a>  training and talking with first responders and looking to make sure they have the proper equipment as you've all heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1146.131s">masks</a>  are scarce, so we've been gathering up what we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1149.693s">Right</a>  now we think we're good, but obviously going forward, it was good to hear in the governor's news conference today that they have some PPE coming in from the national stockpile. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1160.781s">Hopefully</a>  that will trickle down to communities as well, because if this thing keeps evolving, we're probably going to need those supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1171.027s">The</a>  school department we've been in close contact with every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1173.438s">I</a>  have my morning call with the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1176.83s">And</a>  as you know, you've seen efforts that we've taken there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1180.633s">And</a>  some of those are social distancing efforts, like what happened with the teachers who had returned from those countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1188.179s">So</a>  any other questions, anything I've missed?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1190.701s">So</a>  just briefly, as it was released today, and we did do some extensive outreach this afternoon, there has been a presumptive positive test for a case in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1202.15s">We</a>  release that information, we're certainly not obligated, and we spoke with DPH regarding the release of that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1208.152s">It's</a>  our commitment to give the information to the public as much as we can, as quickly as we can, in order to one, make sure that they have the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1216.674s">Second</a>  of all, to make sure that they're advised of some of the mitigation and the general precautions, the hand washing, the disinfecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1223.035s">the</a>  social distancing, some of those efforts, and also to alleviate concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1227.86s">We</a>  truly understand how much anxiety this is driving for the public in general, and we want to make sure more information is always going to be better than less, and any information that we can give, we want to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1240.233s">Of</a>  course there is information we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1242.235s">There's</a>  privacy concerns that are in play, identities, locations, exact circumstances of attraction, stuff to that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1248.84s">We</a>  work closely together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1250.142s">I</a>  think Marianne spent three or four hours in my office today strategizing on these things, working on these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1256.306s">All</a>  department has been instructed in order to do coup planning in order to ensure the delivery of services, identification of essential functions and essential personnel in order to make sure the government keeps running, that we can continue to provide these services. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1269.371s">So</a>  the mayor is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1272.37s">I</a>  can't stress this enough, is that the mayor's commitment to transparency regarding this issue is paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1278.293s">And</a>  every piece of information that we can give, we are going to give as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1282.415s">We</a>  think that can mitigate and contain the spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1287.117s">It's</a>  beyond the point of being able to stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1289.898s">We</a>  have to try to mitigate what's going to happen now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1293.241s">So</a>  the meeting that's going to take place with emergency management personnel is going to be very important for us tomorrow so that we can rely on the guidance that's been given by Department of Public Health, CDC, the governor's office, the Declaration of the State of Emergency, and analyze that for how we can adapt those plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1312.337s">Public</a>  safety dispatchers have been given protocols as to what to do and what questions to ask if somebody calls 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1319.583s">Regarding</a>  an issue like this, too, in order to protect the first responders that are responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1323.406s">Protocols</a>  have been put in place for fire and police for them as they respond to make sure that they're insured safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1330.994s">Kirkland</a>  Washington was a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1332.976s">We</a>  took some really hard lessons from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1334.998s">they</a>  have 25 firefighters stuck in a firehouse as quarantine because they all rushed in because that's what they're trained to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1341.524s">If</a>  somebody's in trouble, they want to go help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1343.606s">So</a>  we have to slow things down a little bit in that regard to make sure that the firefighters stay safe, the first responders stay safe, ambulance stay safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1350.632s">We're</a>  trying to be as thoughtful as we can in this approach.</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1354.255s">And</a>  we do have the public information set up on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1357.557s">We</a>  would refer people for more information to go to the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1362.634s">And</a>  as well as the DPH website and the CDC website for guidance.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1366.876s">We</a>  have some very helpful frequently asked questions that are on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1370.957s">Trying</a>  to make it as simple as we can for folks that we brainstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1374.938s">What</a>  questions would we ask if we were on the outside looking in on some of these issues that we're constantly updating, we're constantly trying to be responsive and kind of adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1383.541s">The</a>  ground is shifting on us a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1385.201s">So</a>  we're trying to be responsive to that as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1389.555s">Thank</a>  you very much for your briefing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1390.936s">Very</a>  informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1391.916s">I</a>  watched the school committee last night, the school committee meeting, and that was, they talked about what they were doing in the schools, and that was very informative as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1401.18s">So</a>  if we take a look at, you know, our different public buildings throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1404.842s">So</a>  if we take a look at, you take a look at our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1407.683s">You</a>  know, they talked about, I think it was a GENEO machine that comes in and sanitizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1414.546s">Okay,</a>  they talked about that now it sanitizes the classrooms and stuff like that, which is great And I know they have a they've had one deep cleaning and I think another one scheduled soon Okay, so so which is I <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1430.438s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1430.718s">As</a>  a parent, that's what I want to hear that, you know, our school spaces are clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1434.223s">And</a>  so what about our other public buildings like City Hall, the library, senior center, those being cleaned as well and scrubbed down and whatnot?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1444.781s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1445.501s">All</a>  those buildings are regularly cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1448.002s">And</a>  I do know that the bathrooms here at City Hall were deep cleaned recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1452.104s">But</a>  that is going to be a subject, a point of discussion tomorrow about how we approach that and how we contract out to make sure that gets done.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1459.447s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1459.887s">I</a>  mean, when I look at the library and I look at the senior center, I look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1463.428s">City</a>  Hall, you know, I mean, there's hundreds if not thousands of people utilizing these spaces, you know, on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1469.453s">So,</a>  we just want to make sure that, you know, we're, you know, keep our schools clean, of course, but also, you know, public spaces or public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1476.478s">So,</a>  thank you very much for your information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1478.44s">Appreciate</a>  all your help.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1479.941s">We</a>  are available all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1481.203s">Please</a>  email the mayor's public email address if there is any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1485.167s">We're</a>  happy to be a resource for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1486.969s">We</a>  understand how much how how concerning this is for the public because we're part of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1492.275s">So</a>  we're concerned, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1493.436s">So</a>  we genuinely want to be as informative as we can.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1506.135s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1508.556s">Just</a>  two quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1510.458s">First,</a>  how does, you mentioned personal protective equipment and some other stuff, what ways does the Governor's declaration of a state of emergency affect how we were preparing up until this afternoon when he declared it?</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1523.286s">As</a>  far as PPE goes?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1524.547s">Or</a>  just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1525.928s">You</a>  mentioned PPE as one example, is there other?</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1528.069s">So</a>  I wanted to say that Monica Burrell, who's the DPH Commissioner, she mentioned on the conference call, the conference <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1533.394s">this</a>  afternoon that they had already put in a request to the national stockpile for additional PPE and supposedly was on its way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1541.156s">So</a>  that's what I was referring to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1543.877s">But</a>  we've been basically following the same guidance that has been put out from day one from DPH and CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1551.658s">And</a>  that guidance has changed and evolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1554.159s">But</a>  that's been constantly monitored and constantly, you know, in touch with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1558.86s">And</a>  any questions we have, they've been very responsive as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1564.497s">We're</a>  all just really keeping a close eye on what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1567.018s">So,</a>  but just the declaration of emergency is an indication of more resources coming to help, not necessarily.</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1572.561s">For</a>  the state it's more, yeah, and it's, it's, uh, it's going to be quicker for the, for the governor to get things done and maybe to waive certain things and to be able to cancel a large assemblies and to be able to act, um, you know, uh, more swift than he would have been able to before.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1587.409s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1587.929s">Um,</a>  and then, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1589.955s">have</a>  you discussed or tomorrow are you planning to discuss any guidance for public bodies in terms of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1597.098s">So</a>  we're all here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1598.939s">Other</a>  committees and groups meet as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1602.921s">So</a>  it'll be we'll have a uniform guidance from for the city for bodies and from public health.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1611.505s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1611.825s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1612.246s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.192s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.933s">If</a>  I can, there were some concerns earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1620.814s">I</a>  know there are some limitations, we do have limitations of the information we can give about the person that has already been diagnosed and found to have the virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1632.057s">Is</a>  it safe to say or could we say that it has nothing to do with the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1635.619s">Because</a>  I think that was one of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1636.899s">Because</a>  I think the kids right now, they're feeling anxiety probably more than anybody right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1643.282s">So</a>  just making sure if we could just say it has no one to do with the schools and we're safe from the schools.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1652.914s">has</a>  had no contact with school-aged children. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1654.555s">So</a>  a full investigation is normally done with these by the Board of Health and with our partners to ask these tough questions at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1662.259s">We</a>  check on that individual often every couple hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1664.9s">What's</a>  your fever? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1665.56s">What's</a>  your temperature? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1666.681s">How's</a>  your condition? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1667.701s">Have</a>  you had any contact with anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1669.242s">And</a>  so we're asking these questions constantly to ensure that specific concern.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1673.664s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1837.486s">I'm</a>  on? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1838.506s">I'm</a>  on now, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1839.427s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1840.487s">I</a>  do know we have representatives from the administration here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1843.308s">In</a>  my conversation with the mayor earlier this afternoon, it's my understanding that these two amendments would create classifications that are more in line with the functions and responsibilities that these individuals are performing in their office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1854.411s">The</a>  first amendment, amendment A, for director of communications, it's my understanding, would be a reflective title of the position that was held by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1860.573s">Devaney.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1861.435s">under</a>  the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1862.976s">And</a>  it's also my understanding that the Director of Community Affairs position under Amendment B would be reflective of the position that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1868.961s">Fisk</a>  held under the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1870.763s">So</a>  what this is, Mr. President, is actually bringing their functional titles to be in line with the duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1876.727s">But</a>  I won't steal Dave's thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1878.929s">Let</a>  him give us a brief synopsis of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1881.631s">I'd</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1882.452s">I</a>  couldn't have said it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1884.013s">I</a>  think that's exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1885.695s">So</a>  we took a hard look at this, and this was <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1889.13s">This</a>  is in line with the mayor's vision for the mayor's office, and kind of being more transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1893.814s">Again,</a>  you're going to hear me say that quite a bit, of what the duties and responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1898.337s">These</a>  jobs were both posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1900.038s">Job</a>  descriptions are available for anybody that would like to take a look at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1903.501s">But</a>  it's exactly like Councilor Neilsen.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1905.863s">Yeah,</a>  Mr. President, if I may, I spoke with the mayor last Thursday or Friday about the same issue, requested job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1912.748s">I</a>  know she forwarded them to the city clerk's office, and the city clerk had distributed them to the members of the body as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1918.032s">I,</a>  for one, Councilor, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1919.224s">I</a>  don't see any issue with this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1920.545s">I</a>  think that the mayor deserves the right to be able to surround herself with her own team for what she feels is going to make her time in the corner office successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1928.248s">So</a>  with that being said, I move for approval of the paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1930.849s">It</a>  is an ordinance, so it's going to have to go through three readings.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1936.943s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1938.204s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1939.385s">So</a>  these don't have any impact on the budget as far as these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1942.427s">These</a>  are simply entitled only, and they don't remove any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1945.109s">They're</a>  not replacing any other positions, correct?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1948.212s">No,</a>  these are lateral. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1949.773s">So</a>  the effect on the budget is to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1953.116s">We're</a>  modeling that stuff out now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1955.197s">Determine</a>  because it's when when there's a transition it's often hard to model exactly how what the year-end is going to look like Based on transitions and vacation buyouts and other issues that are involved with the budget So we're doing our best to model that out and make this as budget Softening as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1969.922s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1970.262s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2039.896s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2041.376s">I</a>  put this on tonight's agenda because I had several residents that reside in condos, in particular Maple Park condominiums that reached out to me recently regarding waste pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2058.944s">And</a>  they asked me the question, which I've actually received over the years from other condo people in the community, why don't they pick up my trash, the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2070.847s">We</a>  pay the same tax rate that any other good paying taxpayer pays in this community, and we don't get trash service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2080.088s">So</a>  I did a little homework, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2082.249s">We</a>  have probably about eight or nine residents from Maple Park, and I appreciate they all came out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2088.527s">because</a>  this issue is very important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2091.708s">But</a>  I did a little homework, Mr. President, pulled out the contract that was signed by the city of Method and Waste Management back in August of 2010, August 25th to be precise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2108.552s">It</a>  was a ten year contract which actually ends this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2112.453s">And</a>  it's my understanding in talking to DPW, what resulted from the contract back in 2010 was the city went around to all the different condo associations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2124.617s">And</a>  they touched base with each condo association, saying, we're signing an agreement with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2130.259s">It's</a>  going to be a 10-year agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2132.339s">Are</a>  you interested, as an association, to have either recycle or trash pickup at your building? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2141.688s">And</a>  for a number of different reasons, many associations said, you know what, we are interested in having both. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2148.556s">And</a>  the city added their condo to the contract, which I have a copy of all the condominium associations and whether or not they get trash, recycle, a combination or none. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2162.43s">And</a>  so at the time, they went around to all the condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2165.634s">Some</a>  condos, like Maple Park Condo, opted at the time not to do trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2173.962s">They</a>  currently have recycle pickup, but not trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2177.954s">And</a>  it was based on, I guess, the board of directors of the condo association, and they decided not to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2189.985s">But</a>  within the contract, Mr. President, and I won't read it, it's a lengthy contract, but on page six of the contract under section 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2200.532s">It</a>  states the contractors shall collect refuse weekly and recyclables every other week from condominiums as listed on exhibit D. And that's what I refer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2212.201s">Exhibit</a>  D shows you all the different condo buildings and whether or not they have recycle or trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2219.815s">It</a>  says, Exhibit D, as from time to time may be amended subject to compensation as specified in Section 23.3, condominiums will be required to provide rubbish dumpster and recycling cots compatible with contractor's vehicles at their own cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2239.779s">Condominiums</a>  that require services greater than specified herein will be directed to purchase additional service <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2248.061s">outside</a>  of this agreement from a vendor of their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2251.843s">So</a>  at the time, Mr. President, Maple Park Condo, and like I said, there are other condos that are in the same boat, decided not to do the trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2261.488s">And</a>  then some years later, they say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2264.389s">At</a>  this point, we'd like to start trash pickup with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2267.871s">And</a>  I'm being told from the DPW department that in order to do so, if Maple Park wanted to join the contract, they can do it one of two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2280.323s">They</a>  can ask during budget period, which is coming up very shortly, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2285.007s">to</a>  have the city, because we have a fixed amount every year that we put into the waste management contract, and if we were going to bring on a new condo association, that would increase the contract amount, naturally, that we would have to add to the budget based on the newcomers into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2304.685s">So</a>  that would be the first way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2306.346s">If</a>  Maple Park and other condos said, you know what, we'd be interested now in joining, please sign us up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2313.51s">The</a>  city would have to make compensation within the budget to account for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2317.992s">The</a>  second way, Mr. President, is the way of <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2322.214s">The</a>  contract ends in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2323.695s">So</a>  it ends this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2325.475s">It's</a>  a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2326.936s">It</a>  ends this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2328.556s">And</a>  I'm not sure how this new administration will go about doing this, but I would assume it might be similar to what they did 10 years ago and reach out once again to all the condo associations in the city and saying, would you like to participate? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2343.802s">And</a>  we can gather a new list at the end of this contract, which is this year, and have the city fund this brand new list. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2353.707s">I'm</a>  being told also in the past, over the last ten years, based on a by request, the past mayors <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2363.431s">If</a>  an association went to the previous mayors, they would make their case for why they need recycling or trash pickup through the city, and the mayor would grant it or not grant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2373.979s">And</a>  I've been told that in the past, there have been condo associations that have been granted this additional pickup service through the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2384.666s">So</a>  I'm offering tonight, Mr. President, a way that not only Maple Park, but the other condominium associations that I have on this particular list, like Craddock Cove, I think the Regency Condo, Wellington Condo, there's a number of other condos in the city that may opt to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2407.523s">So</a>  I'm asking through this resolution, and I'd like to hear from some of the residents also, Mr. President, that the mayor determine how she wants to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2416.596s">If</a>  she wants to do it in this year's budget, we have to make sure that the condos that want to participate <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2424.486s">make</a>  it known and that we add that to the budget or if the mayor feels best that we wait out the five or six or seven months that are left in this 10-year contract and then just see if anyone else wants to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2437.795s">That</a>  may be an easier way, Mr. President, but I'll leave that up to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2442.038s">That's</a>  not up to me to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2444.079s">But</a>  based on my findings, Mr. President, the contract, in my opinion, does call for allowing newcomers into the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2454.642s">And</a>  it does state there'll be an associated cost for a newcomer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2458.983s">It</a>  also states if you have a large condo and you need more than the one pickup, which may be the case in some of the larger condos, that that's added at your own expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2469.245s">And</a>  that's spelled out in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2472.179s">But</a>  my hope tonight, Mr. President, is really to put everyone on the same playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2477.3s">You</a>  know, we all pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2478.721s">I've</a>  had people in the past say, I pay taxes for school, but I have no school-aged kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2483.302s">That's</a>  not how we work in the city of Method, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2486.603s">We</a>  all pay a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2488.003s">We</a>  all should receive the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2489.863s">And</a>  there's no reason why the condo associations and people that live in condos and pay the same tax shouldn't get that same service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2500.626s">Another</a>  issue too, Mr. President, if you don't have trash pickup, you're not eligible for bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2507.993s">So</a>  someone that lives in a condo that wants to dispose of a bureau or a mattress or something, they're not eligible for the pickup that every other resident is eligible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2519.284s">And</a>  that's unfair too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2520.985s">So</a>  I'll have residents, one resident told me he had to take his mattress over to his friend's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2527.247s">This</a>  gentleman is not a spring chicken, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2529.971s">And</a>  to have him get in his car and bring his mattress over to a friend's house is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2535.138s">And</a>  they should be added, Mr. President, as well to the bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2538.622s">So</a>  I'd like to hear with some of, I know Cindy Watson's here, with a number of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2543.909s">And</a>  I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that either suggestion be entertained by the mayor to ensure that Maple Park Condo and any other condo in the city that opts to enter into the program is able to do so.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2559.685s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2560.505s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2562.087s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, can we please have your name and address for the record?</p>

    <p>[Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2566.55s">Yes,</a>  Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2569.832s">First,</a>  I just want to preface this by saying thank you, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2572.553s">Michael</a>  has had an ongoing dialogue with many of the people at Maple Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2577.495s">And</a>  just by mere fact alone tonight, there are 44 owners, residents at Maple Park, and we have more than 20% represented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2587.2s">So</a>  that shows you, illustrates the commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2590.121s">Now,</a>  again, we're not asking for anything extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2593.244s">It's</a>  just sort of an equitable situation that has been overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2597.287s">We</a>  do have one of the residents who was on the Medford Coalition condo a few years ago and did meet with former Mayor Michael McGlynn, and it was to be resolved that bulk pickup would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2611.277s">Unfortunately,</a>  I'm not sure what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2613.279s">It</a>  went through the loophole. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2614.8s">We</a>  don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2616.682s">Again,</a>  just to go back to what Michael said, over 40%, probably closer to 50% of the residents in Maple Park are senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2628.712s">We</a>  just had a situation where there was an older couple who just moved in, and it really caused a lot of disharmony because they didn't know the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2636.098s">It</a>  was about a mattress pickup, and the boat pickup should be something that is allowed for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2644.045s">And</a>  again, you know, we pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2646.666s">We</a>  all have a beneficial interest in being an owner at Maple Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2651.747s">Folks</a>  love Maple Park, and I can assure you, we follow the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2654.788s">When</a>  people come to visit me, I say it's a combination of a convent and a prison because we're so quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2659.309s">We</a>  follow the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2660.39s">We</a>  just want to follow the rules, and we want some level of, you know, reciprocal interest back so that we are able to get bulk pickup.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2672.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2674.497s">Would</a>  anyone else like to speak on this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2679.266s">Any</a>  questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2680.548s">Come</a>  on, don't be shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2681.61s">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2683.554s">Don't</a>  be shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2692.062s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Eddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2693.542s">My</a>  name is David Eddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2694.683s">I'm</a>  a resident at Maple Park Condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2698.104s">I</a>  was also a co-chair of the Medford Condominium Coalition, which petitioned the city to pick up trash or condominiums throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2709.186s">At</a>  the time this contract was signed, we would have had to rent <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2716.4s">two</a>  dumpsters from waste management, because our dumpsters apparently are not compatible with the pickup trucks of waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2726.623s">The</a>  cost for renting those two dumpsters exceeded the cost of the private contract that we had for picking up the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2738.507s">So</a>  we still pay property taxes, like all good people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2747.239s">Included</a>  in that tax is trash pickup services. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2753.842s">We</a>  chose to go with the private pickup because of the cost, being less expensive than waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2763.326s">So</a>  we're still paying for trash pickup, and I don't see why we can't have the bulk items picked up at no cost to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2776.257s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2777.057s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2780.239s">Would</a>  anyone else like to speak on this issue?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2908.64s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2911.683s">I</a>  think part of the issue, from my understanding of talking to DPW, is that the city pays hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just for the bulk pickup contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2923.511s">And</a>  at some point, it was determined that if you didn't have trash pickup, that you weren't going to be eligible for bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2931.676s">And</a>  I'm not sure where that decision was made, if it was a unilateral decision or what. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2936.74s">I</a>  didn't see it in the contract, but I was told by DPW, if you don't have trash pickup, they're not going to pick up bulk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2943.766s">And</a>  I think that was a way of trimming down the exorbitant cost of the bulk items. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2951.132s">I</a>  believe they said they paid $22 an item in the city for bulk pickup, and it's unlimited. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2958.531s">They</a>  only do it during the recycle period, so it's every two weeks they do the bulk pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2963.476s">But</a>  I think that was a way of cutting cost, and that may have been when they cut the service off to Maple Park during that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2970.304s">I'm</a>  not sure exactly when it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2972.386s">But</a>  the reason why I brought up, Mr. President, is to ask these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2976.676s">And</a>  have the administration, we have the chief of staff here, Dave Rodriguez, who I'm sure will take this back to the mayor regarding this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2984.882s">Mr.</a>  President, and we'll be able to get an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=2987.563s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3007.994s">Council</a>  marks the amendment is to ensure that Maple Park or other condominiums can enter into the trash pickup agreement with waste management <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3017.093s">And</a>  then do you want it delineated by the two different options, or just at the administration's discretion?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3023.278s">We</a>  can offer those two different options to make, because it could be done in other ways, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3029.163s">Those</a>  are the two that were stated to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3032.226s">Adding</a>  to this year's budget, or when the contract turns out, which is at the end of this year, that all the economy associations be out with their options.</p>

    <p>[Durali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3472.861s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3473.221s">My</a>  name is Amishka Durali.</p>

    <p>[Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3475.882s">My</a>  name is Elise Turner.</p>

    <p>[Durali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3477.502s">And</a>  so we are both CCSR student leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3480.883s">And</a>  what CCSR stands for is the Center <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3483.194s">Center</a>  of Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3486.398s">And</a>  I'll have Elise talk about our project.</p>

    <p>[Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3488.841s">So</a>  a little bit of an overview of our project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3491.144s">It's</a>  called Benches for Duggar. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3492.465s">And</a>  we want to basically implement four benches in Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3496.05s">Because</a>  right now the benches there, they're very worn down, chipped, very dirty. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3500.795s">So</a>  we want to implement the four benches each with different themes that kind of like represent Medford as a whole so we have LGBTQ plus diversity the arts and sports and we have a plan to like get students at Medford high to actually like <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3515.56s">put</a>  in some applications for art to put on the benches that relate to our themes, because we have many friends that are artists and definitely love to express themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3523.522s">And</a>  over at Medford High, we have a lot of murals that represent Medford and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3528.563s">So</a>  we think that'd be a good idea to add a pop of color and make Medford even more beautiful than it already is.</p>

    <p>[Durali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3534.685s">And</a>  we already have the benches made. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3537.026s">They</a>  were donated to us by the New England Carpentry Union. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3540.088s">And</a>  so we have those benches made. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3541.469s">So</a>  the grant money will really just help us get paint and supplies that we need for the benches. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3547.432s">But</a>  also, we want to expand this project after we do Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3551.454s">We</a>  want to expand the project to other parks in Medford, like Morrison Park and other parks.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3559.178s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3559.878s">Some</a>  of the councilors have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3561.859s">We'll</a>  start off with Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3563.968s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3565.709s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3566.77s">I</a>  think that you coming up, I know that it's a little nerve wracking when you're coming up to speak, but you did a great job in presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3574.374s">I</a>  know that we've had some of your student body here before, some of your friends, and they've brought up some great initiatives, and we're so excited that <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3584.419s">here</a>  again, and our goal is really to make Medford beautiful and share what we're truly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3592.964s">And</a>  I think that the four categories you chose for Duggar Park, I think it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3600.277s">way</a>  to spread that love. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3602.038s">So</a>  I think you guys have done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3603.978s">I</a>  think this is a great initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3605.899s">I</a>  know that my son John is also doing some great things with a great historian, Mr. Ken Krause. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3614.683s">So</a>  everything is nonstop and it's so exciting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3617.504s">So</a>  I fully support this paper and move forward for approval.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3621.625s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3622.886s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3624.306s">I</a>  can't say it better than Councilor Scarpelli, but it's really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3629.554s">to</a>  have you and so many students from Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3631.697s">I</a>  was in your shoes not that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3633.479s">I'm</a>  a Medford High grad. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3635.762s">Just</a>  coming down here and voicing what you think we need to do to, I think you said it perfectly, make Medford more beautiful than it already is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3643.591s">So</a>  I look forward to seeing you work on some other parks too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3647.516s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3648.612s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3649.494s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3650.435s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3651.677s">I'd</a>  like to make a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3653.721s">This</a>  is a PACS project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3655.664s">We</a>  are well aware that the PACS department does have a revolving account that's open with modern hardware, I do believe, with a <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3663.001s">do</a>  purchase a lot of their paint supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3664.862s">So</a>  it might make sense to coordinate with IDPW because I believe we do get some bulk purchasing rates versus regular retail rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3672.586s">So</a>  this $3,000 might actually end up being $4,500 if we spend it the right way with some of our in-house contacts that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3679.449s">So</a>  I'd suggest that you meet with the PACS Commissioner, Mike Nestor, and speak with him a little bit about whether or not you guys can utilize the account that they have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3689.054s">And</a>  use their bulk purchasing to get some of the supplies that you need to get this done But congratulations, wish you the best of luck.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4086.128s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4087.249s">So</a>  we recently created the OPEB Fund Board of Trustees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4093.034s">One</a>  of the seats on that board of trustees is an elected representative of the retirees of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4100.66s">I'm</a>  requesting that the city administration notify retirees by mail of the nomination deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4104.984s">However,</a>  I was informed by the administration that the nomination deadline has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4108.727s">It</a>  is no longer March 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4111.55s">Do</a>  you have a specific date, Dave?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4120.25s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4121.551s">Councilor,</a>  I'm not sure of the exact date. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4123.112s">Alicia</a>  Nunley, who I get is, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4127.356s">I'm</a>  not sure of the exact date. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4128.677s">I</a>  do know that we were talking about a couple of things regarding the OPEB trust fund, so I will defer to her on the exact date. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4134.202s">I</a>  can send a communication to you and to the rest of the council with the exact date once she returns from her illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4140.007s">We're</a>  expecting this week.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4141.448s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4142.989s">And</a>  then, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4145.064s">The</a>  date would be great, but either way the motion that maybe we can strike the date from the motion and just say notify retirees by mail of the nomination deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4152.669s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Dave Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4152.95s">And</a>  I do know that Alicia has been working on this issue with the retirement board and trying to figure out an exact way to make sure that we do outreach to all the retirees.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4159.314s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4159.754s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4160.935s">Sue,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4161.755s">Consulate</a>  Bears, you'd like to amend the original resolution to strike the date that's listed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4166.559s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4312.675s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4313.897s">I</a>  bring this paper forward in response to the 223-2020 legal opinion of the acting city solicitor, which responded to a question asked by the President that was prompted from an inquiry from a citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4328.412s">And</a>  the question was, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4331.519s">Is</a>  a paper offered under suspension, is a resolution offered under suspension a violation of the council rules because it's not on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4338.123s">And</a>  the question was asked in the broadest of terms and the solicitor answered it in the broadest of terms and the response came back yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4344.586s">Papers</a>  that do not show up on the agenda that are brought up under suspension are violations of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4349.669s">Then</a>  the solicitor's response went on to go into specific detail about matters that could be reasonably foreseen and matters that could not be reasonably foreseen and emergency matters, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4360.552s">So</a>  in an effort to allow us to still raise certain issues under suspension and in review of some open meeting law, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4367.714s">determinations</a>  that I was able to put my hands on, one of them being the Oxbridge decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4371.897s">I</a>  came up with some language that would allow us hopefully to have the ability to still offer papers under suspension, but still comply with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4379.703s">Because</a>  based upon the 310-2020 committee of the whole that we just had, there was a lot of discussion surrounding the solicitor's opinion and what could or could not be offered under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4389.961s">So</a>  with that being said, this is an attempt to address the solicitor's opinion and still provide us with the flexibility that's necessary based upon some open meeting law determinations that have been issued by the Office of the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4401.444s">As</a>  we are all aware, the Office of the Attorney General is the authority that's responsible for compliance with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4407.965s">Any</a>  complaints that would be filed against this public body deliberating in violation of the open meeting law would be handled by the Office of the Attorney General, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4415.686s">What</a>  I'd like to do is ask that this paper be sent to the city solicitor for a legal review to see if it complies with her legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4423.573s">and</a>  get a response back, and then potentially take a look at the way that we do business internally to ensure that we have more transparency, but we still also have the ability and availability to bring papers under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4433.502s">The</a>  first meeting of this term, Mr. President, I did put a paper forward requesting that we change the night of our meetings from Tuesdays to Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4439.286s">And</a>  the reason I brought that proposal forward was because, based upon the open meeting law, you need to have 48 hours before your meeting to have the notice posted with the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4448.854s">Because</a>  our meetings are on Tuesday, weekends and holidays don't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4452.157s">So</a>  we need to have to get our agenda out on Friday morning or Thursday afternoon, dependent on whether or not we had a Monday holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4458.12s">So</a>  that would only allow us a very limited amount of time to put items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4462.863s">Upon</a>  review of items that have been filed on the agenda, it was <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4468.08s">pretty</a>  one in every four, every five matters that this council discussed by way of resolution that was getting put on the agenda, was getting put on under suspension and never being actually placed on the agenda and seen by the general public when the notice was posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4481.289s">So</a>  this prompts me to bring forward another proposal for rule changes to allow us to be a little bit more transparent, to allow us to have some items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4489.815s">for</a>  discussion and deliberation or to put items on the agenda at a future date for discussion and deliberation that come up under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4496.879s">So</a>  I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure in moving this matter to the city solicitor's office for a legal review. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4502.062s">And</a>  that's about it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4503.883s">That's</a>  the presentation in a box and bow.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4507.325s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4507.925s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4509.726s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4511.027s">If</a>  I can, through the chair, to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4514.569s">In</a>  layman's terms, if people can understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4517.605s">This</a>  resolution is really to have the voice of the people heard and not stifled, correct?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4526.834s">This</a>  has no impact whatsoever at all on the public participation portion of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4532.16s">This</a>  is really just related to council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4534.202s">Only</a>  a councilor can bring forward a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4535.924s">Only</a>  a councilor can make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4537.846s">So</a>  this only affects the actual conduct of councilors.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4541.875s">And</a>  in recent, as we can see, we had some discussions about open meeting laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4549.361s">And</a>  I think that I applaud my fellow counselor to look at these concerns under transparency to make sure that the people are heard and we're giving them the proper forum where we're not stifled and they're not stifled. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4565.993s">So</a>  I applaud you with this resolution and I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4570.257s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4570.896s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4574.719s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4576.34s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4581.224s">I</a>  was just looking through the language here and I noticed it was a chance maybe to bring up one of my many pet issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4588.95s">And</a>  that is the use of the word shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4594.687s">We're</a>  talking about making the people more able to interact with the city, and it's actually become part of the plain language federal guidelines at plainlanguage.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4606.595s">The</a>  word must is the clearest way to convey to your audience that they have to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4610.837s">Shall</a>  is one of those officious words. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4613.516s">that</a>  has encumbered legal style writing for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4616.56s">The</a>  message that Shell sends to the audience is, this is deadly material. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4620.726s">Shell</a>  is also obsolete. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4622.248s">When</a>  was the last time you heard it used in everyday speech? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4625.232s">So</a>  just as a friendly amendment, because I'd love to get a small victory on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4630.956s">issue,</a>  where we can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4635.299s">I'd</a>  love to see, and I see shell appears elsewhere in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4638.562s">We're</a>  not going to go through and fix them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4640.303s">But</a>  it'd be nice as we add language to the code, I think, to replace shell with must.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4647.589s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4650.351s">Councilor</a>  Peers.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4709.233s">Mr.</a>  President, I do believe that pursuant to the council rules, every 90 days you can introduce a paper that's been deliberated on and addressed and deliberated to conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4717.436s">So</a>  I'm really not too sure what he's getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4720.237s">Ultimately,</a>  the city solicitor issued an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4721.878s">That</a>  opinion came out on February 23rd, 2020.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4727.921s">I'm</a>  not disputing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4731.362s">I</a>  certainly know the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4734.203s">I</a>  say respectfully, I just find it interesting that it's coming back when it was shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4740.685s">I</a>  believe it's chilling free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4742.406s">I</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4742.766s">And</a>  I'm in disagreement with Councilor Scarpelli on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4746.307s">When</a>  city councillors use suspension of the rules so that petitioners, many petitioners, speak at the end of the night, I find it <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4756.378s">a</a>  kind of a quasi-censorship, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4758.781s">So</a>  this one concerns me a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4760.302s">And</a>  as you know, I run magazines. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4762.564s">I</a>  actually brought a magazine into the city just two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4765.888s">And</a>  it worked very hard to bring transparency and free speech to the city by having another newspaper here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4773.455s">This</a>  is very dear to my heart, as you all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4776.018s">So</a>  having the council voting on suspension of the rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4781.546s">It</a>  just seems like the council wants more power and more power, and the people should have the ability to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4786.93s">Maybe</a>  the council should consider a new rule where petitioners speak first at the city council at 7 o'clock, and then after a half hour or more, then the city council begins, and then they can suspend the rules and do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4800.479s">I'm</a>  just suggesting something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4801.68s">A</a>  lot of my readers are in conflict with this, and they are very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4805.943s">So</a>  I just want that on the record.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5101.321s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5103.586s">This</a>  is an attempt to establish an extended illness leave bank by ordinance for all city and school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5109.837s">An</a>  extended illness leave bank is a bank where existing employees can donate one of their leave days to a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5117.642s">And</a>  if one of their co-workers suffers a catastrophic injury or illness, they're able to draw down upon those leave days if they've exhausted all of their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5125.887s">And</a>  there are certain parameters and requirements that are in place to be sure the people that become eligible to draw down these extended illness leave days aren't sick leave abusers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5135.185s">The</a>  state has a very similar program, and when I say very similar, I copied the language from Massachusetts General Law Chapter 4, Section 7P. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5143.646s">I'm</a>  sorry, Chapter 7, Section 4P, to create this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5147.407s">And</a>  then just put in that advisory council language, Mr. President, how we're going to administer this sick leave bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5155.148s">So</a>  what I'd ask is that we obviously have a committee of the whole on a piece of legislation that's this wordy with the city solicitor and the director of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5164.509s">to</a>  determine what steps we can take to establish an extended illness leave bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5169.112s">I</a>  said that we should first make a 75 day investment in the bank to get it up and running to allow existing employees that are out on extended leave to begin to draw down on the bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5178.857s">And</a>  then we can establish an extended illness leave bank advisory council that will be able to come up with rules, regulations, monitor the program and <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5189.142s">The</a>  Director of Personnel is the Program Administrator, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5192.644s">So</a>  this is really an attempt to try to put something in place to do something good for the residents, for the workers here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5198.686s">When</a>  you sit back and you think about people that have suffered from catastrophic injury and catastrophic illness here in the city of Medford, you think of people like Richard Lee, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5208.77s">fought</a>  a very, very public battle with pancreatic cancer and wasn't able to beat it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5213.456s">But</a>  had 40 years of service here in this building, but was still out for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5219.723s">And</a>  we talk about someone like Joe Conway or Brian Rabbit, who we all <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5227.22s">stood</a>  beside and wished him well wishes when he's going through a very public battle with pancreatic cancer right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5233.683s">This</a>  is something that'll help employees that have been good public servants here in the community, that have given their all to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5239.825s">I'm</a>  hoping that we can put something in place that provides a protection and a safeguard for these employees, so that if something unforeseen and catastrophic does happen related to their health or their physical well-being, that there's a safety net that's there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5251.17s">We</a>  value our employees, and I think that we should make steps to show it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5255.812s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5257.321s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5264.182s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5265.243s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you to Councilor Knight for directing this, and that I strongly support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5270.584s">In</a>  my past, I was a federal employee, and I believe we had a similar program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5275.185s">And</a>  I also know that the state has that same program, and it's incredibly helpful and important to folks who are going through difficult extended illnesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5283.406s">So</a>  I strongly support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5284.527s">And</a>  again, thank you and support the motion.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5286.837s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5288.48s">Councilor</a>  Scarpel.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5289.723s">Again,</a>  I too applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5293.49s">I</a>  think that as a municipal worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5296.057s">who's</a>  someone who doesn't take sick days, people that are out there might question even with this intent, you know, that this is compromising city funding, but what they make sure they understand the way that it works is when people retire with the bank of sick days, they're then bought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5317.166s">So</a>  when you could look at, we're going through that right now where we have a custodian that is battling <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5324.109s">cancer,</a>  and he has a family of four, and he looks like, thank God, he's going to pull through, but without the sick bank process that we have in the community that I work in, that individual would have lost his home. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5338.894s">So</a>  these are real issues, and this is what I think what Medford's all about, in helping your neighbor and your <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5346.176s">I'm</a>  actually shocked that I didn't know that we didn't have it in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5351.22s">So</a>  I applaud Councilor Knight and I second the resolve, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5354.823s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5355.984s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5356.925s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5357.686s">I</a>  want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5360.288s">It</a>  is a good thing to have people who do exhaust their leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5365.452s">I</a>  have just one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5366.613s">So</a>  is there a maximum on what other people can donate into the bank or just anything you want?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5377.902s">Based</a>  upon the language of the ordinance that is proposed, it gives discretionary authority to the extended on this lead bank advisory committee to come up with the regulations to determine what will work for both the workers in the community, what will work for the city in the school department, because we don't want to obviously also have a financial situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5397.97s">It's</a>  pretty much, aside from the 75 days that first get dumped into the pool by the government, after that, it's all donated days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5405.738s">And</a>  the parameters would be established by the extended illness leave bank advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5409.042s">So</a>  no parameters has been established on how many days people can put in? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5413.667s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5415.188s">I</a>  believe the language says, and it's right in the second paragraph, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5424.628s">Any</a>  employees completed one day of service may participate by donating to said bank any earned, sick, personal, or vacation leave time in such an amount and with such frequency as said regulations shall permit to maintain a sufficient balance in the bank, but not less frequently than annually.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5442.96s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5443.181s">So</a>  the board will convene to establish the parameters of this also, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5448.064s">They</a>  have the power to promulgate rules and regulations, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5450.245s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5567.167s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5568.828s">This</a>  is a companion paper to the one relative to the rules that we discussed earlier, 20089. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5576.868s">What</a>  this paper does is it defines what an order is, what a resolution is, what a petition is, and establishes a process, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5583.03s">Now,</a>  we've seen, especially around election time, the inordinate number of petitions that get filed at the rail to discuss issues that aren't necessarily something that requires a council vote, a special permit, a signed reversal, grant a location, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5597.934s">So</a>  only a counselor can file a resolution pursuant to our laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5601.195s">Only</a>  a counselor can file an order or an ordinance pursuant to council resolutions in the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5606.737s">So</a>  what this does is it just defines what a petition is, it defines who's an appropriate petitioner and who isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5611.623s">And</a>  someone that's not an appropriate petitioner would still have the ability to come up to the council and discuss anything that they want to discuss with the council and appear before the council when the time is right at the meeting, during the public participation portion of the meeting, wherever that may be, because it seems like there's an appetite to move that based upon the discussion that we've had surrounding the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5627.761s">in</a>  recent days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5629.102s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, this is nothing more than an attempt to provide a little bit more order, a little bit more transparency, and streamlining the process for the way that we do things so that we don't run into a situation that we discussed earlier in our committee of the whole meeting, violations of the open meeting law and circus-like atmospheres coming up here at the council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5647.068s">So</a>  that's the intent of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5649.388s">That's</a>  why I'm bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5650.529s">You</a>  know, every order and resolution must be endorsed by a counselor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5654.47s">Because</a>  the council rules also say that any paper that's on the agenda has to be disposed up to a conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5660.055s">If</a>  someone files a petition, but they don't have official business before the council that requires the council to vote statutorily, it's in essence the filing of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5668.242s">So</a>  that should be placed in the public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5671.204s">Very</a>  similar to the matter that we have on the agenda here this evening, I do believe, under 20099. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5680.352s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5683.473s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5684.253s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5685.834s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5687.114s">I</a>  think assessing our rules, making sure they're good definitions, strong definitions and processes are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5694.956s">One,</a>  whatever the point of action is going forward, I think part of the conversation for me would be on making, addressing rule 33, which is what is the rule that addresses the structure of council agendas and kind of aligning out with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5707.98s">And</a>  then also <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5710.76s">making</a>  sure we have clear definitions of public participation as relates to the council rules and also that those are clearly explained to the public through the city website and other means. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5722.243s">And</a>  just making sure that we are providing equal public participation to what we provide now, I think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5728.845s">So</a>  as discussion goes forward, I think it's important to keep those things in mind.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5734.187s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5736.548s">If</a>  you could please have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5738.88s">Certainly,</a>  Joe Viglione, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5742.404s">I'm</a>  somewhat in agreement with Mr. Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5744.766s">I</a>  do like having specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5747.429s">This</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5748.75s">It's</a>  a slippery slope, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5749.951s">If</a>  people are coming up here and it's election time and they want to give information, how do we work with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5758.66s">Let's</a>  take an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5761.002s">With</a>  the new rules for <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5765.146s">filing</a>  and for the petitions and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5769.229s">What</a>  if a city council uses condolences and birthdays for people that aren't as recognizable as others? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5776.214s">Is</a>  that considered campaigning? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5777.955s">So</a>  where you have on one hand the condolences and birthdays are allowed under suspension of the rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5784.66s">A</a>  council can abuse that and file more of those than actual motions and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5790.944s">So</a>  it is a slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5792.385s">But</a>  I do love the idea of having petitioners come up because I like free speech and want to see more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5797.308s">So</a>  if you could start the council at 6 or 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5801.05s">and</a>  have a public participation, do what you want with the rest of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5805.433s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5805.893s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5806.874s">Council</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5808.44s">I</a>  do believe the term is referred to as bully pulpit, Mr. President, and when you become an elected councilor, you have the right to file any resolution or order that you'd like, and it comes up to the rest of your colleagues to determine whether or not they feel as though that's something that they want to pass on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5821.244s">So</a>  with that being said, I thank the gentleman for coming up here and agreeing with me, and I hope we can move forward on the issue.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5826.006s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5828.867s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5830.427s">I</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5831.548s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5833.068s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5834.008s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5835.249s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5839.155s">Yeah,</a>  the motion, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5840.296s">Motion</a>  for, yeah, approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5843.857s">Yes,</a>  that was approval of a rule change. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5846.839s">Correct,</a>  sorry, but thank you for clarifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5850.541s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5856.964s">I</a>  was not under the impression we were voting for a rule change, so I may have missed that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5863.587s">Okay,</a>  are you asking that we <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5868.223s">Asking</a>  for reconsideration? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5869.765s">I</a>  would ask that at this time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5871.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5871.788s">On</a>  the motion of Consular Marks to reconsider that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5876.174s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5876.775s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5878.897s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5879.538s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5880.74s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5882.5s">The</a>  vote for reconsideration is successful.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5885.301s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5887.441s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5889.041s">The</a>  reason why I state that, I don't know, I was under the impression this was going the way of every other request, either sending it to the Rules Committee or being properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5898.683s">And</a>  I really don't think this has been properly vetted, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5902.324s">I</a>  think it has all good intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5904.905s">However,</a>  Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5906.645s">The</a>  filing of a petition by a resident is requesting council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5915.268s">And</a>  it is, it complies with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5919.689s">It</a>  appears on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5921.89s">And</a>  from what I gather from this, it does state the following petition shall be reserved only for matters requiring council action per law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5933.171s">So</a>  there may be an item when someone's coming up for council help, but it's not a requirement of the council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5943.962s">Not</a>  as was stated, special permits, grants of location, sign variance, those require council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5951.49s">There's</a>  no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5953.416s">So</a>  I think this is kind of a slippery slope, Mr. President, that it limits speech of residents that want to come up and not only come up like they would under suspension, which gives zero notification, but give proper notification and look for council relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5973.925s">And</a>  that council relief may not be something that's under our jurisdiction, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5981.257s">But</a>  something that residents feel that they can get relief from the council by coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5986.442s">And</a>  I don't want to limit that, Mr. President, and I think this language would limit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5991.547s">So</a>  I cannot support that, Mr. President, unless this is properly vetted out to make sure that we're not limiting residents in the ability to come up here and speak or file a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6003.49s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6005.071s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6006.092s">I</a>  do believe if the gentleman reads down to the next sentence, all of the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda and not assigned to council paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6014.599s">So</a>  anybody that does file a petition that doesn't comply with the statutory mandates that require council action would then be placed on public participation and still have the opportunity to show up on the agenda under public participation, still have the opportunity to appear before this body and speak just like they have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6030.0s">just</a>  whether or not they get assigned a council paper number because it's really filing of a resolution if you're getting assigned a paper number because our council rules require us to dispose of all items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6043.067s">So</a>  that's what my intent was, Mr. President, to clarify and streamline.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6050.54s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6051.301s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6052.461s">If</a>  I can, I understand Councilor Marks' hesitation, but I think the meeting we just had in the subcommittee that outlined the limitations we have as a council now that limits our residents to come up and speak, I support this for the fact that being sponsored and having <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6073.815s">an</a>  avenue to make sure that the constituent has a voice and is on the agenda as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6081.72s">because</a>  I think this is going to be a huge culture change in understanding what we can talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6088.545s">So</a>  as Councilman Mark said, I know that the biggest issue we had in subcommittees where in the past a resident would come up, have a concern, a serious concern, but we would support that by having a dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6104.155s">by</a>  the rule now, that violating the open meeting law, that limits that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6112.121s">It</a>  eliminates that completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6114.103s">We</a>  can't talk about it, so Mrs. Jones comes up and talks about some serious issue that we need the police involved in, something that I believe was emergency or <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6126.453s">natural</a>  disaster that we can speak on at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6129.799s">So</a>  it limits different speaking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6132.725s">So</a>  with this, I support it for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6136.095s">If</a>  there's an issue, we have a constituent that has a problem, we assign the number to it, we sponsor it as a council, and make sure that that issue is presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6145.263s">So</a>  this is why I feel that it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6148.305s">I</a>  think it's all in the same breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6149.727s">I</a>  think we're all looking at making sure that our constituents are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6155.031s">And</a>  understand again that this is going to be a big change for what we're used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6161.084s">when</a>  doing business, when people come to that podium, because what we were told by ruling of the attorney general is that we can't talk to you as a council in fear of violating the open meeting law on concerns and issues that are brought to that podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6178.837s">So</a>  whether we like it or not, this is the reason why I support Councilor Knight's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6184.962s">And</a>  again, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6187.164s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6188.284s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6189.912s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6190.713s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I just want to reiterate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6191.873s">I</a>  think this is really just the changing of how numbers are assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6195.756s">We're</a>  not limiting speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6197.057s">And</a>  to Councilor Behr's point, the gentleman's point, and just discussions we had about perhaps looking at our rules in general, maybe it is an option to move that public participation to the beginning of the meeting and in the interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6208.446s">But</a>  it's not limiting speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6210.327s">It's</a>  simply just procedural. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6212.048s">So</a>  I support it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6213.509s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6214.85s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6216.107s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6219.028s">If</a>  it's still going to be moved for approval, I'd like to amend it or add a B paper that at a future committee of the whole meeting, we review the rules for public participation and review the order of the agenda pursuant to rule 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6231.453s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6231.733s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6236.301s">Council</a>  peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6236.822s">Can</a>  you repeat that for the coat?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6238.643s">Sure</a>  that we review any rules pursuant to public participation and also that we review and update rule 33 which outlines the Order of how we address things on the council agenda Yes, yes committee the whole correct <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6260.174s">And</a>  it could be the same committee of the whole as rules review in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6264.698s">Get</a>  it done all at once.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6268.1s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6271.783s">So</a>  Councilor Bears has offered a B paper, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6276.327s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6278.708s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6280.59s">So</a>  this is petitions, presentation, and similar papers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6286.595s">This</a>  is what the section it falls under. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6292.708s">So</a>  if someone wants to come up and make a presentation that the council has no bearing on, that would come under public participation or petitions, presentations, and similar papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6305.152s">Or</a>  are we amending or eventually going to amend this to have what my colleagues are stating, having the agenda coincide with what we're trying to do?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6316.495s">Councilor</a>  Knight, do you want to comment on that?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6319.759s">If</a>  the paper doesn't fall within the parameters of what a petition is defined as, then it would be pushed into public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6326.764s">I</a>  didn't propose any order of business changes to the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6330.947s">I'd</a>  be happy to put something together and offer that next week if you guys want me to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6334.409s">It</a>  seems like I'm on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6339.072s">But</a>  you know it's the plain language reads. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6342.235s">You</a>  know if it's not something that the council is required to act on by law It's not if we if it's something that you know if we don't act on it's going to be constructively accepted Then it will go to public participation presentations and all of that can go right to public participation unless they're requested by a council of a council at sponsoring someone to come and do a presentation and <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6363.772s">So</a>  Mr. President, I think if the council takes a vote to say we want INSTA to come and do a presentation on the pipeline project, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6371.537s">But</a>  if someone shows up and says, I want to talk about the Red Sox middle relievers, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6377.16s">That</a>  goes to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6379.542s">We're</a>  asking someone to come and give us a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6381.283s">That's</a>  one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6381.723s">If</a>  someone wants to discuss with us what's going on, that should happen in public participation.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6386.866s">So</a>  is the issue that it's assigned a number? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6389.808s">Is</a>  that what the issue is?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6391.795s">In</a>  just in looking at the rules when I was reviewing the suspension of the rule stuff and then I saw the petition as well and you know no order or resolution should be <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6401.809s">It</a>  can be filed by anybody but a councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6403.531s">So</a>  once that paper gets filed and it gets a number on it, that's a resolution number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6407.675s">That's</a>  a council paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6409.097s">That's</a>  someone filing an ordinance that's not a member of the board or the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6412.52s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6413.181s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6415.303s">Because</a>  we have to dispose of all items on the agenda that are given a board number.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6418.427s">But</a>  there's a distinction between a resolution and a petition, correct?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6422.898s">But</a>  you have to dispose of all items on the agenda, regardless.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6425.72s">Only</a>  a council can file something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6426.661s">Receive</a>  and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6428.302s">This</a>  council's been doing that for 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6430.564s">And</a>  that's how we dispose of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6431.885s">So</a>  if someone comes up.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6432.546s">That's</a>  one way to do it.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6433.386s">If</a>  someone comes up and it has no bearing on the council, Mr. President, or doesn't require a council vote, you'll hear that saying all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6440.452s">Receive</a>  and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6442.874s">I</a>  just feel that this is, Mr. President, a way of restricting people from coming up, putting something which is valid on the agenda, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6452.641s">it</a>  gets signed the number as a petition, not as a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6456.404s">It's</a>  a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6457.425s">They're</a>  two very different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6458.906s">And</a>  a petition is requesting council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6461.849s">Now,</a>  if they put something on the agenda that they believe requires council action and it doesn't, that's when the council can make a decision to receive and place on file or state clearly that this doesn't require council action and hear out whatever their concern is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6478.102s">I</a>  just don't see the reason <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6480.484s">to</a>  eliminate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6481.725s">I</a>  really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6483.707s">I</a>  don't see the reasoning behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6485.608s">I</a>  don't see how that, how does that increase public participation or make it easier? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6490.212s">Can</a>  anyone state that to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6491.353s">How</a>  does this make it easier for public participation?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6494.836s">It</a>  streamlines our internal operations.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6497.118s">How?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6497.979s">How?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6498.439s">If</a>  someone can explain that to me, by eliminating this, the ability for some resident to come up and put this in advance on the agenda, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6507.014s">So</a>  it's open and notorious, and everyone knows what they want to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6511.639s">I</a>  don't see how that, Mr. President, this enhances anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6517.918s">warrants</a>  additional discussion rather than just approving a council rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6523.122s">It's</a>  not often in my years on the council that you ever see a council rule come up, Mr. President, and approve the same night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6530.887s">I</a>  can't recall the last time it happened, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6533.328s">It</a>  doesn't happen often. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6534.809s">And</a>  I think this hasn't been properly vetted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6538.132s">And</a>  I realize that we're looking to address our maybe open meeting violations and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6547.998s">I'm</a>  not sure this accomplishes anything in that realm, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6552.239s">And,</a>  you know, I've heard people say this doesn't do anything to decrease public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6558.4s">What</a>  does it do to increase public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6562.401s">I</a>  haven't heard that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6564.741s">Just</a>  as I stated in my presentation, Mr. President, this is more about defining the parameters of what it is that we're trying to do and streamlining the way that we do it so that our meetings don't turn into a circus-like atmosphere and environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6576.176s">You</a>  know, the more that we know, the more that we have it defined, the better off we are, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6580.338s">You</a>  know, that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6582.239s">There's</a>  no nefarious intent here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6584.639s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6585.26s">I'm</a>  just trying to make sure that we do things properly and that we streamline things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6588.221s">We've</a>  gotten an opinion from the city solicitor that I think should be given a little bit of attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6592.743s">I</a>  think it's, you know, a little bit serious when the solicitor gives us an opinion that says that any time you take something up that's not on the agenda or under suspension, that it's a violation of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6601.446s">then</a>  all the talk that surrounded that suspension talk was whether or not people were going to have the opportunity to come up to the podium and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6607.672s">We</a>  have a dedicated section in our agenda for people to come up to speak on any topic they want, whenever they want, however they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6614.799s">So</a>  I'm not seeing how this is having any impact on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6618.622s">All</a>  it is is internal controls for the council and how the council operates.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6622.106s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6623.976s">If</a>  I could, and this is, I'm not directing this at Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6626.797s">And</a>  I don't think, and I'm not taking that away Councilor at all.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6628.598s">I'm</a>  not taking it that way at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6629.979s">I</a>  just want to, council rules are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6632.02s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6632.44s">And</a>  I want to make sure that they're properly vetted and you know, public participation as Councilor Knight said, you can come up at any time and speak on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6642.537s">However,</a>  what wasn't stated is now under the open meeting law, Mr. President, you may be able to come up, but the council cannot deliberate now under the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6652.541s">So</a>  if a resident wants to come up and speak on an issue, someone popped up tonight and wanted to speak on an issue, we can hear them out, Mr. President, but we can't deliberate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6663.065s">We</a>  cannot until they're placed on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6665.566s">Hence.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6667.284s">Petitions,</a>  presentations, and similar matters appears on the agenda, gives the 48-hour notice that's required by the open meeting law and the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6676.591s">Hence,</a>  we can deliberate on something they're discussing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6680.693s">They're</a>  two completely different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6683.766s">So</a>  if the council feels comfortable with doing away with a section of our agenda that allows people to come up and pre-advance, put on the agenda what they want to speak about, and hopefully have the council deliberate on it, that's petitions, presentations, and similar matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6703.254s">If</a>  we want to do away with that and say, you know what, the only one that can offer that now is anyone having business that deals with signage and so forth that requires a council vote, or variances, or whatever it might be, that's very different, Mr. President, than a resident coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6722.689s">So</a>  if we eliminate residents from coming up under this section and require them to come under public participation, we may be telling residents that come up <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6731.977s">We</a>  can't deliberate tonight, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6734.019s">We'll</a>  see you next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6734.939s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6736.06s">Point</a>  of information, Counsel Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6737.421s">The</a>  proposal says that all the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6742.465s">So</a>  I don't understand why we wouldn't be able to deliberate on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6744.887s">It's</a>  still on the council agenda.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6746.648s">So</a>  let's just make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6747.709s">When</a>  does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6748.689s">If</a>  I may, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6750.291s">So</a>  what you're saying is beyond the public participation, it'd be listed with no number or are you saying it's</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6754.974s">It</a>  doesn't matter if it has a number or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6756.675s">If</a>  it's on the agenda, it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6757.956s">What</a>  I'm saying is that it shouldn't be assigned a number because all papers on the agenda need to be disposed of in one fashion or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6764.619s">Only</a>  a consulate can file an order of resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6767.641s">So</a>  at the end of the day, if someone files a petition that doesn't comply with the proposed rule change, they get put on the agenda under public participation, the section that it's appropriate for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6780.558s">But</a>  as long as it shows up on the agenda, based on the solicitor's opinion, I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to deliberate, discern, or take any further action as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6789.512s">Because</a>  it's on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6792.635s">Mr.</a>  President, so effectively, you're going to have someone in the city clerk's office, with all due respect, making that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6799.0s">Whether</a>  it falls under the criteria, which was based over here, limited to special permits, grants, locations, sign variance, and common vituals license, only petitions filed meeting this criteria shall be assigned a council paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6813.67s">All</a>  other petitions shall be placed on the public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6817.213s">So</a>  in effect, what we're doing is having the city clerk's office figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6821.736s">what's</a>  going to be a petition and what's not a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6824.797s">And</a>  that goes under public participation.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6827.979s">The</a>  city clerk is well aware of the fact that, you know, if someone applies for a grant of location, we're an administrative authority, we're a tribunal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6834.881s">So</a>  there's an application that's necessary to be filed in the clerk's office for any of these actions to take place, whether it's a grant of location, a conviction was licensed, a sign reversal, there has to be some sort of application action that takes place in the clerk's office to prompt that to come here from an administrative standpoint in government.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6851.92s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6854.221s">Councilor</a>  Morell would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6856.502s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6857.723s">Just</a>  as I understand, I mean, the big issue with this change is just saying that this is reserved for only matters requiring council action per law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6865.007s">So</a>  I think it's just clarifying the response people can expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6869.069s">So</a>  if they fall under these categories, they can expect that we can act on it as required by law as opposed to <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6876.212s">issue</a>  of another sort that we might not even be, we can deliberate on, but the action we can take is limited to, you know, maybe asking the administration to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6882.958s">It's</a>  not under our purview by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6884.48s">So</a>  I think this is just adding clarification and helping set expectations to the public that already exist, but just being very clear about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6892.848s">And</a>  again, not about limiting speech, but just being clear about procedural things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6897.151s">And</a>  that's why I voted in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6899.654s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6906.291s">continue</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6907.871s">I</a>  was just wondering maybe if the council defined this petition was that where was that definition is that just part of our rules or is that part of a definition?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6916.834s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6930.014s">Right,</a>  so that definition is not a legal definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6933.035s">It's</a>  a definition that was created by a legislature somewhere, a town council, board of aldermen, someone that said that only a petition is defined as a council action that only requires action by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6948.441s">So</a>  that's just a made up, that's a made up term, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6957.069s">A</a>  petition is exactly what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6959.07s">It's</a>  requesting the council to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6961.33s">Why</a>  does it have to be something that's required by law? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6967.432s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6969.013s">To</a>  me, that limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6970.373s">Why</a>  do we want to limit people to come up? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6972.514s">This</a>  is the only... Point of information, council and I. It's about stuff that requires the council to take action.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6979.917s">Official</a>  business matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6982.848s">For</a>  example, we had a Kino license that sat on the table for a number of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6987.031s">The</a>  Kino license was in our Zoning Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6989.532s">Because</a>  it's in our Zoning Act and we're the special permit granting authority, it falls under Chapter 48, Section 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6994.455s">There</a>  are actions that we need to take and we need to act in a certain amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6997.597s">I</a>  believe the amount of time was 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6999.698s">Failure</a>  to act within that 90-day period results in a constructive acceptance of the Kino license at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7006.322s">If</a>  we don't take a vote on it, it's a constructive acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7010.025s">It</a>  also opens us up to legal <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7012.879s">action</a>  because it's within our zoning act and we failed to act as a special permit granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7017.465s">So</a>  what I'm trying to do, Mr. President, is delineate items that are under council purview and require council action and items that aren't under council purview and that council can't effectuate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7028.382s">in</a>  terms of taking a vote and it's happening tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7030.545s">You're</a>  approved, it's done, expect to have it tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7033.408s">There</a>  are certain items that come before this body that we can't do that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7037.132s">A</a>  lot of items we're asking people across the hall to do stuff for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7040.216s">What</a>  I'm saying is if in fact we're going to have a petition that gets filed, the petition should be for something that requires council action by law so that <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7047.284s">We're</a>  aware that this is something that's serious business, that's part of our job, that we're required to take action on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7052.527s">I'm</a>  not saying that public participation is something that shouldn't happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7056.77s">I'm</a>  not saying that that section should be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7059.092s">I'm</a>  not saying that people should not be allowed to participate in public at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7063.314s">What</a>  I'm saying is let's streamline the processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7065.116s">Let's</a>  define what a petition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7066.657s">Let's</a>  say this is what a petition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7068.057s">It's</a>  something that requires council action because if we let the ball drop on a petition, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7072.16s">we</a>  open ourselves up to certain legal ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7074.341s">We</a>  have certain obligations based upon the oath that we took, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7077.582s">Some</a>  of those things are duties and responsibilities that were required to execute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7081.723s">The</a>  majority of those duties and responsibilities that come before this council that were required to execute by statute of law comes in the form of a petition by way of an application for action by the council pursuant to some sort of established and enabled legislation, whether it be the granting of locations, the reversal of signs, the issuance of convictual licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7100.939s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7101.72s">So</a>  all I'm saying is a petition is reserved for those matters that require council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7106.943s">And</a>  if we don't take it, then we're in violation and everything else can go into public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7111.145s">If</a>  someone wants to come before the council and speak, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7113.347s">Come</a>  before the council and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7114.788s">Just</a>  do it at the right spot of the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7118.29s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7118.57s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7122.512s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7124.574s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7129.257s">I</a>  share some of Councilor Mark's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7132.338s">In</a>  particular, I think that this could use a bit more vetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7138.399s">And</a>  it's a bit confusing, because as you've been debating, sometimes it's not clear if we're debating substance, or do we like this, or is it clear? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7150.663s">And</a>  so to me, that indicates it's not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7153.163s">So</a>  I wanted to say that we have this phrase, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7156.424s">The</a>  public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7159.706s">I</a>  looked through my agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7162.348s">I</a>  didn't see such a portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7164.549s">So</a>  I don't know where it's going to be placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7166.91s">So</a>  maybe we need, you know, if it went to committee, perhaps they could add some language. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7171.653s">There</a>  shall be a portion of the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7174.394s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7174.695s">Point</a>  of information, Council Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7176.336s">Rule</a>  33, order of business, item 10, public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7180.578s">It's</a>  outlined in the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7181.599s">It</a>  didn't show up on the agenda because there is no public participation paper on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7186.38s">but</a>  it is outlined in the order of business under rule 33.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7188.502s">Oh,</a>  that's, that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7192.406s">Thanks</a>  for addressing that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7195.048s">Another</a>  concern is that, um, and obviously I, I, uh, maybe you should have known that in some sense, but in another sense, this should be accessible, I think, to the community that we understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7206.719s">Um,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7209.572s">I</a>  think there's also sort of a logical error here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7212.893s">And</a>  this is, again, if I went to committee, I suspect they'd resolve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7216.295s">You</a>  define a petition as an application requesting council action as acquired by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7221.377s">Then</a>  it says, skipping a paragraph, the filing of petitions shall be reserved only for matters requiring council action per law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7230.041s">And</a>  then it gives some examples, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7231.801s">And</a>  that is sort of repeating the definition of petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7235.723s">But</a>  then we have a phrase, all other petitions, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7240.401s">Well,</a>  if it doesn't meet that definition, it's not a petition per the definition of the word petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7245.805s">So</a>  if it's not a petition, why are we referring it to as all other petitions, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7252.11s">And</a>  I'm not gonna suggest any, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7258.215s">The</a>  filing of petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7261.28s">shall</a>  be reserved for these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7262.761s">All</a>  other petitions filed shall be placed in this portion of the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7265.743s">All</a>  right, but it says a petition is defined as an application requesting council action as required by law.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7271.066s">Right,</a>  and how many times do you think people fill out a petition that don't actually have the requirement for council action by law that still file the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7280.332s">So</a>  someone's going to file a petition, right, and the clerk's going to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7283.274s">The</a>  clerk's going to look at it and go, yeah, this isn't something that's required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7287.316s">Put</a>  that on public participation.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7289.675s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7290.617s">I</a>  mean, I think it's a fine thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7292.379s">I</a>  just think that if it went to committee, you'd come up with something a little clearer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7296.143s">That's</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7297.024s">Because</a>  as it is, somebody reading this, they're going, OK, we got petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7302.35s">I'm</a>  filing a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7304.512s">So</a>  for example, if a person reads through this, and they have something that's not required by law, and they want it discussed, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7311.688s">should</a>  they deliberately file a petition that they know isn't a petition by definition? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7316.395s">That's</a>  a little strange. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7318.037s">But</a>  that is what I would think I would do under, you know, reading through the statute, through the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7329.309s">I</a>  don't know, that's just a non-expert perspective who isn't familiar with every line of the city code. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7335.431s">And</a>  I suspect that could be made a lot more clear if it went to committee, got vetted, and so forth, the process that Councilor Marks is suggesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7342.933s">Thanks</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7343.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7345.734s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7347.256s">Thank</a>  you can cross 50 mystic street just a thought that came to mind listening to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7352.502s">I</a>  think primarily the process for public participation is going to be unchanged. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7358.848s">It's</a>  just going to be called something a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7362.152s">But</a>  I'm wondering from a practical standpoint and maybe the city clerk has a thought about this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7368.138s">I</a>  think there's value to having a number assigned to a petition for tracking purposes, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7377.366s">So</a>  if you're going back to try to recheck on something that happened rather than saying, you know, remember last February they were talking about coyotes and you have to search through all these <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7391.263s">council</a>  agendas to try to find the one you were thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7394.464s">So</a>  I'm wondering if there might be some value to consider if someone has a petition, it's determined it's a petition, not an item that would require council action, to designate that as P02001 or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7410.009s">The</a>  other <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7414.102s">resolutions</a>  and motions and things that are presented by the body, members of the council, have the numbers that they have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7422.926s">So</a>  I'm not trying to complicate it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7424.507s">I'm</a>  trying to make it so it's not considered less than because currently it is assigned a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7432.691s">And</a>  it seems like there's some concern about that it's less legitimate because it doesn't have a number anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7439.617s">It's</a>  just under public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7441.198s">So</a>  I just thought maybe having a system where a petition got a certain number with a prefix P, another resolution that was a normal one from the council had its own number, and maybe that would alleviate any concern that it's being diminished in terms of its importance, and it would also be easier to track just from a practical standpoint.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7459.553s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7460.013s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7461.279s">The</a>  way that I envision this, Mr. President, would be Mr. Krause gets up and he's, you know, filed for to be on the agenda during the public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7470.301s">Mr.</a>  Krause gets up and he speaks about something that he cares a lot about, which would be a scoreboard at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7475.743s">All</a>  right, let's say, you know, we're trying to push for a scoreboard at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7479.564s">These</a>  are the steps we've taken to get the scoreboard at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7482.164s">We're</a>  looking for the council help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7484.665s">What</a>  can the council do? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7486.525s">Mr.</a>  President, motion to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7489.434s">make</a>  an amendment relative to motion to make a resolution on behalf of Mr. Crouch's speech that the city of Medford take the following steps to affirmatively secure the school board a place to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7500.7s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7501.04s">You</a>  made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7501.9s">Everybody</a>  agree with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7502.801s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7503.041s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7503.381s">It's</a>  assigned a paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7504.301s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7504.922s">Follow</a>  up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7506.943s">Councilor</a>  just took the council just took ownership of that issue, put their name on it, said, this is mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7511.725s">I'm</a>  making this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7512.706s">I'm</a>  owning this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7513.266s">I'm</a>  putting ownership on this issue.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7515.387s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7516.307s">Councilor</a>  marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7519.029s">If</a>  Mr. Krause came up tonight and wanted to do what Councilor Knight was talking about, and he is not in any violation because the open meeting law only applies to deliberative bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7531.852s">Mr.</a>  Krause wouldn't be in any violation of bringing up the issue, so he can appear before us and bring up the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7538.293s">However,</a>  we would be in violation by deliberating saying, you know what, Mr. Krause, that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7544.854s">That's</a>  asked the mayor to get 20,000 for the school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7548.274s">So</a>  that's why I'm saying, Mr. President, having something, if I could just finish, having something assigned a petition number, Mr. President, is a way of getting around, because a lot of people will come up, Mr. President, and want to speak before us that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7562.708s">And</a>  they're not in violation, we would be in violation for deliberating. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7566.671s">And</a>  I think what Mr. Krause raises is a valid point, even with the numbering. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7570.675s">I</a>  think that's a great idea, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7574.359s">I</a>  think having the ability to do that and also having public participation, that to me opens up the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7581.167s">Eliminating</a>  one is exactly what it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7583.269s">It</a>  eliminates the option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7585.071s">And</a>  I don't see how that is open and transparent and adds to discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7589.516s">I</a>  really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7590.337s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7590.637s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7592.499s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I prefaced my comments with Mr. Krause, and I said, say that he had put the paper on for public participation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7600.861s">So</a>  you did it in advance.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7601.781s">We</a>  did it in advance, because we all- What if he didn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7604.862s">Then</a>  we can't talk about it, because the city solicitor gave us the opinion already. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7608.563s">Regardless</a>  of whether or not we change petition or don't change petition, we can't talk about it, because the solicitor already said it'd be a violation of the open meeting law the minute the body deliberates on a matter that's not on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7617.005s">Not</a>  if they were allowed to do a petition.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7619.411s">It</a>  would still be on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7620.832s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7621.372s">It's</a>  on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7622.072s">It's</a>  going to be in public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7623.813s">What's</a>  the difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7624.313s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7625.294s">It's</a>  just a different section of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7627.035s">So</a>  if he's on the agenda under public participation, he has the right to come up and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7631.056s">Then</a>  a councillor can say, this is my issue and adopt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7633.438s">And</a>  then they can take ownership of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7635.218s">You</a>  know, instead of having someone comes up to the podium and we're going to have the seven competing people step over each other to see who's going to do the most with this person when we're all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7642.782s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7643.863s">At</a>  the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7644.663s">And</a>  then it dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7645.564s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7646.584s">We</a>  can take ownership of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7647.705s">We</a>  can say, hey, look. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7648.725s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7649.606s">I</a>  put this proposal forward on behalf of Mr. Krause to get $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7653.188s">I'm</a>  going to get him the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7654.649s">As</a>  opposed to, oh, that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7655.93s">This</a>  person was up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7656.61s">I</a>  agree with this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7657.37s">I</a>  agree with that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7658.291s">Send</a>  it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7658.911s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7659.432s">Send</a>  it to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7660.732s">I</a>  just think it streamlines the process a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8104.449s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8105.83s">This</a>  is a relatively self-explanatory proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8109.072s">I'd</a>  like to refer this to the city solicitor for validation of form and codification, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8113.794s">Where</a>  we're going to put it in the ordinance isn't to be sure that it's in proper form. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8117.356s">However,</a>  in looking at it, ultimately, there's been a fight for 15 across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8122.719s">To</a>  live in the city of Medford and make less than $15, you're not going to be able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8127.199s">to</a>  live in the city of Medford and make $15. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8128.7s">You're</a>  going to have $15 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8130.001s">You're</a>  going to have a very difficult time trying to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8132.783s">This</a>  is an opportunity for us to show that we value our employees, that we believe in the work that they do, that we feel as though our public servants provide a high-quality level of service to the community, and they should be compensated accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8145.651s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I raise this measure and bring it forward for further debate and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8150.695s">I'd</a>  like to ask that the city solicitor put this in proper form and codification, and then we can, again, reconvene on it upon conclusion of legal review.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8157.79s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8158.85s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8160.211s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Knight again for putting forward this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8167.432s">The</a>  organization that I run was part of the Raise Up Mass Coalition that passed the Fight for 15 law here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8174.594s">And</a>  sadly, due to how the state constitution and state laws work, we <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8179.958s">exempted</a>  municipalities from that because it's technically an unfunded mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8183.399s">So</a>  I think it's really important that Medford steps up and says that we're going to follow along with what the state minimum wage is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8189.701s">And</a>  I also think just from the clear purposes of making sure we can hire folks, if you can make $3, $4, $5 more an hour, go work at Subway or some other organization or group rather than working for the city, that's going to present a problem now and down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8202.566s">So</a>  I think it's incredibly important both from a justice perspective and from a practical hiring perspective that we do this.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8209.241s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8210.142s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8211.743s">Lifeguards.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8213.905s">Camp</a>  counselors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8215.526s">Park</a>  police. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8216.907s">Substitute</a>  teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8218.268s">These</a>  are the people that will be impacted and affected by this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8221.05s">People</a>  that provide a very valuable service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8225.173s">We</a>  talk about lifeguards, it writes point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8229.158s">pretty</a>  happy to say that I haven't heard about any type of situation up at Wright's Pond in a very long time, because we do a great job training our lifeguards up there, and we have full complement to staff, and we want to keep it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8241.769s">We</a>  talk about the parks police, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8244.171s">You</a>  know, I can remember a time when I was a child where the parks were crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8249.596s">When</a>  the sun went down, the parks turned into war zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8252.499s">And</a>  now, as you drive through the city and you see the parks in the summertime and the park police are on board, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8258.311s">We're</a>  not seeing those same problems that we used to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8260.873s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I just think it's very important to point out who would be impacted and affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8265.275s">It's</a>  only city and school department employees, and it's only ones that make less than $15 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8271.218s">During</a>  budget deliberations and over the course of the past term, all of the collective bargaining agreements in both the school department and the city side, at one point or another, reached a conclusion and got wrapped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8282.21s">all</a>  contractual employees were receiving a wage that was above $15 an hour, with the exception of those few that I've just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8289.334s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't think this is gonna be something that's gonna have a major impact on the bottom line, but it will certainly have a major impact on the lives of those individuals that are working here and the employee of the city of Medford, and they're gonna be benefits of a fair wage.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8302.761s">You</a>  are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8303.421s">Councilor</a>  Knight, thank you for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8305.663s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Sommer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8307.704s">Jacob</a>  Sommer, 36 Amaranth Place, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8311.112s">And</a>  I heard the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8313.014s">I</a>  didn't hear anything about whether this would be perhaps indexed to inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8319.939s">Is</a>  there a chance of that?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8322.121s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8325.324s">If</a>  the Massachusetts minimum wage exceeds $15 an hour, then the employee shall receive the Massachusetts minimum hourly wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8331.629s">So</a>  as the state sets it is how our employees will get it based upon this proposal.</p>

    <p>[Sommer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8339.414s">But</a>  if Massachusetts does not do an index to increase based on inflation, we would not either in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8346.7s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8347.2s">We're</a>  going to let the state dictate and we're going to follow.</p>

    <p>[Sommer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8351.063s">That</a>  would mean that the city council would have to revisit this in several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8359.129s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8359.669s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8360.01s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8365.103s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8466.15s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8467.391s">I</a>  find this to be a rather self-explanatory resolution, ordinance change rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8471.854s">In</a>  looking at it for my council colleagues, the language in bold would be the new language being added to the existing section. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8479.24s">The</a>  remaining language in the section would continue to remain in full force and effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8485.044s">A</a>  few weeks back, we had some discussion about the removal of a number of parking spots along High Street and <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8491.929s">discussing</a>  the issue with residents in the neighborhood that were impacted by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8495.434s">I</a>  thought this might be an interesting compromise, a way that we could address some of the neighborhood concerns, but also move forward with the project, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8502.645s">Now</a>  with that being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8504.591s">I</a>  would request that this paper be sent to the building commissioner as well as the code enforcement officer for review and recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8511.394s">Where</a>  it's a zoning ordinance, it does have further ramifications than just this 94-151 section. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8518.757s">I</a>  know that there's another section on zoning code that talks about what a suitable parking spot would be and what the parameters of that parking spot would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8526.42s">had</a>  conversation with John Bovuso from the building commissioner's office and he's asked for the opportunity to take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8533.365s">So</a>  I'm requesting that my council colleagues join me in moving forward with sending this to the building commissioner's office for review from the building commissioner and the code enforcement officer for recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8542.431s">And</a>  then we can have a future discussion on it after those come back.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8545.954s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8548.135s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8549.585s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8550.927s">I</a>  have a number of concerns with this text amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8554.291s">I</a>  understand your request to send to the building commissioner, but I see it as being overly broad and really runs the risk of implying that the public asset of street parking is actually owned by individuals who are closest to it, which, of course, is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8568.717s">By</a>  adding curb cuts, we are further limiting parking, and with this being overly broad, it's unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8574.121s">Does</a>  someone several houses down from where this was taken, if they haven't had parking in front of their house for decades, are they allowed to apply for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8583.367s">But</a>  none of this speaks to the fact that this would have an environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8589.131s">It</a>  would increase the amount of impervious surface in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8593.057s">Pervious</a>  surface and green infrastructure such as trees and dirt and soil are really important to mitigate the amount of stormwater drain off that goes into the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8602.75s">We</a>  already have flooding issues in the city by adding more pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8606.226s">We</a>  run the risk of exacerbating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8610.389s">I</a>  do worry that also because of this, mature and significant trees will be under threat as people seek to make space to lay down asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8617.433s">I</a>  also have concerns that the buffer zones referenced are too vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8619.995s">You</a>  can look around the city at buffer zones that already exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8622.837s">There's</a>  maybe some mulch, maybe one tiny bush. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8625.939s">This</a>  definitely looks to <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8628.564s">Kind</a>  of impact neighbors who are around that suddenly their neighbors are parking with their headlights on what was formerly a front yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8636.488s">They</a>  have headlights in their window. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8637.808s">And</a>  then also, often we talk about beautification in this chamber and beautification of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8642.811s">And</a>  while I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I feel that parking on your front lawn, adding asphalt to formerly green, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8650.558s">And</a>  green infrastructure hardly goes far in the way of beautification of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8654.823s">So</a>  as I said, I have a number of concerns on this proposed text amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8659.389s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8660.791s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8661.091s">Council</a>  morale.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8661.852s">Council</a>  of Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8663.574s">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8665.176s">Some</a>  of the many of the concerns of Councilor morale. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8669.161s">I</a>  also think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8671.556s">make</a>  sure that we're not either implying or otherwise that any projects under consideration might be contingent on something like this moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8678.799s">I</a>  wouldn't support this in that case. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8683.301s">If</a>  we're going to move forward with it, I would propose an amendment that the parking that's created have pervious surfaces, permeable surfaces, allowing water to come through and not becoming another asphalt where water is potentially causing flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8697.827s">So</a>  that's the first part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8701.451s">make</a>  sure that if parking's installed, there's protection for mature trees, making sure that code enforcement or the city or whoever's responsible for the buffer strips, that they are sufficient and maintained well, and then also limiting it to one spot.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8719.026s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8723.22s">Council</a>  appears we might need to repeat that last part.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8725.863s">I</a>  don't have anything beyond mature trees.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8729.007s">And</a>  then limiting the <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8756.778s">And</a>  limiting to one spot, you've got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8759.319s">Limiting</a>  to one spot.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8761.999s">Limited</a>  to one spot, correct?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8764.3s">Yes,</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8765.52s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8770.161s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8773.802s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8774.782s">May</a>  I be so bold, Mr. President, to amend the paper to request that in the discernment, the building department also look at the green space requirements associated with intercourt parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8785.99s">And</a>  I offer that in the form of an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8788.231s">Can</a>  you repeat that again, please?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8789.832s">That</a>  the Building Commissioner's Office also review during the discernment the green space requirements.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8808.303s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8811.184s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8813.385s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8814.726s">I</a>  appreciate the fact that Councilman Knight's trying to get creative with the concern about potential loss on street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8823.489s">However,</a>  it flies in the face of everything I've spoken about over the last several years regarding properties on Salem Street and Riverside Ave that have turned their front yards into parking lots, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8837.054s">And</a>  I don't think it's very pleasing aesthetically, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8842.457s">And</a>  I would hate to see a practice, any practice that promotes such, even though it's called inner core and sounds great, the inner core is the outer core of our city and how our city looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8855.746s">And</a>  I don't think it does anything for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8858.627s">So</a>  I would not support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8860.689s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8862.99s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8863.931s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8867.162s">Parking</a>  in a front yard, I think, right now is currently not allowed by our ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8872.145s">I</a>  think I'm correct with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8875.808s">I</a>  think it takes away from the value of a house when you start parking one or two cars on the front lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8881.832s">It</a>  takes away the beauty, especially if you have a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8885.975s">I</a>  mean, I go by every day, by a house on the Mississippi Valley Parkway, single family, and there's a pickup truck parked on the front lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8894.461s">It</a>  doesn't look very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8896.141s">As</a>  people drive by, and again, I don't know if I can support taking up yards and putting down huts up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8904.767s">Even</a>  in previous services, even parking cars in your front yard, I don't think does it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8911.051s">And</a>  I don't know if I could support this either, even with some planting or things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8917.256s">I</a>  just think it takes away from the beauty of the neighborhood and the home.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8922.419s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8923.72s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8925.492s">Mr.</a>  President, I can understand Councilor Knight's presentation, the understanding that we've had some recent, uh, recent concerns, but I, I too, with Council Marks, I know that the Felsway has turned into, um, you know, front yard, um, parking areas and it does take away the appearance of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8948.619s">And</a>  I think, um, although in good intention, I don't think I can support this either. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8953.681s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8955.299s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8958.921s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9815.708s">Good</a>  evening, Joe Villione, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9822.471s">May</a>  I wait until we can start after the council is finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9825.593s">Please</a>  continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9827.934s">I</a>  like, I respected him while he was speaking, so I'd like respect while I'm speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9834.844s">I</a>  remember a couple years ago, my friend Jean, paper was being torn up in the microphone when she was trying to speak, and this is about free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9844.248s">I</a>  think millions of dollars in public access is relevant, and Mr. Knight needs to stop harassing people while they were coming up to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9856.433s">I'm</a>  the last person of the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9858.154s">That</a>  is not by accident, and that is not a coincidence.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9860.675s">If</a>  you could please continue.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9864.804s">Please</a>  continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9865.324s">You</a>  have 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9865.725s">No,</a>  I'd like to start my 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9867.266s">Mr.</a>  Crousy, I'd like to start my 10 minutes when this individual shows some respect to a petitioner, because he loves to make noise, and that's what public access and free speech is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9877.954s">People</a>  having the right to talk.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9879.215s">Mr.</a>  Cruz, Mr. President, I'd like to call the meeting to order.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9882.918s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9883.598s">Mr.</a>  Viglione, please continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9886.04s">You</a>  have 10 minutes, and you've already blown through, like, two.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9888.822s">Well,</a>  I've asked the council for a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9890.944s">Well,</a>  this individual wants to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9892.245s">I'd</a>  ask you to please continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9894.406s">It's</a>  difficult to continue when someone is harassing and abusing someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9897.588s">I</a>  did not do that to him.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9899.128s">Mr.</a>  Bigelow, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9900.669s">Mr.</a>  President, a motion to table the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9903.911s">On</a>  a motion of Consul Knight to table the matter, seconded by Consul Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9908.693s">So</a>  do I not get to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9911.534s">I've</a>  waited all night.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9912.195s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9912.895s">This</a>  is part of the process.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9913.595s">Well,</a>  he harassed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9914.656s">Then</a>  I want to sanction him, because I warned him. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9916.397s">Mr.</a>  President, you don't have to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9919.118s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, remember I wrote a note that I would be harassed?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9923.141s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor, it's been seconded, a vote is going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9926.564s">Mr.</a>  President, other people want to speak from the community.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9928.745s">And</a>  I understand that, but a motion has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9930.806s">So</a>  this needs to be voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9932.487s">If</a>  you do not want to table it, that is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9934.708s">Motion</a>  to table by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9940.072s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9985.763s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9988.205s">I</a>  like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9989.426s">Moving</a>  the TV station to a central location is something that Mayor McGlynn's tribunal said prior to the building of a station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9998.853s">Now,</a>  I love that the high school has an exquisite TV station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10002.136s">I</a>  think it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10004.117s">And</a>  there are past councillors and even present councillors that agree with me that we need <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10010.595s">We</a>  need not to have grandma go up a dark road on the border of Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10016.298s">The</a>  kids at the school, from what I understand, have the full reign of the station, so the citizens get less time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10029.457s">The</a>  station manager is here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10031.218s">I</a>  hope there's a staffer over at the station in case people want to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10034.919s">But</a>  here's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10036.5s">Medford</a>  has never had a functional access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10039.021s">So</a>  after TV3 was shut down, the city is now operating City Access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10045.664s">We</a>  still need to do, as Councilor Mark said earlier with another issue here, what does it take <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10057.25s">to</a>  increase public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10059.852s">So</a>  membership over at TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10062.795s">They</a>  claim 81 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10064.096s">One</a>  has doubled, many politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10067.319s">I</a>  have a vision of 500 people joining the station by the end of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10071.977s">We'll</a>  look towards 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10074.198s">As</a>  many of you may know, and some of you may not, the FCC, under this current inhabitant of the White House, is trying to take away certain monies for public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10085.541s">Other</a>  people are cutting the cord. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10087.762s">So</a>  the monies that were available five years ago, ten years ago, when we had a station that wasn't operating properly, there were color bars, they were at Riverside Avenue, there was no connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10098.812s">Now</a>  we have the opportunity to bring people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10101.575s">And</a>  those young ladies that were up here earlier, that everyone really enjoyed their presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10107.9s">What's</a>  not to like about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10109.949s">A</a>  functional access TV station can enhance what those young ladies are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10114.772s">The</a>  school can interact with public access in a whole different way, because they can have their school channel, we have the government channel, we have the public channel, when they relate together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10124.139s">And</a>  I've been doing this since 1979. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10126.941s">When</a>  it all works together, you have wonderful access. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10130.083s">You</a>  have, in Reading, they have the senior citizens hang out in the front of the access station, which is an old movie theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10137.568s">They</a>  hang out and have coffee on Saturdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10139.409s">They're</a>  not doing public access, it's a community media center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10142.633s">Now,</a>  here's the power of public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10145.476s">In</a>  October, I interviewed a publisher who had a book out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10150.542s">And</a>  he asked me to write for his newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10153.264s">And</a>  as many of you know, for 10 years, we've been wanting to bring a newspaper in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10156.786s">So</a>  my vision is public access, a radio station, which former Mayor Muccini-Burke really liked the idea before she became mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10164.83s">We</a>  were talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10165.651s">She</a>  said, Joe, I can get Homeland Security to put some money in for an emergency AM 1570 in expanded band. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10172.335s">Now,</a>  I'm talking about it all working together because there are some people that don't have internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10176.497s">So</a>  if we have an emergency channel, Chief Buckley, Chief Gilberti, now they have a tool that they don't have currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10183.199s">They</a>  have AM radio, we can get a low power FM, we have the newspaper, we have public access, we have the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10189.761s">Now</a>  it's covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10190.781s">Now</a>  the close to 60,000 people in Medford have something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10195.022s">I</a>  want to work with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10197.003s">I</a>  want to work with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10199.384s">I</a>  want us to move forward with access television in a bright and exciting way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10204.565s">Mr.</a>  Gordon is very well versed over there at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10207.646s">He</a>  can run the high school channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10209.487s">But</a>  we build a new entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10212.267s">Now,</a>  I believe there's something going through the legislature in Boston to try to get funding from streaming to replace the funding that's going to go away when Comcast and Verizon get what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10224.831s">And</a>  you know what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10225.672s">First,</a>  they want Beacon Hill to dictate to all the cities and towns, it all go through Boston, so you people no longer have an ascertainment hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10233.234s">That's</a>  what they're lobbying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10235.016s">We</a>  need to have a real public access station for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10239.5s">And</a>  all due respect to Patrick, he's doing a great job over at the high school, but he does not understand the vision for access that I've had for the past 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10249.369s">And</a>  you know that I've worked on Medford access issues since 2002. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10253.974s">So</a>  I'm passionate about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10256.016s">I</a>  have the knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10256.836s">I</a>  have the expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10258.658s">I</a>  would also like my show on the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10260.899s">So</a>  I'm living in Malden now, but I believe if you don't live in the city, you can still air on TV3 Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10267.541s">I'm</a>  on many, many stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10269.301s">We</a>  just had the Cars biographer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10271.262s">And</a>  because of my access show and interviewing this publisher, we now have a new newspaper in Medford that you're all invited to write for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10279.604s">Pure</a>  free speech and and it's everywhere and it's very exciting because I'm seeing people reading it on the bus I'm seeing people picking it up and getting very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10288.029s">I</a>  work very hard to do this I thank the City Council for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10291.551s">I</a>  want to raise membership I think we could do 500 by the end of the year, but we have to work together Thank you Name an address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10302.297s">Yeah,</a>  thank you Ken Krause 50 mystic Street Medford unlike the <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10308.933s">The</a>  person who just spoke, I am a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10311.815s">I've</a>  been a Medford resident for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10314.676s">I'm</a>  a Medford residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10321.246s">Comcast</a>  cable subscriber, and I'm a member of Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10327.991s">So</a>  I would like to share some information with the viewing public about what is happening at Medford Community Media and not what is not happening at Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10341.482s">The</a>  station director has been doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10344.744s">It's</a>  a staff of one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10347.901s">doing</a>  a tremendous amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10349.663s">They</a>  could use multiple people there, but that's to be determined in future budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10355.749s">Just</a>  three things I want to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10357.49s">One</a>  is there's a fantastic show being presented, started last fall called Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10365.818s">It</a>  was started by Melanie McLaughlin, who now is a member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10371.623s">And</a>  it focuses on issues related to education in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10375.346s">The</a>  first three shows were on food insecurity, which is a big issue for families and students in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10384.074s">The</a>  second program was on vaping, which is another huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10389.562s">issue</a>  in the schools, and the third program was on CCSR, the Center for Social Responsibility and Citizenship, which we just heard about tonight and we hear about frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10403.167s">Melanie</a>  started the show, she's a documentary filmmaker of some regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10408.289s">And</a>  started the show with the idea of getting it off the ground using a lot of student assistance on the production, but ultimately turning the show over to the students to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10420.961s">And</a>  the most recent show actually was the first one that a student hosted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10426.446s">Again,</a>  CCSR, there's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10429.633s">A</a>  group of CCSR students working currently on a project that looks at 50 years of environmental advocacy over at the Medford High School, and interestingly enough, the types of advocacy you've seen recently <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10445.293s">from</a>  CCSR students such as the presentation about getting styrofoam banned actually dates back to the 70s when students at Medford High School came before the city council to request that the city start buying recycled paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10460.57s">that</a>  they clean up certain derelict properties in the city, a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10465.133s">So</a>  Medford has a long legacy at the high school and throughout the community of environmental advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10470.717s">So</a>  these students are producing a number of things, that television show will be one of them, to demonstrate that and to document it and to kind of create a legacy that the future students can follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10484.406s">But</a>  so a student hosted that show, who's part of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10488.269s">A</a>  student operated the camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10490.97s">And</a>  three students were in the production booth doing all the production and the graphics with the assistance of Patrick Gordon. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10499.335s">The</a>  show was done in about five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10502.296s">It's</a>  online now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10503.157s">It</a>  can be watched. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10504.337s">It'll</a>  be on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10505.358s">It'll</a>  be on the in the rotation of the <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10509.912s">television</a>  station for everybody to view. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10512.093s">And</a>  I really recommend people to watch that show because it's excellent and there'll be future ones coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10516.474s">So</a>  that's just one example. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10517.795s">The</a>  second thing that Patrick Gordon is doing is he's been heavily involved with Words and Music, which is a first Friday of the month program at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10527.818s">Again,</a>  if you haven't heard of it, I would recommend you go watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10530.939s">Watch</a>  the archive programs that are all available online. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10534.06s">It's</a>  a show every first Friday where they take the first hour and they discuss with a panel of people a topic of community interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10541.423s">And</a>  then the second hour is live music. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10544.604s">Patrick</a>  Gordon and the staff is there every first Friday and also uses it as a training ground for people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10552.327s">This</a>  past Friday there were adults manning the cameras, working on the other equipment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10558.489s">It's</a>  a very great learning experience and it, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10562.19s">presents</a>  to the community the value of public access, the outreach is being done, and the proof and the product is people are learning how to do this and will hopefully continue to be engaged in future programs of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10578.891s">The</a>  third example I would give you is last fall there was a program that I happened to be on as a guest and afterward Patrick, who knew I'm involved with the arts community, asked me if I knew of anybody who he could contact about trying to establish an art exhibit in the <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10599.581s">studio</a>  space. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10600.602s">There</a>  were two blank walls that he thought were underutilized and elsewhere he had seen that had been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10606.606s">So</a>  I gave him a couple of names and that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10609.688s">Well,</a>  he worked on it all through the winter and last month the Medford Community Media Center had its first art exhibit during which the artists were interviewed for a future program and there's going to be rotating art exhibits going forward throughout the year and future programs on <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10628.982s">the</a>  arts community in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10631.184s">So</a>  those are just three examples that I've seen as a member, as a resident of what we're getting out of the work of the community access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10642.235s">And</a>  it really bothers me when <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10646.368s">the</a>  perception of the station is presented in a way that's not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10652.63s">And</a>  so I just hope people will take the time to look at some of these programs that are being offered at the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10660.692s">They</a>  are very good quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10662.653s">The</a>  support is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10664.953s">Everyone</a>  is welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10667.034s">And</a>  I encourage you to get involved with the public access station because it is a great asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10671.835s">The</a>  station itself is very well equipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10675.506s">The</a>  support is there, and I hope when the budget comes around in the few months ahead that we can look at adding some additional money for the station, whether through the cable access fees or some other way where perhaps additional staffing could be used, because that will only help the station be more effective in serving the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10694.679s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10695.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10699.002s">Could</a>  you please have your name and address for the record?</p>

    <p>[Duggan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10701.621s">Laura</a>  Duggan, 31, Hickory Ave., in the Heights, Medford Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10707.07s">And</a>  I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of station manager Patrick Gordon of Medford Community Media, Medford's local cable channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10716.542s">As</a>  the hostess of a MCM show entitled, Looking Back at Medford History, for almost two years, I've had the opportunity to see Mr. Gordon at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10728.81s">He</a>  has proved to be an excellent, on all accounts, demonstrating a professionalism that is a credit to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10737.495s">He</a>  is a friendly guy and very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10741.177s">Under</a>  the management of Patrick Gordon, MCM has flourished. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10744.759s">Many</a>  new and entertaining shows are now available for the viewing public, and Medford High School students have had the opportunity to develop programming due to the close proximity of the station to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10760.088s">The</a>  necessity to quarry members of MCM is not a problem for those who have nothing to hide, would you agree? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10768.224s">As</a>  far as outreach, station manager Patrick Gordon has established an off-site location at West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10778.868s">Weekly</a>  programming from there is shared with the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10784.01s">In</a>  addition to excellent programming, we now have a wonderful webpage which offers easy access to membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10792.193s">training,</a>  program scheduling, and to see any of the programs that have already aired. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10798.955s">Many</a>  of the people I have interviewed on my show, I've been doing this for two years, I don't know, it might be 20, 25 interviews now, who might be from, not Medford, can have their friends watch it, and are watching it, and they're learning now more about Medford through these interviews, and also it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10815.439s">But</a>  my show is just one of many new shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10818.76s">Another</a>  thing is, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10821.301s">Medford</a>  citizens have been able to see and hear the candidates that were running in the last local election. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10828.104s">I</a>  don't remember when I ever saw that available to the public, where you could watch everyone make a statement about where they were and then watch the debate, the mayoral debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10839.208s">I</a>  mean, I think that was the highest form of public service to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10844.43s">And</a>  Mr. Gordon made sure that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10849.156s">So</a>  if, and also if you don't want, if someone doesn't want to leave the comfort of their home and on a night that's a city council meeting is happening, they can catch it on MCM. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10861.739s">So</a>  that's also another service to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10864.96s">Medford</a>  is lucky to have Patrick at the helm of Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10870.942s">He</a>  needs to be commended at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=10873.963s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>
