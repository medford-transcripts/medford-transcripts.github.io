00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:05,497
Welcome to the Mustang Report!

2
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Lydia Ryan from the Mustang Report and I'm here with the Stang.

3
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:40,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And today we're going to be asking him a few questions just about what he does daily at the high school.

4
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:42,769
[SPEAKER_10]: What sporting events are your favorite to go to?

5
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say ones that are close quarters, indoors, because everybody's really close together and it's fun to get everybody pumped up.

6
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And what are your methods to getting the crowd pumped up?

7
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Loud.

8
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:57,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

9
00:00:59,028 --> 00:00:59,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Just being loud?

10
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:00,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

11
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:01,729
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

12
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,570
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the biggest event that you've been to this year?

13
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,031
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of them that I've been to.

15
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you try to go regularly to each event?

16
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I try.

17
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of difficult.

18
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,233
[SPEAKER_10]: How is the crowd when you don't make it to an event?

19
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have as much spirit as they always do.

20
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure about that?

21
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd hope.

22
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the inspiring advice, and this is Lydia Ryan signing off.

23
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Cariann Lacharis, and I'm here with the Mustang Report.

24
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:38,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Mr. Maloney, and we're just going to ask you a few questions on how the fall sports season went.

25
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:39,629
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think the outcome was?

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,971
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a pretty successful fall.

27
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our kids worked very hard.

28
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:47,335
[SPEAKER_00]: We were fortunate with some great facilities.

29
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:52,269
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the girls soccer team win the GBL championship.

30
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,890
[SPEAKER_00]: The girls volleyball won the GBL championship.

31
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Golf also won the GBL championship.

32
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:04,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Football made the tournament for the first time since the new MIA existence.

33
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:08,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boys soccer also went to the state tournament and did very well.

34
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,938
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very happy with the outcome.

35
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:13,599
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had great support from the band and the cheerleaders as well.

36
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand a lot of the teams are going into the new conference.

37
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:21,960
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think that's going to affect the outcome in the sports team's record?

38
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,982
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a challenge.

39
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:26,064
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finally going to have a league to call home.

40
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,225
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northeast Conference will be starting in the spring of 2017.

41
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:33,029
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 16 teams, so it's going to be very competitive.

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Our coaches and our kids are going to have to work very hard to stay at a competitive level.

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,913
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think the outcome of the Thanksgiving football game is going to turn out this year?

44
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think we're finally going to beat Malden?

45
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:49,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we won over there two years ago, so we're looking to do it again.

46
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:52,481
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 129th, so the boys will be ready.

47
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:56,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Nassimento and his staff have done a great job with the kids.

48
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,506
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been very competitive.

49
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:58,807
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting a lot of points up.

50
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping we go over to W. Do you think you could predict the score?

51
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:07,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say we're going to beat Marlin 42 to 28.

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,682
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll hold you to that.

53
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:14,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Lydia Ryan reporting with the Mustang News and I'm here today with Mr. Nass to talk about Thanksgiving.

54
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

55
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:29,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I mean we have the big game in the morning and then hopefully after a big win I will be going home and we are actually going to host Thanksgiving this year for the first time.

56
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:31,642
[SPEAKER_10]: So cool.

57
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:33,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are you looking forward to most?

58
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:36,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it the football game or eating with your family?

59
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:44,554
[SPEAKER_20]: The football game is a big, big part of our Thanksgiving tradition, and it's one of my favorite parts of the day.

60
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:50,820
[SPEAKER_20]: But honestly, just getting everyone together, especially at our new house, will be exciting, and that's my favorite part.

61
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:55,044
[SPEAKER_10]: So what does your family typically eat on Thanksgiving?

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,665
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I mean, we got the turkey, which is pretty standard on Thanksgiving.

63
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:04,270
[SPEAKER_20]: And then just a bunch of those usual sides that we got.

64
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,052
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce.

65
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you know, gravy, all that sort of stuff.

66
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:13,256
[SPEAKER_20]: This is, you know, we're in the middle of a Thanksgiving interview here.

67
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:14,756
[SPEAKER_20]: That's fine.

68
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:15,416
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

69
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:19,498
[SPEAKER_20]: So he can, he can actually, you can probably interview him as well on this, right?

70
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:20,678
[SPEAKER_20]: At the same time, get him out of the way.

71
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,160
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but you know, one of my favorite things is, you know, we got to have pumpkin pie.

72
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,621
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, it's, it's delicious.

73
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:30,182
[SPEAKER_19]: So you might have to zoom out a little bit so that you get all of us in this picture.

74
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:30,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

75
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:31,383
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

76
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:34,444
[SPEAKER_10]: So question for both of you, is it called sauce or gravy?

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,642
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a, that's a, that tends to be a huge debate.

78
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, not with my family.

79
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:46,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, um, but with, with a lot of people that are, you know, that are out there, I'll get down in the frame for you.

80
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:46,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

81
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, to me, I'm cool with gravy.

82
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,469
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I've always called it gravy.

83
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,711
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm, I don't know.

84
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,654
[SPEAKER_19]: We talking like red sauce that goes on pasta, turkey.

85
00:04:58,694 --> 00:04:59,174
[SPEAKER_19]: That's gravy.

86
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:01,175
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can both agree it's gravy.

87
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:04,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is your favorite dessert?

88
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:07,634
[SPEAKER_20]: That's tough.

89
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:08,355
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot.

90
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,097
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot out there.

91
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:12,059
[SPEAKER_20]: I think pumpkin pie, though.

92
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,202
[SPEAKER_20]: It's unbelievable, and it's a must-have.

93
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Not a huge pumpkin pie fan.

94
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,330
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to be...

95
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:25,678
[SPEAKER_19]: But then I realized that it's not really my thing.

96
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:31,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Very boring guy, go for some apple pie.

97
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:37,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes, who knows, maybe some pumpkin roll, but not pumpkin pie.

98
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:42,790
[SPEAKER_20]: It's questionable, but everyone's entitled to their own opinion, I guess.

99
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,892
[SPEAKER_10]: So for sides, is it mashed potatoes or stuffing?

100
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:46,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is your favorite?

101
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:47,733
[SPEAKER_20]: 100% stuffing.

102
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:47,873
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

103
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:53,249
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's a giant pile of mashed potatoes.

104
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:59,031
[SPEAKER_19]: You take all the vegetables, you throw it all in there, throw some gravy on top, and just eat it with a spoon.

105
00:05:59,131 --> 00:05:59,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't even use a fork.

106
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you both eat the turkey, or would you rather something like ham?

107
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:07,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Turkey.

108
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:10,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Turkey every time.

109
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:14,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Ham's great, but if I had to choose, I'm taking turkey.

110
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:19,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and for our last question, can you do your best imitation of a turkey?

111
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Best imitation of a turkey.

112
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, this is going to be great.

113
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I guess, right?

114
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,931
[SPEAKER_20]: Gobble, gobble, gobble.

115
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:32,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you can do better than that.

116
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,334
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I got.

117
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:34,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing?

118
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:35,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you top that?

119
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,296
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I can't top that.

120
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,198
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just gobble, gobble.

121
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,159
[SPEAKER_19]: The real turkeys don't even do that.

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,221
[SPEAKER_19]: I see them every morning on my drive to work.

123
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:44,943
[SPEAKER_19]: They just stand in the middle of the road.

124
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:46,404
[SPEAKER_10]: What noise do they make?

125
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,677
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't put my window down because they're aggressive birds.

126
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:53,041
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want them to attack me or peck my eyes out.

127
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:53,601
[SPEAKER_19]: They're tall.

128
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,263
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they could poke in the window.

129
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:55,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Nah, I'm all set.

130
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:58,266
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw a turkey attack an SUV today.

131
00:06:59,587 --> 00:06:59,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Where?

132
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Highland Ave in Winchester.

133
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,391
[SPEAKER_20]: I see it every morning.

134
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,033
[SPEAKER_20]: They attacked my uncle the other time.

135
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,674
[SPEAKER_20]: They're aggressive creatures.

136
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,176
[SPEAKER_20]: They're very territorial.

137
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,604
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Aaron, I wish you both luck on your football game on Thanksgiving, and I hope you have a great turnout.

138
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the interview.

139
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:18,547
[SPEAKER_10]: City of Ryan, signing off.

140
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mrs. Dorsey, what's your favorite dessert for Thanksgiving?

141
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:29,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, my favorite dessert for Thanksgiving is a lot of the typical ones that you will see on every Thanksgiving table.

142
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:30,836
[SPEAKER_17]: I love apple pie.

143
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,297
[SPEAKER_17]: I love pumpkin pie.

144
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:36,160
[SPEAKER_17]: My family's favorite is chocolate cream pie.

145
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,833
[SPEAKER_17]: and banana coconut custard pie.

146
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:41,334
[SPEAKER_17]: What's your favorite dessert?

147
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:44,457
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite dessert on Thanksgiving would have to be apple pie.

148
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,218
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you doing this Thanksgiving?

149
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:49,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going over my in-laws for Thanksgiving.

150
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:54,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I love turkey and we're going to try to make a turkey together and I'll bring some goodies.

151
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:57,627
[SPEAKER_01]: We celebrate three cultures that day.

152
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:04,313
[SPEAKER_01]: The American traditions along with the Italian because my husband is Italian and if I don't have pasta

153
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,698
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone will be a small revolution in the house.

154
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, the Puerto Rican tradition.

155
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,504
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have the bearnia, which is the pork, and I make the rice and all the trimmings.

156
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And then friends stop in for dessert.

157
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's usually a long night, but it's wonderful.

158
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:21,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great time.

159
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, this is DP reporting here with Ms.

160
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:25,651
[SPEAKER_13]: LeClaire.

161
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:26,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Ms.

162
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,993
[SPEAKER_13]: LeClaire, what are your plans for Thanksgiving?

163
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I am going to spend it with my sister and my whole family.

164
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,137
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to eat lots of turkey and stuff it.

165
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:34,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful.

166
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have just a quick question for you.

167
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you call it sauce or gravy?

168
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm a gravy person.

169
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,133
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you on that one.

170
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,734
[SPEAKER_13]: And last question is do you like chicken or turkey better?

171
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:48,795
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a difference?

172
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Like in general?

173
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:55,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Turkey?

174
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:57,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Good answer.

175
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,240
[SPEAKER_13]: This is DP here with Miss LeClaire.

176
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Miss LeClaire.

177
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:08,368
[SPEAKER_09]: do you know or do you help out your mom when she's like cooking or like your dad or just your family members?

178
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:12,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I usually help out my mom and my grandmother when they're like cooking the turkey.

179
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,432
[SPEAKER_13]: I usually help them make an apple pie.

180
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,654
[SPEAKER_13]: That's that's all I do usually.

181
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what time they put in the turkey in the morning?

182
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:27,565
[SPEAKER_13]: My grandmother usually, and my mom usually wake up around like 6.30 to put it in, because we usually eat early.

183
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:29,166
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't do dinner, we do lunch.

184
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,187
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good idea.

185
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,368
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to move over here to Dora.

186
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:39,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you usually help out, or do you just sit back and just wait for the food to be ready?

187
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:47,756
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as I would love to sit back, my mother would not allow that, so I help her out in the kitchen, help my dad start a fire sometimes.

188
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:50,677
[SPEAKER_08]: So how long does the food last?

189
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:53,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very long.

190
00:09:53,879 --> 00:10:00,783
[SPEAKER_08]: There are leftovers for the week's lunches, but with my brother in the house it doesn't last very long.

191
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nick, it's your turn.

192
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,628
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you like to eat the most?

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm a big turkey guy myself.

194
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:13,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I like turkey.

195
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:17,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But every year we do not only just like the Thanksgiving dinner at my family.

196
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:21,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We also do a Thanksgiving lunch where like, we're also all Italian.

197
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:28,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So my uncle makes like a huge batch of like raviolis and like a lasagna.

198
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:35,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's probably my favorite meal of the of the year because he he gets it from this place Anna's in Medford.

199
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're literally to die for.

200
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,128
[SPEAKER_09]: What about dessert?

201
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:49,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Desserts, we do kind of the same idea, but my great-grandmother, who's 98 years old, is super talented with making pies.

202
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:54,014
[SPEAKER_05]: She makes like eight different pies every single Thanksgiving.

203
00:10:54,054 --> 00:11:01,036
[SPEAKER_05]: She makes pumpkin pie, apple custard pie, or something like that, and then your traditional apple pie.

204
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:05,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she makes this one with whipped cream and some other stuff.

205
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:08,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really eat the pies too much, but that's what we do for dessert.

206
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you help out like cooking or picking up the dishes?

207
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:21,290
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like to sit down, wait for the food and then afterwards I take a nap and then afterwards I do help clean up the dishes afterwards though, yeah.

208
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know my family, they're like huge like football like maniacs.

209
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:29,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys usually like watch any sports or?

210
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:37,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, usually it would be my grandpa and my brother and I and we'll be on the couch and they'll be watching it and I'll be kind of you know falling asleep, yeah.

211
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:42,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Nick Kenison with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with Miss Timmons, a substitute at Medford High School.

212
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss Timmons, what do you do for Thanksgiving?

213
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We usually have people over to our house.

214
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,380
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom does the turkey.

215
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good time.

216
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:56,263
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your favorite meal, or what's your favorite food item as far as Thanksgiving goes?

217
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,384
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd have to be the stuffing.

218
00:11:59,064 --> 00:11:59,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I go wild for it.

219
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Or brie mashed potatoes.

220
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:03,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Real good.

221
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,107
[SPEAKER_05]: What are brie mashed potatoes?

222
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Mashed potatoes with brie cheese in them.

223
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:09,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, makes sense, okay.

224
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:13,688
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your favorite Thanksgiving dessert, or if you do any?

225
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:16,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I make a mean pecan pie.

226
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to eat, yeah.

227
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:20,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Pecan pie is pretty tasty.

228
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:29,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, I'm not sure if you're following football, but what is your prediction for the Medford versus Malden Thanksgiving Day football game?

229
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:31,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Gonna do great!

230
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:34,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mrs. Timmons.

231

[SPEAKER_05]: This has been Nick Hennessey with the Mustang Report, and back to you.

232

233
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:49,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like every Thanksgiving, we stay at my grandma's and she just cooks us a meal and we have a good time.

234
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:53,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Next question is, you're participating in the Mustang Movember contest.

235
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Who do you think is going to win this year?

236
00:12:55,795 --> 00:13:03,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, looking at the jars, it looks like Mr. Drowski has a commanding lead over many of the other participants, so I'm going to go with him.

237
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Drowski.

238
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:07,306
[SPEAKER_14]: And what is your favorite Thanksgiving food item?

239
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Has to be turkey.

240
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:08,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Has to be turkey.

241
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:09,868
[SPEAKER_19]: White meat, though.

242
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:10,709
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't like dark meat.

243
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:11,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Happy Thanksgiving!

244
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,679
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to welcome you to John Brewer's Tavern.

245
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,760
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Bill Honeycutt.

246
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,021
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the owner of the restaurant.

247
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,604
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our ninth annual football lunch.

248
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,646
[SPEAKER_16]: We're happy to have both teams here.

249
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:39,331
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to wish you luck on Thursday, but more importantly, a happy Thanksgiving.

250
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:46,258
[SPEAKER_16]: We are lucky enough to have the two mayors, the mayor of Medford, Stephanie Berg, and the mayor of Malden, Gary Christensen, here today.

251
00:13:52,773 --> 00:14:02,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning and good afternoon everyone.

252
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:13,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Gary Christensen, Mayor of the City of Malden and I'm here just to really say, you know, good luck and thank you for being the caliber of students that I've been able to get to know over the past couple of years.

253
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:20,973
[SPEAKER_15]: For the past several months, everybody's been talking about, geez, what's the future of our country after the presidential election?

254
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:26,678
[SPEAKER_15]: And I tell anybody, listen, based on my getting to know all of you, I really feel good about where we're going.

255
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:30,622
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, good luck and happy Thanksgiving to you all.

256
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:43,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all for being here today and thanks to Billy Honeycutt, our favorite alumni for hosting us today.

257
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,748
[SPEAKER_18]: I graduated with this guy and his wife Sue.

258
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:50,871
[SPEAKER_18]: So even though we're not on the Malden line, we're really in Medford, the heart of Medford here.

259
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,672
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to wish you all a great Thanksgiving Day.

260
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:54,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Good luck out on the field.

261
00:14:55,393 --> 00:15:00,955
[SPEAKER_18]: we'd want to bring the trophy home, but you know, it's more to be good sportsmen on that day.

262
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:03,056
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's all about that and camaraderie.

263
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:08,258
[SPEAKER_18]: You look around the room, you see what Malden and Metro have made of, and we're a great two cities.

264
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:13,480
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got a great history, second oldest rivalry, contiguous rivalry going on here.

265
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So keep it going, represent your cities well, and I look forward to seeing y'all more in the very near future, probably tomorrow at the Metropolitan.

266
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,204

271
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,235
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're gonna have a great day on Thursday.

272
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:55,217
[SPEAKER_14]: You're holding together a great tradition, not only on football, but two communities that work together, that work hard to help our young people grow and develop and have a good future.

273
00:15:55,757 --> 00:16:06,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that each of you has your own aspirations as to what you wanna be when you grow up, when you get older and you go into the workforce and the like, but you're a part of something you'll never forget.

274
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,261
[SPEAKER_14]: This Thursday will be a big year, big day for you.

275
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,823
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll always have this in your mind.

276
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So get out there, have a great competition.

277
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:21,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that you'll do well on the field and let's hope for a really great game so that you can all remember it.

278
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:21,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.
