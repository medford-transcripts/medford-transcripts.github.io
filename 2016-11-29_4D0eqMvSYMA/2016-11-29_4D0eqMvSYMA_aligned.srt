00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:05,497
Welcome to the Mustang Report!

2
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,942
Hi, this is Lydia Ryan from the Mustang Report and I'm here with the Stang.

3
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:40,566
And today we're going to be asking him a few questions just about what he does daily at the high school.

4
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:42,769
What sporting events are your favorite to go to?

5
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,176
I'd say ones that are close quarters, indoors, because everybody's really close together and it's fun to get everybody pumped up.

6
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,640
And what are your methods to getting the crowd pumped up?

7
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,261
Loud.

8
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:57,903
And that's it.

9
00:00:59,028 --> 00:00:59,888
Just being loud?

10
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:00,528
Yeah.

11
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:01,729
All right.

12
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,570
What was the biggest event that you've been to this year?

13
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,430
I don't really know.

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,031
There's a lot of them that I've been to.

15
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,512
Do you try to go regularly to each event?

16
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,092
Yeah, I try.

17
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:15,152
It's kind of difficult.

18
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,233
How is the crowd when you don't make it to an event?

19
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,694
I'm sure they have as much spirit as they always do.

20
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:23,575
Are you sure about that?

21
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,195
I mean, I'd hope.

22
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you for the inspiring advice, and this is Lydia Ryan signing off.

23
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,103
Hi, I'm Cariann Lacharis, and I'm here with the Mustang Report.

24
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:38,348
I'm here with Mr. Maloney, and we're just going to ask you a few questions on how the fall sports season went.

25
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:39,629
How do you think the outcome was?

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,971
We had a pretty successful fall.

27
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,773
Again, our kids worked very hard.

28
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:47,335
We were fortunate with some great facilities.

29
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:52,269
We had the girls soccer team win the GBL championship.

30
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,890
The girls volleyball won the GBL championship.

31
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,251
Golf also won the GBL championship.

32
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:04,275
Football made the tournament for the first time since the new MIA existence.

33
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:08,276
And the boys soccer also went to the state tournament and did very well.

34
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,938
So we're very happy with the outcome.

35
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:13,599
We've had great support from the band and the cheerleaders as well.

36
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,096
I understand a lot of the teams are going into the new conference.

37
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:21,960
How do you think that's going to affect the outcome in the sports team's record?

38
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,982
It's going to be a challenge.

39
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:26,064
We're finally going to have a league to call home.

40
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,225
The Northeast Conference will be starting in the spring of 2017.

41
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:33,029
There's 16 teams, so it's going to be very competitive.

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,474
Our coaches and our kids are going to have to work very hard to stay at a competitive level.

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,913
How do you think the outcome of the Thanksgiving football game is going to turn out this year?

44
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,534
Do you think we're finally going to beat Malden?

45
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:49,138
Yeah, we won over there two years ago, so we're looking to do it again.

46
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:52,481
This is the 129th, so the boys will be ready.

47
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:56,365
Coach Nassimento and his staff have done a great job with the kids.

48
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,506
They've been very competitive.

49
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:58,807
They're putting a lot of points up.

50
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,691
So we're hoping we go over to W. Do you think you could predict the score?

51
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:07,780
I'm going to say we're going to beat Marlin 42 to 28.

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,682
We'll hold you to that.

53
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:14,946
Hi, this is Lydia Ryan reporting with the Mustang News and I'm here today with Mr. Nass to talk about Thanksgiving.

54
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,908
So, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

55
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:29,299
Well, I mean we have the big game in the morning and then hopefully after a big win I will be going home and we are actually going to host Thanksgiving this year for the first time.

56
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:31,642
So cool.

57
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:33,844
So what are you looking forward to most?

58
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:36,726
Is it the football game or eating with your family?

59
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:44,554
The football game is a big, big part of our Thanksgiving tradition, and it's one of my favorite parts of the day.

60
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:50,820
But honestly, just getting everyone together, especially at our new house, will be exciting, and that's my favorite part.

61
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:55,044
So what does your family typically eat on Thanksgiving?

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,665
You know, I mean, we got the turkey, which is pretty standard on Thanksgiving.

63
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:04,270
And then just a bunch of those usual sides that we got.

64
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,052
I mean, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce.

65
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,474
Um, you know, gravy, all that sort of stuff.

66
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:13,256
This is, you know, we're in the middle of a Thanksgiving interview here.

67
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:14,756
That's fine.

68
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:15,416
Okay.

69
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:19,498
So he can, he can actually, you can probably interview him as well on this, right?

70
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:20,678
At the same time, get him out of the way.

71
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,160
Um, but you know, one of my favorite things is, you know, we got to have pumpkin pie.

72
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,621
That's, it's, it's delicious.

73
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:30,182
So you might have to zoom out a little bit so that you get all of us in this picture.

74
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:30,402
Right.

75
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:31,383
All right.

76
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:34,444
So question for both of you, is it called sauce or gravy?

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,642
That's a, that's a, that tends to be a huge debate.

78
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,183
Uh, not with my family.

79
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:46,026
I mean, um, but with, with a lot of people that are, you know, that are out there, I'll get down in the frame for you.

80
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:46,586
Thanks.

81
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,008
Um, to me, I'm cool with gravy.

82
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,469
I mean, I've always called it gravy.

83
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,711
I'm, I don't know.

84
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,654
We talking like red sauce that goes on pasta, turkey.

85
00:04:58,694 --> 00:04:59,174
That's gravy.

86
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:01,175
So we can both agree it's gravy.

87
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:04,237
And what is your favorite dessert?

88
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:07,634
That's tough.

89
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:08,355
There's a lot.

90
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,097
There's a lot out there.

91
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:12,059
I think pumpkin pie, though.

92
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,202
It's unbelievable, and it's a must-have.

93
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,548
Not a huge pumpkin pie fan.

94
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,330
I used to be...

95
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:25,678
But then I realized that it's not really my thing.

96
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:31,702
Very boring guy, go for some apple pie.

97
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:37,907
Sometimes, who knows, maybe some pumpkin roll, but not pumpkin pie.

98
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:42,790
It's questionable, but everyone's entitled to their own opinion, I guess.

99
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,892
So for sides, is it mashed potatoes or stuffing?

100
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:46,752
Which is your favorite?

101
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:47,733
100% stuffing.

102
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:47,873
No.

103
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:53,249
No, it's a giant pile of mashed potatoes.

104
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:59,031
You take all the vegetables, you throw it all in there, throw some gravy on top, and just eat it with a spoon.

105
00:05:59,131 --> 00:05:59,991
Don't even use a fork.

106
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,733
And do you both eat the turkey, or would you rather something like ham?

107
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:07,814
Turkey.

108
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:10,775
Turkey every time.

109
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:14,476
Ham's great, but if I had to choose, I'm taking turkey.

110
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:19,058
Okay, and for our last question, can you do your best imitation of a turkey?

111
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,003
Best imitation of a turkey.

112
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,725
Wow, this is going to be great.

113
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,169
Yeah, I guess, right?

114
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,931
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

115
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:32,792
I know you can do better than that.

116
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,334
That's all I got.

117
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:34,814
Nothing?

118
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:35,735
Can you top that?

119
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,296
No, I can't top that.

120
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,198
It's just gobble, gobble.

121
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,159
The real turkeys don't even do that.

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,221
I see them every morning on my drive to work.

123
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:44,943
They just stand in the middle of the road.

124
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:46,404
What noise do they make?

125
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,677
I don't put my window down because they're aggressive birds.

126
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:53,041
I don't want them to attack me or peck my eyes out.

127
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:53,601
They're tall.

128
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,263
I mean, they could poke in the window.

129
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:55,984
Nah, I'm all set.

130
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:58,266
I saw a turkey attack an SUV today.

131
00:06:59,587 --> 00:06:59,948
Where?

132
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,390
Highland Ave in Winchester.

133
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,391
I see it every morning.

134
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,033
They attacked my uncle the other time.

135
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,674
They're aggressive creatures.

136
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,176
They're very territorial.

137
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,604
All right, Aaron, I wish you both luck on your football game on Thanksgiving, and I hope you have a great turnout.

138
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,386
Thank you for the interview.

139
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:18,547
City of Ryan, signing off.

140
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,710
So, Mrs. Dorsey, what's your favorite dessert for Thanksgiving?

141
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:29,795
Well, my favorite dessert for Thanksgiving is a lot of the typical ones that you will see on every Thanksgiving table.

142
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:30,836
I love apple pie.

143
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,297
I love pumpkin pie.

144
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:36,160
My family's favorite is chocolate cream pie.

145
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,833
and banana coconut custard pie.

146
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:41,334
What's your favorite dessert?

147
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:44,457
My favorite dessert on Thanksgiving would have to be apple pie.

148
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,218
What are you doing this Thanksgiving?

149
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:49,241
I'm going over my in-laws for Thanksgiving.

150
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:54,765
I love turkey and we're going to try to make a turkey together and I'll bring some goodies.

151
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:57,627
We celebrate three cultures that day.

152
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:04,313
The American traditions along with the Italian because my husband is Italian and if I don't have pasta

153
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,698
everyone will be a small revolution in the house.

154
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
And, of course, the Puerto Rican tradition.

155
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,504
So I have the bearnia, which is the pork, and I make the rice and all the trimmings.

156
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,465
And then friends stop in for dessert.

157
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,788
So it's usually a long night, but it's wonderful.

158
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:21,608
It's a great time.

159
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,191
Hello, this is DP reporting here with Ms.

160
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:25,651
LeClaire.

161
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:26,252
So, Ms.

162
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,993
LeClaire, what are your plans for Thanksgiving?

163
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,536
I am going to spend it with my sister and my whole family.

164
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,137
We're going to eat lots of turkey and stuff it.

165
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:34,889
Wonderful.

166
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,810
And we have just a quick question for you.

167
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,431
Do you call it sauce or gravy?

168
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,292
Oh, I'm a gravy person.

169
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,133
I agree with you on that one.

170
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,734
And last question is do you like chicken or turkey better?

171
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:48,795
There's a difference?

172
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,577
Like in general?

173
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:55,438
Turkey?

174
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:57,478
Good answer.

175
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,240
This is DP here with Miss LeClaire.

176
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,120
Thank you, Miss LeClaire.

177
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:08,368
do you know or do you help out your mom when she's like cooking or like your dad or just your family members?

178
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:12,531
I usually help out my mom and my grandmother when they're like cooking the turkey.

179
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,432
I usually help them make an apple pie.

180
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,654
That's that's all I do usually.

181
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,656
Do you know what time they put in the turkey in the morning?

182
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:27,565
My grandmother usually, and my mom usually wake up around like 6.30 to put it in, because we usually eat early.

183
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:29,166
We don't do dinner, we do lunch.

184
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,187
That's a good idea.

185
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,368
We're going to move over here to Dora.

186
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:39,671
Do you usually help out, or do you just sit back and just wait for the food to be ready?

187
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:47,756
As much as I would love to sit back, my mother would not allow that, so I help her out in the kitchen, help my dad start a fire sometimes.

188
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:50,677
So how long does the food last?

189
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:53,479
Not very long.

190
00:09:53,879 --> 00:10:00,783
There are leftovers for the week's lunches, but with my brother in the house it doesn't last very long.

191
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,585
So Nick, it's your turn.

192
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,628
What do you like to eat the most?

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,382
Um, I'm a big turkey guy myself.

194
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:13,303
I like turkey.

195
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:17,765
But every year we do not only just like the Thanksgiving dinner at my family.

196
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:21,968
We also do a Thanksgiving lunch where like, we're also all Italian.

197
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:28,012
So my uncle makes like a huge batch of like raviolis and like a lasagna.

198
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:35,097
And so that's probably my favorite meal of the of the year because he he gets it from this place Anna's in Medford.

199
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,319
And they're literally to die for.

200
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,128
What about dessert?

201
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:49,452
Desserts, we do kind of the same idea, but my great-grandmother, who's 98 years old, is super talented with making pies.

202
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:54,014
She makes like eight different pies every single Thanksgiving.

203
00:10:54,054 --> 00:11:01,036
She makes pumpkin pie, apple custard pie, or something like that, and then your traditional apple pie.

204
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:05,598
And then she makes this one with whipped cream and some other stuff.

205
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:08,279
I don't really eat the pies too much, but that's what we do for dessert.

206
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,844
Do you help out like cooking or picking up the dishes?

207
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:21,290
No, I like to sit down, wait for the food and then afterwards I take a nap and then afterwards I do help clean up the dishes afterwards though, yeah.

208
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,393
So I know my family, they're like huge like football like maniacs.

209
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:29,035
Do you guys usually like watch any sports or?

210
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:37,200
Yeah, usually it would be my grandpa and my brother and I and we'll be on the couch and they'll be watching it and I'll be kind of you know falling asleep, yeah.

211
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:42,256
Hi, this is Nick Kenison with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with Miss Timmons, a substitute at Medford High School.

212
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,297
Miss Timmons, what do you do for Thanksgiving?

213
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,339
We usually have people over to our house.

214
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,380
My mom does the turkey.

215
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,980
It's a good time.

216
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:56,263
What is your favorite meal, or what's your favorite food item as far as Thanksgiving goes?

217
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,384
That'd have to be the stuffing.

218
00:11:59,064 --> 00:11:59,624
I go wild for it.

219
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,105
Or brie mashed potatoes.

220
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:03,086
Real good.

221
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,107
What are brie mashed potatoes?

222
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,448
Mashed potatoes with brie cheese in them.

223
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:09,625
Oh, makes sense, okay.

224
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:13,688
What is your favorite Thanksgiving dessert, or if you do any?

225
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:16,430
I make a mean pecan pie.

226
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,830
I like to eat, yeah.

227
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:20,072
Pecan pie is pretty tasty.

228
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:29,218
And lastly, I'm not sure if you're following football, but what is your prediction for the Medford versus Malden Thanksgiving Day football game?

229
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:31,759
Gonna do great!

230
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:34,781
Thank you, Mrs. Timmons.

231
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,383
This has been Nick Hennessey with the Mustang Report, and back to you.

232
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,858
Mr. X, what are your plans for this year's Thanksgiving?

233
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:49,627
Well, like every Thanksgiving, we stay at my grandma's and she just cooks us a meal and we have a good time.

234
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:53,472
Next question is, you're participating in the Mustang Movember contest.

235
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,874
Who do you think is going to win this year?

236
00:12:55,795 --> 00:13:03,202
Well, looking at the jars, it looks like Mr. Drowski has a commanding lead over many of the other participants, so I'm going to go with him.

237
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,543
Mr. Drowski.

238
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:07,306
And what is your favorite Thanksgiving food item?

239
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,186
Has to be turkey.

240
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:08,867
Has to be turkey.

241
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:09,868
White meat, though.

242
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:10,709
I don't like dark meat.

243
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:11,489
Happy Thanksgiving!

244
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,679
I want to welcome you to John Brewer's Tavern.

245
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,760
My name is Bill Honeycutt.

246
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,021
I'm the owner of the restaurant.

247
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,604
This is our ninth annual football lunch.

248
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,646
We're happy to have both teams here.

249
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:39,331
I just want to wish you luck on Thursday, but more importantly, a happy Thanksgiving.

250
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:46,258
We are lucky enough to have the two mayors, the mayor of Medford, Stephanie Berg, and the mayor of Malden, Gary Christensen, here today.

251
00:13:52,773 --> 00:14:02,476
Good morning and good afternoon everyone.

252
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm Gary Christensen, Mayor of the City of Malden and I'm here just to really say, you know, good luck and thank you for being the caliber of students that I've been able to get to know over the past couple of years.

253
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:20,973
For the past several months, everybody's been talking about, geez, what's the future of our country after the presidential election?

254
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:26,678
And I tell anybody, listen, based on my getting to know all of you, I really feel good about where we're going.

255
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:30,622
So again, good luck and happy Thanksgiving to you all.

256
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:43,267
Thank you all for being here today and thanks to Billy Honeycutt, our favorite alumni for hosting us today.

257
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,748
I graduated with this guy and his wife Sue.

258
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:50,871
So even though we're not on the Malden line, we're really in Medford, the heart of Medford here.

259
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,672
But I want to wish you all a great Thanksgiving Day.

260
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:54,953
Good luck out on the field.

261
00:14:55,393 --> 00:15:00,955
we'd want to bring the trophy home, but you know, it's more to be good sportsmen on that day.

262
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:03,056
So it's all about that and camaraderie.

263
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:08,258
You look around the room, you see what Malden and Metro have made of, and we're a great two cities.

264
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:13,480
We've got a great history, second oldest rivalry, contiguous rivalry going on here.

265
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,943
So keep it going, represent your cities well, and I look forward to seeing y'all more in the very near future, probably tomorrow at the Metropolitan.

266
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,204
We'll be out there at the

267
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:25,606
big event, the big event tomorrow.

268
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,789
So go get them, have fun, and enjoy your Thanksgiving holidays.

269
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:36,397
We also have our superintendent, Roy Bilson.

270
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:41,155
So, congratulations to both teams.

271
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,235
I know you're gonna have a great day on Thursday.

272
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:55,217
You're holding together a great tradition, not only on football, but two communities that work together, that work hard to help our young people grow and develop and have a good future.

273
00:15:55,757 --> 00:16:06,679
I know that each of you has your own aspirations as to what you wanna be when you grow up, when you get older and you go into the workforce and the like, but you're a part of something you'll never forget.

274
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,261
This Thursday will be a big year, big day for you.

275
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,823
You'll always have this in your mind.

276
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,565
So get out there, have a great competition.

277
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:21,630
I'm sure that you'll do well on the field and let's hope for a really great game so that you can all remember it.

278
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:21,990
Good luck.
