1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:00,611
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:03,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can get started.

3
00:00:04,114 --> 00:00:05,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start with roll call.

4
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a while, so remind me if I miss anything.

5
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:13,601
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll start with roll, and if people trickle in, we'll make sure they're added to our list.

6
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:16,903
[SPEAKER_10]: But just one by one, we'll go down the line.

7
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:17,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Lois.

8
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:22,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji.

9
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:23,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Here.

10
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:24,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

12
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:28,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not see Loretta.

13
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:31,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen?

14
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:32,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

15
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:34,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke?

16
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:35,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

17
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

18
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:40,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Martha, I do not see in our list here.

19
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, also not.

20
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob?

21
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:46,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

22
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:47,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Jessica?

23
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:51,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Not seeing.

24
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:52,737
[SPEAKER_10]: John?

25
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:55,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Not in my list.

26
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:56,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Will is here.

27
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,421
[SPEAKER_10]: And Paul?

28
00:00:59,682 --> 00:00:59,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

29
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:01,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic.

30
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:03,319
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Did everyone have a chance to review our minutes from last month?

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I do have two minor corrections, if I may.

33
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:18,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

34
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:34,065
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Zero Waste Medford from Provisa, the third bullet down, last sentence,

35
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:47,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to clarify, she doesn't want compostable bags, I believe it was, to be the new single-use plastics, but compostables is okay.

36
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wanted to edit the

37
00:01:55,188 --> 00:02:02,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Eighth bullet down, Luke said ordinances that require usability and recyclability are useful.

38
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:17,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd like to have that more appropriately state can be effective, are useful is very vague and probably not correct.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Noted.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,862
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

41
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:23,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

42
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:24,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Barry.

43
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I notified Teresa, but I didn't hear back.

44
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:38,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to make sure, towards the very end of the minutes, there is a reference to a person that doesn't exist.

45
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:42,587
[SPEAKER_02]: The name is Matt Barlow, not Arlo.

46
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:42,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

47
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,319
[SPEAKER_10]: to fix that.

48
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to know.

49
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make sure, yep, I got my notes here.

50
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Matt Barlow, good to know.

51
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:00,965
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anything else?

52
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, let's

53
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:17,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make a move to a motion to accept the minutes as edited.

54
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:18,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I second that.

55
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:21,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

56
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go down the line quickly.

57
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:26,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Lois?

58
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:28,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

59
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji?

60
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:31,575
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed that meeting.

61
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:31,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Barry?

62
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:31,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

63
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:40,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen?

64
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:41,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

65
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:44,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke?

66
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:45,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

67
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:48,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob?

68
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

69
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:52,647
[SPEAKER_10]: John?

70
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, sorry.

71
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Will, I will abstain, I was not present.

72
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul?

73
00:03:58,911 --> 00:03:59,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

74
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:04,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect and I think we had 1 new member just join.

75
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:10,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a guest guest, so with 6 votes, the eyes have it.

76
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,544
[SPEAKER_10]: We accept the minutes and we can move on.

77
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Find a little bit of note taking.

78
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Alicia will be able to assist.

79
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,811
[SPEAKER_10]: We have 3.

80
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Choices that had come up for our next meeting date.

81
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:35,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the 1st, Monday of November is, I believe, Veterans Day.

82
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:44,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will not be having a session on that day, but instead we have November 6th, 12th, and 13th.

83
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:56,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if we had the exact numbers on who voted for each, but that is in our list here as the 3 viable dates.

84
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just note that those dates are November 6th is a Wednesday.

85
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, a Wednesday, a Tuesday and a Wednesday.

86
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, 7th and 13th are Tuesday and Wednesday.

87
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:15,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

88
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So a little bit different, same time, different day.

89
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:24,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be okay with the 6th or 13th myself.

90
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to meet the day after election day.

91
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:39,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that doesn't mean that you can't, but I don't want to.

92
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:40,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I would agree with that.

93
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:41,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

94
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:43,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps the 13th.

95
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:51,100
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, any opposed to.

96
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Next session being Wednesday, the 13th.

97
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,972
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'll just make sure that's noted November 13th.

98
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:05,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll see you all there.

99
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:08,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

100
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:11,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we can get into the nitty gritty.

101
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:15,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to throw it over to our administrative staff.

102
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:17,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we have some updates.

103
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

104
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:30,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I was clicking around at calendars and notes, and I couldn't find the Zoom window.

105
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Modern day problems.

106
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:35,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume you mean me.

107
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:41,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis does not have updates for you, but I have a bunch of updates that Brenda left to share with you.

108
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:47,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also, in one of these many windows, had the agenda open for this meeting.

109
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:53,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you looking for, no, the notes she gave me were monthly updates on initiatives, so that's later.

110
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The in terms of administrative updates.

111
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:03,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I have administrative and then into harvester energy.

112
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:11,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Often we have administrative updates and I'm trying to think if we have any good ones for you, I. I'm thinking about the timing of your last meeting.

113
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:17,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie for Sina, who has just joined us on the call this evening.

114
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:24,456
[SPEAKER_09]: She's actually the new head clerk in our office and so she was an intern with us for 14 or 15 months.

115
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she was hired to into the clerk position.

116
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:35,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that may have actually happened since your last meeting or her first day was since your last meeting.

117
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:38,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So welcome, Jackie.

118
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:42,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I don't remember last meeting, so maybe people remember me.

119
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:43,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.

120
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:50,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you clarify, is that head clerk for City Hall or head clerk for Planning and Development?

121
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:51,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our office.

122
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:55,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the clerk position in our office, but the title is head clerk.

123
00:07:56,036 --> 00:08:03,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Frankly, I need an office manager, and I think of it as an office manager, but that's a different level in the system.

124
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:08,323
[SPEAKER_09]: and they would only approve the head clerk level and not the office manager level.

125
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:12,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, she's the head of herself.

126
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:17,365
[SPEAKER_09]: She kind of manages the intern stuff and she's the office manager.

127
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:20,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's actually a great way to think of it.

128
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:27,946
[SPEAKER_09]: She does a lot of all the finances and all the phone desk answering, and she's responsible to make sure the phone gets answered.

129
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's not there.

130
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:40,342
[SPEAKER_09]: One other, in case any of you tend to visit City Hall, the elevator has been out for quite a while undergoing major repairs.

131
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It works again effective today.

132
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,989
[SPEAKER_09]: It beeps now, it's interesting.

133
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully this will be way more reliable, but if anybody is reliant on an elevator to visit our office, you can now get there.

134
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:58,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Lisa, this is Bob.

135
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,616
[SPEAKER_11]: What's this RFP about redeveloping city-owned parcels?

136
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to talk about that now or later.

137
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe later if that's okay.

138
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Less administrative, more policy.

139
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it on the list for the policy updates.

140
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:18,051
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so I'll mute, and I think Jackie, are you ready?

141
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,155
[SPEAKER_09]: You can sit, but Jackie is prepared to talk more about Harvester Energy Festival.

142
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just so you have coming up on the 19th.

143
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:40,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some of you are going to be volunteering and I can send a volunteer sign up sheet if any of you are interested in volunteering for the event and, you know, manning your table or just doing general setup and breakdown.

144
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:45,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can answer any questions about, you know, details for the day of.

145
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:48,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to send out emails in the next week

146
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:54,972
[SPEAKER_07]: or two just about, you know, details about when to come, what the sign-in process is going to look like and everything like that.

147
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,956
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm happy to answer any questions.

148
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:12,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And traditionally, I think most of you all, I was looking to see who's on here, knows this, nobody's that new, but this committee has co-hosted this event.

149
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:25,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think in recent years, it's been more and more the staff running it and less and less this committee, but we really would love to have all of your help for various jobs.

150
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:31,175
[SPEAKER_09]: If any of you have favorite jobs that you like to do, you should make sure that Jackie knows that as we're setting things up.

151
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:37,239
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, John Rogers directs traffic and helps with that.

152
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:50,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie's done a number of updates this year, including ordering signage that's made that says things like parking and arrows.

153
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to tell them about the signs?

154
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:53,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, yeah.

155
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for you to bear that.

156
00:10:56,235 --> 00:11:02,056
[SPEAKER_07]: better directions or like last year we had so if you were at the event last year, we had.

157
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:07,798
[SPEAKER_07]: go, it was called green team and they basically do electronics recycling, things like that.

158
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:10,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a paper shredding service as well.

159
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had them in that parking lot right next to community garden.

160
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:16,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And it obviously causes like a traffic backup.

161
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:19,105
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, that's just the best spot for it.

162
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:24,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But we really wanted to make sure that we have handicapped parking access.

163
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to kind of be really sure this year

164
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:37,275
[SPEAKER_07]: that we almost have like some parking volunteers that are directing, okay, this is for recycling, this is for the paper shredding, and this is handicap parking.

165
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:52,818
[SPEAKER_07]: This direction, you know, going to the Hormel Stadium and the front parking lot of the school is gonna be just like general festival parking because those people can walk, but we really wanna prioritize that the handicap parking is available.

166
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:55,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so this year there's gonna be some,

167
00:11:56,427 --> 00:12:07,149
[SPEAKER_07]: yard signs that are just making that clear on the way in, as well as we want to have some volunteers that are, you know, if people roll down their window and are stopping and are confused, that's making that clear.

168
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think some people just were thinking, oh, there isn't even any handicap parking, it's all blocked.

169
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one of the things.

170
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:25,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, because of that, we also wanted to be sure that if we're having some, like basically three access points to the festival, like coming from that front, that parking lot, we're going to have the

171
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:34,444
[SPEAKER_07]: the electronics recycling and the paper shredding coming from the Hormel Stadium parking lot and coming from that little parking lot in the front of the Midland School.

172
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:38,327
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanna make sure that everybody knows which way to walk to the festival.

173
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:42,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's just some like walking direction signage and some larger posters.

174
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are all some things that we have this year just to try and help it run a little more smoothly.

175
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:54,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And also some signs for within the festival, just pointing people to the food and the beer garden because

176
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a giant expanse at this point.

177
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, I want to make sure people know what's going on.

178
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:10,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's, um, Brenda also organized like an EV showcase with some of the cars that we're going to put right near the electronics recycling in the grass.

179
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'll be cool.

180
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots of cool stuff.

181
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:15,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make sure everybody can access it.

182
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:20,385
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a great idea.

183
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:21,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the signage.

184
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:23,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Jackie.

185
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I volunteered for setup.

186
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:27,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

187
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:30,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So, where should I expect to park.

188
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,811
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good.

189
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:37,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we were thinking, Alicia you can like add on to me with this but.

190
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:42,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we thinking that those people will probably park in the general parking?

191
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know... So we would rather that you park further away and then walk in.

192
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:55,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you park in the lot, so we're going to close the lot right next to the festival very early.

193
00:13:57,423 --> 00:14:12,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly even the night before so it doesn't fill up with parking parked cars that we then have to move, because there will be things other things going on in that area that day I tried to get baseball and soccer canceled but I was told no go on that.

194
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:24,960
[SPEAKER_09]: So there will be other activities, but we need the lot available for the recycling process and to pull the cars in off the road for that.

195
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need to park sort of out front.

196
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:34,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And frankly, if you parked up close, and then we would tell you before the festival starts to go get your car and move it and put it back out front.

197
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:38,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to park in front of the school.

198
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

199
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

200
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

201
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:41,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

202
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: off of Salem or whatever that is.

203
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:47,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

204
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,494
[SPEAKER_09]: You can park in front of Andrews or McGlynn.

205
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:56,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually expect parking in front of Andrews to get filled up because they're going to have soccer over there and baseball at some point.

206
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:06,808
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nicer if you can park in front of McGlynn, frankly, because that's leaving those spots over there for the kids who are playing over there.

207
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:09,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

208
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,772
[SPEAKER_07]: In front of our base parking lot.

209
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:22,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to mention there are a bunch of jobs that we often so we'll have we'll need people to help staff check in tables.

210
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,223
[SPEAKER_09]: We need help with setup and breakdown and.

211
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:32,216
[SPEAKER_09]: we may need help with like directions and stuff.

212
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:38,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to think what other jobs, we're not doing the green awards, so we won't have anything around that.

213
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not doing a raffle, so we won't help with that.

214
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,383
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll really simplify a lot of the volunteering.

215
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:54,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will have student volunteers, but we really, my experience has been that we need adults with the students.

216
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:58,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So what might happen is that we might ask you to be responsible for a check-in table,

217
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:08,476
[SPEAKER_09]: and give you like four or five students who would also be there that would rotate through, and you might need to just check in and check on them.

218
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:19,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But there needs to be like an adult who is thinking about that and them during the course of the... And I see there are a bunch of questions, so I'll shut up and let people ask questions.

219
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:24,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Jill Feldman has had their hand up for a while.

220
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:25,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

221
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just you're muted.

222
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're muted.

223
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:38,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with Mothers Out Front, and this will be the third year that we've participated.

224
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:49,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want you to know that it's an invaluable tool for us to promote climate messages, and also for us to recruit new members.

225
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:58,381
[SPEAKER_06]: were there three years ago, we've started a chapter in Medford.

226
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:03,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't know if you just wonder sometimes like, you know, whether things have an impact, definitely.

227
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,924
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a really good festival.

228
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:08,305
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

229
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,847
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate hearing that because the staff work really hard.

230
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:14,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, that is great to hear.

231
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic, I see Kathleen as well.

232
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:26,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to ask, what about the folks that are tabling?

233
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they park?

234
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:37,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that'll be the same as, you know, that sort of like the front parking lot of McGlynn or the Horn Mill.

235
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:44,792
[SPEAKER_07]: One, just because we want to keep that rear parking lot, which is next to the community garden open for the recycling and for handicap parking.

236
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:46,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

237
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless there is a handicap parking need.

238
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you could park there and move your car, which they've had people do in the past.

239
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:55,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, Alicia, is that?

240
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:56,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

241
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:59,802
[SPEAKER_09]: If you park there to unload, we help you unload.

242
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:10,525
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the other thing that we do need a lot of setup help because it's great to help somebody unload quickly enough that they can then go move their car out of the way of the recycling setup.

243
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:19,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I also think that a lot of our student volunteers aren't coming until the festival technically starts at 12, which is when they were available.

244
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:26,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So it definitely would be really, really helpful if more of you guys could volunteer for that setup period.

245
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,104
[SPEAKER_07]: The student volunteers probably had difficulty anyways helping move things around.

246
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them are just middle schoolers.

247
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking that maybe we'll even have some of the interns

248
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:46,224
[SPEAKER_07]: with some of them and we're going to have them, we're going to get them some sidewalk chalk and have them draw some directions on the sidewalks and keep things like that too, so.

249
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:48,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So when do you need us?

250
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:54,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're sure we're kind of doing it in shifts this year.

251
00:18:54,487 --> 00:19:00,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I did sort of like a 10 to 12, um, 12 to two 30 and a two 30 to four.

252
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:09,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can do multiple shifts, but for the setup, like if you guys were there around 10 AM between 10 and 12, that would be really, really helpful.

253
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:16,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually we set up the tables at 10 and we ask the exhibitors to come at 11.

254
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:20,528
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's sort of like a wave of like, there's nothing to do.

255
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:21,989
[SPEAKER_09]: The tables are here.

256
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there's a lot to do.

257
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it settles down again.

258
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the exhibitors start showing up and then there's a lot to do.

259
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the event starts.

260
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:32,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's less to do.

261
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:38,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And then people are tired and they need backup at the check-in tables and stuff because they need to rotate through.

262
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So it kind of comes and goes in waves.

263
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:47,175
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have three check-in tables.

264
00:19:47,215 --> 00:20:04,902
[SPEAKER_07]: We think I'm going to do some layout stuff in the next couple of days, but we wanted to cover that back, that area like the school and then the wind turbine and the bathrooms, that walkway coming from the Hormel parking to try and

265
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:12,472
[SPEAKER_07]: intercept some people that might be coming on from there or from like the park, because it's just a big festival.

266
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:22,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like we're going to have two bands, we're going to have beer garden, food, ice cream, obviously everything else we talked about.

267
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:26,145
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got like 60 tables for this year's festival.

268
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:27,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty big.

269
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:50,337
[SPEAKER_09]: So for those of you who are curious who remember, we'll continue to have tables along the walkway along the school, but that instead of lining the walkway to the wind turbine, the tables will come in down in front of the school and then into the playground and through the playground and there'll be a lot of tables through there.

270
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:59,908
[SPEAKER_09]: and then out the other side of the playground, which is where you will then see the electric cars staged and the beer garden.

271
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,471
[SPEAKER_09]: The beer garden needs to be like on the other side of the playground.

272
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:07,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that would be the way over to the wind turbine.

273
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,637
[SPEAKER_09]: to like do wind turbine tours.

274
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:12,839
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's a new stage.

275
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:16,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the music will be up on the stage.

276
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a turf field in front of the stage.

277
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:24,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where we're planning to put the knuckle bones from the Medford Family Network, the kids activities.

278
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,506
[SPEAKER_09]: The layout will work a little differently and the flow will be different.

279
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:37,768
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I'd love to get feedback on after the fact is, does this work?

280
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:39,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we have done it differently?

281
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:51,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you're there, if you haven't seen it, there are these new rain gardens that are awesome, but they're really in the way of where we used to do the festival and that path isn't still there the same way.

282
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:53,711
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to do it.

283
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:55,072
[SPEAKER_09]: over there.

284
00:21:55,092 --> 00:22:05,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we had tables along the path between the school and the wind turbine, they'd be down low, behind and beneath the stage.

285
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:11,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So you would really feel like the festival had turned your back on you if you're in that group of tables.

286
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why we're sort of looking at this different arrangement.

287
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:26,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking about having the Green Energy Consumer Alliance closest to the door with the bathrooms, because that will be the most direct route to the wind turbine.

288
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:33,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So people could gather there kind of behind the stage to go for a wind turbine tour, and then they could walk up that path.

289
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:41,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you, there's a ribbon cutting for the Micklin Playground tomorrow afternoon.

290
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,315
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome to come to that and you're welcome to go by at any time to sort of see what we're talking about.

291
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:53,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow at 3.30.

292
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Kathleen has her hand up.

293
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,750
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.

294
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,591
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

295
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:13,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to ask one question.

296
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:22,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know if there is a football game that might be taking up some of the McGlynn Middle School?

297
00:23:22,074 --> 00:23:23,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely no.

298
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:30,195
[SPEAKER_09]: They kept things out of Hormel Stadium for us.

299
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:31,381
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

300
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:32,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

301
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We could use the Hormel parking lot as well.

302
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

303
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:43,286
[SPEAKER_09]: If you feel like you can, parking at Hormel is good because you know that visitors want to park closer.

304
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:45,347
[SPEAKER_09]: They decide it's too far and they're not staying.

305
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:47,467
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

306
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:54,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing is my daughter has some testing that day and I will be occupied in the morning.

307
00:23:54,872 --> 00:24:00,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not be able to come until probably around noon.

308
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So apologies, I won't be there for the setup.

309
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:09,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jackie's gonna circulate the link to the signup.

310
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you didn't actually make a form this time, right?

311
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,046
[SPEAKER_09]: You just asked people to add their names to the spreadsheet.

312
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:24,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I can make a form, but Brenda had just sent that off and it seemed to work okay for people, but yeah, okay, I'll just send along what we had had.

313
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:28,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there all day, so use me as you wish.

314
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

315
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:39,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a great networking event.

316
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:46,561
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually think that we're going to have a much better turnout from Tufts students than ever before for two reasons.

317
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:54,148
[SPEAKER_09]: One is that Jackie has used a lot of her connections at Tufts and advertised it as a networking event.

318
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,651
[SPEAKER_09]: That excites students.

319
00:24:57,132 --> 00:24:59,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other is, Jackie, tell them about the shuttle.

320
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:00,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

321
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:11,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So this year, so last year, Loretta had kind of last minute, um, organized a free shuttle with Magan transport, which was such a great idea, but it kind of came together.

322
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,620
[SPEAKER_07]: So last minute and people didn't really know about it.

323
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:23,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this year we're still going to do a last leg of outreach because I'm just finalizing sort of a little schedule I made up with, um, Um, I was going to talk to him.

324
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:29,407
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like the transport owner, but basically the, it's going to be a free shuttle loop around Medford.

325
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,437
[SPEAKER_07]: to and from the festival.

326
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,819
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like about a 45-minute run.

327
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,422
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like adding traffic, so it could be less.

328
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:45,448
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to stop at, it's going to start in South Medford, like across from the Tufts Pool at the intersection of Main Street and Medford Street.

329
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:53,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it's going to go to the Tufts Community Center, and then the West Medford Community Center, and then the Senior Center in Medford Square, and then to the festival.

330
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:00,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of new, but we just really wanted to make it more accessible and it's also a sustainable way to get there.

331
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:05,099
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that's happening and then there's going to be one run.

332
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,623
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier in the morning directly from Tufts to the festival so we can get some more student exhibitors there.

333
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:22,288
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have more clubs coming this year and we've tried to get, just in trying to encourage the students to come because it's just such a great community event.

334
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:24,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the new thing.

335
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:29,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And stay tuned for the shuttle schedule details.

336
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:30,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on it.

337
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:34,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to send a link

338
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:38,831
[SPEAKER_07]: for this volunteering sign up.

339
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:49,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the ad, by the way, in the Tufts environmental bulletin that comes out.

340
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that today and it mentioned the shuttle.

341
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:56,985
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

342
00:26:57,446 --> 00:27:00,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've had some of the interns send that stuff out, which is great.

343
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sent in the chat a link to our spreadsheet.

344
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:15,454
[SPEAKER_07]: If it didn't, for some reason, show up on the right tab, which it should have, but it might not, if you go to the bottom, it'll have the tabs and it should say 2024 volunteering.

345
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, let me know.

346
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:33,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just sort of having you guys sign up on 2024 volunteering underneath the staff section.

347
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:45,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I also see Bob.

348
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I hope I don't jinx the event, but the long range forecast is currently favorable.

349
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:58,029
[SPEAKER_11]: with sun and cloud mix, and mid-60s is the temperature, so we'll see.

350
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:09,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to apologize that I have a wedding event that day, so I will not be able to attend, but I think the Green Energy Consumers Alliance person has been there so many years, they know how to do wind turbine tours.

351
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:10,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

352
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob, will this be actually the first festival you're ever missing?

353
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:16,134
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

354
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:17,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

355
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,981
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fluke event.

356
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:20,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Fluke wedding event.

357
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why they're doing this wedding in October, but they are.

358
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:26,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably because it's cheaper.

359
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,513
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I got married in November.

360
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right.

361
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:30,095
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

362
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:41,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other questions?

363
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:45,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think if there's anything else that you all don't even know to ask about.

364
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:50,846
[SPEAKER_09]: But there will be the electronics recycling, shredding, and textile donations again.

365
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: So the textile donations and shredding, we're arranging for, and so sometimes our volunteers help with that.

366
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,170
[SPEAKER_09]: The electronics recycling is being run by a professional company.

367
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,632
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we may be helping direct traffic, but I really don't expect us to be needed as part of that.

368
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they're really going to be hands on.

369
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,534
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll remember there have been years where we had to manage that.

370
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have to manage it.

371
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,335
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of the things I like.

372
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:26,578
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully you all got a flyer in your mailbox from National Grid that said electronics recycling at the Harvester Energy Festival.

373
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:29,659
[SPEAKER_09]: That was huge last year and they did it again this year.

374
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:39,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I did want to mention also about the shredding just because I just talked to the company that we're having this year just to get some details.

375
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:46,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put it on the website tomorrow, but just for any restrictions because the mailer did go out and I've gotten a few calls about it.

376
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:52,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Staples are fine, little paper clips are fine, even those little binder clips are fine.

377
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:57,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just no hard binding, no three-ring binding.

378
00:29:58,267 --> 00:29:59,628
[SPEAKER_07]: and nothing that isn't paper.

379
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:01,290
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the rules on that.

380
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:13,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I was going to talk about this with Alicia, but there's no restrictions really for the amount, but we could maybe set a limit for how many bankers boxes we're allowing per person.

381
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's an on-site shredder, so they're bringing their on-site shredding truck.

382
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:20,245
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't just take it away, it gets shredded on-site.

383
00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:34,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we usually have sort of said things like limit to three boxes a person, and that's mostly to avoid somebody showing up with like an office sort of stuff.

384
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:39,463
[SPEAKER_09]: In my experience, if the shredding truck fills up, then we're done.

385
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:44,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And that only happens if you have like a really steady stream the whole time.

386
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We've never had that happen.

387
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:50,887
[SPEAKER_09]: But if somebody shows up and is like dominating it, that's not fair.

388
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:55,829
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we might say three or five boxes, something like that is fine.

389
00:30:56,449 --> 00:31:07,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Max, because that allows us to look at the person who has 15 boxes or a whole truckload and say to them, you can wait till the end.

390
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:20,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Once all the regular people have done their shredding, if there's still space, you may shred, but you can't dominate and then we have 10 residents waiting their turns because of that.

391
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully makes sense.

392
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:25,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Kathleen.

393
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:31,296
[SPEAKER_00]: You're muted.

394
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:34,939
[SPEAKER_00]: You answered part of my question on the electric bill.

395
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:35,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

396
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything on the website?

397
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:42,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to look at that with the pricing for the electronics.

398
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:45,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I should.

399
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:46,227
[SPEAKER_07]: There should be.

400
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:49,098
[SPEAKER_11]: The flyer had prices.

401
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:55,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the card, but you know, I actually just got a list from the guy running it and I'm going to put it on tomorrow.

402
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to have one of the interns do it.

403
00:31:57,763 --> 00:31:59,624
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, there will be tomorrow.

404
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:00,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

405
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:02,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

406
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:12,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's like a rebate on dehumidifiers, so that's good.

407
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,347
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, any parting thoughts?

408
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:28,008
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, I'm going to throw it back to Alicia.

409
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, Jackie, sorry.

410
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I was just going to follow up.

411
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:46,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

412
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:49,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to get something for one second for them.

413
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:57,175
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we're going to move on to the policy updates the information that Brenda sent me.

414
00:32:58,156 --> 00:32:59,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a ton of different things.

415
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:13,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But why don't I start with the things off the top of my head because Bob was asking about the RFP, and I thought it was good to mention the ribbon cutting for our pop up park, and sort of like what all is going on with that.

416
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,747
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have been talking for many, many, many, many, many years about Medford Square.

417
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:29,558
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been many, many studies about Medford Square and what to do in the square and with the square and all of these parking lots and what we.

418
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:46,598
[SPEAKER_09]: have been we also last year had MAPC come do like an up refresh of like what is what are the interests what are the priorities of the city we what do we want to see um and so the answer really was housing

419
00:33:48,583 --> 00:34:03,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Realistically affordable housing and then for deed restricted affordable housing ground floor commercial to keep the ground floors activated and active and some sort of innovative approach to parking.

420
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:05,218
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we handle parking in the square?

421
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:10,123
[SPEAKER_09]: how do we make it better for the community?

422
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:15,144
[SPEAKER_09]: In order to do that, we've put out an RFP.

423
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:18,865
[SPEAKER_09]: We came to find a good developer to work with.

424
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:31,769
[SPEAKER_09]: We came to the decision, there was a lot of questions about selling the parcels versus leasing the parcels, and how do you do that so that it's cost-effective for developers so that they want to do it?

425
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:36,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And the answer to that, we've been told by all of our consultants, is a ninety nine year lease.

426
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,111
[SPEAKER_09]: So we retain ownership.

427
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:48,194
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't sell them, but we give them enough a long enough runway with the property so that it's cost effective.

428
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:59,597
[SPEAKER_09]: They can finance it and they can basically for I've been told that from the perspective of people who are financing it, ninety nine years is the same as selling it to them.

429
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:16,751
[SPEAKER_09]: We worked with Mass Development, which is a quasi-state agency, and they helped pay for a consultant who is helping to write the RFP, well, helped to write it, and is guiding us and advising us through the process.

430
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:26,634
[SPEAKER_09]: The RFP went out and the RFP both asks for price, like what would you pay for us annually?

431
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:33,445
[SPEAKER_09]: What community benefits will you provide?

432
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:37,747
[SPEAKER_09]: The selection process, we do not have to take the highest price.

433
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:53,636
[SPEAKER_09]: We will rank them and we can do a combination of community benefits versus dollars for the city because more affordable housing is a community benefit and public parking is a community benefit.

434
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:57,178
[SPEAKER_09]: We've suggested the city would like to see a supermarket in there.

435
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,619
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to see more community space.

436
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:07,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so all of those are things that we will then rank and rate and rank, um, for the.

437
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:13,063
[SPEAKER_09]: For the to choose a developer, and then we will negotiate with a developer.

438
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:17,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry that I said the cat was jumping on my lap and that was very disconcerting.

439
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:38,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there was some like, so we've also in the corner of one of the lots we've set we're setting up a pop up park, which is the idea is this is like a temporary location, that's going to be a fun location with paint and furniture that can be moved from place to place so it's not permanent in that location.

440
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:49,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And that allows us to then hold meetings and events there in that space and to hear from people like in the space and for people to imagine it.

441
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:57,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Because part of what we would like to see is better, you know, more use of the water, water facing activity activation.

442
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:04,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And included is the option that all the parking behind the building that runs along the river

443
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:13,670
[SPEAKER_09]: could be part of this for a developer that has innovative ideas and integration and has an idea of how they would use all of this together.

444
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:19,355
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's an interesting twist to it.

445
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:24,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I was thinking, I feel like there was one other thing in all of that.

446
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:30,432
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so the bids are due December 20th.

447
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:38,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll interview firms in January and hopefully have a selected proposal.

448
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:42,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And well, we'll have a selected firm in February, and then we'll work through.

449
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:47,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the other thing that we asked for is that we'd really like to, like there are bonus points for,

450
00:37:48,688 --> 00:38:05,755
[SPEAKER_09]: providing some campus-like feel between the senior center and city hall to make things more walkable, and that we did say that the city is open to realignment of the roads in that whole area if there's a proposal where that makes sense to do.

451
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:13,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We were looking for something that's really best for Medford Square and we said, let's think outside the box on it.

452
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:23,944
[SPEAKER_09]: So the pop-up park is going to be on Thursday, I think, is the ribbon cutting for that, or Wednesday?

453
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:25,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm going to check my calendar.

454
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:29,567
[SPEAKER_09]: The pop-up park is Wednesday at four.

455
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:34,850
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, we're going to have, Colleen's is going to sell ice cream.

456
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a little bit of an event.

457
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:39,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And Matt Heaton is going to play.

458
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:43,355
[SPEAKER_09]: He called and volunteered to play at this event.

459
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:46,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be nice.

460
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:50,014
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also the date that the car park bids are due.

461
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:53,035
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be really interesting.

462
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:59,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely ask me how that went, if you see me at the pop-up.

463
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:02,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

464
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:04,858
[SPEAKER_09]: So then Brenda's updates.

465
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:11,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Electrify Medford, 84 people have signed up so far and 19 have been coached.

466
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,602
[SPEAKER_09]: They've had a bunch of, I could go through all the events that they've been at.

467
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:19,304
[SPEAKER_09]: She left little details on all of them, but I could speak for an hour here.

468
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:25,987
[SPEAKER_09]: The EV Showcase, the Canoemobile event, and the Mystic River Celebration, they were at all of those.

469
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:39,937
[SPEAKER_09]: then they're going to be at the Farmer's Market this week or next week, the Harvest Art Festival and the Pumpkin Smash, and there's going to be a winter preparedness event November 14th at the library.

470
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:41,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll be at those events.

471
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:45,552
[SPEAKER_09]: composting.

472
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:48,013
[SPEAKER_09]: We have about 4,500 people signed up.

473
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:49,814
[SPEAKER_09]: We're continuing to do outreach.

474
00:39:50,894 --> 00:40:03,499
[SPEAKER_09]: They were just doing a little pilot where they had the city robocall about 100 houses and say, your new compost bin is going to get dropped off.

475
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,680
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to use it, you can just use it.

476
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:09,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't want to use it, you can leave it

477
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:17,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it is or put it back out and in it garbage to guard or call garbage to garden if you want it to go away right away and they'll take it away.

478
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:24,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And each of the compost bins that gets left would have a package with it that says, you know, this is your new bin.

479
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:26,233
[SPEAKER_09]: This is part of the city's program.

480
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:28,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, we missed you.

481
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they're going to go around.

482
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they were actually going to do this this past week.

483
00:40:32,337 --> 00:40:34,239
[SPEAKER_09]: You see, I had an update in my email.

484
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they're doing it this week.

485
00:40:38,443 --> 00:40:45,214
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies in that this includes okay so 400 and 4550 people total includes the hundred or 30 pilot folks.

486
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:59,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So they dropped off 130 bins with the idea of to see what the up reach so the idea is that they were going to knock on the door.

487
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:07,544
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the people are there they would talk to them and if they're not there they were just going to leave the band with this information, but the city Robo called first.

488
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:17,782
[SPEAKER_09]: What they had found is when they go around knocking on doors, 90% of the people they talk to take a compost bin and start.

489
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:26,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is to sort of get past the fact that like 70% of people weren't actually opening the doors.

490
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:31,385
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see how that, we'll have an update for that next month.

491
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get an update next week.

492
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,801
[SPEAKER_09]: EV charging revolving fund.

493
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,602
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like Brenda told you all about this.

494
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I ask a quick question about the topic?

495
00:41:42,704 --> 00:41:43,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

496
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:44,686
[SPEAKER_12]: The bags.

497
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:53,631
[SPEAKER_12]: When we did it, I remember it was somewhat cumbersome to try and figure out where to get them.

498
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:56,033
[SPEAKER_12]: We used Garbage to Gardens directly, and we got it from them.

499
00:41:56,353 --> 00:42:01,536
[SPEAKER_12]: When the city took over, they weren't providing the bags, and so it was a little bit cumbersome to get there.

500
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:02,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just wondering,

501
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:07,483
[SPEAKER_12]: what others experience has been and where that stands.

502
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:19,188
[SPEAKER_09]: You can order bags directly from Garbage to Garden and they'll just leave it with your bin and it's $8 for 20 bags, which is 20 weeks worth because that's the liner.

503
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:25,270
[SPEAKER_09]: They can also drop off for you the kitchen countertop bags if you want.

504
00:42:27,564 --> 00:42:33,506
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy compostable, so if you buy your own bags, you just have to make sure they have the right certifications.

505
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:43,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And in Medford Trove Green possessions, they sell compost bags specifically to Medford specifications.

506
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:49,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the very best reliable place to get them rather than figuring it out yourself.

507
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else want to add to that if there are other

508
00:42:57,018 --> 00:43:10,925
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll just say I've been buying my bags directly through Garbage to Gardens and that's been, it just requires paying attention when you come close to the end of your line.

509
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice if they had an automatic refresh or something, but.

510
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:32,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Like to put it on auto, I'll mention that to them, that they could have an option for auto perch, like automatically charge my credit card every, you know, 20 weeks and send a new bag.

511
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:36,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a bad idea, honestly.

512
00:43:36,378 --> 00:43:42,043
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's what they were doing when the city was not involved, when it was completely private.

513
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:44,865
[SPEAKER_12]: They would leave a bag with each pickup.

514
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really clear.

515
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,339
[SPEAKER_09]: You weren't charged extra for that.

516
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:55,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And the difficulty is that it was... So there were actually two things going on.

517
00:43:56,381 --> 00:44:07,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they were leaving one bag every week, that actually really slowed the drivers down because they had to get out and put... They had to like get it off their roll and rip it and put it there.

518
00:44:07,704 --> 00:44:10,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really adds up when you're doing for thousands.

519
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:17,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that was, they didn't want to leave one a week that way.

520
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:21,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the city was picking up that additional cost.

521
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:29,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you spread that out over the 18,000 households we hope to have included, it adds up.

522
00:44:30,312 --> 00:44:33,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why we're not doing it that way anymore.

523
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:38,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's reasonable that we have that responsibility.

524
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:45,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it is a problem when you get to the end of the week and you don't have a bag for the next week.

525
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:46,765
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, ah.

526
00:44:48,306 --> 00:44:52,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can use paper bags.

527
00:44:52,166 --> 00:45:00,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they recommend is that if you do that, you kind of double up, like that you put two bags in and then you put it inside that's a little thicker.

528
00:45:00,408 --> 00:45:01,788
[SPEAKER_12]: They tend to fall apart.

529
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:12,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, or you can put a put a paper bag in and then so they take it and they dump it into their truck so it's not really a problem for them.

530
00:45:12,572 --> 00:45:15,476
[SPEAKER_09]: If it falls apart, it just is more gross in the bottom of your ban.

531
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:15,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

532
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:19,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

533
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:22,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh.

534
00:45:24,323 --> 00:45:26,244
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, shall I move on?

535
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:40,855
[SPEAKER_09]: So the EV charging revolving fund that passed the city council the first reading, the process isn't, then they have to advertise it and then they have to vote again, but we don't see any issues and that will really help out our office budget.

536
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:52,243
[SPEAKER_09]: The school's HVAC is that we're working through the schematic design from the Andrews and the McGlynn site assessment

537
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:59,352
[SPEAKER_09]: The schematic design for the Andrews, the site assessment at the Megalyn, as well as we're working on fixes in the lower school.

538
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:01,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So that project is moving.

539
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:07,875
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a traditional city project and that is so big and complicated that it is slow.

540
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:13,398
[SPEAKER_09]: But I saw schematic designs presented last week, so it's moving along.

541
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:18,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire station.

542
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:28,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we had an energy meeting with the Consultants for the fire station, they think it's possible that we could hit net zero.

543
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:38,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are the designers on the new Cambridge fire station, which is net zero, but they said it's an extremely tight site and it's

544
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:44,456
[SPEAKER_09]: It's made it very expensive for them to go net zero, but they think it would actually be much easier for our building.

545
00:46:44,997 --> 00:46:47,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what we'll definitely have solar panels on top.

546
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:58,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But what we're looking at is doing a partial geothermal where we do wells that handle some of the load, but not the whole load for the building.

547
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:04,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a balance of like cost effectiveness and the amount of space we have and the time.

548
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:07,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they're just doing the engineering on that right now.

549
00:47:08,563 --> 00:47:10,624
[SPEAKER_09]: to determine if that's what makes the most sense.

550
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:17,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lovely working at this point on a building where there was no debate over whether or not it could be

551
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:26,265
[SPEAKER_09]: all electric, and they just wanted me to say that it was okay that their emergency generator be natural gas.

552
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:38,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know for those of you who may remember the details with Hurricane Sandy, but at that point, they had natural gas, but they couldn't get diesel deliveries.

553
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:43,079
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the emergency generators went dry because there was a requirement for them to be diesel.

554
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually from that whole like resiliency, this is an emergency building, like that the emergency generator would be natural gas.

555
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:58,435
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's coming, and it's fun.

556
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:08,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you may not know, the architects on the library, when we told them that it was gonna be, we wanted a net zero building, were like stunned.

557
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:12,803
[SPEAKER_09]: They had never designed a net zero building before, and they didn't know that they could.

558
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:14,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And Luke helped them.

559
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:21,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm gonna tell you that I presented last night with that architect at our library to donors.

560
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:25,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And she mentioned that she has now gotten

561
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:32,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And Luke, I wasn't really familiar with what she was saying, but she's being recognized as a library designer.

562
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:32,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

563
00:48:34,337 --> 00:48:35,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you understand it?

564
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:35,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

565
00:48:35,899 --> 00:48:46,546
[SPEAKER_03]: She's getting the F.A.I.A., which is a distinguished award in the American Institute of Architects.

566
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:50,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically she is the

567
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:55,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm forgetting.

568
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:57,140
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a fellow.

569
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:08,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and being a fellow, you have to have accomplished certain things in the industry and it's a prestigious award.

570
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:14,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and she is specifically a fellow because of her work with libraries.

571
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:17,119
[SPEAKER_09]: And with Medford's library.

572
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:18,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford's library was a huge.

573
00:49:19,848 --> 00:49:21,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, huge part of her application.

574
00:49:22,272 --> 00:49:28,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's presented at a library conference about designing net zero libraries now.

575
00:49:29,462 --> 00:49:32,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we can't change the industry.

576
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:41,688
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just add about the library that whoever's in charge, as the people there are extraordinarily nice, particularly in the children's section, but everywhere.

577
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:44,629
[SPEAKER_12]: They go out of their way to be helpful and friendly and accessible.

578
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:49,450
[SPEAKER_12]: And I complain when I'm not happy, and this is, it's really, it's always a pleasure to go there.

579
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:53,312
[SPEAKER_12]: And I go with my grandson fairly frequently, and they're just as nice as could be to everybody.

580
00:49:53,432 --> 00:49:53,792
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great.

581
00:49:54,762 --> 00:50:01,228
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, stuff like that really comes from top down and well, we might say from the mayor, but from the library director.

582
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:07,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're at this fancy formal presentation for the big donors and stuff about the green aspects of the library.

583
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:11,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And Barbara is saying, I still want my penguin habitat.

584
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:13,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't we have a penguin habitat?

585
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And the architect said, yes.

586
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:23,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Barbara wanted penguins to slide through slides through the library.

587
00:50:23,345 --> 00:50:25,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, we could not do that for her.

588
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:32,287
[SPEAKER_09]: When that is the heart of your library director, you just have people who love their work.

589
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:33,927
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows.

590
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:34,528
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great.

591
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:35,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

592
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:40,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so the fire station, it's looking.

593
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:42,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get penguins at the fire station?

594
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:45,520
[SPEAKER_09]: No, maybe that would work.

595
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:50,709
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if we can get firemen at the fire station, that would be lovely.

596
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:54,747
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, so that is coming along.

597
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,869
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Climate Equity Council.

598
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:19,504
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you all know, the Climate Equity Council is made up of the Medford Connectors, and they are putting on three Hispanic Heritage Month events, as well as the Winter Preparedness event, and that Brenda has been doing an abbreviated Electrify Medford training for them as well, so they can also help with some of the outreach.

599
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:21,666
[SPEAKER_09]: But now there are more hands up.

600
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:24,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we go back to Kathleen?

601
00:51:25,638 --> 00:51:32,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious, when is the fire station forecast to be complete?

602
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:33,922
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years or?

603
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:41,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Couple of years for the life of me I don't remember, but it's a couple of years right now.

604
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:55,070
[SPEAKER_09]: It's well the design so we finished the, so it took a while to get the like the layout and the, the schematic on where on how on the property there are a lot of issues with it's a very tight site, and they wanted a lot of parking.

605
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're now moving into the work with the engineers and stuff to get the details.

606
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:09,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's this override vote to help pay for the bond for it.

607
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:16,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that doesn't pass, I don't know what that means for this project, because it's a $30 million building.

608
00:52:18,922 --> 00:52:19,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

609
00:52:21,324 --> 00:52:21,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Barry?

610
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:26,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without getting into the

611
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:29,750
[SPEAKER_02]: messy politics of the fire station.

612
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as a factual yes, no question is the management of the fire department behind the new design.

613
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:46,154
[SPEAKER_09]: The fire chief is at every single meeting that we have on this.

614
00:52:46,354 --> 00:52:51,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And he whichever fire chief we've had over the years has been a single meeting for this.

615
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:54,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if he can't come, we don't hold the meeting.

616
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:54,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So

617
00:52:57,066 --> 00:52:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And there have been changes made that he has asked for.

618
00:52:59,488 --> 00:53:12,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And he overrode some of the things that we thought it would be a better design to not have a big, wide apron in front of it, but to have the trucks come straight out onto the road.

619
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:14,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And he overrode that.

620
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:17,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he changed the whole orientation of the building.

621
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're listening to him.

622
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:27,325
[SPEAKER_09]: He and the union are not necessarily the same thing.

623
00:53:27,745 --> 00:53:28,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know.

624
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's what.

625
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but he is at the union, as opposed.

626
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:34,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking if the manager is.

627
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:40,369
[SPEAKER_09]: He is at every single meeting and they're not moving forward unless he's comfortable with stuff.

628
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:41,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

629
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:42,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

630
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:45,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm at most meetings.

631
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:48,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So which is why I can say that so definitively.

632
00:53:53,294 --> 00:53:53,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Luke.

633
00:53:55,203 --> 00:54:18,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just ask, along the lines of the discussion at the library yesterday, are there some grants available for net zero fire stations to help kind of offset the load that Medford will need to take on for the costs?

634
00:54:19,652 --> 00:54:24,456
[SPEAKER_09]: It's much harder with fire stations because we don't have the equivalent of the Massachusetts library building.

635
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:31,042
[SPEAKER_09]: MLBC, whatever that organization, we don't have it for fire stations.

636
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:37,128
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are working with National Grid on building level scale incentives.

637
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is direct pay, which is

638
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people are aware of this from the federal government.

639
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:51,315
[SPEAKER_09]: If you as a homeowner do a renewable energy project, you get a 30% tax credit.

640
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:54,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Nonprofits and government get that.

641
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's called direct pay.

642
00:54:58,217 --> 00:55:07,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we can get the 30% that when we were doing the library and all, that money was just lost.

643
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:08,869
[SPEAKER_09]: We could not access that.

644
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not the whole building.

645
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:16,498
[SPEAKER_09]: That is just the parts that have to do with the renewable energy.

646
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:19,801
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is very much on our radar.

647
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:29,510
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was funny because the architects were like, well, we don't know if we can really count on this money, really love to see what happens with the government and how it all works.

648
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And Brenda and I were like, actually, no, it's a formula.

649
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:36,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And as long as you meet the codes of the formula, you can do it.

650
00:55:36,857 --> 00:55:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are becoming quite well versed in that.

651
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will just for your reference,

652
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Brenda is coming quite well versed in that, and she briefs me with what I need to know.

653
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:53,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But there have been a lot of webinars in education for municipal staff on how to take advantage of that direct pay.

654
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:58,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is guaranteed as long as you jump through the right hoops in the right order.

655
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:01,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is one of the things that she has her eye on.

656
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:03,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is great.

657
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:15,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like, by the way, in Massachusetts, the heat pumps, you got to jump through the right hoops and in the right order.

658
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:22,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's really important that if people are thinking about getting heat pumps, that they are paying a lot of attention to that.

659
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:31,887
[SPEAKER_09]: because you can install the right kind of heat pumps and not get an energy assessment beforehand and don't qualify for the 10 grand.

660
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:38,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can do the energy assessment and work with an improved installer and install heat pumps.

661
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turns out they're one of the models that doesn't qualify.

662
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:43,973
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got to be really careful about that.

663
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:48,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard both stories in Medford in the past year and 18 months.

664
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:56,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the onus should be less on the consumer.

665
00:56:57,712 --> 00:56:58,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Then.

666
00:56:58,993 --> 00:56:59,573
[SPEAKER_01]: The.

667
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Seller of the service and.

668
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:06,735
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be made.

669
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely clear.

670
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:11,337
[SPEAKER_01]: How to get that?

671
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:14,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Advantage.

672
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:17,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And like like I say, you know you.

673
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:24,935
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be like you go to the store and you know, choosing this product over that product.

674
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:26,476
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

675
00:57:28,197 --> 00:57:31,479
[SPEAKER_01]: This is big money for for middle income people.

676
00:57:33,061 --> 00:57:37,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that needs to be completely clear.

677
00:57:38,885 --> 00:57:42,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, whatever, whatever way we can get that, get that out.

678
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:48,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, not all companies are as above board as you would like.

679
00:57:49,354 --> 00:58:05,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And some companies, so when we got our quotes for my house, we got three quotes and the company that just seemed the most professional and I was really the most comfortable with, and I said to my husband, I like them, I'd like to do business with them, I think this would go smoothly.

680
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:11,187
[SPEAKER_09]: When they sent us their proposal, it was dramatically higher than the other two.

681
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:22,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we sent all three of them to the consultant, Abode, that is contracted at this point through Electrify Medford, to review the quotes.

682
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:35,457
[SPEAKER_09]: The company that I thought was so amazing and professional, Abode said to us, there's not enough detail here for us to really understand what they want to install, and we don't know whether or not these would qualify for the rebates.

683
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:43,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not comfortable with, we're not certain which model, if they're even proposing the right model for New England.

684
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:51,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just found that to be really interesting because they really came across as a company I'd like to do business with.

685
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:58,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I saw somewhere within a few blocks of here, four of their trucks at one house one day.

686
00:58:58,755 --> 00:59:00,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, oh, somebody is getting heat pumps in.

687
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they're installing the right stuff.

688
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

689
00:59:06,285 --> 00:59:16,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad that the consultants are around because I went through thinking about heat pumps a couple of years ago, had three different proposals, all of them gave me different information.

690
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:19,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I talked to Luke, he gave me information that was different for all three of them.

691
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:22,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just threw my hands and walked away and haven't gone back yet.

692
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:27,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, now's a good time to do it when we have people who can help.

693
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it really helps to run it through with a boat.

694
00:59:33,895 --> 00:59:43,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, don't quote me on this, but I think it's free for everybody now, because it was going to be free, covered by our grant for some populations, and then other people would have to pay.

695
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:48,688
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I heard that it's now free for everybody because Mass Save is covering it.

696
00:59:48,988 --> 00:59:50,149
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not 100% on that.

697
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:50,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

698
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:54,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was like 70 or 80 bucks.

699
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:57,881
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the best 80 bucks I ever spent.

700
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:05,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, why did you spend that money?

701
01:00:06,074 --> 01:00:12,058
[SPEAKER_09]: To have them look at the proposals that I was given and tell me how do they compare?

702
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:14,759
[SPEAKER_09]: What do they really need?

703
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Which ones were going to be more energy efficient?

704
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:20,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Were they all good proposals for my house?

705
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And would they all qualify for the Mass Saver eBay?

706
01:00:23,925 --> 01:00:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the third party that you sent information to

707
01:00:30,332 --> 01:00:40,562
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to choose which one's okay for your house to negotiate a contract with.

708
01:00:43,485 --> 01:00:45,687
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me is problematic, but

709
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:47,036
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me.

710
01:00:47,256 --> 01:00:51,779
[SPEAKER_09]: They're an independent third party that's been evaluating these.

711
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:56,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they told me was that there was not enough information from one of them.

712
01:00:57,243 --> 01:01:06,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they can tell you is which equipment they're recommending and the pros and cons of like, this is going to be more expensive to run.

713
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:08,050
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to heat recovery faster.

714
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:11,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Your house will get warmer faster, but it'll be more expensive.

715
01:01:11,532 --> 01:01:15,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they could tell us about the various what it actually meant.

716
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those companies, they're all in it to make a profit.

717
01:01:20,496 --> 01:01:20,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

718
01:01:22,717 --> 01:01:33,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so is this company that you, you paid the 80 bucks to, and I, I did, you know, I, I'm not, I'm not like going against this or anything like that.

719
01:01:33,543 --> 01:01:43,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the, the information should be made clearly available to consumers, which company is selling

720
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:49,259
[SPEAKER_01]: the product, it shouldn't be like, well, you have to choose.

721
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:51,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't know how to choose.

722
01:01:52,261 --> 01:02:01,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most consumers aren't as judicious and intelligent as you, Alicia.

723
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:10,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is important for people to know that, you know, to know

724
01:02:12,112 --> 01:02:21,478
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is a, you know, equality across this thing, you know, so I, I just wanted to point that out.

725
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:22,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

726
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:27,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Then in order to fix that, you have to make the you have to institute more regulations.

727
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:32,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to get things passed more laws and get more regulations in place.

728
01:02:32,906 --> 01:02:35,348
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the end result of that would be more regulations.

729
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:40,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I may add to that, Paul, I agree with you.

730
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:59,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, in this particular culture and economy, the competitive marketplace and the open legal approach basically says, I can sell you

731
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:13,515
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a piece of junk that I made in my backyard and tell you it's the greatest thing ever and if you buy it, that's too bad for you.

732
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:15,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And while Medford can

733
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:30,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's important to be as clear as possible and groups like mass save can be as clear as possible, but as possible about these are the pieces of equipment that qualify.

734
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:47,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I mean, a contract that you sign should include very clear language about what you are getting.

735
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:51,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet there are plenty of contracts that are pretty bogus.

736
01:03:53,801 --> 01:03:55,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately,

737
01:03:57,343 --> 01:04:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: The onus is on the consumer, and it is only through groups like ABODE that are contracted by the city or by National Grid or other large kind of

738
01:04:12,836 --> 01:04:13,576
[SPEAKER_03]: How shall I say?

739
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not that National Grid and the utilities are our saviors in this, but they are responsible fiduciaries, as they are called.

740
01:04:28,828 --> 01:04:31,570
[SPEAKER_03]: They do need to respond to their clientele.

741
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:39,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And so companies like Abode and some of the other

742
01:04:40,984 --> 01:05:02,158
[SPEAKER_03]: energy auditors out there are paid to provide citizens with somewhat unbiased, not quite unbiased, but semi-unbiased evaluation and information.

743
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:07,025
[SPEAKER_12]: It was my experience when we did try to do this a couple of years ago.

744
01:05:07,045 --> 01:05:16,227
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to all that, there was just, it seemed to me, ignorance around clarity on a variety of issues, like what did or didn't qualify for the $10,000.

745
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:19,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you or didn't you have to get rid of your old furnace?

746
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:26,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Were or weren't heat pumps effective below whatever lower degree temperature in the winter?

747
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:33,612
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought some of it was just the people that were coming out to talk to me, didn't know what they were talking about, since they all had different things to say.

748
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:40,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when I talked to Luke, who I regard as really knowing what he was talking about, he had something different to say than the three people that I spoke to.

749
01:05:41,054 --> 01:05:43,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, that's improved and there's more clarity about it.

750
01:05:43,794 --> 01:05:53,897
[SPEAKER_12]: But having an unbiased, presumably knowledgeable entity providing advice, I think is a good idea with all the reservations, of course, appropriately expressed.

751
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:54,797
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my view.

752
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:06,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to overstep and jump in on a good conversation.

753
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:14,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I do wanna acknowledge we're going very, we're straying away from our agenda time slots a little bit and I wanna be mindful of time.

754
01:06:16,752 --> 01:06:29,258
[SPEAKER_10]: So unless Alicia has any more really pressing updates, I'd love to jump towards our next section or two just to make sure we can move this along and end at a reasonable hour.

755
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:32,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was it.

756
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:34,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were the end of the updates Brenda left me.

757
01:06:36,957 --> 01:06:37,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic.

758
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:40,240
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

759
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:46,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob, you had been, I believe, tapped to talk a little bit about waste reduction.

760
01:06:46,945 --> 01:06:54,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you feel strongly enough to speak on it now or if you'd like to postpone it to the next session.

761
01:06:55,432 --> 01:06:58,635
[SPEAKER_10]: We've run clean through your time slot.

762
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:04,220
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I can mention is I just sent out an email and I don't know if it's bounced back to some people.

763
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:12,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked up some examples of what things can people do to reduce waste and I got

764
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,961
[SPEAKER_11]: website that says there's 21 things you can do.

765
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:22,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sent that out to people just as an initial step, and maybe I'll have more to say next month.

766
01:07:22,745 --> 01:07:27,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can take that as an initial appetizer for the main event.

767
01:07:28,347 --> 01:07:29,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll leave it at that.

768
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:32,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I very much appreciate it.

769
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,792
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll keep checking our inboxes for that, and I'll let you know if it bounces.

770
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

771
01:07:39,486 --> 01:07:42,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Which brings us to our final piece of business.

772
01:07:42,848 --> 01:07:49,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul has prepared a presentation on PFAS, a very important topic near and dear to my heart.

773
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:53,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul, are you prepared to speak on that?

774
01:07:53,353 --> 01:07:58,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you are muted.

775
01:08:00,517 --> 01:08:01,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, can you hear me?

776
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:05,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Can people hear me?

777
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:06,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

778
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:14,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll share my screen unless the presentation is in your hands, which you can share.

779
01:08:15,072 --> 01:08:18,874
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd rather do that than have you share it.

780
01:08:19,535 --> 01:08:23,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have nothing, but I can deputize you to share.

781
01:08:24,018 --> 01:08:24,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

782
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:27,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can at least.

783
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:35,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's co-host should be able to share screen.

784
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:40,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Paul, you should be okay to go for it.

785
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:46,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Can folks see this?

786
01:08:49,267 --> 01:08:49,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

787
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:56,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe you could make it so that it occupies the whole screen, but I don't know.

788
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:57,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's good.

789
01:08:57,649 --> 01:08:57,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

790
01:08:57,869 --> 01:08:58,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

791
01:08:58,729 --> 01:08:59,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that good?

792
01:09:01,309 --> 01:09:01,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

793
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:02,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

794
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to share this.

795
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:16,961
[SPEAKER_01]: because I keep abreast of it quite a bit, and I'm interested in it.

796
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:28,108
[SPEAKER_01]: So it affects stuff that I do at work and other people, obviously.

797
01:09:28,188 --> 01:09:34,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure that people had some information about it.

798
01:09:34,111 --> 01:09:35,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was

799
01:09:35,624 --> 01:09:37,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go through with this now.

800
01:09:38,165 --> 01:09:46,587
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let me just minimize stuff because I... Okay, there we go.

801
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:55,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so things that contain PFAS, right?

802
01:09:56,029 --> 01:10:01,010
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just... I'm sorry, I need to minimize stuff.

803
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:05,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

804
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:11,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything you see contains PFAS.

805
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:28,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're almost in everything you touch, you consume, and they are just ubiquitous, absolutely everywhere.

806
01:10:30,295 --> 01:10:31,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ask the question,

807
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:34,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can I find some PFAS?

808
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:37,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, almost everything you look at.

809
01:10:38,398 --> 01:10:51,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Your clothes, your desk, your utensils, well, not utensils, but cotton pads, even dental floss and nail polish.

810
01:10:53,425 --> 01:10:54,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely cleaning products.

811
01:10:56,747 --> 01:11:01,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Paints and sealants and varnishes.

812
01:11:03,988 --> 01:11:10,731
[SPEAKER_01]: in eye makeup and all kinds of cosmetics that are there.

813
01:11:11,152 --> 01:11:14,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to understand that.

814
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:25,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do we love polyfluorinated alkyls?

815
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:33,463
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very good at being hydrophobic and lipophilic.

816
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:44,475
[SPEAKER_01]: They're resistant to water and oil, and they make excellent water and oil repellents.

817
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:47,856
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you have them in pots and pans when you cook stuff.

818
01:11:49,436 --> 01:12:00,160
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a low surface tension, which means they spread very easily in thin films across a surface you're actually spraying them on.

819
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:06,079
[SPEAKER_01]: and this prophecy of valuable for firefighting foams and whatnot.

820
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:18,324
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as often used in firefighting foams as they were before, but I think in many places they still are.

821
01:12:19,604 --> 01:12:26,487
[SPEAKER_01]: They have chemical stability, so they are chemically resistant to heat, chemical degradation, biological breakdown,

822
01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:38,260
[SPEAKER_01]: They contribute, and this durability comes from the carbon fluorine bond that they have.

823
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:47,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes some useful industrial coatings, electronics, and various other things, including automotive components.

824
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,526
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good as electrical insulation.

825
01:12:54,752 --> 01:13:04,877
[SPEAKER_01]: They have many uses in electrical applications, materials, insulating materials for wires and cables and semiconductor manufacturing.

826
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:07,699
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually used in chip manufacture.

827
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:22,307
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see chip manufacturing or chips stacked, you can think how much PFAS is used in those industrial applications.

828
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:40,324
[SPEAKER_01]: They are resistant to biological degradation, so these are novel compounds, fluorine compounds, and they are not, evolution has not reached a point where it can actually break these things down yet.

829
01:13:41,865 --> 01:13:48,707
[SPEAKER_01]: People are working on it to accelerate evolution to break these things down, but we'll see.

830
01:13:49,527 --> 01:13:51,407
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used obviously in sewage treatment,

831
01:13:54,192 --> 01:13:59,074
[SPEAKER_01]: systems and certainly medical devices because of their properties.

832
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:08,658
[SPEAKER_01]: But the resistance to biological degradation makes them appealing in those applications.

833
01:14:10,019 --> 01:14:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got high thermal stability.

834
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,582
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just really resistant to being broken down.

835
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:19,783
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're used as coating on your pots and pans.

836
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:21,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

837
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:29,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so why we love PFAS, they make everything associated with modern life better.

838
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:32,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So that tells you something about modern life.

839
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:41,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you just an example of how PFAS are used in cosmetics.

840
01:14:43,393 --> 01:14:49,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are absolutely inserted into cosmetic formulation

841
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:52,646
[SPEAKER_01]: like no other.

842
01:14:53,746 --> 01:15:01,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are added to cosmetics for a number of reasons, including water resistance.

843
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:11,873
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want your mascara to run off anymore like in old movies when, you know, it rained and your mascara run off.

844
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:16,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Film formulation, they form a nice film.

845
01:15:17,978 --> 01:15:20,840
[SPEAKER_01]: which increases the durability and spreadability.

846
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,461
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very good at forming films on things.

847
01:15:26,663 --> 01:15:28,263
[SPEAKER_01]: They preserve color.

848
01:15:28,944 --> 01:15:40,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So color ingredients in cosmetics make them very useful for using in lipstick and eye shadow.

849
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:43,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Skin, believe it or not, skin conditioning.

850
01:15:45,028 --> 01:15:53,672
[SPEAKER_01]: PFAS can condition stuff that goes on your skin and it makes your skin appear shiny.

851
01:15:54,272 --> 01:15:56,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Remarkably, that's allowed to be used.

852
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:08,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, they improve product consistency, which is really important for manufacturing of almost anything.

853
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:10,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

854
01:16:11,045 --> 01:16:19,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I'm just giving you the amazing number of PFAS that are used in cosmetics.

855
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:22,110
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a list.

856
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:35,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go through it, but just to know there's 18 of them over here and up to 35 from there that are actually used in cosmetics, believe it or not.

857
01:16:35,496 --> 01:16:36,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is

858
01:16:37,935 --> 01:16:45,917
[SPEAKER_01]: This just exemplifies how much, how useful they are in almost everything we use dealing with modern noise.

859
01:16:46,957 --> 01:16:52,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so this slide is titled Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.

860
01:16:52,939 --> 01:17:06,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I put that there, and that's the title of the film, it was just that it exemplified exactly how these things are used, and you find them in almost

861
01:17:07,563 --> 01:17:08,523
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere you go.

862
01:17:08,543 --> 01:17:12,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with the way we live.

863
01:17:13,705 --> 01:17:23,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're used in textiles and leather to provide waterproofing.

864
01:17:24,488 --> 01:17:26,889
[SPEAKER_01]: They're obviously used in waterproofing sprays.

865
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:31,050
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used in food packaging, including

866
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:38,783
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually compostable, such as coffee cups and disposable dishes and pizza boxes.

867
01:17:39,443 --> 01:17:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, recent research has shown that pizza boxes are just incredibly impregnated with these things.

868
01:17:49,988 --> 01:18:01,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, recycling of impregnated paper can lead to PFAS contamination of downstream things.

869
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:13,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're used in fire extinguishing films because their surface active properties are very good at smothering things.

870
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:16,749
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used, believe it or not, in ski wax.

871
01:18:17,309 --> 01:18:18,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the wax is not enough.

872
01:18:19,511 --> 01:18:24,354
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to give it a little bit more oomph with the PFAS in there.

873
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:37,660
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used in industrial applications like chromium electroplating that generally causes some sort of toxic aerosol.

874
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:46,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Chromium electroplating is used in a myriad of things.

875
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:56,363
[SPEAKER_01]: You have anything that's chromium-plated, you probably have PFAS used in that application.

876
01:18:57,644 --> 01:19:02,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they're used in pots and pans because they're non-stick.

877
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,471
[SPEAKER_01]: They're heat-resistant.

878
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:10,055
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes them excellent things to use in that application.

879
01:19:11,082 --> 01:19:16,426
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used in liquids and greases that are used in electronic industry as lubricants.

880
01:19:17,427 --> 01:19:30,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cosmetics use involves things like sun protection and skin and hair products, which make these products water repellent.

881
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:32,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And

882
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:42,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Building products, such as floor coverings, cables, coated woods, solar panels and glasses.

883
01:19:43,255 --> 01:19:49,199
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the applications there, all towards water repellents.

884
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil and gas industry use them quite frequently.

885
01:19:54,643 --> 01:20:01,808
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the fracking fluid used to contain large amounts of PFAS.

886
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:18,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were, as you know, this is injected deep underground into sedimentary rock to release gases that are used.

887
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:23,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul, is there a category or group of products that they replace?

888
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:25,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Where?

889
01:20:27,299 --> 01:20:27,859
[SPEAKER_12]: In any of these.

890
01:20:28,826 --> 01:20:30,407
[SPEAKER_12]: in any of these situations?

891
01:20:31,148 --> 01:20:33,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there other substitutes?

892
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:37,134
[SPEAKER_01]: These are applications that are made de novo.

893
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:44,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are, you know, people think, well, that would be good to use that there.

894
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:46,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, they have an application there.

895
01:20:49,466 --> 01:20:50,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

896
01:20:51,230 --> 01:21:00,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm what I'm trying to understand is if, if they were eliminated, would there be other safer products that would take their place?

897
01:21:02,078 --> 01:21:04,120
[SPEAKER_01]: That's being worked on right now.

898
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:12,686
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a there is a contingent of people that are saying, well, you know, we don't need to use this stuff to do that.

899
01:21:12,886 --> 01:21:19,551
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I'll be honest with you on a chemist.

900
01:21:20,132 --> 01:21:20,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So

901
01:21:23,176 --> 01:21:28,498
[SPEAKER_01]: something that comes along the way and says, hey, this makes this reaction works better.

902
01:21:29,519 --> 01:21:30,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use it.

903
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:36,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, I'm not of that mind frame anymore.

904
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:43,946
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, but many chemists are still stuck in that mind frame.

905
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,486
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know what I mean?

906
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:46,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that?

907
01:21:46,107 --> 01:21:46,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

908
01:21:46,487 --> 01:21:47,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

909
01:21:47,687 --> 01:21:47,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

910
01:21:48,668 --> 01:21:48,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

911
01:21:50,148 --> 01:21:56,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're used in ionic liquids, particularly things that are found in lithium batteries.

912
01:21:59,172 --> 01:22:01,813
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of lithium batteries, right?

913
01:22:01,873 --> 01:22:06,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an application that they're used in.

914
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:19,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain pesticides contain PFAS as co-formulants because they increase the spreadability

915
01:22:21,063 --> 01:22:22,944
[SPEAKER_01]: of pesticides on plants.

916
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:34,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, they kill more bugs, but once the plants die, they find their way into the soil.

917
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:39,311
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have another way of being exposed to them.

918
01:22:41,157 --> 01:23:04,742
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually themselves are actually used as pesticides, and roughly about 45 pesticide-active ingredients approved by the European Union contain trifluoromethyl, though trifluoromethyl is used in a myriad of chemical

919
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:24,642
[SPEAKER_01]: products, including lots of drugs, because fluorine provides an electron withdrawing property that is very useful in making particular things work.

920
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:42,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, roughly about 30% of newly approved active pharmaceutical ingredients are organofluorine compounds.

921
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:53,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So, some fellow identified 342 fluorinated active pharmaceutical substances.

922
01:23:53,443 --> 01:23:57,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I can testify to this because I am involved in making drugs.

923
01:23:57,885 --> 01:23:59,165
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm there.

924
01:24:00,766 --> 01:24:04,207
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so, I don't know what this thing is.

925
01:24:05,578 --> 01:24:24,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, just to say that they, in spite of all the stuff that's going on about concerns about PFAS and whatnot, we are still getting patents, and in the thousands.

926
01:24:25,196 --> 01:24:33,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did this little search on Google patents to look at, you can see the data.

927
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:40,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you see my arrow there.

928
01:24:40,324 --> 01:24:42,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pointing to 2015 to 2024.

929
01:24:42,965 --> 01:24:45,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So roughly about nine, 10 years.

930
01:24:47,468 --> 01:24:53,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still tons of patents going in for things that

931
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:58,401
[SPEAKER_01]: resonate with perfluoro and synthesis of.

932
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:01,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I entered.

933
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:09,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got about roughly about 20,000 entries here.

934
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:19,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the side here, these are the main companies that are introducing new PFAS into applications and whatnot.

935
01:25:19,404 --> 01:25:22,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how popular this stuff is.

936
01:25:24,099 --> 01:25:25,799
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not going away.

937
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:35,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there is any mitigation to be done, this process needs to be regulated in a serious way.

938
01:25:36,702 --> 01:25:37,722
[SPEAKER_01]: What do these look like?

939
01:25:38,582 --> 01:25:40,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they look like what you see right there.

940
01:25:41,623 --> 01:25:53,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure people don't come across chemical compounds a lot, but what you see as nodes there and nothing in the middle there, those are

941
01:25:53,831 --> 01:26:00,112
[SPEAKER_01]: those are carbon molecules, sorry, carbon atoms.

942
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:03,433
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you can see fluorine there.

943
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:17,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a, I just wanted to give you a sort of a pictorial depiction of how chemists might imagine perfluorinated compounds.

944
01:26:17,276 --> 01:26:20,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just there for just

945
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:23,910
[SPEAKER_01]: for fun.

946
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:28,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone's having fun here, but anyways.

947
01:26:29,695 --> 01:26:33,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so environmental stuff.

948
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:45,628
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, there's here, I wanted to point out the three conceptual models for how PFAS gets into the environment.

949
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:45,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And

950
01:26:47,432 --> 01:26:51,055
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from EnviroVicky.

951
01:26:52,296 --> 01:26:54,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I just copied and pasted over here.

952
01:26:55,038 --> 01:26:58,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to concentrate on only one of them.

953
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:06,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the conceptual site model for landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

954
01:27:07,294 --> 01:27:15,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I want to say about this is that you can see how the stuff gets into the groundwater.

955
01:27:15,962 --> 01:27:26,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is really a nice depiction of how what we use on the surface gets into the bottom of stuff and then essentially pervades almost everything.

956
01:27:27,552 --> 01:27:30,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is on the right side in the little

957
01:27:31,464 --> 01:27:36,365
[SPEAKER_01]: depression you see, there's a typical marker for invertebrates.

958
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:40,686
[SPEAKER_01]: They end up being affected by this quite a bit.

959
01:27:43,767 --> 01:27:55,169
[SPEAKER_01]: This just shows that they are very dispersible, very ubiquitous.

960
01:27:56,709 --> 01:28:00,310
[SPEAKER_01]: They get into almost everything because of their properties.

961
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:06,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the reason why I just wanted to put this slide up.

962
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:08,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I have to say about that.

963
01:28:10,132 --> 01:28:18,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So human effects on humans and effects on animals and why we should hate PFAS.

964
01:28:19,436 --> 01:28:28,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I had a slide before saying why we love PFAS, but now we should concentrate on why we should hate them.

965
01:28:28,918 --> 01:28:32,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, so they affect the immune system.

966
01:28:34,002 --> 01:28:35,703
[SPEAKER_01]: They suppress the immune system.

967
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:40,026
[SPEAKER_01]: There's corroborating evidence to say that, to show that.

968
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:41,968
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect the thyroid.

969
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:52,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly, they alter thyroid hormones and potentially contribute to thyroid disease.

970
01:28:53,897 --> 01:28:57,940
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect reproductive health, both in men and women.

971
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:12,101
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of outcomes on pregnancy, delayed puberty, sperm count, fetal development, all manner of things.

972
01:29:12,742 --> 01:29:21,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how these are affecting seriously the health and welfare of people.

973
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:32,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Cancer, there's been some correlation between specific cancers and PFAS, including kidney and testicular cancer.

974
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:42,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Developmental effects, lower birth weight, potential impacts on neurodevelopment in children.

975
01:29:44,523 --> 01:29:51,466
[SPEAKER_01]: There is even some evidence showing that they affect addiction or they enhance addiction.

976
01:29:52,447 --> 01:29:53,568
[SPEAKER_01]: to substances.

977
01:29:54,968 --> 01:30:02,012
[SPEAKER_01]: They clearly have an effect on semen quality and motility.

978
01:30:03,373 --> 01:30:15,559
[SPEAKER_01]: For many years, we have wondered why the semen quality and quantity and whatnot have gone down in human populations.

979
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might actually be the culprit.

980
01:30:19,602 --> 01:30:21,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is evidence supporting this now.

981
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:44,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Neurodevelopment effects, you know, they have potential impact on neurodevelopment in particularly if the higher levels and in blood cord or blood towards adverse effects on cognitive development and behavior in children.

982
01:30:47,331 --> 01:30:48,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Other health effects.

983
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:56,105
[SPEAKER_01]: liver damage, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes, and lots of other stuff, nasty stuff.

984
01:30:56,845 --> 01:30:58,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just in humans.

985
01:31:00,548 --> 01:31:04,430
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's going on in animals.

986
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:15,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to point out and what I'm really concerned about, this is a canary in a coal mine kind of thing, is the effect on amphibians.

987
01:31:17,724 --> 01:31:19,545
[SPEAKER_01]: things like geckos, frogs, and whatnot.

988
01:31:20,865 --> 01:31:40,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Their numbers have been declining in the United States, and this might actually represent a causal effect, a causal, what do you call it, causal effect, I guess, yeah, on why these populations are declining and going down.

989
01:31:41,056 --> 01:31:44,778
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously other things that are here that I've

990
01:31:45,402 --> 01:31:48,983
[SPEAKER_01]: put up, but I'm not going to get into it for sake of time.

991
01:31:50,023 --> 01:31:53,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's no reflection on the importance of the animal.

992
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:59,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the other species on this planet, because I value them just as much as I value my son.

993
01:31:59,866 --> 01:32:01,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

994
01:32:02,247 --> 01:32:04,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we mitigate all this stuff?

995
01:32:05,848 --> 01:32:08,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulation policy is important.

996
01:32:08,908 --> 01:32:14,290
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to restrict use of PFAS and limit environmental contamination.

997
01:32:16,563 --> 01:32:20,888
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to put money into monitoring and research.

998
01:32:21,588 --> 01:32:25,332
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just, you know, ignore it.

999
01:32:26,033 --> 01:32:27,615
[SPEAKER_01]: It's affecting everything.

1000
01:32:27,735 --> 01:32:31,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It's affecting our healthcare.

1001
01:32:33,061 --> 01:32:34,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It's affecting our bottom line.

1002
01:32:35,043 --> 01:32:37,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is absolutely important.

1003
01:32:39,218 --> 01:32:43,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Remediation and cleanup, obviously, this is an important thing.

1004
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:53,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can find places where they've been produced and that's usually where they are usually dumped, where they're produced, they're usually dumped.

1005
01:32:56,585 --> 01:33:08,070
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make a map of that and people are much, people who are much more erudite and much better at this than I am

1006
01:33:09,465 --> 01:33:12,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made maps and you can check that out.

1007
01:33:14,428 --> 01:33:15,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to find out alternatives.

1008
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:20,952
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an issue for modern existence, modern life.

1009
01:33:21,132 --> 01:33:23,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want everything to be convenient and whatnot.

1010
01:33:24,534 --> 01:33:31,198
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to think about what it means for something to be convenient.

1011
01:33:33,698 --> 01:33:35,339
[SPEAKER_01]: public awareness and education.

1012
01:33:35,839 --> 01:33:42,622
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're doing right here at MEEC, which is a forum for educating the public in medicine.

1013
01:33:45,223 --> 01:33:50,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to put in place food safety measures.

1014
01:33:51,985 --> 01:33:55,407
[SPEAKER_01]: It again goes back to regulation.

1015
01:33:56,607 --> 01:34:03,330
[SPEAKER_01]: How much, what are the actual toxicological limits of these things and how they

1016
01:34:05,803 --> 01:34:08,664
[SPEAKER_01]: impact health, in what concentrations.

1017
01:34:10,264 --> 01:34:19,647
[SPEAKER_01]: These have to be implemented by government and government should listen to people.

1018
01:34:21,108 --> 01:34:24,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can I mitigate PFAS?

1019
01:34:26,969 --> 01:34:35,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not putting this responsibility on the consumer because I am not the kind of person that thinks that things are just put out there for

1020
01:34:36,516 --> 01:34:41,680
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're all... and whatnot.

1021
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we are.

1022
01:34:45,103 --> 01:34:50,528
[SPEAKER_01]: There's water filtering that you should think about if you're concerned about it.

1023
01:34:51,468 --> 01:35:02,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have not seen data on Medford water contamination with PFAS, so that's ongoing, I think.

1024
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:04,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And by 2025, we should know more.

1025
01:35:06,825 --> 01:35:16,170
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not, it would not be a surprise to me that we find a ton of it in the drinking water be, or actually consume.

1026
01:35:17,322 --> 01:35:20,483
[SPEAKER_01]: But filters aren't as effective as people think.

1027
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:29,267
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a saturation limit with PFAS which exceeds what you normally try to get out of carbon filters and whatnot.

1028
01:35:29,447 --> 01:35:30,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And it costs money.

1029
01:35:32,408 --> 01:35:36,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people, middle-income people, don't have the money to install filters.

1030
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:43,352
[SPEAKER_01]: They rely on taxes to get clean water out of the tap.

1031
01:35:44,552 --> 01:35:45,112
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a given.

1032
01:35:47,763 --> 01:35:52,186
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use nonstick cookware because I'll give you a point on this.

1033
01:35:52,967 --> 01:36:00,893
[SPEAKER_01]: You take you take a stainless steel pan, heat it up, make sure the water drop a few drops of water on it.

1034
01:36:01,093 --> 01:36:05,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it beads, it's it's hot enough and nothing will stick to it.

1035
01:36:05,597 --> 01:36:06,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So just oil after that.

1036
01:36:07,318 --> 01:36:08,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that'll help you out.

1037
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it'll help.

1038
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:11,541
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1039
01:36:11,601 --> 01:36:14,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So then obviously check care products.

1040
01:36:15,324 --> 01:36:15,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mindful of

1041
01:36:17,247 --> 01:36:23,790
[SPEAKER_01]: what cosmetics you use, and whether the things are like advertised as waterproof.

1042
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:26,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually that means they've used it on it, so.

1043
01:36:28,552 --> 01:36:29,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Read product labels.

1044
01:36:30,113 --> 01:36:42,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are not implemented at all thoroughly, so we don't know what goes into product labels, so particularly packaging.

1045
01:36:42,718 --> 01:36:44,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see a protein bar.

1046
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious, healthy.

1047
01:36:47,748 --> 01:36:50,689
[SPEAKER_01]: but it might be contaminated PFAS because of the packaging.

1048
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:57,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And then properly dispose of containing PFAS-containing items.

1049
01:36:59,732 --> 01:37:09,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I put this up because, yes, there should be something that says or some sort of method to dispose of this stuff.

1050
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:14,823
[SPEAKER_01]: if we are of a mind to do it in a very serious way.

1051
01:37:15,703 --> 01:37:18,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see this happening too seriously.

1052
01:37:18,545 --> 01:37:34,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm seeing a lot of people throw the cookware into the rubbish bin and it goes into the municipal waste and ends up in the waste water.

1053
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid contaminated sites.

1054
01:37:37,711 --> 01:37:40,873
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's that's a given because you need you.

1055
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:49,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I would generally not recommend anyone building a property or a house near a fracking site, so please don't do that.

1056
01:37:50,979 --> 01:37:52,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so.

1057
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:58,424
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some ways people are trying to mitigate PFAS hello.

1058
01:38:00,926 --> 01:38:03,868
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some ways people are trying to mitigate PFAS they.

1059
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,351
[SPEAKER_01]: there's froth flotation.

1060
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:14,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just to give some, some glimmer of hope to this whole nonsense that's going on.

1061
01:38:15,335 --> 01:38:18,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to, there are very, very

1062
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:23,482
[SPEAKER_01]: are bright people looking at this problem in a very serious way.

1063
01:38:23,942 --> 01:38:28,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's froth flotation, which means you bubble stuff through sludge.

1064
01:38:29,205 --> 01:38:35,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And remarkably, that causes the PFAS to come to the surface and you can collect it and then treat it some way.

1065
01:38:36,168 --> 01:38:38,489
[SPEAKER_01]: There is photocatalysis.

1066
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:43,692
[SPEAKER_01]: You essentially use sort of a screen-through kind of method to

1067
01:38:44,537 --> 01:38:47,077
[SPEAKER_01]: use, it's usually UV light.

1068
01:38:47,598 --> 01:38:53,999
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as you can see that in the pictorial on top, light irradiation.

1069
01:38:54,659 --> 01:39:06,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So that certain substances like titanium oxide can be used to break down PFAS.

1070
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:09,381
[SPEAKER_01]: There is reductive fluorination.

1071
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:13,662
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another catalytic method to get rid of PFAS.

1072
01:39:14,663 --> 01:39:18,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then the last thing I wanted to point out is mixed matrix membranes.

1073
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:21,248
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of a filtration method to get through the PFAS.

1074
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:38,641
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I put this up only to show that there are people seriously thinking about this getting rid of stuff, because it is a serious problem, and we need to really think about it deeply, carefully, methodically.

1075
01:39:39,822 --> 01:39:43,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this should give us a glimmer of hope on

1076
01:39:44,977 --> 01:39:46,597
[SPEAKER_01]: are folks thinking this.

1077
01:39:47,057 --> 01:39:51,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of these obviously is going to emerge as, or some of these, so there's others.

1078
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:58,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, this is by no means an exhaustive depiction of what's going on.

1079
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just putting this up like that.

1080
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:14,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of these should emerge as, or two or three might emerge as the optimal method of treating things in terms of cost and effectiveness.

1081
01:40:15,508 --> 01:40:25,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I wanted to just give you some references that I've used to formulate this presentation.

1082
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:38,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these, particularly the last ones, are very, very helpful for a lay person to go through

1083
01:40:39,163 --> 01:41:03,526
[SPEAKER_01]: there is some obviously these are reviews and these are done by scientists so there is some um i did it some you know it's it's boring uh to some folks uh so if you want a but but but for those who are very interested and deeply concerned um they should be looking at some of these um um

1084
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:05,238
[SPEAKER_01]: references.

1085
01:41:05,919 --> 01:41:08,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I just wanted to thank you for your attention.

1086
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:09,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it so much.

1087
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:10,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1088
01:41:20,067 --> 01:41:20,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic.

1089
01:41:21,007 --> 01:41:21,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1090
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:26,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you taking questions?

1091
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:30,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if we have too, too much time, but if people have things on their minds.

1092
01:41:42,233 --> 01:41:47,016
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, looks like we're in the final few of us.

1093
01:41:47,237 --> 01:41:55,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Last bit on the agenda is if we have any new business we'd like to discuss, anything we'd like to throw into the record before we adjourn.

1094
01:41:59,526 --> 01:42:00,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is Bob Payne.

1095
01:42:02,622 --> 01:42:17,250
[SPEAKER_11]: With all the hurricane destruction due to floodwaters, I was gonna raise the issue again about Medford's vulnerability to excessive rain or coastal flooding.

1096
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:20,272
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two different threats, I guess.

1097
01:42:20,392 --> 01:42:26,776
[SPEAKER_11]: One is overtopping the Amelia Era Dam, but I guess there might be a project to raise the level by four feet.

1098
01:42:28,193 --> 01:42:37,736
[SPEAKER_11]: that would help, but then the other issue is, say we get 12 inches of rain in six hours, what's gonna happen to Medford?

1099
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:52,060
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, I guess I'd like to revisit that to see if Brenda knows anything about any recent studies about how vulnerable we are and what is our, do we have any plans to mitigate such threats?

1100
01:42:56,842 --> 01:42:57,502
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll leave it at that.

1101
01:42:59,563 --> 01:43:02,584
[SPEAKER_10]: make sure we make time on the agenda for it, and I'll relay that to her.

1102
01:43:04,805 --> 01:43:05,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kathleen?

1103
01:43:06,405 --> 01:43:10,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Paul, I was wondering if you could send your presentation out?

1104
01:43:11,147 --> 01:43:13,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an issue?

1105
01:43:13,488 --> 01:43:20,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And my other question was, how long have these PFAS, you know,

1106
01:43:22,102 --> 01:43:24,803
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals been used in products?

1107
01:43:24,903 --> 01:43:30,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it recent or is it like something introduced in the 60s and 70s or earlier?

1108
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:33,425
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years.

1109
01:43:33,445 --> 01:43:34,965
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years, okay.

1110
01:43:35,005 --> 01:43:43,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, longer perhaps, but that's my perception of the data that's out there.

1111
01:43:44,107 --> 01:43:46,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been used quite frequently.

1112
01:43:46,108 --> 01:43:51,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're used, like I said, they're used in a myriad of things, almost everything

1113
01:43:52,593 --> 01:44:03,580
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can think of in terms of, in terms of greasing modern life.

1114
01:44:06,962 --> 01:44:13,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good use of that term.

1115
01:44:14,386 --> 01:44:17,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1116
01:44:17,428 --> 01:44:18,809
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very useful things.

1117
01:44:18,989 --> 01:44:20,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we,

1118
01:44:22,165 --> 01:44:25,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what we do with stuff when we make it.

1119
01:44:26,488 --> 01:44:28,889
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

1120
01:44:29,569 --> 01:44:37,854
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we're doing good, but we really don't.

1121
01:44:39,935 --> 01:44:41,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can get away with it,

1122
01:44:43,117 --> 01:44:43,857
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll sell it.

1123
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:47,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think as with many things, right.

1124
01:44:47,899 --> 01:44:56,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It may have started as a small application, but now lots of people are making different versions.

1125
01:44:56,724 --> 01:45:06,889
[SPEAKER_03]: As you saw, there are like thousands of variations and they're super useful and you can find a million products to sell it in.

1126
01:45:06,909 --> 01:45:07,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1127
01:45:10,793 --> 01:45:13,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where we're at.

1128
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:22,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be clear, PFAS is the tip of the iceberg.

1129
01:45:23,003 --> 01:45:29,788
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 70,000 or 80,000 chemicals that we have no regulation on at all.

1130
01:45:31,169 --> 01:45:36,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use them in products, all sorts of products.

1131
01:45:37,959 --> 01:45:45,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last presentation I made was on... I forget what they were on.

1132
01:45:46,669 --> 01:45:51,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I made some presentation before, but that was something awful too.

1133
01:45:52,536 --> 01:45:52,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it?

1134
01:45:52,937 --> 01:45:53,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, how hard it was?

1135
01:45:53,978 --> 01:45:54,679
[SPEAKER_11]: No idea.

1136
01:45:54,939 --> 01:45:55,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1137
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:55,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1138
01:45:59,826 --> 01:46:00,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1139
01:46:01,307 --> 01:46:08,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Paul, don't go too far down the doomsday feelings, at least.

1140
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:09,850
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

1141
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:21,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to say that, as you were saying, while those things do grease the life and make things seem better,

1142
01:46:22,695 --> 01:46:29,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, to Benji's question earlier, we can still do things the old fashioned way.

1143
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:38,247
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are the old school solutions still available.

1144
01:46:39,408 --> 01:46:42,730
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to preserve food without all this stuff.

1145
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:45,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that should give us hope.

1146
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:46,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1147
01:46:48,977 --> 01:46:55,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I need to head out and eat dinner, but thank you very much.

1148
01:46:55,339 --> 01:46:55,979
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

1149
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:56,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Paul.

1150
01:46:57,079 --> 01:47:00,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also love a copy of that if available.

1151
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:01,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1152
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:10,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I did send it to Teresa and I sent all the accompanying documentation too.

1153
01:47:10,602 --> 01:47:12,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be available.

1154
01:47:14,529 --> 01:47:18,192
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that maybe we should discuss at a later point.

1155
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bring it up right now, but like in a big way, but in terms of references and things that people can access freely, perhaps we should have some place to put them on the MEEC site.

1156
01:47:41,418 --> 01:47:41,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1157
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:42,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good.

1158
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,060
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1159
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:45,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night.

1160
01:47:48,083 --> 01:47:51,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I make a motion to adjourn?

1161
01:47:51,706 --> 01:47:52,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

1162
01:47:52,027 --> 01:47:52,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second that.

1163
01:47:54,489 --> 01:47:55,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic.

1164
01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:56,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Any objections?

1165
01:47:58,692 --> 01:47:59,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a wonderful evening.

1166
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:00,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1167
01:48:00,494 --> 01:48:04,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I will see you all next month, November 13th.
