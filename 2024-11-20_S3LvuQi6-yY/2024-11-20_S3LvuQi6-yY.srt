1
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:46,406
[SPEAKER_04]: See you later.

2
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everybody.

3
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,861
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we all doing today?

4
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful, wonderful.

5
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:11,785
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

6
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:16,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we might as well jump in if we're all good to go.

7
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:19,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that we're recording.

8
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,893
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will call us.

10
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:28,816

[SPEAKER_00]: So I will call us to order.

21
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:39,078
[SPEAKER_00]: The following resolution was moved for further discussion to this subcommittee.

22
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:57,123
[SPEAKER_00]: 2024-40 offered by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, consolidation language for diversity, equity, and inclusion, DEI support, whereas the city's DEI director and ADA coordinator is supporting school ADA, DEI, crisis management, HR, and training needs by being a resource to the school administration team.

23
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:04,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and call the roll to make sure we are all here and we'll get started.

24
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,285
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Member Reinfeld?

25
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

26
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:11,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau?

27
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

28
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,721
[SPEAKER_00]: and member Olapade. Present.

29
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,562
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three present, zero absent.

30
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:17,823
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good to go.

31
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:19,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.

32
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:38,497
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think to start, I'll add some immediate thoughts from the meeting that had us call to this subcommittee meeting, which was some questions and some, I think, clarification about the current practices of leaning on the city's DEI director and how she's been offering her support and expertise on questions about these.

33
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,601
[SPEAKER_00]: different circumstances and how best we can continue to support the school district.

34
00:07:43,441 --> 00:08:03,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most immediate question for at least myself was are we preparing other staff for example with these you know these practices and trainings so they can then go into the community and go into the school district community and support when our DEI director from the city side is not available per se as well as are we

35
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:09,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a potential to have another staffer, a date in that process.

36
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:11,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that also came up was.

37
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:26,567
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros in my mind were that there might be broader expertise, having someone on the city side who understands the state's suggestions and mandates and policies and procedures of these practices, who can help implement them in the school system.

38
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:33,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we aligning the school districts, DEI, ADA, crisis management, HR, in trainings?

39
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they aligned with the city's mission as well?

40
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:43,255
[SPEAKER_00]: we're resource sharing as well, which I think is incredibly important when we understand how are we implementing them properly.

41
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:51,036
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I think most immediate for me is that, is there a prioritizing of time?

42
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that these issues are incredibly diverse and they are ever changing.

43
00:08:54,957 --> 00:09:04,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want the city's DEI director to be taken away from her responsibilities day to day if there's opportunity for her to work in tandem with potentially another

44
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:20,085
[SPEAKER_00]: employee on the city side or on the school side who can prioritize that day-to-day and they can work together to make sure things are aligned, whether it's a full-time staffer or maybe a contractor that's meeting on a, let's say, quarterly basis or bi-quarterly basis, for example.

45
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:28,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the most immediate questions that I have, and I would ask my colleagues if they have any other considerations they'd like to add before we kind of open it up for further discussion.

46
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Member Olapade summarized it well.

47
00:09:35,519 --> 00:10:00,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be good for this committee to understand what has been happening, what the need is, and what that intersection looks like in terms of building capacity within the district, understanding that there is very particular training that Director Nwaje has that people in the school district don't have, and just really making the best use of people's time and expertise in a really collaborative way that

48
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:07,003
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure that everyone who needs to be supported is supported on both sides of things.

49
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:14,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau?

50
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:16,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

51
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did voice this during the school committee meeting.

52
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:30,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have, you know, when school committee members are onboarded, we go through a training and there's a lot of focus on what we do not have access to.

53
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:36,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the employees of Medford public schools are not employees of the city of Medford.

54
00:10:38,039 --> 00:11:04,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm concerned about setting a precedent where somebody who is not an employee of Medford Public Schools is, and this is not a, say something about Francis, who I think I have a great relationship with, but I am concerned that we, do we even have any kind of, any document in place that authorizes

55
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who is not part of the school system.

56
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:21,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I have no idea since we don't get a report, which makes sense because we this doesn't seem like the kind of stuff that stuff that that Francis has been involved in doesn't seem like the stuff we would get a report on.

57
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:26,619
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am curious if there has been any involvement with student related

58
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:40,047
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and not students like the global, the generalized students, but individual students.

59
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:46,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, when we go for our training, we are kind of beaten into us a bit.

60
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,711
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can never ask for anything about any individual students.

61
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:56,315
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no rights to know anything about individual students in our district.

62
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:10,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are some of my concerns that I'm not saying those things have not been worked out, but they're not worked out in a way where I have any insight or knowledge of.

63
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:13,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of my thoughts.

64
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:19,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

65
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:36,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another moment, I think also the question about availability, I think is a big part of it's something that I think we've run into is making sure that we are as available to the student population and their immediate families and related relations outside of that.

66
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:48,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we supporting them, not just in the most emergent situations but I think outside of most emergent situations and making sure that we're maintaining that relationship after you know potential incidents have occurred or make sure that we're complying long term.

67
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think because these issues are ever changing, it feels as though.

68
00:12:53,151 --> 00:13:02,256
[SPEAKER_00]: having a better understanding about how we are diverting time away from the city side of these initiatives and these trainings that the DEI office is pursuing.

69
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:06,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we taking time away from them to pursue those from the city side to this district?

70
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:10,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is that happening on the other side, the other way around?

71
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:21,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that just having a better understanding about how much that's been happening thus far and is that compliant or consistent with our values as a district is also something that I'd like to hear about too, about the time management,

72
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,287
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I think we're all having as well.

73
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:33,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our director would like to chime in or anyone on the school side that feels like they have some insight would be really appreciated I think.

74
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to let Ms.

75
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:46,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Nwaje Francis weigh in on how she has been supporting the schools.

76
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:59,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I did make comments on November 4th, but I think the fact that she's here, she should be able to speak to the work that she has done and answer any of your questions directly.

77
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's fantastic.

78
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:08,108
[SPEAKER_06]: The language in this resolution is very vague, and so I am very eager to know how we are

79
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:10,739
[SPEAKER_06]: to know the details.

80
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for being here, Frances.

81
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:17,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you all for inviting me.

82
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:28,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I welcome the opportunity to talk about my role as what is, you know, currently known as the DEI Director, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is the

83
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:41,565
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology that has been used over the past five to seven years, evolving from the real name, which is the Office of Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

84
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And I raise that because that's

85
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:46,449
[SPEAKER_02]: how I was trained.

86
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trained as a civil rights representative.

87
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,434
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean in a nutshell?

88
00:14:51,614 --> 00:15:00,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that whatever space I am in, I am required to know which of the titles I need to apply and apply them to ensure the compliance for that space.

89
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:07,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether it's the schools, the municipal, a private entity, or even a family owned business of more than 50 people.

90
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:22,448
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I do want to do is make sure that you can rest assured, I do not have access to student information, nor would I ever, nor would anybody in this role ever require access to student information.

91
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, it's very vague, right?

92
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not, the details aren't there.

93
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's just say a call comes in and I'm told that,

94
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:59,149
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hateful imaging or, you know, on choice words have been discovered, it is important to know more of the ethnic identity of the person that did the discovery as a way of, you know, collaborating and planning support versus knowing the name and who they are and, you know, what, none of that comes into play.

95
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes along to say with student files, those,

96
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:07,313
[SPEAKER_02]: that information does not come to play.

97
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:13,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I only know about students when they meet me and they introduce themselves to me or they invite me.

98
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:18,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And case in point, the GSA group at the high school.

99
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't encroach on their time.

100
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:33,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I wait for their invitation for me to join their groups and I show up and provide them with the support that they need or just be a listening ear if that is their choice.

101
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:44,937
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time that it would be necessary for me to know the identity of a student was in the very extreme case.

102
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:48,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm speaking under the ADA law.

103
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:58,460
[SPEAKER_02]: The school had, let us say, a deaf, not hard of hearing, but a deaf-blind student who required ASL interpretation.

104
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: That requires a different form of signing, that is in-hand signing.

105
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:12,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, ASL interpreters are hard to come by, let alone interpreters that have the ability to sign in hand.

106
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:24,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that information, not for myself, but I need to list that individual just as I list community members' names on the request that I send out to MCDHH.

107
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:30,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, those are the extreme parameters.

108
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:34,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for, you know, those of us that are hearing those of us that could be tuned in.

109
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:43,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that, you know, that the director does not have, nor would the director have unnecessary access to student information.

110
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:51,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, understand that I'm bound by the strictest laws of confidentiality, which in turn pose their own issues, right?

111
00:17:52,713 --> 00:18:06,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to make certain decisions and I'm required to make those decisions by sharing the least amount of information possible, regardless of who I am making those decisions about and who I am informing.

112
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:11,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always have to keep that in the back of my mind because I deal with

113
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:23,941
[SPEAKER_02]: highly sensitive information to the point where the facts actually comes directly to me and doesn't go to a general delivery because I deal with people's medical providers.

114
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:29,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Member Reinfeld, I just saw you raise your hands.

115
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:32,584
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just, I'm curious, are you a mandated reporter?

116
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all those things.

117
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:35,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

118
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:40,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I am a mandated reporter as well.

119
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:53,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't, you know, civil rights hat doesn't, it doesn't, you don't get to take it off, you know, unfortunately you wear it you straightening it up in the morning before you leave the house so that it looks good and proper.

120
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:59,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and really the role is to be that mediator, right?

121
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're not at compliance, why aren't we at compliance?

122
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can we get there?

123
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can we do?

124
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's truly a partnership.

125
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's truly a collaborative effort because I do have to work.

126
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:16,019
[SPEAKER_02]: in partnership with the administrators at the school.

127
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:27,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned from them and I learned from the teachers and as a result, I then better understand what the need is and how I can be a support to them.

128
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:30,242
[SPEAKER_02]: My trainings are ongoing.

129
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:38,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the EOC and the DOL and the ADA,

130
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,386
[SPEAKER_02]: are all colliding as far as the allures go, right?

131
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:45,350
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of intersectionality that is happening at this current time.

132
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a training session for the EEOC last month, the exact same training that I took in July.

133
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:57,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, something miraculously has now changed.

134
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't stop the learning.

135
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:02,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It is ongoing.

136
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:06,128
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no one place to go and get the information.

137
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:20,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I am fortunate that I have, I had great trainers for when I first started my role so I have a network and if I am stuck, I can quickly access my network.

138
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,920
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is no such thing as knowing it all.

139
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:39,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many situations what might apply for Membo Olapode might apply very differently for Membo Reinfeld and then by the time I get to you Membo Russo, it's completely off the books because it no longer exists.

140
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:43,455
[SPEAKER_02]: A law changed somewhere and you didn't get the memo.

141
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,920
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it is, I'm dealing with life, right?

142
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're dealing with life, it is extremely fluid.

143
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:57,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the greatest things that you can bring to the role is your willingness to be flexible.

144
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:02,706
[SPEAKER_02]: A DEI practitioner and a civil rights expert, there is no end site.

145
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:07,669
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do our work because we're going to see the results of our work.

146
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we do our work because we're determined to continue to push for change, change that is needed on many different levels and change and support

147
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,030
[SPEAKER_02]: for all people.

148
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no equity if you don't have equality.

149
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:26,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that is often misunderstood.

150
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:46,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And my role is unique enough that it does allow me to have conversations with entities that would typically not be willing to hear what needs to be said, such as, there is a need for this training and I need you and your members to engage in this, right?

151
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,252
[SPEAKER_02]: If admin or management attempts to have that support, oh, it's a directive.

152
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:58,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this, you know, so this role is unique enough to allow for those types of relationship management.

153
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:01,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

154
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there are any more direct questions.

155
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:08,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You would like to ask you were worried about time.

156
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:20,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I was well groomed for this I came from supporting 6000 plus full time employees on my own so you know differences, different entities were in place all around.

157
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:30,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is, again, you don't look at what you can't do, you look at what do you have and what you have the ability, what can you make of it at this point in time?

158
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:34,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ability to prioritize is key.

159
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:38,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know what is your hot button and what you must deal with.

160
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:43,458
[SPEAKER_02]: When to use an email to say, hey, I got your voicemail, we'll get back to you in such and such time.

161
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:49,844
[SPEAKER_02]: them, where to go to find the resources, who to call if you're in the jam.

162
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:52,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things aren't necessarily written in the book.

163
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:57,447
[SPEAKER_02]: They come as part of doing this work on an ongoing basis.

164
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:03,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a civil rights person, you never say no, even if you might wonder, why on earth did this call come to me?

165
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:07,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the call came to you because somebody needed somebody to talk to.

166
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:11,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's a gentle handoff that you do, that's what you do.

167
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:16,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember receipts.

168
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:18,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

169
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:22,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that information about students.

170
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:30,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't assuming you did, but I also felt it was our responsibility to know that.

171
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel really much better knowing that.

172
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:35,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I greatly appreciate the clarity.

173
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:38,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you?

174
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:47,372
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to estimate, which after everything you just said, the answer is, it depends on the day, I'm sure, is the answer.

175
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:58,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But how much time are you spending on school-related, if you can come up with an average, which sounds like an impossible request.

176
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:17,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not so sure that I could say that it's an average, but what I can tell you is that I chatted with my colleague over at the school yesterday, and today I chatted with my same colleague over at the school, and we're only on Tuesday, and it's two different things.

177
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:21,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, yeah, it's two completely different things.

178
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:30,262
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that we were supposed to chat about yesterday, we chatted about, but something else was involved too that just came up.

179
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:59,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really, really difficult for me to give an estimate because, you know, chatting with my, you know, collaborative partner over there is very different from when I'm doing my research for what is needed based on documentation that somebody's medical provider has submitted, right, or conversations about, like, planning, you know, for an event that is about to happen.

180
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:09,320
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can safely say that at least once a week, fortunately or unfortunately, my partners hear from me.

181
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be anything.

182
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:15,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also resources for me that I need as well.

183
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:18,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, you know, I've got this grand idea.

184
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do this, this, and this.

185
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:22,566
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is there anybody that can help me with that?

186
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, it's two ways.

187
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a give and a take.

188
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:33,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And who do you have a specific collaborator at in the school system?

189
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:50,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually I would say that I have more day-to-day conversations with Janine over in HR, those are my convos, but they're my go-to people for certain things, right?

190
00:25:51,016 --> 00:26:03,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I could come across something and send it to our Director of Student Services, Joan, and sometimes I could actually need Joan's help in answering a question.

191
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:10,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, you know, I could be looking for the superintendent and the superintendent is dealing with something else.

192
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:15,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm reverting to either Dr. Cushing or Dr. Galluzzi.

193
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:24,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends on the actual nature of, you know, the reason for like my outrage.

194
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

195
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:45,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to ask if you can't do hours, is there a way to estimate what percentage of the time or what I'm trying to do, because we're being asked to put this into the school budget, which I think is a very fair request.

196
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:49,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And so trying to figure out, I know that we can't

197
00:26:50,947 --> 00:27:03,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But a value on this but to figure out in a proportionately and looking across the system at how this how this shakes out in terms of what time the staff would be spending.

198
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:21,282
[SPEAKER_06]: scrambling around to get answers versus you having answers more at the ready and just kind of the percentage or what this looks like if you know I think we are blessed to have a resource in house like this and.

199
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I would have to really think about it further because I would not want to provide you with misinformation.

200
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:32,966
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for example, the ADA, right?

201
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:36,749
[SPEAKER_02]: A request came through for an accommodation, right?

202
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That took about 10 to 15 minutes.

203
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Why exactly what the person needed, the doctor had written.

204
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:42,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

205
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,995
[SPEAKER_02]: You think you're all done and your file is closed.

206
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:46,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's not.

207
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:49,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to your two week check-in and all of a sudden,

208
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:58,563
[SPEAKER_02]: there are different things that have gone on with this person, this person is no longer on site, which means that when they return, you will now have to begin the process again.

209
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:08,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it is, it's difficult to say that it's 10% or it's 20% because I don't really, I don't really, you know, chart it in that manner.

210
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: There are standard check-ins that, you know, I will do.

211
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:31,397
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have, you know, a group of people, I will just, you know, make my one phone call and be on, you know, suck up a couple of hours if she needs time, get in my update on everybody and who needs what and how, you know, everything is going.

212
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:34,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are things that require, you know, on-site.

213
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, you know, every employee is entitled

214
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: to the opportunity to request a reasonable accommodation, that is the law, right?

215
00:28:42,462 --> 00:28:43,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So, guess what?

216
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:47,164
[SPEAKER_02]: People usually ask, oh, can you send the ADA paperwork?

217
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:48,544
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't work that way.

218
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:50,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I can't send it.

219
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:55,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to do my due diligence to ensure that I give you the opportunity for an interactive dialogue.

220
00:28:56,207 --> 00:29:06,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some interactive dialogues, just they don't end because people need more hand holding and others are more straightforward, but it doesn't end there.

221
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:10,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still open until all the information comes in.

222
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the information comes in and that's still not clear.

223
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:22,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hey, do me a favor, can you reach out to your doctor and let them know to expect a call from me or things of that nature.

224
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is the actual dialogue that takes place with the employee.

225
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:32,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I have to be cognizant that some of our employees are in collective bargaining units.

226
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people are offering me their lunch times to meet and their break times to meet, absolutely not.

227
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be said that the DEI director stopped you from having your lunch.

228
00:29:45,472 --> 00:29:50,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually meet during their periods, or at that time, I revert to what I called school time.

229
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:53,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I meet during the parameters of the school time.

230
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:56,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of my work day.

231
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:02,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is very, very difficult for me to say like, oh, it's 10%, 15%.

232
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, out of the blue, I've received a call from a parent.

233
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: who was having custody issues but from speaking with the parent I was able to help her understand that the real issue is not the school, the real issue is the fact that the address listed is not the address where the child lays their head, despite the very valid reasons.

234
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:32,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ask, how did you reach out to me?

235
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:34,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you reach out to me?

236
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,573
[SPEAKER_02]: There's somebody on the phone that's in crisis.

237
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:37,594
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

238
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:40,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You minimize, you mitigate the crisis.

239
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:52,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Another question, you mentioned having an idea and coming to discuss that.

240
00:30:54,443 --> 00:31:14,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, in the trying to understand what all of this is a resource for and is supporting what that means, what's the balance around things that you are responding to requests from within the school community versus bringing things to the attention versus just the routine follow-up?

241
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:19,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that there is definitely more on the response side.

242
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the sense I got, certainly.

243
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:33,646
[SPEAKER_02]: There is definitely more on the response side when you have employee to employee allegations that involve alleged violations of civil rights, right?

244
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:35,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is the civil rights officer?

245
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:37,653
[SPEAKER_02]: for the city of Medford.

246
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:43,676
[SPEAKER_02]: That is hands down who's involvement they're going to ask for, right?

247
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:50,079
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look at whether you're a school department, how is this- And I know HR wants that.

248
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran into Janine when I was on campus.

249
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

250
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,943
[SPEAKER_06]: There are these things that I cannot touch and I should not touch and we absolutely

251
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:00,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

252
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:04,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, I'm trying to be, you know, trying to be delicate.

253
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:04,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

254
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,947
[SPEAKER_02]: So hands down, I'm supporting 100%.

255
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:11,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is what the role calls for.

256
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,032
[SPEAKER_02]: You sort everything else out afterwards.

257
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:24,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sometimes in, you know, parents who are, whose interpretation of certain

258
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:42,420
[SPEAKER_02]: rules or certain decisions are slightly skewed, your role is to mitigate the issues so that there is clarity and then people have an understanding to move forward in the work.

259
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it might be teachers who think that they're being

260
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:57,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Treated differently, and it just takes having a conversation with a different entity for them to understand that you're not being treated differently.

261
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:03,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not being asked to do anything that is outside the scope of your job.

262
00:33:04,326 --> 00:33:18,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that that was kind of what I was getting at or wondering about at in terms of building capacity within the district because there is so much work we can do on so many of these fronts, whether it's a physical constraint a cultural constraint a

263
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:39,869
[SPEAKER_06]: situational something that arises in terms of being responsive to what's happening, but also building awareness of resources, of best practices, and all of that, both in terms of our administration, but also the staff and the employees more generally.

264
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:49,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we have an opportunity, as we say, we have an opportunity to work with Director Nwaje on what DEI looks like in our district.

265
00:33:49,592 --> 00:34:07,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering what that opportunity is and whether it's, you know, it is, no, it's really, this is about compliance or this is about the opportunity to do more and make our district a better, more welcoming, more compliant place, which I think is something we would all

266
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:18,212
[SPEAKER_06]: love to do and to have really built into that culture from the moment of onboarding, really from recruitment on.

267
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:32,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I smile because you mentioned recruitment and my collaborative partners on this call have entertained me and allowed me to

268
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:36,589
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bear apart and help support recruitment.

269
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:45,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently received an email out of the blue from, I don't know if it's a resident, but somebody who identified themselves as being a parent.

270
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:54,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're a Medford resident wanting to know what Medford Public Schools is doing as far as recruiting, you know, more diverse teachers.

271
00:34:55,138 --> 00:35:08,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully, because of the collaborative partnership that we have had, I feel confident in being able to draft some of the stuff that's already in the works and the stuff that's already being done.

272
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:13,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It is no single person's job.

273
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an ongoing job.

274
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I can say is that while she might want to build capacity

275
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:24,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not something that can easily be passed on.

276
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:32,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have the ability to do this day in day out because you need to know what toolbox you are opening to address.

277
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:35,769
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to weigh pros and you have to weigh cons.

278
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:42,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, you know, I don't want it to come off as, oh, this is knowledge that you can just

279
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:47,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send some, you know, somebody can go to something and then they'll be done.

280
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:52,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be the first one to tell you the mayor gets to review all the bills.

281
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:57,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in some training at least once a month about something.

282
00:35:58,187 --> 00:35:59,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I just sit there because

283
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:05,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over my head, and other times it's like, wait a second, they didn't say that the last time I was in.

284
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:19,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important, like, you have to know where to go for your civil rights trainings, where to go for your updated legal trainings, where to go for your ADA trainings, the difference between the title one and title two.

285
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,386
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, okay, what's the situation again?

286
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:25,287
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you were at a restaurant, right?

287
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:34,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that, you know, is a different impact than, you know, you were at a place of worship or you were at City Hall.

288
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes, you can build that capacity, but it will take time.

289
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a partnership in learning and there will be some growing pains.

290
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: and there will be some that you will lose, but through that loss will come the growth, right?

291
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an ongoing journey, no destination.

292
00:36:56,989 --> 00:36:57,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Ongoing.

293
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, member Rusev.

294
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:08,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so I appreciate, I especially like that last thing you said, that it's a journey, there's no destination.

295
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:11,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that sort of describes a lot of

296
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:13,497
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire point of education.

297
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:22,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking around to try and understand how other districts do this work in their own districts.

298
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:29,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, just like everything else in public schools, every district seems to have taken a different path.

299
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Since everybody started in a different place, that makes sense.

300
00:37:35,593 --> 00:37:41,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find it was hard to get a lot of information from districts for which I am sure there is stuff.

301
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:42,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I find nothing on Malden.

302
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,779
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no chance that Malden has nothing.

303
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Their website has nothing.

304
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:57,027
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I did find was in Watertown, they have a director of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in the public schools.

305
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:00,189
[SPEAKER_01]: In Arlington, they have

306
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:05,753
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a city director and, well, town.

307
00:38:06,913 --> 00:38:10,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have a director for the schools.

308
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:14,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forget the title of the other person that works there.

309
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:17,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Somerville, which, I mean, we're not Somerville.

310
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:19,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to have their money.

311
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:26,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually would, if you know what's going on in Somerville, I would love to hear a little more.

312
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,639
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if you don't.

313
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:29,852
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on me to go find out.

314
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:37,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have 11 FTEs in their Office of Equity and Excellence.

315
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first, I was like, that's a lot.

316
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, that's not a lot.

317
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,617
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because that means they might be actually getting to do the work.

318
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:52,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Each school building has a four to eight person committee of staff that's already in the building.

319
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Every building has an actual

320
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the title but a member of the that offices staff assigned to that building.

321
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:14,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the challenges, Shirley, is that when we talk about reading instruction, we can talk about outcomes.

322
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:15,615
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at scores.

323
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:21,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is relatively quantifiable.

324
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I think that a lot of the work you do, and I bet the work that's going on in these other districts, is also

325
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,447
[SPEAKER_01]: not terribly quantifiable.

326
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:44,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you have a specific problem in the student population you're trying to, or the staff that you're trying to address, if you can name the problem, you can determine, is it getting better?

327
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:49,541
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, it's probably a very challenging thing to quantify.

328
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,683
[SPEAKER_01]: As you said, it's the journey.

329
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:55,186
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I see

330
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:04,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, I mean that I wish I could find information other districts because I find it hard to believe that most of the districts don't have some initiatives.

331
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see a lot of staff and.

332
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:09,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And.

333
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

334
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:23,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wonder, you know, we are at a at a crossroads with our passage of the override.

335
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:31,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that that it's not as much money as everybody thinks it'll be gone before we can.

336
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:45,060
[SPEAKER_01]: link, but I am just trying to understand if having an additional, having an FTE at school focused only is something that makes sense.

337
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:55,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like that in Somerville and in Watertown, they don't mention the city in the school website, which I think is relatively normal.

338
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:59,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming on the city sides, they also have somebody.

339
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:14,061
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like that in Arlington, in their Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Justice, there's two people that are school employees, and there's the city person.

340
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:16,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all on the website like they're a team.

341
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:20,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's how I like to think of this stuff is team.

342
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:33,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm asking you your thoughts on us having our own FTE to be your colleague.

343
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:38,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, we're not talking about hiring.

344
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:45,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine if we were to allocate resources for an FTE, we would very much

345
00:41:46,368 --> 00:41:50,930
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have you involved in helping us know, well, what does the job description look like?

346
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we hire?

347
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:58,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, you, I mean, hopefully you would be involved in the actual hiring process.

348
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:02,456
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did mention

349
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:10,524
[SPEAKER_01]: recruitment, and that is something that has been, I'm pretty sure it's on the strategic plan.

350
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:26,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one of the, if it's not a current goal, it has been a goal, the superintendent, and it's, you know, and I've been to every one of these sessions at school committee conferences now for years, and there are many challenges.

351
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:30,288
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one of the,

352
00:42:32,256 --> 00:42:34,658
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those challenges can be solved if you don't invest.

353
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:39,462
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually costs money to go to places to recruit.

354
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:51,351
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just post it on Indeed or whatever the school-based websites are and think you're going to just... That's not how you actually get recruitment to happen.

355
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:54,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that's all we're doing, by the way.

356
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:55,114
[SPEAKER_01]: But

357
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:08,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Having somebody full-time to work on that initiative as well as other school-based initiatives around culture, I would like to hear your thoughts on that.

358
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:17,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And can I just jump in on that, that culture and retention, it's one thing to get people into the district, having them stay, just to be really explicit.

359
00:43:19,112 --> 00:43:21,153
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no belonging, that doesn't happen.

360
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:21,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

361
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:27,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So, 1st of all, I would like to say, yes, wish we had some of those money, right?

362
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:35,013
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had some of those money, much of what is needed would already be in place.

363
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally for a community this size, I believe we're about 65.

364
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:47,484
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand plus, we translate automatically into six different ethnic languages.

365
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:52,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make it clear that this is really a wish list.

366
00:43:53,465 --> 00:44:01,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Diversity, equity and inclusion, civil rights, equal opportunity, affirmative action, equity, belonging, justice, accessibility, whatever you call it.

367
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:07,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one group, one unit on behalf of a community.

368
00:44:08,725 --> 00:44:21,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whilst we might have a charter for the city side and a charter for the school committee side, the very idea that we're different sort of already starts to go against the real mission.

369
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:26,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The mission is equity for all, and we have to start from a place of equality.

370
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:31,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So, member Ruseau, I think it was Arlington, my colleague, Jill Harvey,

371
00:44:33,573 --> 00:44:39,277
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the model that you said that you favor, which is that there is an office, right?

372
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:41,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that office, there is a director.

373
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have a representative for the city.

374
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:46,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have a representative for the school.

375
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:49,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have a community engagement.

376
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:51,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have ADA.

377
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many aspects to the DEI role.

378
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one role.

379
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:04,008
[SPEAKER_02]: As in accounting, you have account payable, accounts receivable.

380
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:06,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It's broken out a lot more.

381
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:15,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see people that are listed specifically as ADA coordinators, they are well-versed in that role.

382
00:45:16,722 --> 00:45:19,064
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what regs they're applying.

383
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:21,507
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on top of that.

384
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:22,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

385
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes communities supplement by bringing in design experts to fulfill that role if you want to, you know, do a building redesign and things of that nature.

386
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:56,688
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also the other aspects that we don't really talk about, and that is the unfortunate aspect, the investigatory, the compliance aspect, who needs to respond to that, the grievance aspect, the complete and utter neutral zone.

387
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:06,376
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have DEI sitting in HR, it creates conflicts because HR laws and civil rights laws actually don't go hand in hand.

388
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:17,638
[SPEAKER_02]: There is sometimes intersectionality that is smooth and other times it is the law that is actually creating the disadvantage.

389
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:21,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to defer to the civil rights laws.

390
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know this when I first started.

391
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:37,374
[SPEAKER_02]: You learn this as you're doing the work because you are exposed and in communication with a broad base of professionals, legal experts in different aspects.

392
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:52,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I, I, I, you know, I would say if it was my wish list, I would say for the city of Medford from where I sit from the different communities that have been identified as living in Medford.

393
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a 1 unit.

394
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:57,953
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a 1 unit with someone that represents the school.

395
00:46:58,013 --> 00:46:59,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody that represents the city.

396
00:47:00,535 --> 00:47:05,579
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you need your investigatory unit that is able to go in there and handle.

397
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:14,467
[SPEAKER_02]: The investigations and the complaints, because they are the ones that are versed in that stuff.

398
00:47:14,988 --> 00:47:15,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

399
00:47:16,152 --> 00:47:19,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody knows that I'm a process police.

400
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:22,675
[SPEAKER_02]: ADA decisions aren't just pulled out of a hat by me.

401
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:23,836
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the process?

402
00:47:23,896 --> 00:47:25,177
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you have no process?

403
00:47:25,557 --> 00:47:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: We will create one.

404
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:32,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the process that we will go with for everybody who applies for one, regardless of who that person is.

405
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: These are federal laws.

406
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:37,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal laws require that you are able to show an established process.

407
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:46,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it very much is always you must always remember that compliance is the key as you move forward.

408
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:53,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we don't have some of those money, but if we did, I would take some of those money and, you know.

409
00:47:54,111 --> 00:48:05,738
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome the opportunity to create a unit where people who live, work, do business and study in Medford could go and feel supported.

410
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:18,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are times when people need the DEI person, but they feel more supported from the ADA person, so they go there, but it doesn't matter because it's the same unit and the person gets served.

411
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about all the community members

412
00:48:21,206 --> 00:48:23,527
[SPEAKER_02]: who require the extra support.

413
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:28,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra support is not just about translating information.

414
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:33,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Much of what is translated is not even understood because it's above the ninth grade.

415
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:39,694
[SPEAKER_02]: But just even the extra support of, okay, sit in front of the computer and I will sit next to you.

416
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:45,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That could all be done.

417
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:49,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The support and the, oh yes, I'm going to be at that meeting.

418
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you come to that meeting?

419
00:48:50,942 --> 00:48:52,944
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm there, all right, we'll all go together.

420
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:55,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and you'll get your neighbor to come as well because they're a child.

421
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:57,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that expansion.

422
00:48:58,588 --> 00:49:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: An office like that would help.

423
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:07,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Rousseau, I have something I want to add.

424
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:10,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Member Rousseau and Member Reinfeld both put their hands up, so I'll let them.

425
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:12,066
[SPEAKER_00]: My hand's down.

426
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious what processes exist.

427
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know whether the end of this sentence is in our community or in our schools.

428
00:49:24,425 --> 00:49:27,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm interested particularly in our schools.

429
00:49:28,626 --> 00:49:35,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your support of DEI efforts in the school and ADA efforts in the school, is that to help us develop the systems and processes we need?

430
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have those in place?

431
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we in this work?

432
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:52,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what I will say is that the process was created to avert what was about to happen because decisions were made prior to arrival.

433
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:56,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no process to support those decisions.

434
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:59,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when an employee reached out to me.

435
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:01,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not move forward.

436
00:50:02,016 --> 00:50:03,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Process had to be created.

437
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:16,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not you've been given a hammer, you have to build that house because you need to be able to show that you have a set process that you follow for all individuals.

438
00:50:17,145 --> 00:50:19,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Without equality, there is no equity.

439
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:25,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Equity is a figment of many people's imaginations because we're not even at a foundation of equality yet.

440
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:36,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Right so that process was created mimic the process that I had from the state and it includes what a lot of times people forget.

441
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:42,534
[SPEAKER_02]: The appeals process yes, we hope that people accept our decisions, but.

442
00:50:43,018 --> 00:50:49,363
[SPEAKER_02]: when people choose not to accept our decisions, we are required to clearly spell out their appeals process.

443
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:56,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like that, updates to policies, those are shared.

444
00:50:56,109 --> 00:51:01,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The school policies will always look different because of the purview, but they should never clash.

445
00:51:01,714 --> 00:51:03,055
[SPEAKER_02]: They should never oppose.

446
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:07,299
[SPEAKER_02]: They should always be in some sort of alignment or parallel.

447
00:51:07,919 --> 00:51:08,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

448
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:11,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like the notice of non-discrimination.

449
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:14,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a public notice that I'm required to post.

450
00:51:14,063 --> 00:51:16,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just gets posted up in the school.

451
00:51:16,184 --> 00:51:18,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter whether it's the school department.

452
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:20,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't discriminate.

453
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:21,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

454
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:21,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

455
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And it spells out.

456
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:25,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like that.

457
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Updated postings that I get from the EEOC.

458
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:31,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't keep that to myself.

459
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:36,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I share that with my colleagues because some of it may actually pertain to them.

460
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:58,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I have, I think, poor Joan, I think you've been hit with my information that I've received from one of my magazines, whether it's the federal government looking at something as to why there's a shortage of special education teachers, which I don't understand why they don't look at that 15, 20 years ago, but that's just me.

461
00:52:00,288 --> 00:52:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: To hey, did you know that they're looking at there's a case about an IP and stuff like that.

462
00:52:07,595 --> 00:52:10,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sometimes it's just information sharing.

463
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:16,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if I can.

464
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:19,231
[SPEAKER_00]: comment on this as well.

465
00:52:19,251 --> 00:52:22,253
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that member Rousseau mentioned that I think you've kind of illustrated for us.

466
00:52:22,393 --> 00:52:25,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's also, let me just go through my notes here so I don't forget.

467
00:52:25,795 --> 00:52:37,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think that there is a difficulty in quantifying the actual work that's being done day to day because these instances of need are coming up, you know, as we know, just situationally, right?

468
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:38,724
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time, right?

469
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:46,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's the citywide want to push these initiatives forward because of the benefit of having them in place and the schools doing the same.

470
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:47,770
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about

471
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:57,098
[SPEAKER_00]: one-on-one meetings, HR questions, crisis management, ADA compliance and DEI protocol compliance, those things are very much situational.

472
00:52:57,118 --> 00:53:02,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's difficult to determine how we are supporting students because they come up as they come up.

473
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:06,507
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think ultimately what you're talking about is a culture shift, right?

474
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:12,512
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only having someone on the city side or the school side or both that's there to support in all these

475
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:35,989
[SPEAKER_00]: instances and endeavors, but also how are we supporting the staff, the families, everyone involved in the education system here in Medford, and how are we actually making it so that everyone feels more informed about these questions so that we don't automatically need to look to the one person in the department as of, you know, with a city that has a limited amount of money right now, comparatively to Somerville that has 11 people in their office, right?

476
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:52,391
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always have to look directly to the head of the department to say can you please offer your expertise, it's always wished for wanted and we know we're seeing the benefits of having that but I think we want to continue to work towards making sure that as many people in the district are informed about these things so that they feel

477
00:53:52,831 --> 00:54:07,181
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-informed or not experts, of course, but they feel like they're as compliant as they can be with their limited understanding so that we're making sure that the culture around Medford and the students is consistent with the state suggestions and what you know as an expert in this field.

478
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:15,367
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to acknowledge the impact that's having, and I think the intentionality that we want to continue to have for the students.

479
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:20,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one other question was, and I think that it's been touched upon a little bit,

480
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:35,740
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going into conversations, both at the school, regarding any of the hats that you're wearing, do you find that there are some stop gaps with the kind of school component of it?

481
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that there are some needs of students and families that are a little different than the city side, potentially.

482
00:54:40,303 --> 00:54:49,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you find there are moments where you say, I need a little more time than I may, if it was a city question, because the compliance questions differ with younger people.

483
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:49,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?

484
00:54:50,643 --> 00:54:51,424
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

485
00:54:51,504 --> 00:54:58,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for a point of clarification, I don't meet with students.

486
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:05,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, more so like meeting with like teachers or other personnel working with students, I should say.

487
00:55:05,412 --> 00:55:05,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

488
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:06,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

489
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:12,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm asked the question, it really the hat that I wear is actually dependent on the question.

490
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I get more direct questions about ADA.

491
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:19,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's easy to just wear that hat.

492
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:31,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I get more requests to come in and explain a little bit more or discuss more about my role so that folks have a better understanding.

493
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take off the ADA hat and I put the DEI hat on.

494
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:45,138
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't answer any legal issues because the attorney that I work with for the school is different from the attorneys that I would work with on the city side.

495
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:47,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't discuss discipline.

496
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:55,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes in conversation, people will just out of human nature segue into a venting session.

497
00:55:56,302 --> 00:56:01,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to listen to you vent, but I do not overrule decisions that have already been made.

498
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:13,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well known that the ADA request for a reasonable accommodation is used by many people, not in the city of Medford, just people in general to overcome barriers to performance.

499
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:16,869
[SPEAKER_02]: 2, completely different things, right?

500
00:56:17,129 --> 00:56:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get involved in in your discipline.

501
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:29,115
[SPEAKER_02]: You my, my involvement is in your union contracts to make sure that you don't have gender binding terminology.

502
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Please start getting rid of all these.

503
00:56:31,336 --> 00:56:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Men women should say employee.

504
00:56:35,066 --> 00:56:47,795
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it as neutral as possible so that folks can feel welcome because you do have folks that are gender non-conforming and are stuck in a union that makes them choose, right?

505
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:50,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really just advisory.

506
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:55,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's housekeeping and it should be taking place before contracts go to negotiations.

507
00:56:57,902 --> 00:57:00,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, what's the other thing?

508
00:57:00,604 --> 00:57:04,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say something else, but it just escaped my mind.

509
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:11,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you a moment to think of that.

510
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,618
[SPEAKER_01]: You said something really important just now that also...

511
00:57:15,629 --> 00:57:24,614
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether we have a DEI director or whatever the title ends up being in the schools, I think it's not, this is hardly the first time this has been a conversation.

512
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:35,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize that my colleagues here are, my school committee colleagues here are new, but after seven years, I can say that this has been a conversation for seven years.

513
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:37,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know,

514
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:58,292
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I struggle with is that, as a school committee member and who very much cares about the culture, which when I say culture, I mean definitely employees and students and families, you know, there's a culture that doesn't go out.

515
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:00,074
[SPEAKER_01]: from the individual.

516
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:09,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will, I mean, I'm sure we had passed policies that require significant amounts of work.

517
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:14,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like literally when I was arriving, there were major culture challenges and a culture study.

518
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:17,543
[SPEAKER_01]: That was seven years ago.

519
00:58:18,023 --> 00:58:26,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And the recommendations of those kinds of things are usually actionable.

520
00:58:28,986 --> 00:58:35,669
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are also not actionable by just anyone.

521
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:49,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Your training that you're going through continuously is the kind of stuff where, as much as I admire all of the administrators on this call, they're not in training all day.

522
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:52,037
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were, they wouldn't be able to do any of their other work.

523
00:58:55,342 --> 00:59:02,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see our ability to execute on big culture changes across the system.

524
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:10,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we will have an individual, a new principal, for instance, who's focused on the culture, for instance, of the high school.

525
00:59:11,106 --> 00:59:16,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And she makes that a priority, which, I mean, she doesn't work in a silo.

526
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:19,389
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a boss, and I'm sure they've talked about it.

527
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:39,877
[SPEAKER_01]: When the school committee decides we want to pass a new policy or allocate money to accomplish something, which we have done several times, actually, on the last few years, getting it done, in my mind, is not because nobody is interested in getting it done.

528
00:59:40,057 --> 00:59:42,018
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's not somebody's full-time job.

529
00:59:46,109 --> 00:59:54,014
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these things require continuous focus and the administrators on this call, there's no such thing as continuous focus for them.

530
00:59:54,174 --> 01:00:06,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Their day is sort of like what you described, like a call comes in and there's an emergency here and there's something else going on over there and they have to drop everything and go.

531
01:00:06,963 --> 01:00:14,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on top of their very lengthy list of responsibilities that have nothing to do necessarily with this.

532
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:38,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I have felt very hamstrung as a school committee member in our ability to execute on things around this because I feel inhibited myself, not by other people, in just highly work on to our administrators that I don't want people working 16 hours a day, seven days a week.

533
01:00:39,744 --> 01:00:43,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a human being and I think everybody here is a human being and I don't think that's right.

534
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:48,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I hold back on things that I think are important.

535
01:00:48,631 --> 01:01:00,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I have told other people, my list of policies and resolutions that I have written over the years that have not been submitted is now just pages long, fully written.

536
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:00,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just

537
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:03,072
[SPEAKER_01]: put them on the next agenda.

538
01:01:04,573 --> 01:01:15,040
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that there's only so many hours in the day, and most of those things of course are not related to what we're talking about but some of them are, and I don't want to.

539
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:24,081
[SPEAKER_01]: just assume that there's going to be room in somebody's day who already, I mean, Joan, you're still at the office.

540
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:26,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Maurice, you're still at the office.

541
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:28,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne's at the office.

542
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:31,743
[SPEAKER_01]: It is six o'clock, and I don't think you all arrived at 11.

543
01:01:32,964 --> 01:01:39,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, from a caring,

544
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:44,652
[SPEAKER_01]: human perspective really feel like we need additional staff.

545
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:51,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they sit, who they report to isn't the most important thing to me.

546
01:01:51,997 --> 01:02:04,904
[SPEAKER_01]: However, being able to have the school committee direct what is going to happen, not how it's going to happen, that's execution, but what's going to happen and what the priorities are going to be is really important.

547
01:02:05,044 --> 01:02:06,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do feel that

548
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:14,021
[SPEAKER_01]: The school committee, you know, under no circumstances has authority over you, and we shouldn't.

549
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:15,722
[SPEAKER_01]: You work for the mayor.

550
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:21,784
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, it has nothing to do with you, that statement.

551
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:35,769
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if we pass a resolution telling you to go off and spend the next three months doing something in the schools, fine, we can write that resolution and we can pass it, but you work for the mayor who will decide what you're actually gonna do, not us.

552
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:55,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of this is just like, in many communities authority in the school committee is often ceded to city councils and mayors and town committees and whoever the other,

553
01:02:56,889 --> 01:03:04,033
[SPEAKER_01]: the person who, the city manager, a lot of school committees cede their authority and just don't bat an eyelash.

554
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:12,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they need to do something, they don't have their authority available to them to actually do their job.

555
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:24,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what worries me about just having you do more of the work for us, rather than us having somebody we can

556
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:40,865
[SPEAKER_01]: We can point them in the direction we want them to go, and they're not, you know, they don't have to deal with an issue with the fire department or the police department or DPW like they're none of those issues will ever have anything to do with the work that they're doing in the schools.

557
01:03:46,530 --> 01:04:07,627
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has always been my concern since the very first time we started talking about this at school committee is that I want, we're elected to accomplish goals and so is the mayor, but she's elected to, you know, and your point though that the city and the schools and like we're a community is,

558
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:20,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, but, not and, I agree, but Medford has transitioned a lot in the last seven years, a lot.

559
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:23,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like

560
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:32,005
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council knows what their actual legal authority is, the mayor knows, the school committee knows.

561
01:04:32,906 --> 01:04:39,313
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was on, it was, nobody knew what, I mean, you know, everybody was just in each other's business.

562
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:42,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody let everybody be in everybody's business.

563
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,496
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just made things such a mess.

564
01:04:47,036 --> 01:04:53,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And city council was talking about the schools, and nobody could do anything because nobody knew who was responsible.

565
01:04:54,699 --> 01:05:00,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of have become a bit rigid in that I want to

566
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:15,561
[SPEAKER_01]: be very thoughtful if we cede responsibility, because I have seen that when I joined the school committee where it was like, wait, is the city council still on the school committee, the members that have been on the school committee?

567
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:19,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they still actually here and not on city council?

568
01:05:20,905 --> 01:05:29,311
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a transitionary period for Medford, and I think that's my discomfort.

569
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:44,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, if it's okay, I'd just like to respond to that.

570
01:05:44,203 --> 01:05:50,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk about culture shift and, you know, this is where the culture shift really does begin, right?

571
01:05:50,687 --> 01:05:56,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It is about, are we brave enough to do what we have not done before?

572
01:05:58,052 --> 01:06:03,656
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is that this work, you cannot dictate this work, this work dictates itself.

573
01:06:04,676 --> 01:06:15,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I'm saying that is because at 11 o'clock today, you know, whilst we're all in our offices, I realized, oh my goodness, I forgot to order the plates for the event tomorrow.

574
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,206
[SPEAKER_02]: People will be eating off napkins.

575
01:06:18,386 --> 01:06:22,089
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this, it dictates itself.

576
01:06:24,008 --> 01:06:29,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't so much look at it as guiding or directing the work.

577
01:06:30,012 --> 01:06:31,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is the need?

578
01:06:32,334 --> 01:06:39,539
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have consultants and people go into spaces, what you get is a snapshot of a report.

579
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:42,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody is in that space for six to nine months.

580
01:06:44,722 --> 01:06:48,385
[SPEAKER_02]: A snapshot of a report for a moment in time.

581
01:06:48,845 --> 01:06:50,426
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

582
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what you get.

583
01:06:54,243 --> 01:07:01,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally have never found that to be the most useful way of getting information.

584
01:07:03,508 --> 01:07:10,492
[SPEAKER_02]: How much time do respondents of the surveys put in if no relationship has been built?

585
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:14,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do they go to to answer questions?

586
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm really talking with my DEI hat on.

587
01:07:21,348 --> 01:07:27,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2024 and we still have people who choose not to respond to the question, are you a veteran?

588
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:29,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the stigma.

589
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:33,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that sink in, right?

590
01:07:34,474 --> 01:07:43,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So, remember Ruseau, I can say that your points are definitely valid and your fears are valid, I hear them.

591
01:07:45,913 --> 01:07:52,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would simply ask for just a little bit of trust so that we can do this the right way.

592
01:07:53,498 --> 01:08:00,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end, it will benefit and impact our students and we want it to be better.

593
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:11,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The relationship I have now with my collaborative partners is far different from the relationship that I had when I first started.

594
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:19,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't March 2022, boom, just pick up the phone, call Suzanne, call Joan.

595
01:08:19,924 --> 01:08:27,310
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really a trusted relationship that I hope I don't misspeak by saying I have earned this.

596
01:08:30,332 --> 01:08:40,160
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to have some of the conversations that I have with them so that we can actually resolve issues, we can co-train, we can collaborate,

597
01:08:41,345 --> 01:08:43,428
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a huge investment of trust.

598
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:57,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really, I don't really know how else, how else to put it, except for to say I'm sorry I was not there from the beginning and I don't know how to.

599
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,081
[SPEAKER_02]: make that better.

600
01:08:59,722 --> 01:09:05,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But you cannot continue to move forward with a fragmented approach.

601
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not what DEI is.

602
01:09:07,912 --> 01:09:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does create more issues down the road.

603
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:15,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it difficult for people like me, who we are on the tail end.

604
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:16,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not the newbies.

605
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:19,344
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not what we fought for.

606
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not what we envisioned.

607
01:09:21,764 --> 01:09:27,206
[SPEAKER_02]: We have newcomers coming into our schools at an alarming rate.

608
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:31,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a training today, the 2020 census.

609
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Every 34 seconds, a new immigrant enters America.

610
01:09:36,188 --> 01:09:39,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what the 2020 census reads.

611
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:46,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need this, you know, tears are for those who don't have a voice.

612
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to show that collaboration.

613
01:09:51,089 --> 01:09:52,350
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the true meaning.

614
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about authenticity, that is the true meaning.

615
01:09:58,155 --> 01:10:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that collaboration is what is needed.

616
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:11,607
[SPEAKER_02]: When things are destabilized on the highest political platform, the school is the only safe place that some of our students have.

617
01:10:13,857 --> 01:10:22,140
[SPEAKER_02]: and that collaboration and that partnership is needed because that says that we will not let you go because we are taking a holistic approach.

618
01:10:25,762 --> 01:10:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: The meals that are served, those meals are served as a result of the Civil Rights Act.

619
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:38,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Meals didn't just come to pass that school will have free meals.

620
01:10:39,408 --> 01:10:42,929
[SPEAKER_02]: McKinley-Vento, that is because of the Civil Rights Act.

621
01:10:44,764 --> 01:10:56,391
[SPEAKER_02]: If people did not march and people did not kneel, we would have students that would not be educated today as a result of DV, because districts would fight about who's going to transport them.

622
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:03,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

623
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:06,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Superintendent, I think you might have wanted to add something.

624
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:07,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you an opportunity to say.

625
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:09,602
[SPEAKER_00]: at your piece.

626
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:10,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

627
01:11:10,722 --> 01:11:11,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

628
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:17,464
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could see on my little notebook, I was just jotting a few things down.

629
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:29,406
[SPEAKER_05]: But as Francis was sharing, what I wrote down was the word collaboration, which I believe strongly in and is part of my core values.

630
01:11:31,147 --> 01:11:33,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Francis as a true collaborator.

631
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:37,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And when there is a challenge or a question,

632
01:11:38,888 --> 01:11:58,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for a quick consult, it's wonderful and refreshing to know that you just have to pick up the phone and you can collaborate with a colleague down the street at City Hall to say, you know, this is something from your area of expertise, could you provide a little feedback?

633
01:11:58,742 --> 01:12:05,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that different members of our team for different pieces do consult and collaborate with Francis.

634
01:12:07,372 --> 01:12:13,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as she was trying to quantify, and even myself, I was like, oh, it's, you know.

635
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:22,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a quiet week and there could be a week where she's on speed dial because it could be something that's pressing.

636
01:12:22,352 --> 01:12:27,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you said, Member Olapade, certain things are situational.

637
01:12:29,134 --> 01:12:37,197
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone gets injured unexpectedly or something were to happen and there is a major ADA need,

638
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we have an expert in that area that we could just call, consult, collaborate, and guide the individual to go and meet with Francis, or Francis would schedule to meet with the staff person and, you know, provide the official ADA support that needs to be given.

639
01:12:58,271 --> 01:13:02,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I truly do see this partnership as a collaboration.

640
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:14,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to thank Frances for bringing her expertise and professionalism to the table all the time to support us in different capacities.

641
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:23,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it's just asking for an additional colleague to be part of the process, even when we've done select interviews.

642
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:29,688
[SPEAKER_05]: our own Will Piposelli, who's our new comms director.

643
01:13:30,289 --> 01:13:39,994
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were looking into bringing on a new comms director and we partnered and collaborated with Francis at City Hall,

644
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:47,342
[SPEAKER_05]: and saying, you know, we want to, you know, interview candidates and really bring on someone who was going to be the best match for us.

645
01:13:48,022 --> 01:13:51,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And that best person was in the person of Will Pippaselli.

646
01:13:51,744 --> 01:14:04,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just an example though, of having an additional voice at the table, um, where it was, um, again, an opportunity for us to collaborate and, um,

647
01:14:05,703 --> 01:14:07,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't, we weren't mandated to do it.

648
01:14:07,745 --> 01:14:19,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't necessary, but again, through the relationship that has built over the years and talking with her and saying, would she like to partner with us for this particular role?

649
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:29,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Frances has always said, yes, she was willing to lend her expertise and come to the table and help us find the best individual for the job.

650
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:40,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to restate that we are truly appreciative as a district of the partnership with Francis and

651
01:14:42,651 --> 01:14:49,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I know there are DEI directors and there are different models which member Rousseau shared from many other communities.

652
01:14:51,199 --> 01:15:01,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people want to collaborate and work in a true collaborative, in a true partnership and others sometimes it's just not a match.

653
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:06,172
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do feel in this particular context where Medford is concerned,

654
01:15:07,413 --> 01:15:28,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I say to you as the committee, our partnership, our collaboration with Francis, who is currently housed at the city of Medford in the DEI, ADA, I can't remember all the other letters you said, EEOC, there were a lot of letters, alphabet soup, but I loved all of it.

655
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:32,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I truly can say that the collaboration that we have right now

656
01:15:33,573 --> 01:15:38,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a true collaboration and it is worth the investment.

657
01:15:39,135 --> 01:16:02,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would qualify it by saying it's in the person of Frances, who has really partnered so well with special education, with Suzanne in academics and instruction, with Peter in our operational realm, with human resources, with Janine, like really collaborating with the entire team and working with principals

658
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:18,393
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's going to the Roberts and supporting DEI initiatives on a district level or at some of the particular schools where they've asked to collaborate, can we have the DEI director?

659
01:16:18,493 --> 01:16:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And we say, yes, we'll let her know.

660
01:16:20,714 --> 01:16:27,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And Frances has always said she's more than willing to collaborate with us.

661
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:31,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And she has collaborated on principal interviews.

662
01:16:32,641 --> 01:16:35,543
[SPEAKER_05]: and just lent her expertise.

663
01:16:35,643 --> 01:16:37,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a true collaboration.

664
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:44,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the caution that the committee is expressing.

665
01:16:45,129 --> 01:16:54,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this context, I can say, rest assured, in the person of Frances, we do have a true collaboration.

666
01:16:54,775 --> 01:16:56,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyone in the team

667
01:16:58,177 --> 01:17:14,111
[SPEAKER_05]: on the team would, I think they would confirm and say that it's how she brings herself to the work that she has really fostered and nurtured the relationship that we all have now.

668
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:16,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to add those comments.

669
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:17,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

670
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:22,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

671
01:17:25,194 --> 01:17:33,039
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that because we're starting to come down to the end time here, I'm not sure if anyone else has any other further comments that they want to just add as additional.

672
01:17:33,079 --> 01:17:38,882
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any questions or comments coming from the public, it seems on my end.

673
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:43,745
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to open the floor one more time before we kind of finish.

674
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,107
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has anything else they'd like to ask or add.

675
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:51,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we still have our director here who can offer her understanding of the situation.

676
01:17:55,776 --> 01:17:56,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, over to yourself.

677
01:17:57,657 --> 01:17:58,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

678
01:18:00,498 --> 01:18:06,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, I hope there will never be an end to the collaboration.

679
01:18:06,821 --> 01:18:08,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be very upset by that.

680
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:17,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And I certainly want to make sure that we find a way to codify the relationship.

681
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:29,974
[SPEAKER_01]: with the director and the schools, which I think is sort of the principle point of the resolution.

682
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:42,400
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly want to codify, which is why I offered my motion that codified it through December 31st, so we could stop running in circles in that meeting, because we were going in circles.

683
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:46,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's one thing though that,

684
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:53,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I want to have that I don't think we can have with Frances.

685
01:18:55,248 --> 01:18:58,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because of Frances, to be clear, but because she works for the city.

686
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:07,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I want somebody interacting with the students directly, and being able to look at student records, and being able to look at discipline issues, and looking at,

687
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:20,912
[SPEAKER_01]: student complaints about staff and staff complaints about students and doing things that at the moment are definitely outside of the

688
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:26,368
[SPEAKER_01]: the responsibilities as I'm taking 1,000 notes.

689
01:19:26,749 --> 01:19:33,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, I think, is very much that's central administration in the public schools' job.

690
01:19:34,512 --> 01:19:36,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want that.

691
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:45,377
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also don't want, not because of who the director is, but because of the bandwidth requirements.

692
01:19:45,658 --> 01:19:49,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if that is to happen, the bandwidth requirements are

693
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,440
[SPEAKER_01]: are massive.

694
01:19:51,780 --> 01:20:05,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do not think that one human being could do both of the jobs, the job that's being done today and the job that I want to see happen.

695
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:14,486
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also do not want Director Nwaje to not be a part of that.

696
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:19,947
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, creating a professional community

697
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it's called in education?

698
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,293
[SPEAKER_01]: The professional, yeah, thank you.

699
01:20:26,594 --> 01:20:28,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Learning communities, PLCs.

700
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:31,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's what I'm talking about, yeah.

701
01:20:33,177 --> 01:20:43,882
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, creating a PLC is something that I know you all talk about and school committee conferences talk about and many different articles that get forward to school committee members talk about.

702
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:49,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And having a person on both sides

703
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,520
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides is probably the wrong choice of words.

704
01:20:52,841 --> 01:21:09,284
[SPEAKER_01]: But having two people creates a heck of a lot more opportunity for the sharing of knowledge and the training and the whole bouncing thoughts and ideas off of each other with enough similarities.

705
01:21:09,345 --> 01:21:13,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if similarities and backgrounds would be a reality, but I would want

706
01:21:15,726 --> 01:21:23,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It to be a collaborative process to create a job description for a school based EI director, which would or whatever the title would be.

707
01:21:24,569 --> 01:21:28,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that job description, I would want it to include.

708
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,811
[SPEAKER_01]: That this is a colleague of.

709
01:21:32,227 --> 01:21:48,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Director noisier is, again I don't remember your whole title but that this is not a standalone position that sort of like Arlington that these are two folks that are working together and allowing for the school side person to.

710
01:21:50,051 --> 01:22:01,982
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to dig into discipline stuff and the kinds of issues that I think are really important to the school committee and I know to the administration and everybody.

711
01:22:03,123 --> 01:22:08,047
[SPEAKER_01]: But when there's a crisis in a city department, that's not going to affect that person.

712
01:22:08,087 --> 01:22:10,109
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still doing whatever it is.

713
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,195
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I am.

714
01:22:15,215 --> 01:22:27,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like on the floor of the school committee on whatever day it was, it's not the best environment for this kind of a conversation, frankly.

715
01:22:28,582 --> 01:22:32,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I don't think most of us had time to think about and prepare for that conversation.

716
01:22:33,025 --> 01:22:37,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm greatly appreciative of everybody who's here and everything that's been said.

717
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:46,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope that there has never been a moment where anybody thought I wasn't appreciative of all the work of Director Nwaje, because that's definitely not true.

718
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:52,386
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a requirement to send back a recommendation of some sort.

719
01:22:53,747 --> 01:22:56,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on the motion that was made by whoever made it.

720
01:22:58,091 --> 01:23:09,139
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm just going to make this motion, which is still semi vague purpose that we send a recommendation to the full committee that a new.

721
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:23,672
[SPEAKER_01]: DEI-like director position be created in the public schools and that the job description will include that this is a colleague of and work in collaboration with the director

722
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:27,807
[SPEAKER_01]: the full title in the city.

723
01:23:28,447 --> 01:23:38,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also do think that the collaboration, you know, one of the things we were talking about in the meeting was the compensation part of the stipend part.

724
01:23:38,574 --> 01:23:43,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it does make sense now that I have, I actually have an understanding of what the director does.

725
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:50,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had, you know, cursory understanding, but that that seems like an appropriate

726
01:23:51,303 --> 01:23:54,866
[SPEAKER_01]: continuation to have that stipend be a part of the school budget.

727
01:23:56,508 --> 01:24:08,038
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things, I'm a software developer by training and there's this common mistake made in management where you will add more developers to get a project done sooner.

728
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:12,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody remembers that the communication costs are exponential.

729
01:24:14,204 --> 01:24:20,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you double the developers, you've not doubled the communication requirements, you've quadrupled it.

730
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:24,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I don't want us to make that mistake.

731
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:31,560
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual communication work that Francis would have to do with a new position is real work.

732
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,221
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be compensated.

733
01:24:33,241 --> 01:24:38,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that I think communication would be the only work.

734
01:24:39,486 --> 01:24:41,208
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of where I am right now.

735
01:24:42,489 --> 01:24:46,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that we don't just have to keep re-meeting in this subcommittee.

736
01:24:47,093 --> 01:24:49,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's my recommendation.

737
01:24:49,515 --> 01:24:53,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the full writing up of that, but that's why it's for coordinating.

738
01:24:57,011 --> 01:25:01,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think the thing when you saw me go, is this the right resolution for right now?

739
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:11,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It was me saying, is this, we cannot rely on Frances to do all of this work, but we can't have her not do this work either.

740
01:25:11,259 --> 01:25:13,720
[SPEAKER_06]: This collaboration is so important.

741
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:23,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, I put my hat on of going, I went to the strategic plan and I look at all of these objectives and initiatives and,

742
01:25:24,406 --> 01:25:35,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Only some of them are covered, I know they're they're baked into a lot of what we do as a district, but to really put that front and center, understanding who is responsible for these things.

743
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:42,227
[SPEAKER_06]: in many of these instances, is this a consultation or is this a responsibility?

744
01:25:42,307 --> 01:25:54,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would like to see these are the responsibilities within the district in doing this work and how that interfaces with this valuable collaboration.

745
01:25:55,558 --> 01:26:03,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do think extending the partnership, the collaboration makes sense and

746
01:26:05,524 --> 01:26:12,672
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it mean to take it to the next level of what this looks like on the ground and with the students?

747
01:26:12,932 --> 01:26:13,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I would support that.

748
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:45,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Clarify, so is the suggestion from you members, so I know you're kind of still working on the language to bring back to the larger committee, the suggestion or recommendation that we start the conversation about having a new personnel come into the schools and acting in that role while also continuing the extensive collaboration that we've been seeing thus far for Miss Nwaje and also including the stipend we discussed at the November 4th meeting and continuing that as well.

749
01:26:47,284 --> 01:26:50,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, I think I've got enough of it written down to read it.

750
01:26:50,446 --> 01:26:55,930
[SPEAKER_06]: To continue to extend the stipend through the end of this fiscal year.

751
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:59,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's already, that's already.

752
01:27:00,493 --> 01:27:11,960
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we had approved this through the end of the calendar year, but to move into the fiscal year to maintain the full collaboration at this level.

753
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we have a sense of

754
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:17,210
[SPEAKER_06]: what this means in practice.

755
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:22,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read the motion.

756
01:27:24,054 --> 01:27:35,300
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to recommend that Medford Public Schools create a new job description for a school-based DEI director that will work in collaboration with the city DEI director, period.

757
01:27:38,642 --> 01:27:41,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Further, the schools will provide an annual stipend

758
01:27:45,555 --> 01:27:54,000
[SPEAKER_01]: to the city DEI director to compensate for the collaboration and communication with the school department.

759
01:27:55,361 --> 01:27:59,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's, you know, Frances has not just communicated.

760
01:27:59,824 --> 01:28:04,907
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had a new DEI director tomorrow, she's not going to just communicate with that person.

761
01:28:05,528 --> 01:28:09,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said collaboration and communication with the school department.

762
01:28:10,931 --> 01:28:13,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And further,

763
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:19,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the word further, because it's like another deal with the fact that it doesn't make sense in English.

764
01:28:20,499 --> 01:28:36,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Further, the, Maurice, should I put the superintendent or should I say the director of finance should make a recommendation on the appropriate stipend amount?

765
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:40,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had a number that we were just like, what did we pay for the,

766
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:44,356
[SPEAKER_06]: The consolidation on building on me, right.

767
01:28:44,556 --> 01:28:56,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and those are apples and oranges, and I don't think that whatever we were paying that makes me that was the number I just used in the meeting because I wanted something to happen immediately.

768
01:28:57,468 --> 01:29:03,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I mean I didn't have time to do research as we were live on TV, but.

769
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:09,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather I have you assigned to do that, or should I just have the director of finance?

770
01:29:10,552 --> 01:29:16,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have it as me, but I always do it in consultation when it comes to finances.

771
01:29:18,642 --> 01:29:23,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And then working with the team, trying to quantify

772
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:29,172
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, it's hard to do that because things fluctuate.

773
01:29:29,753 --> 01:29:32,434
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can put both.

774
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:35,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm open to it, but I will consult with them.

775
01:29:35,817 --> 01:29:38,358
[SPEAKER_06]: To be really clear, I don't want to nickel and dime.

776
01:29:38,418 --> 01:29:40,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not trying to nickel and dime anything.

777
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:46,684
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to provide fair compensation for work that is important and happening.

778
01:29:47,506 --> 01:29:50,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in my mind, it's more than the amount we've already talked about.

779
01:29:50,608 --> 01:29:55,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's I guess it's up to the people who will do some kind of research on this.

780
01:29:55,852 --> 01:29:59,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So further, the superintendent will investigate and make a recommendation.

781
01:29:59,374 --> 01:30:00,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip the investigator.

782
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:01,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you will.

783
01:30:02,156 --> 01:30:03,396
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent will make.

784
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:10,141
[SPEAKER_01]: A recommendation for the stipend amount effective.

785
01:30:10,161 --> 01:30:12,222
[SPEAKER_01]: FYI, 26 and one more further.

786
01:30:18,879 --> 01:30:19,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it.

787
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it seem OK for everybody?

788
01:30:22,902 --> 01:30:28,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I I don't know that there is a number in anybody's mind to just.

789
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:38,264
[SPEAKER_01]: extend what we discussed at the last school committee through the end of the fiscal year and just, you know, use the same amount for that six month period?

790
01:30:38,884 --> 01:30:40,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that acceptable?

791
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:50,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise you'll have to come back to us before the end of the year, which if I last looked is like in 15 seconds, it seems, and have done that work.

792
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:53,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably easier if you do that work for the next budget.

793
01:30:53,651 --> 01:30:54,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

794
01:30:57,915 --> 01:31:00,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense to folks that we would?

795
01:31:02,118 --> 01:31:02,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

796
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two more regular meetings.

797
01:31:07,942 --> 01:31:08,202
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

798
01:31:08,823 --> 01:31:09,463
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.

799
01:31:09,503 --> 01:31:09,963
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two.

800
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:14,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't expect anybody to spend a month doing research on this.

801
01:31:14,787 --> 01:31:25,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just say that I would like the reality check of is the current stipend in the ballpark?

802
01:31:25,754 --> 01:31:26,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

803
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:36,040
[SPEAKER_06]: because if it needs to be significantly more, I want to know that by December, I'd like to make that happen.

804
01:31:36,861 --> 01:31:45,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'll put, we'll make a recommendation for the stipend amount by the December, one second.

805
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:57,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And if no, rather than we stick with what we have, I think if we can't get a good number in that timeframe, what we have is the best we've got.

806
01:32:00,132 --> 01:32:02,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying a lot of furthers.

807
01:32:02,293 --> 01:32:02,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read them all.

808
01:32:02,953 --> 01:32:04,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I have to read them all again.

809
01:32:04,994 --> 01:32:11,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I read it one more time for the people have to vote?

810
01:32:12,536 --> 01:32:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I probably, although I'm okay.

811
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:20,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this does a within district position?

812
01:32:20,879 --> 01:32:24,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this make sense to the people in this room?

813
01:32:27,935 --> 01:32:47,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it makes sense to me the way in which we are working and collaborating and knowing that there's opportunities for greater collaboration and more structured in a more formal way.

814
01:32:50,117 --> 01:32:53,998
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to meet, to reach more students, to reach more staff.

815
01:32:55,558 --> 01:32:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I do feel that there's greater potential for greater collaboration.

816
01:32:58,739 --> 01:32:59,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

817
01:32:59,299 --> 01:33:06,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Because one of the things I think we heard from Francis early on is this is what this job isn't, or this is what this consultation and this partnership is not.

818
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:11,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And I heard this group say, those are also things.

819
01:33:13,203 --> 01:33:14,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are ands.

820
01:33:15,703 --> 01:33:18,004
[SPEAKER_06]: not oars, but hands.

821
01:33:18,504 --> 01:33:19,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

822
01:33:19,264 --> 01:33:22,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I will mute myself now and let member Ruseau read.

823
01:33:23,906 --> 01:33:33,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the resolution is, this will be the recommendation to the full committee in response to the motion to come here.

824
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:44,133
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion is to recommend that Metro Public Schools will create a new job description for a school-based DEI director that will work in collaboration with the city DEI director.

825
01:33:44,673 --> 01:33:53,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Further, the Medford Public Schools will provide an annual stipend to the city DEI director to compensate for the collaboration and communication with the Medford Public Schools.

826
01:33:53,735 --> 01:34:01,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Further, the superintendent will make a recommendation for the stipend amount by the December 16 meeting.

827
01:34:03,336 --> 01:34:04,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get to the floor.

828
01:34:04,216 --> 01:34:06,297
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody thinks we missed something, we can just change it then.

829
01:34:06,397 --> 01:34:09,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my motion.

830
01:34:13,478 --> 01:34:14,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second it.

831
01:34:16,995 --> 01:34:19,416
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do a roll call.

832
01:34:20,017 --> 01:34:21,657
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are all ready.

833
01:34:21,697 --> 01:34:22,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So Member Reinfeld?

834
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:24,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

835
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:25,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau?

836
01:34:26,679 --> 01:34:26,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

837
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:28,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Pate?

838
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

839
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,161
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

840
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:34,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to send to full committee passes.

841
01:34:36,803 --> 01:34:38,704
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nothing else, I want to say thank you to everyone for

842
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:41,365
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking with us for a little over an hour and a half here.

843
01:34:42,066 --> 01:34:42,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Ms.

844
01:34:42,586 --> 01:34:59,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Nwaje for your expertise and your commitment to working with our district and I think just offering your time I think it's given us on the subcommittee I think a lot to think about but I think also given us a lot more to be assured that we are working towards making the district as accepting and as compliant as possible so truly thank you.

845
01:34:59,355 --> 01:35:04,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes I appreciate being able to address this thoughtfully and not

846
01:35:07,771 --> 01:35:09,152
[SPEAKER_06]: in a sudden resolution.

847
01:35:11,413 --> 01:35:14,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you all so much for having me.

848
01:35:14,434 --> 01:35:16,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to my collaborative partners.

849
01:35:17,855 --> 01:35:22,177
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, it makes my world feel a lot more full.

850
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:30,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't resist, but I just must say this without further ado.

851
01:35:32,261 --> 01:35:37,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to throw that further out there if we're furthering the mission.

852
01:35:39,265 --> 01:35:42,147
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, this is what happens in the DEI world.

853
01:35:42,187 --> 01:35:46,810
[SPEAKER_02]: You think about ways in which to use words.

854
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,431
[SPEAKER_02]: But I certainly appreciate you.

855
01:35:48,471 --> 01:36:00,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you giving thought and making decisions that are going to have long lasting impact and really thinking about sustainability, which does come full circle.

856
01:36:01,638 --> 01:36:22,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Education is all of our responsibilities and just knowing that many of our students are only finding their safe places in schools and with adults who are not necessarily their family members, it is important that we continue to do this work and continue to move forward.

857
01:36:23,275 --> 01:36:24,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for having me.

858
01:36:27,898 --> 01:36:28,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.

859
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:31,850
[SPEAKER_06]: to adjourn.

860
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:33,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, is there a motion to adjourn?

861
01:36:35,171 --> 01:36:42,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I was making sure nobody else had something to say as I was speaking slowly, but hearing none, motion to adjourn.

862
01:36:43,474 --> 01:36:45,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Seconded by Member Ruseau.

863
01:36:46,035 --> 01:36:46,775
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

864
01:36:46,915 --> 01:36:47,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that a roll call?

865
01:36:48,376 --> 01:36:49,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's roll call on Zoom.

866
01:36:49,516 --> 01:36:50,857
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it's roll call.

867
01:36:50,897 --> 01:36:51,977
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Member Reinfeld?

868
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:52,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

869
01:36:53,498 --> 01:36:54,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau?

870
01:36:54,698 --> 01:36:54,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

871
01:36:55,579 --> 01:36:56,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Opada?

872
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:56,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
