1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,622
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks for joining me today.

10
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:48,484
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just start by introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:49,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

12
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:50,405
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Shanine Pellequin.

13
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:52,006
[SPEAKER_01]: My pronouns are she, hers.

14
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:59,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a West Coast transplant who's been in Medford for about 14 years now.

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of bizarre to have landed in this place that I ended up calling home so far away.

16
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,655
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife might say the same thing, also a West Coast transplant.

17
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:10,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

18
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:18,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll ask you just kind of the first question that we ask everybody, which is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:20,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been thinking about this.

20
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:22,527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tricky.

21
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:26,010
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of allergies in my family, so we actually don't get to eat out very often.

22
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:31,234
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go, I like the egg and avocado and rosemary salt at Goldilocks.

23
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:40,721
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want, I just want to give a shout out to Mateo and Francesca at Real Gusto because they don't use a lot of garlic.

24
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:41,682
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of our allergies.

25
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:54,953
[SPEAKER_01]: in their dishes and so they actually let me come in and like talk to them during a slow time and went through the entire menu and figured out what my kid can eat and we got to go out to dinner for the first time.

26
00:01:55,533 --> 00:02:05,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this nice dinner and not have to worry about him and he just thought he was the coolest thing ever so that's been a really nice place to have for like nice dinners for my family as well.

27
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, that's a great story.

28
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:13,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think we're mainly hoping to talk about your work with playgrounds and parks.

29
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little bit about Medford-specific stuff, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you got into this type of work.

30
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:19,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

31
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:28,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think it all started when I had to go to my brother's Little League games because I just hated watching Little League.

32
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, my older son is now in Medford Youth Baseball.

33
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:40,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew all of the parks and playgrounds in my hometown, and I knew which ones were great and which ones weren't, and I think I've been a playground snob since.

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:49,836
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been sticking my nose in parks and playgrounds here since like 2012 or so, and I've been serving Medford family since 2005.

35
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:56,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the director of recreation at an organization that's now called Communitas, but was then EMARC for about 10 years.

36
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:03,864
[SPEAKER_01]: We served about 500 people a year in community based recreation programs.

37
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:13,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to start presenting to the Medford city council as like this shaking, nervous 23 year old to defend our CDBG funding each year.

38
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:17,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started paying attention to what was happening there and got into the family network.

39
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we chose to buy our home, our home here.

40
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm a recreation therapist by training.

41
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:27,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been, my whole work, all of my work has been about.

42
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:37,712
[SPEAKER_01]: creating opportunities for people primarily with disabilities, but who are excluded from recreation for a variety of reasons and making sure that they get those benefits too.

43
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:42,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I got my master's in child development at Tufts, Elliot Pearson.

44
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started thinking about the spaces we create for children's play.

45
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:52,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And that whole program is about like children in their contexts and making sure that you're supporting them there.

46
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:53,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And,

47
00:03:54,718 --> 00:04:02,124
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is like fixed equipment playgrounds aren't like maybe the ideal space for children to play and have creativity since everything is nailed down.

48
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:11,331
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where we find children is the space where we have said, you're still allowed to play in ways that are beneficial to you here.

49
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to do a better job at designing those.

50
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got my certified playground inspector

51
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:25,600
[SPEAKER_01]: playground safety inspector certification and sort of learning about the rules for that so that we can get better design.

52
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I consider myself a play worker, which is a distinct profession that comes out of the adventure playground movement in the UK.

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really about advocating for children's self-directed play.

54
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

55
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hopefully a fun job.

56
00:04:44,087 --> 00:05:02,435
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are moments when it's not so fun, but for the most part, it's really nice to be able to, whether I'm calling a family and saying like, hey, this is what's possible for your kid and showing them that or, or getting to see, like, we're going to talk about McGlynn, getting to see the ideas that we have that we had for such a long time actually be constructed.

57
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:05,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, there's concrete in the ground right now that we dreamed up.

58
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:05,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

59
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:07,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty fun.

60
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:27,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I know like you said I'm hoping to hear a little bit about your involvement with the McGlynn and kind of what you're excited about what the process was like because I know that playground is right near like where a lot of kids play soccer and I used to call it like park purgatory getting stuck at that park because my kids loved it it's like huge and there's lots of different things but I was always like

61
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a puddle here, there's a hole in the turf here.

62
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:33,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so like, tell us a little bit about your work with that.

63
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:43,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2019, kind of across all four schools, a group of the different PTOs got together and decided all these playgrounds really need to be resurfaced.

64
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:53,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Playgrounds themselves last for like 20 to 25 years, like the structures if they're cared for well, but the actual surfacing is only going to last like 15, 10 to 15.

65
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,473
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to resurface at some point.

66
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the McGlynn is very different than the other sites.

67
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:04,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the things I want people to understand is how different that site is.

68
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because as you said, it's used during the weekends for soccer and little league, and it's kind of a destination regional park.

69
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Its first purpose is a school playground.

70
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:17,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made sure that the design reflected that and we really prioritize the school.

71
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it is a community park as well.

72
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but the, the PTO with the McGlynn at the time led by Bailey Shendell really

73
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:30,756
[SPEAKER_01]: were very forward thinking and they were like, we need to do this differently because our structure is crumbling already.

74
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:38,784
[SPEAKER_01]: There are broken pieces, there's rust, and it doesn't make any sense to put, it's like 25,000 square feet of rubber surfacing.

75
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Way excessive, it wasn't needed.

76
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:47,531
[SPEAKER_01]: That rubber surfacing is only meant to be like kind of in a six foot radius around any surface and that thing was just a sea of it.

77
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And holes.

78
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And holes, we'll get to that.

79
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:59,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, we shouldn't be putting a $350,000 bandit in something that we're going to have to rip up in a couple of years.

80
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:08,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So they asked the Community Preservation Commission if they could use their funding as a design study instead of to resurface it.

81
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other three scrolls were resurfaced around 2019-ish, maybe 2020.

82
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly when that all happened.

83
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:19,672
[SPEAKER_01]: But those conversations were happening fall 2019.

84
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:32,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, Kevin Bailey brought me into a conversation because there was a middle schooler at the, I think at the McGlynn, who had a sibling.

85
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:44,346
[SPEAKER_01]: with a disability, and she wanted her CCSR project to be developing an inclusive playground in Medford because she wanted a space where her sister could go and wouldn't get tired just climbing up the ladder.

86
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I brought those two efforts together.

87
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:53,333
[SPEAKER_01]: That student ended up moving, but I really wish I could track her down and show her what her idea has sparked.

88
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:59,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, none of us knew, I think, then what this effort would turn out to be.

89
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:16,349
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our first let's kind of talk about this meeting with district officials and Jenny Graham came and some of the teachers in CCSR and Dr. Cushing was there and we just started kind of thinking about what it might take.

90
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:24,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember one of the things that I said then was that the way that playgrounds have historically been designed is kind of like

91
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,024
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you go get an insurance policy, you can go to an agent or you can go to a broker, and it's a very different experience.

92
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:38,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to an agent, they're going to sell you the thing that they rep, the thing that they get paid the most for, etc.

93
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:44,833
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to a broker, they're going to really work through all the different companies and find the best fit for you.

94
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, so we need to do that.

95
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:49,036
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start taking that approach to playground design.

96
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:55,686
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a very encouraging meeting, and then we were starting to talk about funding with the planning department, and that was February 2020.

97
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:59,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Something big happened.

98
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:01,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

99
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,012
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly the district had other priorities for a couple of years.

100
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:15,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started picking it back up in December of 2021, I think, we started interviewing landscape architecture firms.

101
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:26,917
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put together a community committee that we felt was pretty representative of what the needs of that school committee or school community needed.

102
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:35,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did get feedback that we should have had more people with disabilities themselves on there.

103
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:41,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just want to acknowledge that we had therapists and parents and blah, blah, blah.

104
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:45,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a person with a disability on the committee.

105
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:54,483
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also made sure we did talk to all the students who had disabilities, as much as we could communicate with them about what their preferences were and watching their play, etc.

106
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:57,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was input, but just something I think we should do better in the future.

107
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:06,158
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have also talked to a lot of people with disabilities and various disabilities about how they like to experience playgrounds and stuff.

108
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that feedback there, but just kind of owning that.

109
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then spring 2022, we started meeting with that group and the landscape architects and, and I had the privilege.

110
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:26,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the thing that I'm most proud of with this project is for the first time, to the best of my knowledge, we asked the kids first what they wanted.

111
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:28,035
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the time,

112
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,870
[SPEAKER_01]: communities will say, well, here's the park design because this is what we want.

113
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to give the community some choices, but it's like, do you want the red slide that's twisty?

114
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want the blue straight slide?

115
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:40,132
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of benches do you like better?

116
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And those aren't meaningful choices.

117
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:52,095
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think like car park right now and, um, and the McGlynn have done a remarkable job at asking the community first, what they need, how do you want to play?

118
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,275
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you use this space?

119
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,016
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the things that we need to know?

120
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:59,160
[SPEAKER_01]: about this space in particular in your community that will help us with that design.

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:19,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to spend 15 hours before we even had any committee meetings observing recess and talking to staff at the school and talking to students and really hearing what wasn't working, what they liked about this playground, what they needed, how we were going to get them through an interim period.

122
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:25,711
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to do some things right off the bat, like get them some signs that says, like, the playground is closed during school hours.

123
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't come play on our playground while we're in the middle of recess.

124
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:35,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And fixing some access issues to even get the kids with disabilities onto the playground.

125
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:42,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that that's what I'm most proud of, is the feedback that we started with.

126
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:44,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

127
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you excited?

128
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:51,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any kind of elements about the playground that you want to share or like timeline what people can expect?

129
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I'll tackle the elements.

130
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we heard really loud and clear from the kids was that they don't like the wavy slides, not the twisty slides that go all the way around.

131
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,497
[SPEAKER_01]: but the kind of like barely curvy ones.

132
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:08,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by the time, I mean, I've been about the same height since I was in fifth or sixth grade, right?

133
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:15,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by the time these kids are in like fourth-ish grade, their legs don't fit down those slides anymore, and they can't go fast.

134
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:18,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really like to race.

135
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:26,085
[SPEAKER_01]: They also really like to play this game called Watermelon, where they stick one kid at the bottom of the slide, and then they see how many kids it takes coming down the slide to knock the last kid off.

136
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:28,066
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new one to me.

137
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And those require straight slides.

138
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,971
[SPEAKER_01]: they said, well, you don't want any of those wavy slides.

139
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:36,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was talking to the manufacturer, he said, oh, yeah, 100%.

140
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:38,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are designed to slow kids down.

141
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really impressed that they noticed that.

142
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:42,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they noticed that.

143
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:47,538
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the kids said that there was that tree in the middle.

144
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember.

145
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:56,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So it had a big white concrete wall that was probably about a foot to 18 inches tall and just one singular tree.

146
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:56,943
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no shade.

147
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,685
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard that over and over again, that everybody's first priority was making sure that there was shade.

148
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's been fixed.

149
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be so many trees on this playground and they're prioritizing native plantings.

150
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And our tree warden is very excited about the additional trees in this space.

151
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:19,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that one tree that was in the middle, the kids said, um, that tree is beloved.

152
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you touch that tree, we will cry for the rest of our lives.

153
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has been the centerpiece of this playground.

154
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were trying to figure out how do we make that accessible?

155
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:40,409
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, not everybody might know this, but the McGlynn has the program, the special education program for the kids who are, have intellectual and physical disabilities.

156
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:43,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have a lot of kids who have visual impairments.

157
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:48,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually were able to consult with Perkins school for the blind on some design considerations.

158
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:57,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and we talked a lot with the special education staff and spent a lot of time with those classes on the playground, watching how the kids play and what they might need.

159
00:13:58,132 --> 00:13:58,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

160
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,981
[SPEAKER_01]: But the question was, how do we make this tree accessible to everyone?

161
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:05,545
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we protect the tree during construction and make it a space that is more usable?

162
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:13,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had designed a deck to go around the tree so that kids could roll or walk up to it and spend time around it.

163
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:23,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that if we had drilled the holes down around the roots that it might've hurt the tree, so we had to move the deck off, but you'll still be able to get on a,

164
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:31,644
[SPEAKER_01]: 88 compliant pathway around the tree and up close to it and then the whole area is going to be kind of this quiet shady tree deck.

165
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:39,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a double straight slide and the kids wanted to swing and it was really interesting the teachers about half

166
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,833
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, yes, swings, kids need to move.

167
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, please put that on there.

168
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:49,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And other teachers had some pretty significant concerns about that, about the turn taking.

169
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:54,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have 100 and something kids on the playground and four swings, kids are just going to be waiting in line the whole time.

170
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:58,280
[SPEAKER_01]: They were worried about kids being struck by a swing.

171
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually designed around those concerns.

172
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big there's going to be a big berm.

173
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,975
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way of the swings that's actually bright yellow so the kids with visual impairments can detect it.

174
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:18,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very clear visual and tactile reminder of like, hey, there's something else happening here.

175
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:22,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the swing zones have a different color surfacing underneath.

176
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:26,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you walk into a particular color surfacing, you're like, oh, there's something moving here.

177
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's set at the back of the playground.

178
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And we prioritized multi-user swings.

179
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,643
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can get like, there's this one called the Viking swing and it's just my favorite thing.

180
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:45,832
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big kind of, I don't know, it's about a six inch diameter rope that's, I don't know, maybe eight or 10 feet long and you can stand on it and swing back and forth.

181
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:50,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bunch of kids can play together as opposed to waiting turns all the time.

182
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,264
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be a basketball hoop.

183
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big kids were so thoughtful.

184
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:01,886
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, we really want a basketball hoop, but also we need to make sure there's a shorter hoop so that the little kids can play.

185
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:02,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw.

186
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:02,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

187
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:06,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, and we want tall monkey bars, but we also want little monkey bars.

188
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:15,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teachers were concerned about kids getting onto monkey bars that were too high for them to handle, which is one of my concerns, too.

189
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:19,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of, like, kids really need that overhead hanging experience.

190
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,231
[SPEAKER_01]: But kids get out of their element pretty quickly.

191
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:31,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to design, I'm hoping that this is gonna work, but there's an ADA height set of monkey bars.

192
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:35,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's inclusive and also better for like the kindergartners and first graders.

193
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:45,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the taller set of monkey bars is set so that you really shouldn't be able to get on it until you are physically capable of reaching it and handling that height.

194
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:46,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting.

195
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:47,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

196
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else about the McGlynn that you want to share?

197
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:59,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now what you'll see is fencing going in and there's a big pavilion area at one end.

198
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:04,698
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have a couple of picnic tables under it, but eventually they'll be able to have preschool graduation and guest speakers there.

199
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:12,841
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a turf field, people might wonder why we're putting in turf, because there's lots of concerns about heat islands and stuff, and we're aware of that.

200
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:17,625
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is, is that grass will not hold up on an elementary playground.

201
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:23,971
[SPEAKER_01]: In this school, there's like 140 to 160 kids out there at any given time, and grass just doesn't stand a chance.

202
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:29,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we put grass there, it was gonna be like closing the playground every however often.

203
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:34,167
[SPEAKER_01]: to reseed and you know, that just wasn't going to work.

204
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made sure it's sand infill.

205
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:38,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that black rubber stuff that people end up bringing home in their shoes.

206
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:46,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you look at that space, you can see the, the giant seating kind of, they look like steps, but they're not, they're not steps.

207
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:51,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're seating that goes up to this raised area under a, under a shade structure.

208
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:57,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you can see the deck around the tree and then the turf is actually going in next week.

209
00:17:58,498 --> 00:17:58,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

210
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:02,300
[SPEAKER_01]: The librarian at the McGlynn has actually been working on this whole unit.

211
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,881
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a big display of all the construction documents.

212
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:12,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So she and I have been working closely to keep the kids updated on what's happening and what the process is and what the documents look like.

213
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really neat.

214
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:15,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

215
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:19,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like the school is really excited about it and some other ways for kids to be involved and informed.

216
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:20,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

217
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:27,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I am really interested in hearing any other playground wisdom that you can share with us.

218
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:53,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what a lot of people don't know is that Playground, I'm not sure I, I understand the reasoning, but I don't necessarily agree from a child development perspective, but Playgrounds are designed for like six month to 23 month olds, and then two year olds to five year olds, and five to 12 year olds.

219
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,007
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little bit of overlap in the five range.

220
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,229
[SPEAKER_01]: but we usually don't do a very good job with the two to five.

221
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:01,648
[SPEAKER_01]: structure design.

222
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:04,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got a couple of structures in town that are better.

223
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:12,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Duggar has a good two to five structure and the current car one is a really nice big challenging two to five structure.

224
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:25,279
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the time it's just kind of two steps up to a tiny little slide and then we wonder why the three-year-olds are on the big equipment that's actually often too big for them.

225
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,021
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should be signage on each

226
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:49,693
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and we're working, the planning department and I are working to make sure all those signs are there right now and check and see what the equipment is designed for because there's different considerations like center of gravity of how high the fences are on stuff and just playgrounds are not designed to be safe I think is the bigger piece.

227
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:53,137
[SPEAKER_01]: They're designed to remove hazards like things that kids might not

228
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:59,111
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware of, or parents, like getting your head stuck in a space, right?

229
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:05,596
[SPEAKER_01]: They're designed so that there's not any spaces that a kid's body could get through that their head couldn't also fit through.

230
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:16,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to make sure that there's not any places where like your kid's drawstring on their sweatshirt would get stuck at the top of a slide.

231
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:17,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really dangerous.

232
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let your kids play with helmets on a playground.

233
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:22,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

234
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you'd think like, oh, that would be safer, but actually because the holes are designed to let a kid's head through, but they're not.

235
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,475
[SPEAKER_01]: actually designed to put a kid's helmet through.

236
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:36,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can end up with like, it's kind of grisly, but yeah, it's a problem.

237
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:36,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

238
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:37,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

239
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're bringing up something that I always made about playgrounds, which is like, oh, these were designed to be safe.

240
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:49,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're like, oh, like, you know, these giant metal structures, like, like, you know, somebody thought about how safe these were for kids.

241
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:49,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

242
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:50,127
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

243
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:55,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's any kind of like other things that you could share that people might not think about playgrounds.

244
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,913
[SPEAKER_01]: The surfacing is not meant to prevent your kid from breaking their arm.

245
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:01,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a rubber bouncy surface.

246
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:06,217
[SPEAKER_01]: It is literally only meant to keep a kid from a critical head injury and death.

247
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:07,818
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

248
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:14,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we've actually seen an increase in long bone injuries since we started doing this rubber surfacing stuff.

249
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:24,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's speculation, there's wondering in this field about if kids are taking more risks or parents are not watching as much.

250
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:29,661
[SPEAKER_01]: because they think that their kid's not gonna get hurt because it's a soft surface.

251
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:35,566
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really just meant to accept the impact of a kid's head falling on it and help them not die.

252
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's an interesting thing.

253
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:48,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the loose surface thing, which everybody complains about, but it's actually, for me, it's not accessible, but it's also the only loose part that kids can be creative with.

254
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:49,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Like wood chips and sand.

255
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:50,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we're working, there's some...

256
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:57,326
[SPEAKER_01]: edit this piece.

257
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,548
[SPEAKER_01]: There are new guidelines in Massachusetts.

258
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:09,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I think last summer, the Access Board decided that wood chips are not going to be allowed anymore for new playgrounds.

259
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:16,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime a playground is renovated, then they'll need to bring it up and have a solid surface.

260
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:27,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is more expensive up front, but then it's really actually quite expensive to maintain the wood chips over time because they're supposed to be filled and raked and wetted and all these things.

261
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:39,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And parks departments, I mean, not just ours, you know, we have similar sized cities have like 25 park staff and our guys have like seven on a good day and they're doing a tremendous job with the resources they have.

262
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's just not possible.

263
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:51,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things when I started taking my kids to the park was realizing how many parents are really concerned about letting their kids go up or letting any kids go up the slide.

264
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say there's all sorts of developmental benefits to going up the slide.

265
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:59,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's trunk support or trunk control and set.

266
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,963
[SPEAKER_01]: There's trunk control and sensory stuff.

267
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um,

268
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:12,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concern, the adult concern tends to be like, well, they're going to get hit by a smaller kid or you're going to, you know, my kid needs a turn.

269
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's an opportunity to teach turn taking.

270
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:26,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, the skills that we need to teach in the playground are about turn taking, not necessarily sharing because sharing is like an attitude of altruism that we develop over time.

271
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,428
[SPEAKER_01]: But a three-year-old is not capable of.

272
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:31,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I asked you to share my hat right now or your hat, you'd probably be like,

273
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you giving me your water bottle?

274
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:39,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I shame you into giving me your water bottle right now?

275
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you should share.

276
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:45,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's an opportunity

277
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:52,949
[SPEAKER_01]: to help kids learn how to take turns but also have big kids learn how to watch out for little ones.

278
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:57,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I noticed that you want to go up the slide like let's wait till this person comes down and then you can go up.

279
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:09,181
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one of the things that we did at McGlynn was made sure we got a fast straight slide but it's a double slide so the kids can race like they asked for but also the teachers can

280
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:15,664
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're nervous about letting kids go up a slide, there can be an upside and a downside, right?

281
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:20,110
[SPEAKER_01]: So it meets the need of the kid, but in a way that adults are more comfortable with.

282
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:24,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like a little bit like playgrounds are kind of a...

283
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: learning space for etiquette.

284
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

285
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And like learning kind of like how you take up space and how, you know, being aware of other people around you and all that stuff.

286
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:40,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the few spaces we have left where kids can play in multi-age groups, right?

287
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:46,189
[SPEAKER_01]: In all their sports they're in within like a two-year group.

288
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:47,949
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in their grade groups.

289
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,491
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very rarely in multi-age groups.

290
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:55,592
[SPEAKER_01]: That transmission of childhood culture is less than it used to be.

291
00:24:55,712 --> 00:25:00,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids' independence, their ability to go out in the community is lower.

292
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:06,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we make the spaces where they can be as good and comprehensively good for child development as we can?

293
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:08,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

294
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:09,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

295
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:12,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that you want to make sure we talk about today?

296
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:23,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things is when we think about what makes a community worth living in, our parks come up a lot.

297
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:36,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the city has been working really hard to make parks that are good for Medford, that aren't just like kind of cookie cutter spaces, but really reflect our identity and what our community needs.

298
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,979
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels good to be a part of that process.

299
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need help taking care of them.

300
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:45,707
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a ton of damage at Carr Park.

301
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping out with that design team as well.

302
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:54,250
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts like, we need to normalize not going into the construction site.

303
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:01,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you got the text the other day about like car park is closed and it really needed to be like half of car park is closed.

304
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:02,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, please don't go into the fences.

305
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:09,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it puts people at risk as well as the workers who come up later and whether it's intentional or not, it can damage the work that's been done.

306
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:20,101
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like surfaces that aren't cured yet, or maybe there's a surface that isn't quite stable and now the workers have to come back in and it diverts resources that we could be using to

307
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:27,379
[SPEAKER_01]: do all the other things we would like the city to do when they have to come back and clean up glass again in a park.

308
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:38,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, we, I really want to help develop a sense of ownership, um, among young people who are using parks for Friday night activities.

309
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:44,453
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can we help, um, create spaces where our young people feel

310
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:51,426
[SPEAKER_01]: like they have had a say, where they have ownership, where they know that they are welcome to spend time, but then they also will take care of it.

311
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:58,831
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been really fun at CAR, talking to the teenagers and getting their feedback on what kind of spaces they want.

312
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:07,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess just help us take care of these spaces because it's a lot of resources and it's a ton of time to get a new park, my goodness.

313
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the project at Carr is like, it's overwhelming to see like how much it's gonna change.

314
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And overwhelming in a good, exciting way.

315
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:27,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think it does seem like something that is important to acknowledge, like how many resources are going in there and how sort of like grateful we should feel about it, right, yeah.

316
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:33,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the partnership between all the departments with McGlynn we've had, that site was so,

317
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:35,215
[SPEAKER_01]: different.

318
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:36,095
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the river.

319
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:41,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Those white walls that were there, they were created to reflect the river.

320
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:47,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you looked down at the previous port in place, it was like a map of the previous run of the river.

321
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,841
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have a sign that reflects that history in the outdoor classroom at McGlynn.

322
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:57,904
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was all this flooding all the time, and that made the surface fail earlier.

323
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:01,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to address the drainage, and we had to figure out what's under the soil and make sure it's going to

324
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:24,181
[SPEAKER_01]: hold up the structures and and so that took coordination with engineering and DPW and you know we would find remnants of past projects and making them safe and making sure that we have all of these things together and the planning department and their creativity and figuring out how to get this stuff funded and make the best use of the city's resources it's been

325
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:29,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the school district as well, between buildings and grounds and the administrative office.

326
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:36,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing has been my co-chair through this process and there's so many little things, there's funny

327
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:38,695
[SPEAKER_01]: things that come up in each project.

328
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the inner workings of a municipal government must be interesting.

329
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:55,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things I kind of alluded to this week, we had to have a professional come in and take tests to make sure the soil would hold up the amphitheater because it used to be a riverbed, right?

330
00:28:56,221 --> 00:29:01,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I mean, just Monday, there's a grate for drainage that used to be in the grass

331
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this new design, it's on a sidewalk.

332
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:10,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it needs to be accessible, but the grate wasn't included as something that needed to be new.

333
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So now all of a sudden we need to find a new grate or figure out what we're going to do to make sure that it's accessible both by law, but also it's an inclusive playground.

334
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:20,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty important that everything be at least compliant, if not above and beyond.

335
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:25,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we had to pivot and get an accessible one and they were pouring the cement that day.

336
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then, um, yeah.

337
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:36,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like making sure the plumbing that's coming out of the school is matching up with the plumbing that goes to the water fountain.

338
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... An important one not to mess up.

339
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:42,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an important one not to mess up.

340
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,593
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we were talking as a team and...

341
00:29:45,701 --> 00:30:12,100
[SPEAKER_01]: the architect was saying like the difference between what was here before to now is really incredible that it's not just a couple of things on a big flat surface that there's there's changes in the topography and there are spaces and all sorts of different types of play to explore there'll be gaga ball and uh um and the play structure that kids with wheelchairs can get all the way up to the top level and there's transfer platforms so they can slide down and

342
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:14,584
[SPEAKER_01]: separate preschool area.

343
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:21,990
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the lead builders loves the natural pieces and he's been having fun like picking out the boulders that they took from Carr Park.

344
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,353
[SPEAKER_01]: They took boulders from Carr Park and repurposed them at McGlynn for play.

345
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:38,334
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other workers was saying the challenge of making it all fit in this space, like taking this design and actually seeing it become the real materials.

346
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been really fun for all of us.

347
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:41,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

348
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:41,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

349
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it won't feel like purgatory.

350
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:46,500
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be so, so much shadier.

351
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.

352
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:47,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

353
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:50,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I did think about that, that it is always very hot.

354
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always very hot, that playground.

355
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:52,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

356
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:57,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that when they have those, you know, hundred something kids out there at a time that it is

357
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:06,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's shadier, there's more engagement, we've separated out the big wide ball game kind of area from the main area.

358
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:11,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids can move in different ways and it's just going to be a wonderful thing and it should be open.

359
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,500
[SPEAKER_01]: by the beginning of September is the plan.

360
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:22,126
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're aiming, we are aiming as hard as we can for the beginning of school, but it will be around that area.

361
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:22,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal.

362
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:29,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because the McGlynn has such a high needs student population that

363
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:39,366
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really good place to start as we realized that our buildings, that our new school buildings are not as new as they were.

364
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Playgrounds are supposed to last 20 to 25 years.

365
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:46,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one right now would be at 25 years, right?

366
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:49,652
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had kept this playground, it was the first of the schools to be built.

367
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:54,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had these unique site concerns, the flooding, et cetera.

368
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hot and higher use.

369
00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:07,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's been some concerns about the funding and the equity of the funding over the process of figuring out how we're going to pay for this project.

370
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:14,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that in terms of building equity, the McGlynn is a really great place to start doing that.

371
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:34,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fully anticipate that when each of the other schools' playgrounds reach the end of their useful life, which will happen in the next five to 10 years, then we will have that kind of robust community input process and really think about what the unique needs of each school community are.

372
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the additional course or the classes that they have?

373
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the McGlynn also has the English language learners program.

374
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:51,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you are not a kindergartner and you speak a different language, you go to the McGlynn for your English as a second or English language learner program.

375
00:32:51,550 --> 00:33:00,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then they have the special education program for kids with visual impairments and who use wheelchairs and you know, the each school's needs are going to be different.

376
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:02,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the sites are different.

377
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:03,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

378
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:09,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is the beginning of doing park design in a different way.

379
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:15,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really am looking forward to seeing what each of the other school communities creates.

380
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:29,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just wanted to say how impressed I am by the planning department and the mayor's office and how creative they've been about how to get this funded in a way that makes the best use out of each of the different funding sources.

381
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:32,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was some ARPA money and there's

382
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:39,174
[SPEAKER_01]: community preservation act money and community development block grants because it's a low moderate income neighborhood.

383
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to use that funding.

384
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:46,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's an earmark from state DCR that representative Barber helped us to get.

385
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:55,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, as we get different funding sources, we're able to release funding in other areas that would be better served for other purposes.

386
00:33:56,497 --> 00:34:02,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the planning department really has been brilliant in, in figuring out how to fund all of this.

387
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think whenever someone sees, oh, McGlynn's getting this really nice, beautiful playground that's been so planned and thought about, I think it can feel natural to sort of think about, well, what are the other schools going to get?

388
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:22,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you did a great job of kind of naming that the needs of the McGlynn are higher or different, right?

389
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:29,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That they're including all of these students with different needs that might not be present or as present at the other schools.

390
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also a middle school, right?

391
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:32,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the middle schoolers also access it?

392
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,430
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle schoolers don't access it.

393
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,815
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be able to use it after school, but the middle schoolers don't access that.

394
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:43,304
[SPEAKER_01]: They use Hormel and the kind of basketball and street hockey rink over there.

395
00:34:46,353 --> 00:35:03,293
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and then the other thing i was through this project when we got the mcglenn inspected and the inspector was like this is past its useful life like let's let's find something new for this space um we also got the other schools inspected and we worked really closely with the manufacturer to identify any like really

396
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:04,684
[SPEAKER_01]: major hazards.

397
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:10,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a bouncy bridge at the Roberts that we got replaced and some steps and a cargo net bridge.

398
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:10,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

399
00:35:11,788 --> 00:35:14,549
[SPEAKER_01]: The Brooks had a broken slide and a broken monkey bar set.

400
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:22,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took one thing I'm learning about working with municipal government is it takes longer than anyone wants, including everybody who works there.

401
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:26,056
[SPEAKER_01]: But we finally got those replaced.

402
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was against CPC funding or CPA funding.

403
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:34,493
[SPEAKER_01]: But we made sure that they were safe, and those structures were in better condition.

404
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:43,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to replace pieces that were broken, the PTOs were able to get them resurfaced, so the playgrounds that are there are in good shape now.

405
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:51,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will be for several more years, as long as we're taking good care of them and not letting your dog onto the port in place.

406
00:35:56,737 --> 00:36:00,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to seeing what the new sites will be, but it's going to be a while.

407
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like you said, it can feel unfair, but it's actually the beginning of doing things in a more fair way.

408
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

409
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a great blueprint in terms of planning and thoughtfulness.

410
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

411
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:10,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

413
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:20,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to all the staff and the students and the families who gave input and everybody in the community who doesn't go to the McGlynn, but uses that space.

414
00:36:20,384 --> 00:36:22,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really, it's been a privilege.

415
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for all your work.

416
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:27,256
