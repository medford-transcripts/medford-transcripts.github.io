1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:05,452
Hi.

2
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:08,155
Hi.

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:08,275
Hi.

4
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:32,672
Okay.

5
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,072
So I see.

6
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:34,572
Okay, Paul.

7
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:35,133
It's there.

8
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:36,913
John.

9
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:44,674
So it looks like I'm just waiting for Chad.

10
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,515
But I think, Oh, I think I just saw him come in.

11
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:48,255
Okay.

12
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,876
So I think what I'll do is I'm just going to start reading the agenda so we can get started.

13
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:10,217

And so we're ready to begin.

30
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:44,922
I'm going to, you know, of course, start with welcoming everybody for making it today on this very wonderful, warm, hot day.

31
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:47,303
It seems very summer-like today.

32
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,604
And so we have a lot of agenda items.

33
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:59,546
So I'm wondering if I could get maybe one of my subcommittee members could just keep an eye out on the timing to just kind of move this along so that we don't go over the time.

34
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:04,047
So if, you know, Paulette or Paul, if you could just kind of keep an eye on it.

35
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,627
Yeah.

36
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:07,908
Are we on till 630 or till 7?

37
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:07,908
7.

38
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:09,789
Okay.

39
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:10,609
7 p.m.

40
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,450
And that's what it's posted that way at City Hall and on the agenda.

41
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,032
Yeah, so we got the updated invite last night on that.

42
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:21,472
Okay, just wanted to make sure.

43
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:22,472
Yeah, no problem.

44
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,593
And earlier, it'd be okay.

45
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:26,093
Exactly.

46
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:30,456
And that's why, you know, if we can keep an eye on the time and, you know, I'll do that.

47
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:31,337
Thank you.

48
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:32,658
And feel free to move it along.

49
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:33,738
I don't mind at all.

50
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,660
And so let's start with the roll call.

51
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:38,842
Yes.

52
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,243
You want to move a motion to adjourn?

53
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:44,085
Just kidding.

54
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:44,786
A little too soon.

55
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:47,436
Yeah, no problem.

56
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:48,376
Yep.

57
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:50,997
So I can see that Mr. Russo is here.

58
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:51,577
Mr. Russo?

59
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:52,437
Yes.

60
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:53,317
Okay.

61
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:54,217
And Ms.

62
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:54,718
Van de Kloot?

63
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:55,218
Yes.

64
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:56,438
And Ms.

65
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:56,658
Gretz?

66
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:56,978
I'm here.

67
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:57,458
Okay.

68
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:58,338
So there we go.

69
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,879
Three present, none absent.

70
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,339
Okay.

71
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,619
So I'm ready to begin and I'm going to start.

72
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,220
Chad Fallon, Mr. Fallon, he is up first.

73
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,260
So I'm going to let you take it away, Mr. Fallon.

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,640
Go ahead.

75
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,601
Good evening, everyone.

76
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,281
Thanks for having me.

77
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:19,474
Definitely one of my favorite subcommittees to join because it's a chance for me to brag about all the great things our school's doing.

78
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:24,477
Kind of ironic, I was out in the yard with my son and we were splashing around with the T-shirt I have on.

79
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:30,800
I don't know if any of you watch HGTV, but demo day, Chip and Joanna Gaines and that show Fixer Upper.

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,762
I thought how appropriate that I'm wearing this shirt now for what I'm about to present.

81
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,283
So anyways, nice to see you all.

82
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,924
I'm gonna share my screen.

83
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:42,426
I also have one of my colleagues on the call, Richard Cormio, electrical instructor extraordinaire.

84
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,558
He's going to jump in when we talk about a project in his space.

85
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:13,798
Okay, so similar slide to what I had last time, but I think it's just important to remind people that every time we do a project, we take advice from our program advisory council.

86
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,700
We just had a meeting last week.

87
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,541
We had about over a hundred people in attendance, which was really good.

88
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:19,662
We still did it virtually.

89
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:27,787
Typically when we're in the space, we're able to, you know, they're able to make more recommendations on the space itself and the equipment.

90
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:30,369
We weren't able to do that this time, but we still had productive meetings.

91
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:39,915
I think it's important to notice, to note at this point in my tenure at Medford Vocational Technical High School, we've invested over $1 million into the school.

92
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:43,498
And that's gone into almost every one of the programs that I oversee.

93
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,562
And that includes grant funding, private donors, and money from our regular operating budget.

94
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:54,286
So I'm really proud to say that our total investment over four years has been over $1 million to enhance the programs in our space.

95
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,247
And we're really proud of that.

96
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,533
So update on projects.

97
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:05,798
Whenever I present, I always have an issue with my screen.

98
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:06,278
And there we go.

99
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:15,841
So the former cosmetology, our next project happening now is the former cosmetology space downstairs on the first floor will be converted to the new graphic design program.

100
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:23,986
As the students were removing the ceiling from that space, we noticed that there was some potential issues we wanted to have looked at.

101
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,227
So John McLaughlin and his crew were there to help us.

102
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:34,151
He's had some engineers come in and we're waiting on some quotes for some work that needs to be done before we close up that ceiling again.

103
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:34,972
Nothing major.

104
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,114
but it's still something that needs to be looked at for some structure.

105
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:40,015
We want to make sure that everything is structurally sound.

106
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:47,821
So with that said, as soon as that's done, hopefully this year we'll be able to maybe do a week or so before summer, and then we'll be starting that first off in the fall.

107
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:53,826
Exterior work that we've done over the last few weeks is we've redone our landscaping in the front of the school.

108
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:58,529
We've repaired a very large cement break that was at the walkway.

109
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,690
I'll show you pictures in a minute.

110
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,953
We've built a new house in electrical, and I'll have Rich Cormier talk about that when I have the pictures.

111
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,814
Basically, this is 12 additional student work booths.

112
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:22,120
As you know, electrical is always one of our most highly sought after programs, and in an effort to make sure students have all that they need to be successful in this program, we've added 12 additional booths, and Rich has designed another house.

113
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:29,083
So in the program, if you've been in there, there's what we call the house, which students actually will wire a kitchen, a living room, a dining room,

114
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:33,384
I'll let Rich describe that more, but we've built a second one with carpentry.

115
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:38,005
Recap of this year is we did complete the cosmetology salon.

116
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,765
We'll have a ribbon cutting for that in the fall.

117
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:47,267
We completed the renovation of the programming and web design shop, and we've built additional storage in Bistro 489.

118
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,108
Each one of these projects was done by students.

119
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:58,410
Still left for this year is we're building picnic tables for Bistro 489 for the deck, and we're going to have umbrellas in them as well.

120
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:00,674
That's our last project of the year.

121
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:06,300
And then the last thing we're doing with CCSR is we're going to be installing a micro pantry outside of our front door.

122
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:09,744
So here's some pictures.

123
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:11,105
I am super proud of this.

124
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,109
This was a long time coming.

125
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,111
The front of our school needed a facelift big time.

126
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,888
So this was a combination of efforts.

127
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:21,149
It was our construction and craft laborer students, our carpentry students.

128
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,432
They were able to kind of design how we wanted it to look.

129
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,492
I told them what I wanted.

130
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:28,773
I said, I wanted some different height.

131
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:36,237
I wanted some low growth and I wanted things that weren't going to be so dependent on water because, you know, not everyone's always there.

132
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:38,298
So I'm really proud of the way that came out.

133
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,388
This was a project that was amazing.

134
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,071
Our cement sidewalk in front of the school was falling apart.

135
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:55,536
And to have this done by an outside vendor would have cost thousands of dollars, but this was right up, I mean, this was just right up our alley.

136
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,677
It's actually the construction craft labor students.

137
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:04,802
So they were responsible for, we rented a couple extra jackhammers and we jackhammered everything out of that space, dug it out.

138
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,663
and prepared it for new cement.

139
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:10,106
And then we had the cement mixer truck came and dumped it.

140
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:12,408
And these are just a few pictures of what the kids took part in.

141
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,769
They were so excited.

142
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,112
These, this like a couple of weeks of this project, there was so much excitement.

143
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:26,318
Of course, you know, a little bit of less excitement inside the office as I'm trying to be on a Zoom call and I have five Jack cameras going off, but still that's Vogue Ed, you know, it was great.

144
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,620
It was like just a day in the life.

145
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,462
So this was a group project for sure.

146
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,419
I think my favorite part was the picture on the left.

147
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,263
I was out there watching them with this, this float that they were using to make it all smooth.

148
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:44,250
And then they, um, went in with a special tool when all was said and done to make it look just perfect.

149
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,212
And there's what it looked like before.

150
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,514
And here's what it looks like now.

151
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:49,355
Pretty professional.

152
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:49,896
If you ask me.

153
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:54,268
Wow, beautiful.

154
00:10:55,188 --> 00:11:12,940
In Bistro 489 one thing that was built that was not built when the space was constructed was storage, and the only storage they had was a walk in freezer and fridge, and like a very small dry storage area so if you remember when you walk into the restaurant from the school, along that right side of the wall was just dead space.

155
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,781
So I kind of came up in my mind with, let's just put up a wall, let's do some barn doors.

156
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:22,602
And that's all I had to say for Mark Lumino, my carpentry teacher and his students to say, okay, we got this.

157
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:24,182
I said, barn doors, that's all I want.

158
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,883
Next thing I knew they had Harvey doors ordered.

159
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:30,024
They had a wall designed and they had a wall up within a couple of weeks.

160
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:35,285
And now that this picture was before it was painted, but now it matches beautifully, looks great.

161
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,665
You'd never even know it wasn't there.

162
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:40,826
So now that's really an additional piece of storage for the shop.

163
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,247
Mr. Cormier, please take it away.

164
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,648
How are you doing, everybody?

165
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:49,288
So we found out that our program has expanded.

166
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:53,049
Next year we'll probably have around 60 students total.

167
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,530
So we needed more space.

168
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,430
Right now, the amount of workspaces we had was about 45.

169
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,832
So I asked the Carpentry folks to help us out.

170
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,232
They had a student who was very

171
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,933
interested in CAD.

172
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:10,015
So he designed the new house, which is similar to the old house with a couple of changes.

173
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:17,579
What you're looking at there is the upper left-hand corner is during construction, how they built the walls and how to keep them in place.

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,721
You see the students working up on the upper right.

175
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:26,124
And then in the center there is one of the designs that Adam Burns and I worked together on,

176
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:34,993
We wanted to give the students an example of wiring in metal studs, because, you know, when you work in industry, it's not all wood, sometimes there's metal involved.

177
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:37,436
So we had the confidence to build a metal stud wall.

178
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:45,004
But really the focus of this and the thing I'm really most excited about is we're going to teach the students how to fish wires into old homes.

179
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,328
So what you're looking at on the left is a corner that we put sheetrock.

180
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:55,152
Then there's a piece of plexiglass, another piece of sheetrock, more plexiglass, and then sheetrock that goes down the wall.

181
00:12:55,612 --> 00:13:04,878
And the students will learn how to cut a hole into the sheetrock, and they'll be able to see how a snake goes through a ceiling, because there's joists and there's strapping up there.

182
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,522
And that's what the plexiglass is for, so they can see what happens to the snake when it's in the ceiling.

183
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:12,484
And then they'll come down and go into the switches.

184
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,386
So I think that this is gonna be something unique.

185
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:17,328
I haven't heard of anybody else doing this.

186
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:21,412
And I think that Adam and I have built something here that's gonna be pretty neat.

187
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:27,338
Another good feature is we left one of the rooms wide open and the same student who likes CAD designed a kitchen.

188
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:34,325
And next year, when we get back to school, one of our lesson plans will be how to wire a kitchen because it's a big part of the industry.

189
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:37,208
It's one of the best moneymakers electricians have to be honest with you.

190
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:45,531
There's usually about nine circuits involved, and everything will be to scale because it's big enough to be a real kitchen with a stove and a refrigerator and all that.

191
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,632
And he has put on the print where those things are going to go.

192
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:57,755
And this will really teach the students the things that are in the National Electrical Code that have to do with the kitchen, how to wire a stove, how to wire a refrigerator, because it's a little different.

193
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,677
And it'll be something that they're going to really enjoy when they get to do it.

194
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:04,797
So we're very excited about this.

195
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:14,920
And now we have all the space we need for our incoming students and the next year's freshmen, because that's always where we run into a problem, is when we have all four classes in the shop for long periods of time.

196
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,820
At the beginning of the year, it's exploratory.

197
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,480
It's not so bad.

198
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:28,443
But when the freshmen choose their shops, like they have for the second half of this year, we have to make sure that we can accommodate them to make room for this.

199
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,652
Actually, I get a little emotional about this.

200
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:35,035
We were able to get our old related room back.

201
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:39,140
For years, the electrical program had no related room connected.

202
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,786
And then somehow things happened and they took the room away from us.

203
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:48,179
It became a culinary related room.

204
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,200
Well, they didn't really need it.

205
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:57,025
And my friend Dennis, who did pass away, as you all know, before he left, we had made an arrangement to take that room back because he wasn't using it anymore.

206
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:00,067
He was able to use the conference room for his classroom.

207
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,689
So one of the last conversations we had was us taking over that room.

208
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:08,172
And now it kind of feels weird being in there and seeing all this stuff and having to move it out.

209
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:11,093
But anyway, we do have our own classroom back again.

210
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:14,696
That's a huge help because now people can work in the shop while we're working in the

211
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:19,886
in the related room and the class doesn't get disturbed by the people using all their tools.

212
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,428
So everything's going really well actually.

213
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:28,313
And I appreciate all the support that you people always give us because without you, we couldn't grow the way we are.

214
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,154
We wouldn't have the money to be able to afford this.

215
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,135
So thank you.

216
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:41,812
Thank you, Rich, and you may or may not be aware that we have asked this year which is really exciting for us we've asked for an additional teacher and electrical.

217
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:51,497
So we're really, we're, we're stepping up to the likes of the bigger vocational technical high schools in the state and we're asking for three teachers, which is only going to enhance the program even more.

218
00:15:52,197 --> 00:16:00,461
And Rich, I just want to publicly thank you for your leadership and your dedication to the program, because not only are you a graduate of the program, but you're just somebody I can rely on.

219
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,262
And it's nice to have you and the kids.

220
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:05,163
You guys are always impressing me with what you do.

221
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:06,404
So great work.

222
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:08,084
It's nothing.

223
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:08,965
I know.

224
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:13,107
So that's a brief update of what we've done.

225
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:16,688
I'll take any questions if anybody has them at this point.

226
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:17,809
Kathy?

227
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:19,630
Yes, Ms.

228
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,010
Van de Koot.

229
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:23,334
Well, first I just want to say thank you for the great presentation.

230
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,097
It's great to see all of the projects.

231
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:35,305
I'm particularly excited I have to say I think that that new house and you know the what you've talked about with the kids being able to learn how to do the kitchen.

232
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:39,729
and how to, you know, cut into the drywall, whatever.

233
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:40,970
It's just fantastic.

234
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,191
So really exciting.

235
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,472
I can't wait to see it in person.

236
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:51,840
And the outside of the house of the school looks, by the vocational interest, looks so much better.

237
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,143
So thank you for, thanks for all you do.

238
00:16:56,867 --> 00:17:00,749
And I definitely wanted to just say the presentation was phenomenal.

239
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:13,917
And all the projects that are going on with all the different programs, the construction, craft, labor, and the carpentry students working together on the outside project with the cement, that is unbelievable.

240
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:14,877
It looks beautiful.

241
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:23,162
The landscaping, it looks wonderful and very exciting to hear about the electrical program expansion.

242
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:42,032
and the collaboration with the students working on CAD and just that's so interesting that we're gonna be the first to actually be part of wiring and teaching the students how to fish the wires through and to be able to see it, that is so exciting and so unique.

243
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,193
It's wonderful.

244
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:50,577
Everything you just shared today is unbelievable with everything that's already completed at the vocational school.

245
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,779
It's just, it's looking beautiful.

246
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:56,085
Thank you.

247
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:56,325
Yes.

248
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:57,646
Thank you.

249
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:58,987
Yeah, this is all very exciting.

250
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:03,450
And I know my son absolutely loves the rotation this year through electrical as a ninth grader.

251
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:20,882
I have a question about, obviously I'm not an electrician, but are there any specialized things in the electrical program related to, you know, solar and car chargers and all of those things that

252
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:24,526
I think of as new, but if you're an electrician, they're just electricity, I'm sure.

253
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:28,669
But is there anything in our program for those, or is there a need for something like that?

254
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:36,715
So as far as the solar panels go, we don't really get into that much because what we found out is they don't really use apprentices for those jobs.

255
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:43,441
When they need an apprentice, they go out and hire a carpenter and call that person an apprentice so that they can do the work of putting the panels.

256
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:44,902
I'm sorry, my grandson's crying in the background.

257
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:47,344
They can do the work of putting the solar panels up on the roof.

258
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,245
So we do want to do some, we have a couple, we show them to them.

259
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:53,526
What was the other thing you asked about?

260
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:54,967
Yeah, electric vehicle.

261
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:55,827
Oh, yeah.

262
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:58,349
So a couple of years ago, we installed a charger.

263
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,429
Yeah, I use it.

264
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:00,409
Yeah, there you go.

265
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,131
So we installed that a few years ago with the help of the city, they had a grant.

266
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:07,232
And if they get another grant, we'll do that one also.

267
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:13,195
And actually, the other day, I did take them all out there to show it how it works and show them how to calculate the kilowatt hours.

268
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,276
I think they charge you 25 cents a kilowatt hour.

269
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:26,866
So we went over all that and we are going to add to our program a little bit more about that because the mandate saying that the gas engine vehicles will be gone in 10 or 20 years or so.

270
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,210
And there's a code rule now that you have to put an outlet in for a car charger.

271
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,812
So yes, we are covering that.

272
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:34,217
Thank you.

273
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:36,098
We're also doing voice and data work.

274
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:42,481
When we built the new robotics program, it was the first time the school had let us install the Cat6 data wiring.

275
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:47,684
And the kids installed 66 points, which is 120 punchdowns.

276
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,205
And there were two mistakes.

277
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:52,006
When they came to certify, there were two mistakes out of that whole thing.

278
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:54,528
So yeah, we're trying to expand as much as we can.

279
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:55,608
We're trying to keep up with the times.

280
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:56,909
Thank you.

281
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,329
That's great.

282
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,070
Yep.

283
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:02,967
I especially liked right after the electric car charging station.

284
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,549
One of my favorite days was when Ms.

285
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:11,532
Alicia Hunt, our director of energy and environment came to you and it was taken by a car that was not being charged.

286
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:12,272
That was fun.

287
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,233
I was a little thrilled that day.

288
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:15,614
So sorry again, Alicia.

289
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:22,678
Any other questions for me?

290
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,083
Okay, thank you guys.

291
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:33,147
Yeah, would you be able to share the presentation with us via email?

292
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,429
Sure, I'll do that right now.

293
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,510
Thank you so much.

294
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,291
I really appreciate it.

295
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,072
And thank you both.

296
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,834
Mr. Comeo, thank you so much for being here.

297
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:40,336
Thank you, Mr. Fallon, for being here.

298
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:43,780
And always enjoy hearing about all the projects going on.

299
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,301
Thank you.

300
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:45,102
Thanks.

301
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:59,688
So next we have Mr. McLaughlin and it's, so agenda number five, Meffitt High School front entrance, letter, sign, and walkway.

302
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:11,435
So at our last meeting, we discussed in great detail that, you know, it was recommended by the superintendent that it's very difficult to know where the front entrance of the school is.

303
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:16,278
We need an official main entrance with a sign designating the front entrance.

304
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:22,079
And I and I know, you know, there's been some talk that, well, we're going to have the visionary committee form.

305
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:30,522
But even in the short time, it's very important that we have an official sign on Mefford High School, you know, to just note Mefford High School.

306
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:37,803
So at our last meeting, we asked John if he can get us estimates and some sign pictures.

307
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:43,525
So we got a collection of we got an estimate, which I will share that

308
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:47,267
Right now, one moment, I'm just going to get that open.

309
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,129
And I did share with everybody via the email.

310
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,152
I'm just going to go to the area where I have to just quickly open up the estimate.

311
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:22,919
Okay, while we're doing that, John, did you want to maybe just go over anything while I'm just locating that estimate?

312
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:37,209
Hi, sorry.

313
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,871
As usual, our house is busy as well.

314
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:57,093
So basically what I did is I did, I brought in a company to do a little bit of design work and try to get some pricing information on, you know, obviously signage for the front of Mefford High School.

315
00:22:57,673 --> 00:23:01,774
And I was kind of, I was actually surprised at the pricing information.

316
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:02,514
I thought that it was,

317
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:07,418
You know, I thought it was a lot, but anyways, it really looked good.

318
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:21,563
I just figured it to use it as a starting point to push forward or whatever, not push forward or just a starting point for a sign at the high school.

319
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:27,256
And I just put the estimate up on the screen right now.

320
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,536
So- Yeah, so that's one of them.

321
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:36,317
There was, I think there was a few of them because they were done by, obviously by design.

322
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:44,639
So I initially told him to, you know, give me a few different scopes at a few different price points.

323
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,040
So they're ranging, it looks like from 21,250 and,

324
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,781
up to up to 26,850.

325
00:23:57,182 --> 00:24:12,548
And you had mentioned that, you know, for those at first, when I when I had first got the estimates, or those two estimates, and when I first got the estimates, I sent them over to the mayor's office, and I sent all of it to her all the pitches.

326
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:23,652
And she looked at him and she liked those two particular signs, which was, I think it was like one in four, I think, in the estimate.

327
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:24,873
So she liked those ones.

328
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:30,255
And then when we got the pricing back, it kind of fell off my chest.

329
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:38,959
So I went back to the guy and he said the basic sign, Mefford High School basic sign was just going to be probably about a little over 10,000.

330
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,351
Can I ask a question?

331
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:44,132
Yes.

332
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:54,721
And of course my phone's ringing at this point, but my question is, I've just seen the phenomenal work that our students are doing at the vocational school.

333
00:24:55,442 --> 00:25:05,490
And I'm wondering whether there's a way for this project, designing a sign, whether it makes any sense to,

334
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:25,449
to ask Chad, and I don't know if Chad's still on, you know, is there between our different shops, is this something that, you know, a sign, I know there might be a timeline, so if the desire is expediency, maybe it takes too long, but I just wondered

335
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:31,043
I'm sorry, I just can't have my video on at the second.

336
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,304
But we did talk about this.

337
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,765
John knows we're willing to help.

338
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:37,528
We felt it was a little bit beyond our scope at this point.

339
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,229
So I think that's why he went out for bids.

340
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,731
But John knows we'll always do whatever we can to help.

341
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,392
I just think it was a little bit outside of our realm.

342
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:49,356
From the lighting perspective or from the installation?

343
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:55,296
I'm curious what part of the project was the most challenging to you, Chad?

344
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:59,317
Well, because we weren't sure what kind of letters it was going to be.

345
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,518
Was it going to be one sign?

346
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:02,438
So I think it was a little bit unclear at this point.

347
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:05,979
And so that's all I can say about that.

348
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:12,361
I think we're always interested in seeing if it fits and if it fits into what we're doing, we're more than happy to help.

349
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:13,121
John knows that too.

350
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:14,474
Oh, absolutely.

351
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:14,995
No, no, no.

352
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:22,658
Chad, Chad, you know, obviously, I mean, he was the good news part of the meeting on the second half with the bad news, I guess.

353
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:33,222
So whatever you want to call it, but, uh, yeah, no, Chad, Chad in the, in the, uh, they actually helped us this afternoon as well, uh, down by the front entrance, getting some mops for us.

354
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:33,402
So.

355
00:26:33,712 --> 00:26:35,212
Yes, yes, yes.

356
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:45,715
Do you wanna, like, I guess one of the questions is kind of getting a sense from the committee what we think, you mentioned the mayor like number one and four, is it possible to put them up right now?

357
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:52,717
Yes, and that's what I was, I was just waiting for just that conversation to finish up and I'm gonna share the next screen.

358
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:54,418
One moment, let me just click on it.

359
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:58,359
I just have to navigate, I just have a lot open, so I'm going to the area.

360
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:00,752
Okay, I think it's right here.

361
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,076
Okay, here it is.

362
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:07,197
Okay, I just have to, I'm getting it ready here.

363
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,959
I'm ready to do it right now.

364
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,241
Okay, let's see.

365
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:12,202
Okay, right here.

366
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:15,764
Okay.

367
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:29,689
Okay, so with the help of Dr. Cushing and Dr. Maurice and Ms.

368
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:36,094
Susie Weiss today, they put together this slide presentation, which I'm gonna show you right now.

369
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:42,919
And it has the pictures that John McLaughlin shared with all of us in the email.

370
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:48,703
So as you can see right now, I'm showing you pictures one and two.

371
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:49,844
Can you see that okay?

372
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:50,845
Can everybody see that okay?

373
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:51,958
Yes.

374
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,259
OK, good.

375
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:53,659
All right.

376
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,240
And I don't want to move along too quickly.

377
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,101
So I was just going to pause it right there for a moment.

378
00:27:57,222 --> 00:28:01,384
And now let me move on to the next slide.

379
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:03,245
And I can make it a little bit bigger.

380
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,887
Let me just see if it might be too small.

381
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:09,990
Let's see.

382
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,450
It can either be 100.

383
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,671
Oh, zoom out.

384
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:13,031
Zoom in.

385
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:13,732
Zoom out.

386
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:14,933
Oh, sorry.

387
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,313
Wrong zoom.

388
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:22,848
Yeah, sorry, I think I did the wrong one.

389
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:26,369
Making it smaller zoom in.

390
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,190
There we go.

391
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,110
I'm getting right now.

392
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:34,013
One more time just to make it a little bigger.

393
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:37,755
OK, this is much bigger.

394
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:40,216
OK, so as you can see.

395
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:41,537
There.

396
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:46,799
They look very similar, but I think it's just a different font.

397
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,600
So here is number one.

398
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,641
And then number two.

399
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:02,231
And this is number three and four.

400
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:05,353
So three and four look very similar.

401
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:07,675
You know what the difference is?

402
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:16,221
Is that the M is in the white on number three and the Medford, like the Mustang M is in the blue background on number four.

403
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:19,464
And then five has the white background.

404
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:22,506
I don't like the white background in the middle.

405
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:25,029
Okay, okay, that's good.

406
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:41,476
So as part of this, and I was going to ask, I don't know if Dr. Cushing was able to help, but what we were going to do was to do a poll, but I'm not sure if we're able to do something like that.

407
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:49,839
I know it was very last minute, so I just wanted to ask Dr. Cushing if that was something that we would be able to do, but if not, it's not a problem.

408
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,261
It was just something that I thought of very last minute,

409
00:29:54,362 --> 00:30:02,760
I was at a meeting yesterday and we did a poll and on the zoom call and it was, you know, it was interactive and I said, Oh, maybe we could do that for this meeting tonight.

410
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:04,503
And there's number six.

411
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:09,230
It's the blue, it looks, you know, with the Mustang traditional.

412
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:14,193
Number seven, this is just the standard Mayford High School sign.

413
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:30,741
And then it looks like- If you can see that sign, it's cut out so that the cement is the letters, just so that if you don't, if you can't see it that well, in case you were gonna make a decision, that's exactly how it is.

414
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:31,662
That's the cement.

415
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,403
So it's basically just the frame.

416
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:35,624
Oh wow, that's really neat.

417
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,566
And then it says home of the Mustangs on it underneath.

418
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:43,789
And let's go to number eight.

419
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:49,193
And this one looks very similar to number seven.

420
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:52,375
It's just where it says home of the Mustangs is a little different.

421
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:54,937
It is a little different, just slightly different.

422
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,501
Just where it says home of the monster.

423
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:05,043
I can see the line goes all the way across on number eight and it stops a little bit on number seven.

424
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:07,864
Okay.

425
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:13,967
And just be aware too, while we're looking at these, they're not lighted signs.

426
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:18,728
So just so that you know, there's no, they're not lighted.

427
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:20,389
Not lighted, okay.

428
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,030
But we could shine a light on them.

429
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:33,283
For sure, yes, we can add lights on the building somewhere up or below or below it or above it or however.

430
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:39,788
Now that sign right there is obviously the etching on the window would be done as well.

431
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:42,050
And then the Mustang pride over the door.

432
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:49,596
I don't know on this one, the things that I think it's, you've got the horse in two different places.

433
00:31:50,837 --> 00:32:04,960
I like the Mustang pride over the door, but maybe if, I mean, if we're gonna use this rendition of the horse, then maybe I would do the etching on the window, but have one of the plainer signs over it.

434
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:10,782
I mean, I don't understand why we would repeat the horse twice.

435
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:23,733
So if I could jump in for, so this is not an official logo of the Medford public schools.

436
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,515
And so like, I think this would be a significant shift.

437
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:36,961
I would, my recommendation would be to stick with the M logo that has actually been updated by the CTE graphics department.

438
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,003
But the other thing too is, I mean, if you wanted to go with something like this, I think that's fine.

439
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:48,448
It's just, it would be more of a significant shift versus what is there now.

440
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:56,395
The other thing I wanted to mention is the first five signs that you put up were designed to be backlit by LED.

441
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,327
Yeah, so I'm not wild about this new logo.

442
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:14,496
What I do like, I like, depending, the home of the Mustang's right over the door is, you know, I prefer we stay with our old logo.

443
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:22,302
I like the old logo.

444
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:23,183
Yes, Mr. Russo?

445
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:26,265
Based on the feedback we've been receiving around

446
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:39,763
the school name change, I'm wondering if we shouldn't find a way to engage the entire community in a poll of some sort and let them choose.

447
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:42,605
I mean, I don't think we can put a logo on a ballot.

448
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:51,812
I don't know that the format of ballots allows for anything other than text, but I'm uncomfortable deciding something that's important.

449
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:56,568
So I disagree with you, Paul, if I may, Ms.

450
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:57,389
Cathy?

451
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:58,210
Yes, Ms.

452
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,511
Van de Kool, go ahead.

453
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:09,278
I mean, if we were to reconsider naming the high school at some point, that would be when we did a very large project, if we were going to ever go that way.

454
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:16,763
I think for this one, the idea was simply to get a sign on at the front signage as soon as possible.

455
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:18,785
We see, I mean,

456
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:31,816
Involving the whole community to make a decision about whether they like this sign or that sign to me is similar to sort of involving the whole community and whether we want this paint or that paint.

457
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:46,714
I think this is in our purview that we can suggest, you know, we might want to involve all our colleagues or the mayor, whatever, or, you know, but to go further than that, I mean, I don't think this is a community issue.

458
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:51,875
I think this is coming up with a good design and getting it up over the door.

459
00:34:53,415 --> 00:35:00,157
I don't disagree in principle, but the renaming of the Columbus is absolutely explicitly in the law within our purview.

460
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,218
The community disagrees greatly.

461
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:04,515
that we should be making as such a decision.

462
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:11,138
So I don't know where to draw the line, but if it's what's in our authority, then that's fine.

463
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:14,119
So Paul, we're not renaming the high school.

464
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,401
We're putting a sign with the high school's name on it.

465
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:20,983
And spending far more than we're gonna spend on the Columbus renaming.

466
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:24,805
And the principal argument against the Columbus renaming is we can't afford it.

467
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:30,587
I think we could also say that's a can of worms too.

468
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:41,409
I'm just not willing to vote to spend $25,000 on a new sign when there's already signage that isn't perhaps adequate.

469
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:42,649
I'm not going to disagree with that.

470
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:57,573
But I think if we're going to spend that kind of money after the number of communications we received about spending money on a sign about another building, it seems really tone deaf.

471
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:09,513
So the question will be the cost of what we got as bids surprises me that it's so expensive.

472
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:15,535
And I think that's the issue is to say, hey, we like this kind of, this is kind of what we're looking for.

473
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:19,157
How can we do it in a less expensive way?

474
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:22,258
Can it be done in a less expensive way?

475
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:30,664
I mean, I look at the letter on the vocational school, and I think it looks pretty good.

476
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:32,547
How is that done?

477
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:44,200
So Dr. Cushing has his hand raised, and I just wanted to mention that in this particular project, we're not renaming the high school.

478
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:48,024
Medford High School doesn't have a sign on the front entrance.

479
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:54,490
There's no way to find the front of the school because there isn't a sign.

480
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,733
For some reason, when the school was built,

481
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:58,754
they just never put a sign up.

482
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:01,736
I had discussed this with John McLaughlin.

483
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:13,844
So what we're doing today in the committee and what we spoke of in the last meeting was that we would like to have a sign to designate the front entrance of the Medford High School.

484
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:16,606
So we asked John McLaughlin to get some estimates.

485
00:37:16,646 --> 00:37:21,329
So some of the pictures that I shared were a little bit more in detail

486
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:38,639
but then we could just go with a simpler sign that just simply says Medford High School without a logo and just leave it like that and we could you know once you know the vision committee is formed in the future that sign can be taken off and then put

487
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:46,982
in another place in the new high school or the new renovated high school at some time in the future, which might not be for 10 or many years later.

488
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:55,726
So I just wanted to provide that clarification about what we're talking about on this meeting agenda item.

489
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:59,088
But Dr. Cushing, go ahead and then Mr. McLaughlin after that.

490
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:04,610
So one of the things that in speaking to a signed installer about this project

491
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:11,630
One of the complicating factors is the height off the ground and the medium that it's being mounted into.

492
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:19,997
So that's just a complicating factor that kind of adds to the complexity of being able to do this work.

493
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:29,288
You know, and then if we are to get electricity there, that, you know, could that be something the city electricians could help with to help defray the cost?

494
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:42,712
Could that be something that, you know, the CTE students, Mr. Cormier, who was on the call, might they be able to help us to get to a certain point with that power to help defray some of the cost?

495
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:49,834
So those are just some of the things that, you know, the location of the sign and those types of things can impact that cost.

496
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,274
Mr. McLaughlin?

497
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:58,378
And just to add to it now, that's only one company.

498
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:05,524
That's only one designer with a bunch of different designs.

499
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:07,826
I mean, there's plenty of companies out there.

500
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:15,632
I mean, you know, we could have graphic arts design assigned and then have it made or see how we could have it made.

501
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:18,615
Or like Chad said, maybe a possibility that

502
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:24,058
the students may do it, or we can send it out to a sign maker and have it done.

503
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:38,545
I mean, so that was just basically, I had one company come in, draw up a bunch of schematics, just so that we could get an idea or a starting point on where we could go as far as the signage goes and different types of signs.

504
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:41,047
And I was curious to see what he came up with.

505
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,649
And I like some of it and some of it, you know, obviously, you know,

506
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:51,150
It's not maybe necessarily my taste, but that's really it.

507
00:39:51,190 --> 00:40:02,712
I mean, we certainly have a whole way that we can go in whatever way we choose to pursue it, but it was just a starting point, I guess you could say.

508
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:08,033
And I know Peter has a company too that he has been in contact with as well.

509
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:11,234
And so I guess that's it.

510
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:27,957
So as part of this demonstration, I asked Dr. Cushing if he could help me with just launching a poll so that we can just get some feedback of preference for a sign.

511
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:31,018
So I was going to do that right now.

512
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:37,820
I will click, launch the polling, and then I'm going to screen share again the signs so that everybody can see them again.

513
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,721
So if you could just bear with me, I'm going to click on launch the polling.

514
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,623
And this is just to get some feedback.

515
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:53,066
Ultimately, we'll have to bring this to the whole committee to hear what their thoughts are, but this is just a starting point to get to the next step.

516
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:54,427
So hold on a moment.

517
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:55,607
I'm going to click launch polling.

518
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:56,727
Okay.

519
00:40:57,348 --> 00:41:02,830
So now I'm going to then click screen share and go back to the pictures.

520
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:12,450
So if you, everybody, can you see the poll that's in progress right now?

521
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:20,415
So I just need to withdraw the co-host permission from everyone so that they can actually vote.

522
00:41:21,456 --> 00:41:22,176
Perfect, thank you.

523
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:23,117
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

524
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:31,362
And the other thing too, I think one of the things today that might be good

525
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:54,398
is, and maybe that's not the purview of this group, but for us to get a dollar amount that you are comfortable with, so that we can start going through and making those types of calls and that type of work.

526
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:57,640
Yes, because there's certainly procurement

527
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:07,481
hurdles as well in certain amounts of money that we, you know, you can spend, but you need to, you know, have three quotes.

528
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:14,006
And so it's a little bit difficult with a sign, cause you, you know, you want three quotes for the exact same sign.

529
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:22,013
Well, I don't know, you know, if everybody makes the exact same sign, but it's still procurement rules that we have to follow as well.

530
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:26,068
Excuse me, Pete, sorry.

531
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:27,869
I'm sharing the pictures again.

532
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:29,809
Can everybody see the pictures?

533
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,610
You're doing great.

534
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:34,291
Okay, perfect, okay.

535
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:34,871
Mr. McLaughlin.

536
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:40,973
I'm going through them pretty quickly, but I'm gonna go back up again so you can see them again.

537
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:50,936
Just thinking about what I like my reference to.

538
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:54,717
Which one's that?

539
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:56,906
This is number six.

540
00:42:57,506 --> 00:42:57,827
OK.

541
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:02,170
I should tell you, this is number seven.

542
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:06,953
This is number eight.

543
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,116
This is number nine.

544
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:15,339
Number 10.

545
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,761
This is number 11.

546
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,543
Can you do one, two, and three again, Kathy?

547
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:22,464
Yes, of course.

548
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,526
Here is one and two.

549
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,027
They are on the same slide.

550
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,329
Show one.

551
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:28,650
Very similar.

552
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:34,735
I have a hard time figuring out which is, I think they're both in my, the way I look at it, I can see they look the same.

553
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,957
And here is four, here is three.

554
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:40,299
Okay, wait a minute, where's three?

555
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,261
Three is right here.

556
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:43,582
Oops, sorry, I went too fast.

557
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,584
I clicked off of it, sorry.

558
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:47,666
Wait, here we go.

559
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:51,289
Three has the white background for the logo M.

560
00:43:52,786 --> 00:44:05,914
and then four has the blue background, the logo, and five has the blue logo background with white from Everett High School.

561
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:13,559
The thing is that, so everyone knows is, I mean, you know, there are certain elements that you can mix and match in signs here.

562
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:20,323
So there's some that, as member Van de Kloet said, there's the sign over the door, there's the applique to the window,

563
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:24,189
and then the main sign up on the concrete facade.

564
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:33,567
So in speaking to one of the sign companies, the overwhelming majority of all of that would be able to survive

565
00:44:34,717 --> 00:44:39,041
any renovation in the future or be reapplied.

566
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:47,568
Obviously the appliques to the windows would be something that would need to be replaced, but what goes up can easily be taken down.

567
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:59,299
It's just, there would be, no matter what you do, there would be a cost, you know, kind of, if you're doing a renovation, the cost would be baked into the renovation as to the cost of taking down the sign.

568
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:01,761
Peter.

569
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:03,207
Yes.

570
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:04,588
Mr. Russo, go ahead.

571
00:45:05,088 --> 00:45:05,408
Thank you.

572
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:09,149
I'm not sure what renovation you're talking about, but I mean, if we do a new- Potential.

573
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,611
Okay, if we do a new high school, I'm not sure $25,000 is part of the conversation.

574
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:16,792
I concur.

575
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:21,314
Does anybody need me to show the pictures?

576
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:25,356
Do you want me to stop the screen share and everybody can take the poll?

577
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:31,198
Can I just see one and two again?

578
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,273
Yes, you may.

579
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:33,654
Yep, let me get up to one and two.

580
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:34,094
Yep.

581
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:38,997
Okay, so here is one on top, two on the bottom.

582
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,739
On this one, we can only vote for one, correct?

583
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,340
It looks like they are the same.

584
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:48,042
Yeah, they look to be the same too.

585
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:48,942
I'm looking for differences.

586
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:50,463
They're a little bit thinner.

587
00:45:50,503 --> 00:45:51,644
Yeah, exactly, I think, yeah.

588
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:53,545
There's a little bit thinner.

589
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:55,406
Yes, the font, it must be the font.

590
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:56,887
Yes, I do see it now.

591
00:45:57,978 --> 00:46:05,641
what it's like a little bit, you know, a milder font on number, it looks like on number two, a little bit more dramatic on number one.

592
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,022
Excuse me.

593
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:08,583
Sorry.

594
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:11,644
And then here is three, four, and five.

595
00:46:14,745 --> 00:46:16,246
And this is number six.

596
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:27,331
And then this is number seven, number eight, number nine,

597
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:31,556
And number 10, and then, yep.

598
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:37,739
And this is just, I think this was an extra one, number 11.

599
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,940
So we just have the 10 of them on the poll.

600
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,022
Yeah, it would only go till 210.

601
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:49,245
If somebody really loves number 11, I would say, I've re-enabled the chat.

602
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:50,285
You can throw it in there.

603
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:53,867
So I'm going to stop the screen share right now.

604
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:55,848
Yeah, I need to see six again.

605
00:46:56,968 --> 00:46:58,009
Okay, let me do it again.

606
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,149
I'm looking at the documents we received.

607
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:02,450
So those are not numbered the same.

608
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,951
Let me do this screen share again.

609
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:04,511
One second.

610
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:06,812
Oh, I'm disabled right now.

611
00:47:06,832 --> 00:47:07,272
I'm sorry.

612
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,873
Dr. Cushing.

613
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,014
Yeah, no problem.

614
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:22,199
Should be good to go now.

615
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:23,299
Okay, thanks.

616
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,180
Okay, here we go.

617
00:47:25,914 --> 00:47:28,736
Oh, and what did you want to see again, Mr. Russo?

618
00:47:29,256 --> 00:47:29,776
Number six.

619
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,097
Number six, okay.

620
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:33,698
And here is number six.

621
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,100
Okay, then that wasn't the one I wanted to see.

622
00:47:38,781 --> 00:47:39,622
Number seven, maybe?

623
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:41,823
Okay, this is number seven.

624
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:43,324
Okay, thank you.

625
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:44,425
You're welcome.

626
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,426
Does anybody else want to see any

627
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:52,135
I'm not hearing anybody.

628
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:58,397
So I'm going to stop the screen share and then I'm going to take the poll myself.

629
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:05,240
Okay.

630
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,501
So did everybody get a chance to take the poll?

631
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:11,203
Okay.

632
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:11,683
Very good.

633
00:48:12,263 --> 00:48:12,563
All right.

634
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,143
So, um,

635
00:48:15,857 --> 00:48:17,598
And Dr. Cushing, I'll need your help.

636
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:19,400
I don't know how to see the results.

637
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,340
That's all right.

638
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:27,586
So we have option two has 17% of the polling.

639
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:34,731
Option six has three, I'm sorry, 50% of the polling.

640
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:40,135
And what I was reading there, option seven has 33% of the polling.

641
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:41,136
Okay.

642
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:44,898
So option six is the winner in this group.

643
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:50,430
But, you know.

644
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,432
Well, we probably should use rank choice voting and drop below us and have everybody vote again.

645
00:48:56,572 --> 00:49:04,735
So option two would be dropped, option six and seven would be there.

646
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,576
I'm going to end the polling and go in and create a new one real quick.

647
00:49:10,536 --> 00:49:13,157
Actually, I'll tell you what, let me launch polling.

648
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:16,618
And I'll bring up the screen share again.

649
00:49:16,638 --> 00:49:20,880
All right, so your only choice is option six and seven.

650
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,502
All the other choices are there, but for ease, six and seven.

651
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:26,303
Can you show us six and seven?

652
00:49:26,944 --> 00:49:28,505
And I'm going to do the screen share.

653
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:31,306
Dr. Cushing, could I have permission to screen share again?

654
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:34,548
And there you go.

655
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:35,528
Thank you.

656
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,492
OK, so we are just looking at, oops.

657
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:41,972
Oops, OK.

658
00:49:44,005 --> 00:50:05,855
six and seven okay so let's take another closer look at number six spend a little time next i'm going to go over to seven so is seven another cut out one seven oh okay uh mr mclaughlin could you answer that question number seven

659
00:50:07,702 --> 00:50:10,263
Let me just, could I just look at it real quick?

660
00:50:10,363 --> 00:50:14,785
Because if it looked like the cement, then yeah, that's cut out.

661
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:16,786
So I can't see it from here.

662
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:26,411
So in my recollection with the one who submitted this sign display, that would be, it's cut out.

663
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:36,716
It shows the concrete behind and there would be an option to add LED blue, white, whatever color you want.

664
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:41,364
behind there so it would shine and illuminate kind of like a backlit sign.

665
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:46,705
So the thing about this then is that it's not showing the blue and white colors.

666
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:50,325
It's showing the blue and the color of the school.

667
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,046
It could also be painted behind if you wanted to.

668
00:50:56,766 --> 00:51:00,187
So you could paint the concrete white and then that would show through.

669
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:05,248
And here is number six again.

670
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:17,113
Does anybody need more time on these pictures or do we want to just proceed with the poll?

671
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:21,961
So I'm going to stop the screen share and if everybody wants to take the poll.

672
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:44,026
And did everybody get a chance to take the poll?

673
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:51,632
I think that's good.

674
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:52,452
Dr. Cushing, go ahead.

675
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:53,093
Nope.

676
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:57,737
I was just going to let you know that 67% of the people on this call voted for option six.

677
00:51:58,377 --> 00:52:01,340
Option seven, it has now changed, is now 57% and 43%.

678
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,520
So yeah.

679
00:52:09,672 --> 00:52:10,992
Okay, excellent.

680
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:22,515
So, you know, the reason we did the poll was we wanted to kind of narrow down, you know, what type of sign would be preferable for Memphis High School.

681
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:31,317
As part of this evening's agenda item, you know, as Dr. Cushing said, is that we want to kind of narrow down a price.

682
00:52:32,177 --> 00:52:40,405
So we want to have something very similar to what's showing in number six or possibly seven if we were going to share six and seven with the full committee.

683
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:49,775
So, you know, I'm thinking, you know, in terms of figures, you know, like, let's say

684
00:52:51,535 --> 00:53:14,641
you know, 15,000, like, I mean, I would like to hear some feedback from my committee members to put a sign on Medford High School that would be able to be transferable at some time in the future, you know, would that be something that I could, you know, we could possibly, you know, kind of decide on this evening or 15 to 20, you know,

685
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:25,943
I just, I'm not particularly interested in whether it's transferable.

686
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:29,663
I just also have no interest in renovating the building.

687
00:53:29,803 --> 00:53:34,444
So I don't think that for me would be part of my calculation.

688
00:53:35,204 --> 00:53:38,185
And I am not sure if that affects pricing.

689
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:47,486
I also, the subcommittee can only make recommendations if the full committee decides.

690
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:51,687
So I feel like if there's two options, the full committee really should

691
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:53,538
get both options at least.

692
00:53:54,258 --> 00:53:54,899
Yep, yep.

693
00:53:55,299 --> 00:54:04,704
So I think what what I was trying to say and I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that I'm making the decision, I want to, I want to make a recommendation to the full committee.

694
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:12,308
So, if we want to definitely move this project into the full committee for them to see both number six and seven.

695
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:22,370
And, you know, I guess, you know, we can give the estimate that we currently have that Mr McLaughlin has received from I believe it's from white.

696
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:24,393
That was a picture from white lights.

697
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:25,674
Is that correct, Mr McLaughlin?

698
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:26,475
Yes.

699
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:26,976
Yeah.

700
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:27,356
Okay.

701
00:54:27,716 --> 00:54:30,640
So we have the estimate from white lights.

702
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,622
I'm not sure exactly what

703
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:37,325
you know, estimate goes with number six and white estimate goes with number seven.

704
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:44,128
Would you be able to tell us, Mr. McLaughlin, or would you have to reach out to them and you could get that by the next year?

705
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:47,170
I'll have to get, I'll have to get the pricing information.

706
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,731
Cause I think I had one in four at one point.

707
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:54,674
And then I think the basic sign, he just told me it was going to be like a little bit over 10,000.

708
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:59,676
Now we're just a basic Medford, you know, Medford high school sign.

709
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,137
So yeah.

710
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:02,298
So I can certainly reach out to him.

711
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:13,902
I did have communication with him today, so I can find out, you know, find out what option six, the price is on option six for sure.

712
00:55:14,462 --> 00:55:15,562
What is the sign made out of?

713
00:55:15,582 --> 00:55:31,968
You know what, I honestly, I don't really know what the materials are, but that's certainly a question that I can, I don't know if it said it on the quote or not, if the quote was that in detailed, but I can certainly find out what the material is.

714
00:55:32,995 --> 00:55:37,859
Okay, Kathy, we're probably more, it's probably, you know, it seems to me like modern plastic.

715
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:44,784
So modern, you know, on that idea, some of the work that I've seen that they have done.

716
00:55:45,985 --> 00:55:46,705
Dr. Cushing.

717
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:51,549
You know, I just had a very enlightened idea, basically fly into me.

718
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:56,172
And I was wondering if, would it be worthwhile for us to put this out to our student body?

719
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:04,897
and for us to really, you know, see, you know, take a look at the top three vote getters, right?

720
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:09,100
And have them really take a look at it and see what they think.

721
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:11,862
I just kind of- I love that idea.

722
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:12,503
You know?

723
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,824
Yes, I think that's wonderful.

724
00:56:14,224 --> 00:56:22,311
And I happen to know the student outreach coordinator, so I would be able to really connect with the student body and to see about this.

725
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:24,158
Is that what you say?

726
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,279
No, you know yourself.

727
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:25,799
That's good.

728
00:56:25,879 --> 00:56:27,600
That's therapy for you.

729
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:37,508
I would just ask that we do in like the top three are the yeah, I like never Vanderquilt I was uncomfortable with the other logo.

730
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:42,592
And we don't it didn't make our top three so we don't have to get into the reasons.

731
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:43,953
But

732
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:58,975
I think at the same time, I think it's worthwhile having a little bit more of a chat, maybe with construction, I mean with carpentry and electrical.

733
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:04,257
To me, this is the kind of project we can, what letters were done on the vocational school

734
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:10,098
So I think both, I think, Peter, I think it's a great idea to involve the students.

735
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:16,560
I think that doing some pictures around the school saying, which one do you like, you know, and it would be fabulous.

736
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,521
I know it's late in the year, but I think that would really be the best.

737
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:30,584
And I think if there is, you know, a way to see if there's any idea more about how to create the sign without spending that much.

738
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:39,042
And just so that, you know, two graphic arts could design the whole thing as well.

739
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:43,343
So, I mean, we have options, you know, we do.

740
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:48,225
Okay.

741
00:57:48,285 --> 00:58:01,050
So, so for, for this, then we, are we, is there like a recommendation to have Dr. Cushing do a poll with the student body with the three top signs and

742
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:18,330
Um, Mr. McLaughlin, would you be able to, um, reach out to, um, you know, the carpentry construction craft labor, Mr. Fallon and, um, the, um, you know, graphic arts to see if it would be something that they would be able to do.

743
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:25,455
And, you know, if it's definitely not, then we still have, you know, the sign estimate that we got.

744
00:58:26,015 --> 00:58:30,378
And then once we gather all that information, um, you know, we can then

745
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:38,182
you know, have another, I guess, another meeting at another subcommittee meeting to talk about the feedback.

746
00:58:39,443 --> 00:58:46,810
Yeah, because when it when it comes to the vocational school, obviously, projects have to align with their curriculum.

747
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:54,577
So I can certainly check in with with loosebag Nola over in graphic arts.

748
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:57,412
and whatever we need to do.

749
00:58:57,472 --> 00:59:02,894
I just basically just need my marching orders and we'll go out there and do what we gotta do.

750
00:59:05,535 --> 00:59:09,396
Okay, so at this point, we're going to keep this in subcommittee.

751
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:11,537
Is that what I'm hearing from my committee members?

752
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,479
Say that again, Kathy?

753
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:23,081
Are we going to keep this item in subcommittee at this time until we get the poll from the student body,

754
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,442
and just clarification from construction and craft labor and graphic arts.

755
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,083
There is a question about timing.

756
00:59:34,683 --> 00:59:38,865
And I'm not sure we're clear about what the timing should be.

757
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:46,547
Do we want it in place so it's there for the opening of school in September?

758
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:53,810
Or is it more important to cut costs, include the student body, et cetera?

759
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:08,915
So, so far what I'm hearing is we want to do a little more exploration and we're not ready to give an okay to a 20,000 plus sign.

760
01:00:11,137 --> 01:00:16,001
I think that's what I was hearing from some, I mean, some of my committee members.

761
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:28,050
I was, you know, I was asking for, you know, a ballpark figure, but it seems as though, you know, from what I heard was that maybe,

762
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,081
more exploration.

763
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:38,366
I would be amenable to having it ready for the first day of school, if we can do that.

764
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:46,792
And we can maybe get the polling information from the student body and have it ready for the June 14th meeting.

765
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:50,774
And we could share out the results with the full committee.

766
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:55,938
I would really like to really move forward with this project.

767
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:01,488
you know, I would like to make a motion to do something like that.

768
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:12,572
So motion to get the polling from the student body, Don McLaughlin reach out to just, you know, find out for sure, can construction craft labor do it?

769
01:01:12,812 --> 01:01:18,094
Yes or no, you know, with graphic arts, Mr. Fallon, he did speak already.

770
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:24,957
And he mentioned that it was out of his realm with what they could do, but maybe there are some things that they can do that could cut some costs.

771
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:31,536
Yes, and with the pricing, the pricing may be just the manufacturing of the sign.

772
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,177
I don't know if it included installation.

773
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:38,318
And then the other question is if it included the electrical work.

774
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:42,079
So I don't think it did, but I'm not certain.

775
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:50,921
The pricing information, it definitely didn't include the electrical work, but it did include the installation.

776
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:56,062
You know, this is where we really need a company to step up and make a donation.

777
01:02:00,338 --> 01:02:07,541
I don't know if the class of 2021 has had time to raise enough money to get their little logo on the bottom, right?

778
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:09,602
Gift of class of 2021.

779
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:16,785
I think Mr. McLaughlin, we have to say this sign a gift to the class of 2021.

780
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:19,626
We don't want anyone to think they gifted the high school.

781
01:02:24,748 --> 01:02:27,009
Yeah, you wouldn't want to be responsible for that gift.

782
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:29,540
Thanks, Jeff, for saving me.

783
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:35,484
OK, Kathy, I think it's 6.04 now.

784
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:43,931
So Dr. Cushing, do you think it's possible to get the polling done before the June 14 meeting?

785
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:45,973
Yeah, we can definitely do it next week.

786
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:53,145
And what the way my thinking about doing it is, you know, I have to go back and look at the options.

787
01:02:53,225 --> 01:03:00,288
But I would say if there's that top sign option, and that last option with the bottom give kids multiple choices.

788
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:07,471
So if they want to kind of like make, you know, the sign a little bit different, but then it just puts more ownership in the students hands.

789
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:24,453
And then we can just, you know, I'd like to just motion that we, um, to, to show the committee members, um, the sign ideas that we've, you know, visited this evening and we can hear their thoughts and we can share the results from the student body poll.

790
01:03:24,473 --> 01:03:36,897
And we can talk about the pricing estimates that we received, which will, you know, um, and we can go from there and Mr. McLaughlin, anything that you can find out any additional information, you know, please, you know, let me know, reach out to me.

791
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,418
Um, I appreciate it.

792
01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:46,351
So is there a second on that motion to share this with the full committee on our June 14th meeting?

793
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,914
Second.

794
01:03:50,095 --> 01:03:51,736
And so I'm going to take the roll call.

795
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:54,598
Mr. Russo?

796
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:55,579
Yes.

797
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:57,361
Ms.

798
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:57,761
Van De Kloet?

799
01:03:58,161 --> 01:03:58,402
Yes.

800
01:03:59,282 --> 01:03:59,683
And Ms.

801
01:03:59,723 --> 01:03:59,943
Kretz?

802
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:00,343
Yes.

803
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:03,606
So we have three in the affirmative and zero in the negative.

804
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:05,227
So the motion passes.

805
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:05,748
Thank you.

806
01:04:06,382 --> 01:04:08,203
Okay, so we're going to move on to the next.

807
01:04:08,623 --> 01:04:19,867
And the next discussion was just john McLaughlin was just going to go over some of the work that they did on the front entrance to just, you know, kind of rejuvenate it.

808
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,008
Mr. McLaughlin, if you could go over that.

809
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:24,249
Oh, sure.

810
01:04:24,769 --> 01:04:27,170
A couple of years ago, I had the landscaper come up and

811
01:04:28,122 --> 01:04:34,886
You know, obviously down the very, very front of the driveway at Steve Miller driveway in the left side.

812
01:04:34,906 --> 01:04:47,974
If you're coming up the driveway towards Medford High School there is a monument there and over the years we've tried many, many different approaches to try to, you know, put some flowers down there and

813
01:04:48,714 --> 01:04:57,583
You know, just try to make it a little bit more appealing just as you come in the driveway about I think it was about two years ago I met with the landscaper.

814
01:04:57,603 --> 01:05:09,575
And we put some more hardy flowers down there, I think that there's some there's some pitches that you have, but I mean it comes down to, and I will say to that aggie aggie to.

815
01:05:10,612 --> 01:05:18,798
in the forestry department came up and they, you know, they did some trimming in the area just to try to open it up a little bit.

816
01:05:19,098 --> 01:05:31,387
But I will say, I mean, our biggest problem is obviously water and getting water to that area, whether it, you know, obviously sprinkler, I mean, it hasn't rained right now for like almost two weeks.

817
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:35,590
So, I mean, there's been nothing to rejuvenate it.

818
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,192
So we just basically just kind of been doing the best we can

819
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:50,401
Today, Chad had some of the vocational students, we have bought some mulch and he spread some mulch around to get it ready for the summer.

820
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:57,106
And I mean, it's just, it's just, you know, it's a cost factor, obviously, to

821
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:01,780
to put a sprinkler system down there or whatever.

822
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,280
And then it's a maintenance factor.

823
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:08,443
And then, you know, a lot of times in the winter at the corners is where they pile the snow.

824
01:06:09,524 --> 01:06:14,107
And a lot of times that ends up being where the snow gets piled up.

825
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:19,130
But basically, I mean, we've been just trying to do the best we can to make it a little bit better.

826
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,692
We just repaired the fence on both sides about a month and a half ago.

827
01:06:23,252 --> 01:06:25,653
So that's about it.

828
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,735
That's really all I can add to it.

829
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:49,842
unless there was some type of, I know I have spoken with the DPW and they may be getting some kind of a tool that digs underneath sidewalks so that, you know, maybe there may be a sprinkler system option at some point, but I don't know any pricing information or whether the DPW could,

830
01:06:51,823 --> 01:06:58,690
even help us at this point, or whether they did obtain any of the equipment to do that stuff.

831
01:06:59,011 --> 01:07:11,544
Because we also met with Chad, because Chad, at one point out in his courtyard in the vocational side, they had sprinklers that I think they got destroyed by the science lab project when they were digging out there.

832
01:07:13,081 --> 01:07:22,724
So he, you know, he, and he mentioned it earlier too, as well, how he, you know, wanted to get higher to air plants that don't need as much watering.

833
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:25,045
Thank you.

834
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:26,706
Yeah, thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

835
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:30,207
And Dr. Cushing, I do have the pictures that John shared with me.

836
01:07:30,587 --> 01:07:32,368
Would I be able to do the screen share again?

837
01:07:32,388 --> 01:07:41,051
Okay.

838
01:07:43,163 --> 01:07:47,064
Okay, and so these are the pictures that Mr. McLaughlin sent to me.

839
01:07:47,384 --> 01:07:51,304
I think there's just the one here that I brought up right now.

840
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:52,725
That's one angle.

841
01:07:53,965 --> 01:07:55,585
Let me go here.

842
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,905
It looks absolutely beautiful.

843
01:07:58,025 --> 01:07:58,766
I couldn't believe it.

844
01:07:58,946 --> 01:08:00,106
Oh, we're gonna get to that.

845
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,746
Sorry, I'm ahead of myself.

846
01:08:02,386 --> 01:08:03,906
So that's one angle.

847
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:07,767
There's three just different angles, but it looks so beautiful.

848
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:08,687
I can't believe it.

849
01:08:09,327 --> 01:08:11,428
And let me just bring up another one.

850
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:12,568
Hold on one moment here.

851
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,627
Oh, here we go.

852
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:25,749
Okay, so this is one of the picture here.

853
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:27,010
This is all three of them together.

854
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,790
Okay, very good.

855
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,473
Okay, so what you can see is there was right here.

856
01:08:31,493 --> 01:08:43,041
I'm kind of like with my mouse showing you there was a broken fence and we reached out to the mayor's office and the city engineer's office and I believe the DPW was able to

857
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:48,874
help assist with that and get that section of the fence broken.

858
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:50,195
That was broken.

859
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:54,499
We did hire a McDonough fence to replace it.

860
01:08:54,559 --> 01:09:07,830
And Aggie actually, Aggie Tudin actually had the forestry come up and eliminate any of the trees that were potentially near it that could fall and damage it.

861
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,231
Thanks, Maggie.

862
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:15,543
Thank you, Aggie, I see you on the call here and I have to, I keep on doing this with the pictures.

863
01:09:15,563 --> 01:09:17,824
Wrong picture up again.

864
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:21,426
And thank you, Aggie, for everything that you did to help with this project.

865
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:24,287
I know we were emailing and Ms.

866
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:38,655
Montello, I don't know if she's on the call, but she was extremely helpful and she brought this to my attention and she said, there's a very nice, easy, quick way that we can beautify the front entrance corner would be by fixing that broken,

867
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:45,538
fence section and then just, you know, beautifying it a little bit with some, you know, like with the mulch or with some fresh plants.

868
01:09:45,878 --> 01:09:47,639
And it looks beautiful.

869
01:09:47,659 --> 01:09:49,940
I really think it looks absolutely beautiful.

870
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,961
When I saw the pictures today, I couldn't believe it.

871
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,361
I said, oh my gosh, it looks so nice.

872
01:09:55,382 --> 01:10:03,646
And then I was doing a little bit of Googling myself and, you know, because we have, you know, a lot of the same situations that we have at the high school at my house.

873
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,887
We don't have much irrigation.

874
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:05,947
So,

875
01:10:06,722 --> 01:10:21,626
You know, it looks nice and I think some low maintenance, natural looking flowers, you know, they look really nice and I'm hoping that we can keep it looking that nice where it's like the front entrance, everybody sees it and it's the first thing they see when they come to our school.

876
01:10:21,706 --> 01:10:25,607
So I'm so happy with all the work and all the help that we got on this.

877
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:28,008
Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin and Ms.

878
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:29,369
Agitudin, thank you so much.

879
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:30,709
I really appreciate all your help.

880
01:10:31,456 --> 01:10:35,299
If I may just add, Kathy, too, and I think Aggie can correct me.

881
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:43,106
As far as trees at Mefford High School, I think within the last year, we've planted around 16 trees.

882
01:10:43,446 --> 01:10:53,254
I want to say around 16 trees, brand new trees that working with Aggie, they've planted up there last year.

883
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:55,957
Yes, John.

884
01:10:57,705 --> 01:10:59,686
If I can jump in here, congratulations.

885
01:10:59,766 --> 01:11:01,027
It really does look great.

886
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:05,869
I went by the entrance today, and it's such a refreshed look and so welcoming.

887
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:11,092
Thankfully, the dead trees were removed, the fences fixed, and the plants look great.

888
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:13,773
There is one shrub on the right, a small rhododendron.

889
01:11:13,813 --> 01:11:14,973
I think that's gone, John.

890
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:19,956
I think that can just be taken out.

891
01:11:19,996 --> 01:11:22,377
I didn't want to put that one in the picture, but yeah, you're right.

892
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,038
We can replace that rhododendron.

893
01:11:24,638 --> 01:11:25,518
Yeah, yeah.

894
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:26,759
But the others are lovely.

895
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:35,519
And I will say, I believe we planted 18 trees at the high school in the last year and a half.

896
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,700
Last fall.

897
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:50,771
It also, for Arbor Day, which was last Friday in April, we planted five red maples along the island on the west side of the school, of the high school, and a Princeton elm at the front entrance.

898
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,121
So I checked on them.

899
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:55,763
They're doing well, miraculously, because we've had no rain.

900
01:11:55,803 --> 01:12:02,708
But John, if it's possible for people to get water into those gator bags on the trees, that would be very helpful.

901
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:11,014
But I'll ask DPW if they can include, if they sometimes send out the night watchman to water.

902
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:16,018
So if the watchman can come by and fill those gator bags, I'll see if that's happening.

903
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:17,118
Because that will really help.

904
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:20,761
And if they're there, maybe they can water the plants at the monument, the new plant.

905
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:22,987
Perfect.

906
01:12:23,747 --> 01:12:24,207
Okay.

907
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:25,168
Yeah.

908
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,148
Thank you so much.

909
01:12:26,168 --> 01:12:26,788
Thank you.

910
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:28,329
Great job, everyone.

911
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:29,129
Great job.

912
01:12:29,169 --> 01:12:29,609
Thank you.

913
01:12:29,989 --> 01:12:30,409
Teamwork.

914
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:31,349
Thank you.

915
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:32,390
Thank you.

916
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,070
Does anybody have any questions?

917
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,371
I just have a quick question for Aggie.

918
01:12:36,391 --> 01:12:46,153
Does the city plant many maples?

919
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:51,195
I feel like when I walk around, I never see maple trees in any of the newly planted trees.

920
01:12:51,395 --> 01:12:52,415
And I walk a lot.

921
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:55,847
Is there, do we just not plant maples for a reason?

922
01:12:56,007 --> 01:12:56,887
Do they get too big?

923
01:12:57,048 --> 01:12:57,748
What's the deal?

924
01:12:58,228 --> 01:12:59,769
Good question, Paul.

925
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:06,351
As a matter of fact, we plant, I think mostly, it could be the majority that we plant are red maples.

926
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:17,835
We plant, we go for diversification of species, which is the correct environmental way to do it.

927
01:13:18,616 --> 01:13:21,897
But I think we planted 24 varieties last year, which is great.

928
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:26,093
of trees, and we had about six different types of red maples.

929
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:31,216
And of course, we don't plant Norway maples, which are the invasives.

930
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:44,144
They're illegal to buy or sell in Massachusetts, and those are... But we do have lots and lots of red maples.

931
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:47,547
We don't plant them under wires, so... Okay.

932
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:51,289
That might be... Yeah, I'm in the hillside, and every...

933
01:13:51,753 --> 01:13:53,793
trees under a wire, even all the new trees.

934
01:13:54,714 --> 01:14:06,676
So maybe that's what it is that, you know, cause I was, I'm just walking around and I listened to an audio book about maple trees and I'm like, but I, and that's why I was observing all these trees that were planted in like the last decade.

935
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:11,217
And I'm like, I couldn't find a single maple tree to be, to be found, but I think it is the wires.

936
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:14,938
I'll have to send you a map so you can find them on your walk.

937
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:20,139
Generally we plant flowering ornamental trees under the wires.

938
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:25,237
because they don't get so big and we don't have the issues that arise when they get matured too big.

939
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:26,918
Thank you.

940
01:14:28,259 --> 01:14:29,340
Mr. Cushing, I saw your hand.

941
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,161
Go ahead, Mr. Cushing.

942
01:14:31,242 --> 01:14:40,670
You know, if in the future there are any sugar maples available, you know, the, you never know the CTE program might offer a horticulture program in the future.

943
01:14:42,008 --> 01:14:50,654
And that would offer, you know, one thing that students would be able to, you know, learn how to do the sugar mapling and things like that.

944
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:59,781
And, you know, I'm actually being serious as across the Commonwealth, there are many communities that there are many schools that are offering horticulture now as an option.

945
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:05,765
And so anything that could be native close to the high school might be a positive benefit.

946
01:15:06,025 --> 01:15:07,846
just something to possibly think of.

947
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:14,171
I know you can tap other maples other than just the sugar maples, but that is the more traditional.

948
01:15:15,172 --> 01:15:16,473
Peter, that's a sweet idea.

949
01:15:16,493 --> 01:15:24,239
Paulette, you're so with it.

950
01:15:24,379 --> 01:15:30,063
I'd like to have us have a horticultural program, but that's a topic for another meeting.

951
01:15:30,789 --> 01:15:32,490
Right, and avora culture too.

952
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,151
I always try to encourage young people to go into that.

953
01:15:35,491 --> 01:15:43,896
Anything in the forestry related fields is very exciting and especially for women, a great career for women.

954
01:15:45,036 --> 01:15:54,541
But yes, some of the trees that are the red maples that were newly planted on Arbor Day, two or three of those are a cross between a red maple and a sugar maple, so I'm sure they could be tapped.

955
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,090
Are there any more questions?

956
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:04,671
It's 6.17.

957
01:16:05,191 --> 01:16:05,912
Okay, thank you.

958
01:16:05,992 --> 01:16:06,792
Thank you so much, Ms.

959
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,112
Tootie.

960
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:10,834
I really appreciate you, I'm sorry, Aggie, for being on the call today.

961
01:16:10,894 --> 01:16:12,494
I really appreciate everything that you did.

962
01:16:12,554 --> 01:16:12,854
And Ms.

963
01:16:12,874 --> 01:16:13,955
McLaughlin, thank you so much.

964
01:16:14,155 --> 01:16:19,957
And so, yep, so we're gonna be moving on to agenda item number seven, Medford High School restrooms.

965
01:16:20,517 --> 01:16:27,140
So we spoke about this over several meetings and the mayor had made a,

966
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:36,824
resolution on the February meeting that she would like to have the high school bathroom project started.

967
01:16:37,544 --> 01:16:40,367
So I wanted to know, where are we with this project?

968
01:16:42,108 --> 01:16:52,097
And did the bathrooms go out for RFP, the ones that we voted on to get rehabilitated go out for RFP?

969
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,542
Harmon Zuckerman, PB – David Ensign, PB – Michael Leccese, PB – David Ensign

970
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:34,290
It's primarily been held up in my office based on the conversations that we've had with some of the folks at the city, but I do anticipate that an RFP will issue prior to the conclusion of the school year.

971
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:35,590
Okay.

972
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:44,632
Fiscal year is really more what I'm worried about than the school year, but I anticipate that will be, and the hope is that the work is completed over the next three months.

973
01:17:45,973 --> 01:17:46,433
Okay.

974
01:17:47,133 --> 01:17:47,633
Thank you.

975
01:17:47,653 --> 01:17:51,834
Because I do want to make sure that, you know, ideally it would be,

976
01:17:52,754 --> 01:17:57,695
ideal if we could have the work done over the summer while the students aren't in school.

977
01:17:58,275 --> 01:18:09,477
And I understand there's a lot going on and it's your first budget year and it's just, I can't believe how fast time's flying and it's already the end of the school year.

978
01:18:10,378 --> 01:18:20,460
So I really appreciate if we can get the RFP out as soon as possible so that we can get the work going over the summer months.

979
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,260
Absolutely.

980
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:22,400
We agree.

981
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:24,179
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

982
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,120
PB – Harmon Zuckerman.

983
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:25,700
PB – Harmon Zuckerman.

984
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,561
PB – Harmon Zuckerman.

985
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:45,253
Thank you.

986
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:46,074
Thank you, Mr Murphy.

987
01:18:46,094 --> 01:18:55,926
We're moving on to agenda number eight, the solar speed signs, and I think you already saw a sneak preview of this of the site, because I accidentally shared it, so I'll share it again.

988
01:18:56,507 --> 01:18:57,408
So hold on a minute.

989
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:01,233
And so Mr McLaughlin sent me the picture.

990
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:08,126
And the speed sign, it's installed, and I'm sharing the picture now.

991
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:16,075
That's directly in front of Methodist High School, right at the corner, just beyond the crosswalk.

992
01:19:16,496 --> 01:19:19,980
Now, there's also another one up in the back in the vocational school.

993
01:19:20,647 --> 01:19:30,258
behind where the cabinet shop is, and it's pointing up towards the back for people coming down from the field area.

994
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,144
The third one will be installed at the Andrews Joe.

995
01:19:35,783 --> 01:19:42,669
Joe has some time off that he was using, but we discussed that he knows exactly where he's gonna put it.

996
01:19:42,769 --> 01:19:51,356
So I'm anticipating at the Andrews in front of the Andrews coming from Riverside Ave will be installed shortly.

997
01:19:53,597 --> 01:19:55,359
Okay, thank you very much.

998
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:56,580
Does anybody have any questions?

999
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,041
And we have set the 10 miles an hour.

1000
01:19:59,442 --> 01:20:00,483
Excellent, thank you.

1001
01:20:00,903 --> 01:20:01,864
Set for 10 miles, okay.

1002
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,014
Does anybody have any questions for Mr. McLaughlin?

1003
01:20:08,274 --> 01:20:10,495
Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin, really appreciate the pictures.

1004
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:17,497
Okay, so we're moving on to agenda item number nine, the Medford High School hot water system.

1005
01:20:18,337 --> 01:20:21,258
So this item, we haven't discussed this item yet.

1006
01:20:22,019 --> 01:20:25,760
I did find it in the city of Medford's capital improvement plan on page 41.

1007
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:26,360
And, you know,

1008
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:41,453
I asked John McLaughlin if we could get some estimates, which he did get and he shared with us the estimate from Urban and Sons estimate for the hot water system is $171,644.

1009
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:50,137
And it's, you know, this is something that, you know, we will need to replace.

1010
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:53,578
There currently isn't any hot water in Memphis High School.

1011
01:20:53,998 --> 01:20:59,701
So we're gonna need to definitely replace this before the students return to the high school in September.

1012
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:02,749
So Mr. McLaughlin, I'll turn it over to you.

1013
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:05,750
If you could, you know, maybe just, you know, go over everything with us.

1014
01:21:06,371 --> 01:21:07,171
I would appreciate that.

1015
01:21:08,672 --> 01:21:08,932
Sure.

1016
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:19,299
So basically the heat exchanger inside a 50 year old hot water tank rotted out to the point where it's no longer useful.

1017
01:21:19,799 --> 01:21:27,303
So at this particular time, the back half of the building, the kitchen, the pool, the gym area doesn't have hot water.

1018
01:21:27,944 --> 01:21:28,284
So I,

1019
01:21:30,293 --> 01:21:35,135
our contractor, Irvin Plumman, I sent for them for a quote.

1020
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:53,144
And as I was sitting back and thinking, I thought of our friend, Alicia Hunt, down at City Hall, who gets grants and who looks for rebates and does all that happy stuff for us at the schools with our lighting and our Andrews School and projects.

1021
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:56,826
And she is actually on the meeting.

1022
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:58,346
I did have a, I did go,

1023
01:21:59,927 --> 01:22:03,409
with Josh from B2O yesterday.

1024
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:13,173
And he had a team of engineers that were scouting out the location and scouting out the high school for, you know, for the replacement.

1025
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:17,355
I think Alicia, you can jump in whenever you would like.

1026
01:22:17,835 --> 01:22:18,716
Yes, go ahead.

1027
01:22:19,196 --> 01:22:19,636
Thank you.

1028
01:22:20,276 --> 01:22:23,958
So it perhaps would be helpful to give some of you some background.

1029
01:22:24,598 --> 01:22:27,160
Other than Paulette, I think that

1030
01:22:29,254 --> 01:22:32,955
this some of the what's going on here predates most of everybody.

1031
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:44,738
So we actually had a whole building audit of all of our schools back in 2009 to look at what was there, what needed to be done, get estimates.

1032
01:22:45,078 --> 01:22:48,158
And it was actually B2Q that did those back then.

1033
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:55,980
And they're also the engineering firm that I've been working with on the solar and energy project at the Andrew School and at the DPW.

1034
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:59,001
We're contracting with them to do some HVAC

1035
01:22:59,581 --> 01:23:02,523
management at the police station in the library for now.

1036
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:12,670
So I actually said to Josh, you know, you know this building or you have, can you take a look and see back in 2010, we got a green communities grants.

1037
01:23:13,492 --> 01:23:23,377
And what we got the money to do was to take our hot water systems, both of them off the steam system and put in high efficiency hot water systems.

1038
01:23:24,057 --> 01:23:25,298
And we hired engineers.

1039
01:23:25,658 --> 01:23:27,299
We had it designed.

1040
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:34,682
And most people aren't aware of this, but most of the building, the domestic hot water in all the bathrooms is on one system.

1041
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:44,749
And then the cafeteria and the locker rooms, including the pool area, are on a different hot water system in different parts of the building.

1042
01:23:45,269 --> 01:23:51,595
So we put the whole thing out to bid to become more energy efficient, high efficiency systems in 2010, 2011.

1043
01:23:51,655 --> 01:23:53,397
Because it was a big project, it took a while.

1044
01:23:57,492 --> 01:24:00,054
And it came back as much too expensive.

1045
01:24:00,094 --> 01:24:01,615
It was way more than our grant was.

1046
01:24:02,116 --> 01:24:05,218
So we put it back out and only did the front half of the building.

1047
01:24:05,778 --> 01:24:11,983
So all the bathrooms, so everybody should be rest assured that your kids going to the bathroom, washing hands, they have hot water.

1048
01:24:12,063 --> 01:24:14,024
It's a separate system in the front half.

1049
01:24:14,645 --> 01:24:18,127
By front half, I mean everything except the cafeterias and gyms.

1050
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,080
So that system's there.

1051
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:24,182
This system, we decided we just couldn't afford to do it.

1052
01:24:24,902 --> 01:24:34,706
And actually the back half has one part that does the locker rooms and the kitchen, and then the pool is actually a separate hot water heater.

1053
01:24:34,787 --> 01:24:39,649
So the pool's hot water is still working, but for example, the showers are not.

1054
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:46,992
Thankfully for COVID, you don't see that very often, people using the pool haven't been allowed to use the showers all year.

1055
01:24:47,965 --> 01:24:55,400
So it's not impacting our current use of the pool, it would under normal health condition health regulations.

1056
01:24:57,755 --> 01:25:01,498
So anyhow, I basically said to them, we need to do this.

1057
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:07,502
The system that's there is from 1969, the hot water exchanger or heat exchanger.

1058
01:25:08,022 --> 01:25:21,971
So the idea that you would just quick get a new one of the same thing and stick it in there is perhaps not even possible, let alone clearly would not necessarily make sense.

1059
01:25:22,892 --> 01:25:25,314
So there is plenty of space back in that area

1060
01:25:25,994 --> 01:25:35,128
There should be no problem to put a new hot water heater in there and just abandon in place the old giant tanks which are quite impressive looking.

1061
01:25:35,508 --> 01:25:40,175
That's actually what we did in the front boiler room where we have the front ones.

1062
01:25:42,615 --> 01:25:46,177
The piping and all is such that it shouldn't be too hard to do this.

1063
01:25:46,677 --> 01:25:50,979
However, we need to size hot water heaters for what we need.

1064
01:25:51,380 --> 01:26:00,704
If one was to just put in tanks of the same size as the 1969, we would be paying for massive overcapacity.

1065
01:26:01,885 --> 01:26:05,146
So we actually can't just say, we'll just put whatever that is in.

1066
01:26:05,506 --> 01:26:08,508
We want to just take a quick look at what is going on with the

1067
01:26:09,423 --> 01:26:11,685
The locker rooms, how many shower heads are there?

1068
01:26:11,725 --> 01:26:13,266
What do we legally have to support?

1069
01:26:13,286 --> 01:26:18,970
So I'm reaching out to the health department just to say like, what do you guys consider still active?

1070
01:26:19,831 --> 01:26:21,612
Cause it's a health department regulation.

1071
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:34,422
And the kitchen, in addition to the kitchen, we, as this is an aside, but hopefully everybody's seen, we got a grant to put in a commercial dishwasher in the cafeteria.

1072
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:39,086
So we have to take that into account, the amount of water and how hot the water will be for that.

1073
01:26:40,122 --> 01:26:46,606
So we need to look at that and what else the kitchen needs and then scale the hot water heaters appropriately.

1074
01:26:46,726 --> 01:26:53,590
So we're not paying for, you know, double, triple the size of what we actually need in that space.

1075
01:26:55,411 --> 01:27:03,396
We believe we can manage to not, though adding a bid process to this would add four to six weeks to the whole process.

1076
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:06,858
And we need this working for mid-August.

1077
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,751
So I've been speaking with Josh.

1078
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:16,555
They think they can get us a quote tonight for their services and then get it turned around pretty quickly.

1079
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:18,716
We spoke with procurement.

1080
01:27:18,756 --> 01:27:21,777
John had reached out to them about how fast can we get this done.

1081
01:27:21,797 --> 01:27:27,901
As long as the labor is under $50,000, we can go with three quotes.

1082
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:31,342
But like I said, we can't just say put in hot water heaters.

1083
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:34,284
We still need a detailed specification.

1084
01:27:34,905 --> 01:27:38,728
of exactly what they're installing in that location.

1085
01:27:39,228 --> 01:27:44,051
And then get three quotes on that and have them break out equipment and labor separately.

1086
01:27:44,711 --> 01:27:50,015
And that will be so that if the labor is under $50,000, we don't have to go out to bid on it.

1087
01:27:50,936 --> 01:27:53,057
We've talked about an emergency waiver.

1088
01:27:53,677 --> 01:27:59,081
And it might be possible, but in my past experience with emergency waivers,

1089
01:27:59,912 --> 01:28:04,333
and things like heating and hot water, you have to just replace like for like.

1090
01:28:04,973 --> 01:28:12,656
When we had an issue at a fire station six years ago, we couldn't upgrade and put in a better system with controls.

1091
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,236
They said you just have to put the bare minimum in.

1092
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:23,979
So we might have some difficulty here asking for an emergency waiver because we can't replace what's there with exactly the same thing.

1093
01:28:25,888 --> 01:28:28,229
So John reached out to me on this quickly.

1094
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:33,091
We've been trying to move very quickly on this, but I don't wanna lead you astray.

1095
01:28:33,111 --> 01:28:53,719
I think the $170,000 that it's gonna be at least that much, because I think that when we put it out to bid, my memory is that we had a $250,000 grant, and I remember thinking, oh my God, this came in at double what we have, and that's why we split it.

1096
01:28:54,604 --> 01:28:57,588
Um, so I'm hoping that we can keep it under $200,000.

1097
01:28:57,888 --> 01:29:07,339
Um, but we should be prepared that, that this could in fact be, and it's honestly, it's not, not, not a negotiable.

1098
01:29:07,379 --> 01:29:12,185
Like, can we just put it off because there's not water in the kitchen.

1099
01:29:12,205 --> 01:29:12,285
Yeah.

1100
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:14,888
Yeah.

1101
01:29:15,298 --> 01:29:16,159
Thank you so much.

1102
01:29:16,179 --> 01:29:27,367
And I agree, it's something that we have to act on and I'm ready to make a motion that we proceed with the replacement of the Memphis High School hot water system.

1103
01:29:27,888 --> 01:29:32,751
And we're gonna move this project over to our sub regular meeting for a full committee vote.

1104
01:29:33,932 --> 01:29:37,615
And just to be clear that that quote was just sort of an estimate.

1105
01:29:38,196 --> 01:29:41,238
So it could vary.

1106
01:29:42,053 --> 01:29:46,415
Um, and the other thing that I realized you had mentioned and I didn't touch was just grants.

1107
01:29:47,156 --> 01:29:53,519
Um, we definitely can get a little bit of money from national grid for rebates and incentives on this.

1108
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,340
Um, we'll try and maximize that.

1109
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,202
We have some good people over there that we work with on the money side.

1110
01:29:58,922 --> 01:30:06,807
Um, but I don't, it's not possible to get a grant in this timeframe for something like this, the grant process.

1111
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:10,829
So like it, it conceivably could qualify for a green communities grant.

1112
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:15,132
but that round opens in September and we wouldn't be notified till December.

1113
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:20,036
Like there are no grant opportunities that we could pull off in this timeframe.

1114
01:30:20,936 --> 01:30:23,658
And we're only eligible for $100,000 this year.

1115
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:26,740
So it's, I just wanted to be clear.

1116
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:29,382
Like, I don't think there's a way we could get a regular grant.

1117
01:30:29,402 --> 01:30:30,602
We can get some national grid help.

1118
01:30:33,044 --> 01:30:33,804
Thank you so much.

1119
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:37,106
Do any of my committee members have any questions for Ms.

1120
01:30:37,747 --> 01:30:39,328
Alicia Hunt or Mr. McLaughlin?

1121
01:30:40,233 --> 01:30:43,074
No, what do we need now to proceed on this?

1122
01:30:43,114 --> 01:30:46,455
What's our next step?

1123
01:30:46,615 --> 01:30:50,957
So I made a motion that we proceed with the replacement of the hot water system.

1124
01:30:51,357 --> 01:30:59,800
So what we do need to do is we need to vote on this in subcommittee so that the full committee can vote on it at our next regular meeting.

1125
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:00,600
Okay.

1126
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:08,403
So that they can, you know, so they need our full committee vote to go ahead with the marching orders to replace the hot water system.

1127
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:12,818
And it is, you know, as Miss Alicia said, it's an emergency.

1128
01:31:12,898 --> 01:31:16,399
We have to have it replaced by August, mid-August.

1129
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:18,660
So we have to, you know.

1130
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,380
So I second your motion.

1131
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:21,660
Thank you.

1132
01:31:22,221 --> 01:31:24,641
And so, yes, go ahead, Mr. Ruscio.

1133
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:27,322
I mean, I don't really.

1134
01:31:28,142 --> 01:31:31,324
Now, if anybody here knows the answer, do we really even have to be involved or vote?

1135
01:31:31,384 --> 01:31:34,185
I mean, honestly, they can't do a thing until June 7th.

1136
01:31:34,365 --> 01:31:38,147
That's every day counts as far as I'm hearing.

1137
01:31:38,668 --> 01:31:50,394
So what, what I'm hoping is that the quote for the engineers to get everything, the specifications and everything done will be, I'm hoping it'll be under 10,000.

1138
01:31:50,474 --> 01:31:51,255
I know it'll be under 20.

1139
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:53,756
So I'm hoping it'll be much closer to 10 and I,

1140
01:31:56,278 --> 01:31:57,178
John and I have talked.

1141
01:31:57,218 --> 01:32:08,701
I'm not sure if his budget has that to just take care of it, whether we could get permission as it could be considered an energy project to do it out of my budget this late in the year.

1142
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:12,501
I have it left because I was under a funding freeze.

1143
01:32:12,942 --> 01:32:16,322
And so I haven't been allowed to spend a lot of my budget this year.

1144
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:22,324
So that would just to get us to the place where we can have a quote.

1145
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:24,084
So I think that

1146
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:33,942
I'm hoping that there's the discretion for John and I to go ahead and hire an engineer and get specifications together.

1147
01:32:34,322 --> 01:32:45,045
So possibly by the time, we won't have a quote for June 7th, but by the time we're ready to get quotes, you will have voted and said, go ahead and get the quotes.

1148
01:32:46,286 --> 01:32:50,507
Right, but my concern is we have two meetings left.

1149
01:32:52,203 --> 01:33:03,571
I'd like us, not you, but I'd like us to, I don't know if it's our attorney or the finance people or whoever it is, make a decision as to whether we really have to be involved with voting on this.

1150
01:33:03,631 --> 01:33:10,635
I know we just do it as a matter of course, but you know, if the RFP goes on June 15th and it comes back on June 23rd and we are

1151
01:33:15,151 --> 01:33:22,315
actually have to vote, well, then we all need to be told ahead of time we're going to have an emergency meeting so we can be prepared.

1152
01:33:22,335 --> 01:33:28,119
None of us are like hiding away in Vermont next to a river, which I might hope to be doing.

1153
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:35,704
And if we are not involved, I'd like us to not be involved, to not clog the process up.

1154
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:44,715
You know, we don't get called that the electric bill this year must have been shockingly higher than a normal year with all the type of filters.

1155
01:33:44,776 --> 01:33:47,659
Nobody's we've not voted on that.

1156
01:33:50,172 --> 01:33:52,713
just don't want us to be involved if we don't have to be.

1157
01:33:53,193 --> 01:34:07,480
Nothing for you, Alicia, but if John or the superintendent can, you know, and that can be done all at once, but if he can get an answer whether we have to be involved, I'm fine with just voting this up and going up to our June 7th to agree to it.

1158
01:34:08,821 --> 01:34:13,323
But if it turns out we don't need to be involved, we shouldn't be involved.

1159
01:34:13,703 --> 01:34:17,325
Because we're all obviously in agreement, we're gonna replace it no matter what the number looks like.

1160
01:34:19,929 --> 01:34:28,754
Yes, and I think Mr. Murphy, I'm not sure if you're there, but I know that we don't need to vote to send it out for RFP.

1161
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:29,815
We don't need to do that.

1162
01:34:30,195 --> 01:34:39,160
But I believe that we do need to vote to approve the spending of this repair, replacement.

1163
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,640
but I could be wrong.

1164
01:34:40,761 --> 01:34:41,901
So, Mr. Murphy.

1165
01:34:42,221 --> 01:34:42,381
Ms.

1166
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:44,142
Kritz, I'm here.

1167
01:34:44,162 --> 01:34:45,683
Somebody just shut my camera off.

1168
01:34:45,743 --> 01:34:49,005
If they want to turn it back on, I'm happy to address that.

1169
01:34:49,445 --> 01:34:50,486
I apologize.

1170
01:34:50,586 --> 01:34:55,348
I'm attempting to... There I am, sorry.

1171
01:34:58,210 --> 01:34:59,830
Could you just repeat the last question?

1172
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:00,471
I apologize.

1173
01:35:01,968 --> 01:35:19,759
Yes, so do we, okay, do we need the full committee vote to go ahead with the replacement of the hot water system or can we vote it tonight and then the work can begin before the June 7th meeting as soon as the specifications are available with Ms.

1174
01:35:19,799 --> 01:35:20,599
Hunt's office?

1175
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:31,146
I think that the committee, this is sort of one of those areas in which if the committee does not want us to move forward, you should vote to tell us to not move forward.

1176
01:35:31,807 --> 01:35:45,290
And if you are comfortable with us moving forward, I think we can rely on the procurement laws as they're written, which are largely administrative in nature, to issue the RFP, eventually get a contract, get someone under contract, and then complete the work.

1177
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:50,351
If I think this is, in other words, like, we're going to have to spend money to do this.

1178
01:35:51,092 --> 01:36:01,114
Our financial position, as you've heard me report in the past, is such that we're anticipating a little, our surplus for the fiscal year being a little

1179
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:04,164
north of where I personally would prefer it to be.

1180
01:36:05,285 --> 01:36:09,327
So we're in a good position to fund this.

1181
01:36:09,727 --> 01:36:11,788
And I think that we have legal authority to do that.

1182
01:36:12,168 --> 01:36:20,832
I think the school committee has legal authority to veto it and tell us not to, which I've, based on the conversations I've heard both tonight and previously, there's no indication that that's the case.

1183
01:36:20,872 --> 01:36:22,153
So I think

1184
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:26,526
a vote of confidence and an endorsement in the things that we're going to do is always appreciated.

1185
01:36:26,927 --> 01:36:36,795
But I wouldn't see this as precedent that in a situation in which a repair of an emergency nature, and I'm not using that term in a statutory sense at the moment, has to get done.

1186
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:48,524
I don't think it's that the administration is responsible for coming back and asking the committee for it, provided that there is funding available and we're not taking money away from something else the committee has directed us to spend money on.

1187
01:36:48,564 --> 01:36:49,385
Does that make sense?

1188
01:36:50,986 --> 01:36:51,147
Yep.

1189
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,801
I want to be us tying you down.

1190
01:36:55,021 --> 01:36:56,221
This has to happen.

1191
01:36:57,862 --> 01:36:58,042
Yeah.

1192
01:36:58,302 --> 01:37:01,043
And we're talking just to be just so I'm I know we're spending money.

1193
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:02,984
I would say it's a good practice for me.

1194
01:37:03,104 --> 01:37:04,944
But this is the water heater we're talking about.

1195
01:37:05,865 --> 01:37:21,030
Yeah, I think for the water heater, the Curtis Tufts boiler, the generator and the bathrooms, I think you should assume that these those are fees are all going out the door prior to the conclusion of the fiscal year and that we will be tapping either the

1196
01:37:22,953 --> 01:37:31,580
the surplus funds or the capital improvement funds that are currently, you know, have already been appropriated to the district from the city council.

1197
01:37:31,881 --> 01:37:38,266
And I think in this case, at least in the hot water heater, most likely it would be the surplus funds that we would use.

1198
01:37:40,628 --> 01:37:41,008
Thank you.

1199
01:37:41,328 --> 01:37:42,009
All right, thank you.

1200
01:37:42,389 --> 01:37:42,770
Thank you.

1201
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,191
Are there any more questions for Mr. Murphy?

1202
01:37:46,347 --> 01:37:48,549
Okay, so we have the motion.

1203
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:51,171
We're just gonna share the vote at an upcoming meeting.

1204
01:37:51,191 --> 01:37:54,973
We don't need their approval, so we have the first and second.

1205
01:37:55,113 --> 01:38:03,800
I don't recall if we took the roll call vote on this, so please forgive me if I'm forgetting, but I know that I motioned it, Ms.

1206
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:04,840
Van de Kloot seconded.

1207
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:07,322
I'll just do the roll call vote.

1208
01:38:09,104 --> 01:38:09,264
Ms.

1209
01:38:09,284 --> 01:38:09,784
Van de Kloot?

1210
01:38:10,505 --> 01:38:10,745
Yes.

1211
01:38:11,745 --> 01:38:12,346
Mr. Russo?

1212
01:38:12,366 --> 01:38:12,526
Yes.

1213
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:14,720
And Ms.

1214
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,401
Kretz, yes.

1215
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:19,903
Okay, so the vote passes three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1216
01:38:20,523 --> 01:38:28,107
Okay, so next we are moving on to similar item, but the Curtis Tufts High School boiler.

1217
01:38:29,087 --> 01:38:39,892
So Mr. McLaughlin, if you wanted to just touch on this and it's not a full repair, it's replacing sectional replacements.

1218
01:38:39,932 --> 01:38:41,193
I think you explained it that

1219
01:38:42,138 --> 01:38:45,447
It's not the full replacement, just sectional replacements.

1220
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,870
So I'll let you take it over.

1221
01:38:49,203 --> 01:38:57,826
That is correct at this time, it's not a full boiler replacement we found so boilers are made up in sections that are attached together.

1222
01:38:58,447 --> 01:38:59,987
Each section is attached together.

1223
01:39:00,447 --> 01:39:08,951
So, we found a couple of them leaking we were able to get the parts and put them on hold this winter when nobody could get parts, we were able to get them.

1224
01:39:09,351 --> 01:39:11,632
We found them somewhere in Maine somewhere.

1225
01:39:12,232 --> 01:39:21,387
fire away, and we were able to get them, and then we put them on standby because we did a temporary fix, so that we didn't have to shut the heat off in the building, fix held.

1226
01:39:21,808 --> 01:39:25,293
So now someone's coming along, we'll be getting ready to do the fix.

1227
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:34,161
Well, I don't really know how much it's gonna cost, but I'll obviously ask our contractor how much it's gonna cost.

1228
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:51,805
But a lot of the items in it, and just kind of piggybacking on what Dave said, Murphy said, we bring these to you guys because we want you to know that there's a few issues that we need to solve the problems, you know what I mean?

1229
01:39:51,865 --> 01:39:52,525
So it's not,

1230
01:39:53,652 --> 01:39:56,173
a question of the vote for this and the vote for that.

1231
01:39:56,233 --> 01:40:07,417
But we do have the subcommittee meeting so that I can tell you guys what's been happening in our department and things that, you know, that we need to look out for and things that are coming down the pike.

1232
01:40:08,538 --> 01:40:20,923
Like, you know, I mean, even if you wanted to jump on it and I think Dave already said it, you know, all the RFPs are going to go for those three projects, churner stuffs, the generator, you know, and then I was just letting you know,

1233
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:27,868
on the back end that the pool roof, you know, we had a, we had a temporary repair down on the pool roof.

1234
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:37,496
I had them come up, I had them come in and have a look at it and give me a price on the replacement of the roof, which will have to be replaced.

1235
01:40:37,956 --> 01:40:41,700
It has a temporary hurricane bar on it right now at some point.

1236
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,362
And unfortunately, the price was a lot of money.

1237
01:40:48,345 --> 01:40:50,027
to replace that section of the roof.

1238
01:40:50,507 --> 01:40:55,893
Now, we have a temporary hurricane wire on the roof, and you just said the number can be.

1239
01:40:56,053 --> 01:40:57,114
Oh, I'm sorry.

1240
01:40:57,835 --> 01:41:02,700
It was 625,000 I think was the quote, something like that, in that vicinity.

1241
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:09,326
So, so we have the number we have a temporary fix on it now.

1242
01:41:10,493 --> 01:41:17,280
It's just the informational that, you know, it's coming down the pike who knows maybe there's an MSBA grant.

1243
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:25,788
I mean we were going to try to get an MSBA grant to replace the high school roof but our roof wasn't old enough, but maybe there's something out there that can help us.

1244
01:41:26,268 --> 01:41:28,951
If not, like I said we do have a temporary fix.

1245
01:41:29,311 --> 01:41:33,255
I don't believe it's leaking in the pool at this particular point in time.

1246
01:41:34,395 --> 01:41:49,520
I know that the underlayment, the deck did get wet because of the nature of the problem up on the roof, but it's just, you know, it's one of those things that certainly, does it have to be addressed today?

1247
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,501
I don't know, but does it have to be addressed?

1248
01:41:51,921 --> 01:41:52,221
Yes.

1249
01:41:53,781 --> 01:41:54,161
Thank you.

1250
01:41:57,222 --> 01:41:57,742
Thank you.

1251
01:41:57,902 --> 01:42:02,184
So for the, so, you know, I mean, I'm just gonna,

1252
01:42:03,094 --> 01:42:15,440
process we've been following is like I motion to go ahead with the sectional replacements that you need to put in for the Curtis Tufts hot water heater.

1253
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:19,702
For the same reason- We already purchased a sectional.

1254
01:42:20,122 --> 01:42:22,463
So we're just gonna have to pay the labor to have them installed.

1255
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:27,085
So I don't know if it's gonna be that much.

1256
01:42:27,205 --> 01:42:31,287
It might even be an operational budget expense, truthfully.

1257
01:42:31,943 --> 01:42:32,343
Excellent.

1258
01:42:32,624 --> 01:42:39,449
Okay, so this was more of informational and so yes, you get to go ahead to to go ahead with the labor.

1259
01:42:40,049 --> 01:42:41,190
Obviously, we need to get that done.

1260
01:42:42,271 --> 01:42:44,893
Do we, you know, a motion to go ahead with the labor?

1261
01:42:44,913 --> 01:42:45,934
Is there a second?

1262
01:42:47,795 --> 01:42:48,155
Second.

1263
01:42:49,116 --> 01:42:50,757
Okay, so we'll do the roll call vote.

1264
01:42:50,817 --> 01:42:51,618
Mr. Russo?

1265
01:42:51,638 --> 01:42:52,739
Yes.

1266
01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:53,880
Ms.

1267
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:54,460
Van de Kloot?

1268
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:54,940
Yes.

1269
01:42:55,881 --> 01:42:56,221
And Ms.

1270
01:42:56,261 --> 01:42:56,542
Kretz?

1271
01:42:56,722 --> 01:42:56,902
Yes.

1272
01:42:58,203 --> 01:43:13,946
okay so the next item oh yes you're at 6 45 just for and we are mr mclaughlin already went over the high school roof which was informational information and we have just two items left i believe we're going to make it because

1273
01:43:14,827 --> 01:43:20,692
We already had a preview from Mr. Murphy and Mr. McLaughlin that the RFPs are going out for the generator.

1274
01:43:21,152 --> 01:43:30,079
I just wanted to just have the discussion with Mr. McLaughlin and the high school transformer, which he also, you know, gave us a preview at the pre-budget meeting.

1275
01:43:30,559 --> 01:43:31,700
So we've heard about that.

1276
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,363
So Mr. McLaughlin, you know, at our

1277
01:43:36,249 --> 01:44:02,045
last meeting and a couple meetings before that we've discussed the generator and that it's extremely important it's not operational we've got the estimates it has to be replaced if we lose power there would be no heat electricity etc etc so we all agree that you know we want to go ahead with this project and i don't think we need to have further discussion on this because we've already had discussions over the in this school year

1278
01:44:02,745 --> 01:44:05,947
every subcommittee meeting I've been on with the building and ground.

1279
01:44:06,027 --> 01:44:16,934
So at this time, I just motion that we proceed with replacing Memphis High School emergency generator, which we know is already going off RFP at the end of this fiscal year, I think Mr. Murphy said.

1280
01:44:17,314 --> 01:44:18,575
So is there a second?

1281
01:44:18,995 --> 01:44:19,395
Second.

1282
01:44:20,636 --> 01:44:21,857
Okay, roll call vote.

1283
01:44:21,917 --> 01:44:22,657
We have Ms.

1284
01:44:22,677 --> 01:44:23,218
Caruso.

1285
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:24,178
Yes.

1286
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:25,519
Ms.

1287
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:26,079
Vandekloot.

1288
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:26,620
Yes.

1289
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:27,738
And Ms.

1290
01:44:27,778 --> 01:44:28,418
Critts, yes.

1291
01:44:28,938 --> 01:44:31,459
So we have three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1292
01:44:32,179 --> 01:44:40,281
And we have our final item, which is the Medford High School transformer, which we did hear a preview about this at the pre-budget meeting.

1293
01:44:40,901 --> 01:44:44,542
And the estimate on, this is on a repair, is $19,027.

1294
01:44:44,582 --> 01:44:46,322
And it's, the transformer is out and

1295
01:44:55,002 --> 01:44:57,969
And John, could you just touch on that?

1296
01:44:58,089 --> 01:45:03,782
I know that it's out and it needs to be repaired, but I don't quite really know what a transformer does.

1297
01:45:03,822 --> 01:45:04,764
Could you just share that?

1298
01:45:06,424 --> 01:45:07,104
I'd be happy to.

1299
01:45:07,204 --> 01:45:09,004
So the transformer is working.

1300
01:45:09,925 --> 01:45:10,825
It is working.

1301
01:45:10,965 --> 01:45:18,586
It surfaces one third of Mefford High School, which would be the main electrical junction comes in and it goes into the transformer.

1302
01:45:18,626 --> 01:45:29,148
The transformer distributes the power to the breakers and then it goes out and it obviously does one third of the building electrical system.

1303
01:45:29,648 --> 01:45:30,348
It is working.

1304
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:32,209
It is operational, has a leak.

1305
01:45:32,669 --> 01:45:33,509
There's an oil leak.

1306
01:45:35,469 --> 01:45:41,034
that potentially years ago, they used to have PCBs in them, whatever.

1307
01:45:41,094 --> 01:45:42,656
So PCBs were dangerous.

1308
01:45:43,076 --> 01:45:51,704
So a long time ago, we had the PCBs taken out, and then they put in another oil that may have over time loosen the seals.

1309
01:45:52,405 --> 01:45:56,429
So what had happened when we did the, I had an audit

1310
01:45:56,876 --> 01:46:03,318
insurance audit, we have them every year, they had suggested that we test the oil in the system.

1311
01:46:03,738 --> 01:46:10,719
So what happened was is I waited for them, they sent me a test kit to test the oil to make sure that was okay.

1312
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:19,881
The electrician at that time, he went and he looked at me, thought that the oil was a little bit low and he didn't wanna test it with the oil that low.

1313
01:46:20,362 --> 01:46:26,203
So then I talked to my electrical contractor who turned us on to this particular high power.

1314
01:46:27,823 --> 01:46:32,664
that would come in and do the service and get the generator going.

1315
01:46:32,764 --> 01:46:47,288
I just want to, I just have to make sure, honestly, I just have to make sure that the 20,000 meets procurement specs, that I can actually hire somebody and bring them in for 20, or do I have to bring it, put three quotes out there?

1316
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:50,048
There's a possibility I might have to put three quotes out there.

1317
01:46:51,329 --> 01:46:52,649
It's definitely on the radar.

1318
01:46:53,329 --> 01:46:54,970
And it's definitely going to have to get done.

1319
01:46:55,350 --> 01:47:05,417
And we're definitely going to, you know, it's definitely going to be just so that you can get a little bit of an idea.

1320
01:47:05,437 --> 01:47:13,942
And I think, you know, but a little bit of an idea of what goes on in the life of buildings and grounds and in the areas that we touch.

1321
01:47:14,422 --> 01:47:18,945
But it's certainly something that, you know, we're going to have to take care of it no matter what.

1322
01:47:21,455 --> 01:47:22,335
Thank you very much.

1323
01:47:22,736 --> 01:47:24,957
Are there any questions for Mr. McLaughlin on this?

1324
01:47:25,157 --> 01:47:25,617
Thank you.

1325
01:47:26,678 --> 01:47:38,864
So I, you know, just following with the process I've been doing, I recommend and I motion that we go ahead with giving John McLaughlin, Mr. McLaughlin, the okay to repair the transformer.

1326
01:47:38,884 --> 01:47:40,044
Second.

1327
01:47:40,064 --> 01:47:43,106
Okay, and I'm going to do roll call vote.

1328
01:47:43,906 --> 01:47:44,627
Mr. Russo?

1329
01:47:44,647 --> 01:47:45,707
Yes.

1330
01:47:46,628 --> 01:47:46,928
Ms.

1331
01:47:47,368 --> 01:47:47,848
Van de Groot?

1332
01:47:48,189 --> 01:47:48,449
Yes.

1333
01:47:49,089 --> 01:47:49,469
And Ms.

1334
01:47:49,489 --> 01:47:50,590
McLaughlin, I'm sorry,

1335
01:47:51,803 --> 01:47:52,664
I don't know why I said that.

1336
01:47:52,844 --> 01:47:53,885
Yes, yes.

1337
01:47:58,208 --> 01:48:01,650
Okay, so three in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

1338
01:48:02,511 --> 01:48:03,932
I'm just gonna, I checked my emails.

1339
01:48:04,092 --> 01:48:06,154
I don't have any emails from anybody.

1340
01:48:06,254 --> 01:48:09,957
I did get the email from Mr. Fallon and shared the presentation with, I'll share with everybody.

1341
01:48:10,397 --> 01:48:16,021
And just wanted to note that all the estimates, all the presentations are in the folder that Susie created.

1342
01:48:16,061 --> 01:48:17,082
Thank you so much, Susie.

1343
01:48:17,122 --> 01:48:18,443
You were extremely helpful.

1344
01:48:18,963 --> 01:48:21,025
I had so many attachments and,

1345
01:48:21,952 --> 01:48:24,937
And pictures and everything was included.

1346
01:48:25,298 --> 01:48:27,561
And that's it.

1347
01:48:27,982 --> 01:48:31,768
If there aren't any further questions, I motion to adjourn.

1348
01:48:32,349 --> 01:48:34,893
Second.

1349
01:48:35,434 --> 01:48:36,195
Roll call vote.

1350
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,497
Mr. Russo?

1351
01:48:38,058 --> 01:48:38,338
Yes.

1352
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:39,400
Ms.

1353
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:39,821
Vanderkloof?

1354
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:40,442
Yes.

1355
01:48:41,643 --> 01:48:42,004
And Ms.

1356
01:48:42,044 --> 01:48:42,324
Kretz?

1357
01:48:43,026 --> 01:48:43,246
Yes.

1358
01:48:44,067 --> 01:48:45,489
Okay, the meeting has ended.

1359
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:45,810
Thank you
