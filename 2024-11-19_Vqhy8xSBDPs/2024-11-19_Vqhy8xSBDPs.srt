[SPEAKER_05]: Two zero dash three five seven.

55
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:22,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council request that the city administration examine the benefits of offering an early retirement incentive program and report

56
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:28,471
[SPEAKER_05]: to the council, its findings, council and I. Mr. President, thank you very much.

57
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:34,135
[SPEAKER_07]: There's much uncertainty surrounding our financial situation in the city of Medford.

58
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:44,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the only certainty that we have is that times are bad right now and that we forecast the revenues that aren't meeting our expectations.

59
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:51,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we come into situations like this, there are many ways that we can address the financial crisis.

60
00:04:52,707 --> 00:05:06,772
[SPEAKER_07]: before us, and one of those ways is to offer early retirement incentives to employees that have been working in the City of Medford for an extended period of time, make a good deal of money, top staff.

61
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:16,339
[SPEAKER_07]: and that sometimes payâ€”sometimes contribute less into the pension fund based upon, you know, whenever they were hired.

62
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,584
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, this 5 percent contribution rate, 7 percent, 9 percent, 9 plus 2 percent.

63
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:30,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a way, Mr. President, of getting individuals off the rolls that were contributing at a lower rate.

64
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,863
[SPEAKER_07]: which will, in essence, provide us with a cost savings.

65
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:41,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the administration to the retirement board and report be issued back to the city council examining the feasibility of such.

66
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:43,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, councilor.

67
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice president Caraviello.

68
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I'm sorry, I thought you had your hand up.

69
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:50,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from the council?

70
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:52,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Second the motion, Mr. President.

71
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Any community participation on this?

72
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Clerk Hurtubise, any emails?

73
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this.

74
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:06,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So far, I have an email on one topic for tonight, and it's later in the evening.

75
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:07,416
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you.

76
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:13,661
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, on the motion of council all night, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

77
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

78
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears?

79
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:20,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

80
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello?

81
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:23,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

82
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:24,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

83
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

84
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

86
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell?

87
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

88
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

89
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:31,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

90
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,691
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco?

91
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

92
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,992
[SPEAKER_05]: 2-0-358 offered by Councilor Knight.

93
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request a report from the administration on the following items.

94
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:51,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, amount of private supplemental funds raised to date for the construction of the Medford Public Library.

95
00:06:52,206 --> 00:07:02,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, amount of the grant received from the state for the construction of the Medford Public Library and whether or not it is anticipated this award will be reduced.

96
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,196
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, to what amount?

97
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:09,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And number three, the total cost for the construction of the Medford Public Library.

98
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:16,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, anticipated necessary appropriation by the city council to fund the construction of the Medford Public Library.

99
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:18,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

100
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

101
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:30,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, as we look at the fiscal picture that's before CFO Fiscal Year 21, there are many uncertainties.

102
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We met with our consultant just a couple weeks ago.

103
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:36,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about our fixed costs, what they were, knowing what they are.

104
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,843
[SPEAKER_07]: We have made commitments in this community to capital projects and capital needs.

105
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:44,306
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those projects that's underway right now is the library.

106
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:47,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is going to have to be a

107
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:51,891
[SPEAKER_07]: appropriation made by the city to complete construction for this project.

108
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:56,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have also a commitment for construction of a new fire station.

109
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:06,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we look at these capital needs with the fiscal picture that's before us, Mr. President, I think it's important that we understand going forward what it is that we need to do.

110
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of our colleagues in government have been very vocal

111
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:15,749
[SPEAKER_07]: in their desires to borrow, spend, and tax their way out of this fiscal crisis.

112
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:19,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't necessarily think that that's the best practice, Mr. President.

113
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:27,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we start determining what road we have to take, I think we need to get all the information before so that we can make an informed decision.

114
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution moving forward.

115
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:38,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this information will provide helpful when we develop a budget capital plan.

116
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:40,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

117
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:44,947
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Caraviello.

118
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

119
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:48,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I can give you some insight.

120
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:58,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't give you the exact numbers on this, but I'm a member of the private foundation that's raising supplemental funds.

121
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:07,298
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going along at a pretty good clip raising funds, but unfortunately, this has kind of put a little bit of a halt

122
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:11,041
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, to what we've been able to raise at this particular moment.

123
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:17,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've raised a little bit over a million dollars so far that we have had commitments for our summer paid some months.

124
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:22,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I think the people who committed will continue to, uh, to commit.

125
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:33,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, and, uh, we have a private donation from, from, uh, the Bloomberg foundation, uh, which, which has been committed to, I'm not at liberty to say the number at this moment.

126
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think many people have heard the number.

127
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, we were hoping that, uh, we'd invite the Bloombergs into, into Medford, hopefully in September, October to make the official, uh, gift, uh, to us.

128
00:09:48,043 --> 00:10:03,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also hoping, uh, uh, Barry Sloan, who's, uh, uh, is going to maybe go back to them and maybe they'll have a change of heart, uh, and hopefully, uh, up the gift that they were going to give to a little higher number.

129
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So again,

130
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Question number two, the original grant was for $12 million.

131
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:18,514
[SPEAKER_02]: That grant for the $12 million was based on the original estimate of the library, which came in at around the $33 million mark.

132
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,715
[SPEAKER_02]: The library cost is now down to $27 and change, and you take away the $12.

133
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:53,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings it down but as the as the as council may lose you as as the number of the the price of library goes down so does the grants so If I understand the grant now is down to about ten five From the original twelve in and as we keep cutting and changing then the grant is going to go down.

134
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So As you cut yeah, you just sort of

135
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,340
[SPEAKER_02]: doing nothing because you're cutting the grant.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of makes no sense to do that.

137
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:14,930
[SPEAKER_02]: The total cost for the construction with the original grant is somewhere around 17 and change.

138
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:23,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping right now with the money raised and the gifts by the Bloomberg,

139
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:27,114
[SPEAKER_02]: The number is down to about 13-ish.

140
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:40,181
[SPEAKER_02]: We were hoping to get the number down into somewhere between the 10 to 12 area, which would be a steal for the city of Medford to get a library for $12 million or less.

141
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the original goal.

142
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:51,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, the fundraising has not stopped, but it's kind of at an impasse right now due to the situation here.

143
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:52,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said,

144
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:07,690
[SPEAKER_02]: If if the library would it would no money raised Right now that the numbers around 17 and change but is a with it with the gifts and capital Money raised it's right now.

145
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:17,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around the 13 ish area So again, hopefully the fundraiser will continue after this again fundraising, you know, it's a

146
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two or three-year commitment.

147
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:30,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even gone out to the community yet to start raising money from the citizens of Medford, though a few have donated.

148
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we're at.

149
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:40,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But the number right now would be, if we would had to stop right now, it'd be in around the $13 million area.

150
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:42,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take a few dollars.

151
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:45,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

152
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President.

153
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:52,116
[SPEAKER_02]: The administration can give you a more specific numbers, but those are guesstimate numbers.

154
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:53,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

155
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:55,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

156
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

157
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a clarification, Rick.

158
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:08,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Use the phrase cutting and changing as are there cuts and changes being made to the project or are you saying that that might uh, Yeah, I know the administration, uh at the building meeting.

159
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:26,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say they've made some changes on the brick and things uh, let's say uh, let's say as the price drops so does the grant I gotta say because the original price of the library was in the 33 million dollar area and it came in at 27 so let's say the the 12 and change dropped to 10 to 10 5

160
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might vary a little bit.

161
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I've reached out to Representative Donato.

162
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe in his leadership position, we can get the library foundation to adhere to the $12 million grant.

163
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we won't lose the money due to the cost of the project being less than anticipated.

164
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:50,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be a big plus.

165
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:52,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Rick.

166
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:53,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one other quick question.

167
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:58,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it cosmetic changes to reduce the price or are there substantive?

168
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from what I'm hearing right now, it's just like cosmetic changes.

169
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hope there aren't any substantive changes.

170
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:08,740
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so the building is still net zero and all that as far as you.

171
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

172
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:10,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it, thank you.

173
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:14,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Bears.

174
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello for the update.

175
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:17,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

176
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

177
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:29,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be appropriate at this point that we have a project update also here, and I appreciate the work Vice President Capiello has done on this.

178
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:40,297
[SPEAKER_06]: He was one of the leaders in moving this library forward and was the person that came out originally and alarmed the city that there was a potential grant out there some years ago.

179
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:45,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's why we're in the situation we are now moving forward on a state-of-the-art library.

180
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:59,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would ask, Mr. President, if we can have a separate meeting, maybe a committee of the whole, where we can have a project update on where we stand with construction and the private foundation, and if we are going to meet our goals.

181
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:01,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Mark.

182
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to add that as an amendment?

183
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:05,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

184
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, Mr. President.

185
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:09,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

186
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments from the council?

187
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Any community participation on this matter?

188
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Clerk Hertovich, have you received any emails?

189
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I have not.

190
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I've received no emails.

191
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:27,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Just on one topic for later tonight, and that participant may speak at the meeting.

192
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:28,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

193
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:36,350
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Marks, Clerk Hertovich, please call the roll.

194
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears?

195
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:42,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

196
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello?

197
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:45,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

198
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:46,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

199
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

200
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:49,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

201
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:50,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

202
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell?

203
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:52,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

204
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

205
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:55,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

206
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:56,736
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco?

207
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:57,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

208
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

209
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,319
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

210
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:03,684
[SPEAKER_05]: 20-359 offered by Councilor Knight.

211
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:14,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Director of Substance Abuse Prevention conduct an analysis on the trends relative to substance abuse during the government shutdown and report back to the Council the findings.

212
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:15,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

213
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

214
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:28,499
[SPEAKER_07]: In times like this, it's very odd because, you know, when crisis arises, people rely on government more.

215
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:37,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that our Office of Substance Abuse Prevention has done an excellent job over the years in addressing the concerns that we've had in this community.

216
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:47,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly think that we've made great strides in combating the opioid addiction in the city of Medford and other substance abuse problems that we've seen here.

217
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:54,700
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, Mr. President, with the government shutdown comes a change in our ability to deliver services at the same level.

218
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:56,228
[SPEAKER_07]: that we were delivering them before.

219
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:10,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just ask that the Office of Substance Abuse and Prevention report back to us what the current trends are, what they're seeing, so that we can be better informed and more aware of what approaches need to be taken to continue to be successful in combating opioid addiction in the city of Manhattan.

220
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:12,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

221
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments from the Council?

222
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, Mr. President.

223
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:21,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears.

224
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Any comments from the community?

225
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on that motion, clerk.

226
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, no emails.

227
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:33,893
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears, clerk, please call the roll.

228
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:35,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

229
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:36,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

230
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello.

231
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:37,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

232
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:38,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

233
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:39,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

234
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:40,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

235
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:41,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

236
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:42,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

237
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:43,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

238
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:44,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

239
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:45,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

240
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,059
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco.

241
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

242
00:17:49,340 --> 00:18:03,809
[SPEAKER_05]: 20-360 offered by Council and I, be it resolved that the city administration provide the Medford City Council with a copy of the emergency response plan preparing for an instance of or event where the coronavirus infects our essential personnel.

243
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:12,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Council and I. Yeah, Mr. President, I think as we learn more and more about the coronavirus, one of the things we've

244
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:20,339
[SPEAKER_07]: been able to really appreciate is the work that our first responders perform, our firefighters, our police officers, our DPW and the like.

245
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:30,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gets me thinking, Mr. President, what happens if, say, there's a coronavirus outbreak among all the members of B group in the fire department?

246
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:31,227
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens then?

247
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:36,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if one firehouse becomes infected and two or three groups in the same firehouse become infected?

248
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,931
[SPEAKER_07]: What's our emergency response plan?

249
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:47,996
[SPEAKER_07]: What steps are we taking to be sure that the community is going to be safe and that we're going to be able to deliver the high level of quality public safety services that we've been able to deliver in the past?

250
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:56,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So I offer this resolution, hoping to learn a little bit more about this, Mr. President, so that we operate to address any type of issue like this in the community.

251
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,942
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when we pick up the phone and we call 911, these are the people that we rely on.

252
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that it only makes sense that we show some concern.

253
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:12,694
[SPEAKER_07]: as to what's going on in their lives, and be sure that there are plans in place to protect them, number one, and number two, to be sure to deliver the same levels of protection to the citizenry here in the city.

254
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:14,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

255
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:15,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

256
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:17,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:21,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just like to propose a B paper to this, completely agree with Councilor Knight.

258
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, getting an update on what efforts have been made to provide all the PPE that our first responders need, and any other safety

259
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,779
[SPEAKER_09]: that we've been able to implement.

260
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Second that, Mr. President.

261
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:39,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

262
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

263
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:43,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, one second.

264
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the language on the... I've got it, yes.

265
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:47,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I got it.

266
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:52,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so on the motion of... Actually, Councilor Marks.

267
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:54,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:19:54,543 --> 00:20:06,406
[SPEAKER_06]: In line with this, which I support this resolution wholeheartedly, if we can get an update from our emergency preparedness office regarding what steps have been taken over the last three months, if any.

269
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks, is that an amendment or is it a request?

270
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:16,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, if the councilor doesn't mind, I'll add it to his request.

271
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:17,708
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, I'll do it as amendment.

272
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we add that to the original?

273
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll add that as an amendment to the original motion.

274
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that okay, Councilor Knight?

275
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:24,318
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

276
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:25,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have that language back, please?

277
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:26,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get it all down.

278
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:31,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That we receive an update from the emergency preparedness office.

279
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:33,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

280
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:42,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding what steps, as Councilor Knight mentioned, to safeguard our public safety officials and first responders.

281
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

282
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every year, Mr. President, if I could add,

283
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:58,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We fund the emergency preparedness office in the budget, and it's pitiful of the amount of money that we put in there.

284
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:07,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say maybe $1,500 for a city this size, maybe $2,000, and I can't remember the exact number.

285
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:10,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really next to nothing.

286
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:20,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And in a time of need that we see now, it really makes you think, how are we prepared to handle issues that we confront as a community?

287
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:29,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think it's important maybe during the budget that we also revisit what's spent for emergency preparedness in our community as well.

288
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

289
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:34,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments from the council?

290
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Second the motion, Mr. President.

291
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments from the community or any emails, Clark-Hernandez?

292
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,302
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no emails, Mr. President.

293
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:45,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

294
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:50,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We will take the B paper first that was offered by Councilor Bears and seconded by Councilor Knight.

295
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:54,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to read the language back in the B paper, Clark-Hernandez?

296
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:06,450
[SPEAKER_11]: The B paper is to get an update on efforts made to date to provide PPE to first responders.

297
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:11,287
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, Clerk Kurtopis, please call the roll.

298
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:14,209

00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:18,393

[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco?

00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:25,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

312
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:28,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

313
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,324
[SPEAKER_05]: On the original paper that was offered by Councilor Knight, Clerk Kurtopis, did that have a second?

314
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:34,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I second it, Mr. President.

315
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:42,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Vice President Caraviello as amended by Councilor Marks.

316
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:42,914

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

319
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello.

320
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:47,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

321
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

322
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:49,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

323
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:50,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

324
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:51,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

325
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:52,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

326
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:53,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

329
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:56,410

330
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

331
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:04,761
[SPEAKER_05]: 2-0-361 offered by Vice President Caraviello.

332
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:15,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask the mayor to install clear plexiglass panels in all the chambers in an effort to safely separate council members.

333
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:20,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council is be administered COVID-19 testing.

334
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:26,182
[SPEAKER_05]: With the upcoming budget meetings approaching, council members meet on a frequent basis.

335
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:30,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It must feel comfortable working with each for extended periods of time.

336
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:32,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello.

337
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

338
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:41,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, we've been out of the chambers for a long time, and I know we're getting close to getting back there.

339
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:51,397
[SPEAKER_02]: But similar to like what the grocery stores have done and everything, they put up pussy class barriers in between everybody to keep

340
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:57,980
[SPEAKER_02]: When people are somewhat of a closer of a quarter, it keeps them separated from each other.

341
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:05,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a good step for a temporary measure until the situation passes.

342
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:16,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Further, I know many members of City Hall have been tested already, but I think that the council should be tested also, seeing that we're going to be working with each other.

343
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:21,100
[SPEAKER_02]: in close quarters for an extended period of time.

344
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to make sure that everyone is comfortable with everybody, knowing that we're all safe with each other.

345
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:35,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a suggestion and hopefully my other councils agree and we can get back in the city hall and start working.

346
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:40,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't just for the city council, it's for the school committee, it's for all the boards and commissions who meet.

347
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's time we get back into the people's chamber.

348
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

349
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:49,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Morell.

350
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:50,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

351
00:24:51,074 --> 00:25:00,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate my colleagues focus on safety, but I'm just a little lost as to when we decided or how it was decided that we would be back in the chambers for this type of stuff.

352
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:03,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I do understand the frustration with these types of meetings.

353
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:10,101
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain amount that gets lost in them, but I think this, what we're doing right now is the temporary measure.

354
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We think there is a challenge with testing.

355
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:14,083
[SPEAKER_01]: We can test the city council and then we go and

356
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,095
[SPEAKER_01]: around our spouses who might be going to work or going to places.

357
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And that test doesn't matter if we're exposed in the next day.

358
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:28,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've been paying attention to the news, the things that matter as far as contracting this is space and time.

359
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:34,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're together for hours and we're in places where workers have to be because they can't work from home, I think it's just a risk.

360
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:41,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I appreciate the idea behind this, but I feel like I'm a little lost as to where

361
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:45,389
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone going back to City Hall has been decided upon at this point.

362
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,910
[SPEAKER_02]: For your information, Mr. President.

363
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,672
[SPEAKER_02]: For your information, Councilor Cavillo.

364
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:58,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think earlier this evening, I think it was the mayor says they're coming up with a plan for us to get back, open up City Hall and for us to get back in there.

365
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:02,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's coming hopefully very soon.

366
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:09,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not, I don't think we're going to be out of there another month or two months, but it is getting close to it happening.

367
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:19,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell, no decision has formally been made for us to go back into Alden Chambers to conduct business yet.

368
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:25,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's been numerous agenda items on the agenda to talk about this.

369
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:31,200
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been different, I know during our meetings, I know a lot of Councilors would like to get back to City Hall.

370
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: But no formal decision has been made to actually have our meetings back there yet.

371
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:42,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the big thing was just to hear what Governor Baker had to say yesterday and then try to move forward from there.

372
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:47,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's to give you a little bit more of an explanation, I guess.

373
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:47,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

374
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:48,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

375
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:49,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

376
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears and then Councilor Knight.

377
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:53,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

378
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:54,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just quickly.

379
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, definitely appreciate the focus on safety and and I think it'd be great to get back when possible.

380
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:11,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Um On the plexiglass My understanding of how this works from the epidemiologist is that that helps you if you're in a short A short period of time and interaction.

381
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:22,055
[SPEAKER_09]: So like a grocery store We're only looking at someone for a minute or two You know if we're sitting there for hours the plexi our breath will eventually go over and around the plexiglass So I don't I don't know if that's um

382
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:24,890
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the right way to do it.

383
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to propose a B paper.

384
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:30,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Give the clerk a second.

385
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:34,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Ready?

386
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,663
[SPEAKER_09]: A B paper that it sounds like the city administration is putting together a plan.

387
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:50,792
[SPEAKER_09]: So as part of that, I'd love for us to see the council, essentially this, that the city administration include information on what surrounding communities are doing.

388
00:27:51,568 --> 00:28:00,374
[SPEAKER_09]: with in terms of public meetings, and also any guidance from Governor Baker on public meetings in person.

389
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:06,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

390
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:15,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments regarding this resolution from the councilors?

391
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:17,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

392
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:25,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I've made my frustrations with this virtual governing well-known Mr. President.

393
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:34,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we've passed resolutions in the past calling for budget debates to be held in a non-virtual setting.

394
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you gotten any update from them?

395
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:40,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not.

396
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:41,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not.

397
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:47,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I will reach out to them tomorrow to see if we have an update, but I have not received anything as of yet.

398
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:57,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And once I do find out, or if I get any type of an update, I will make sure that the council knows as soon as possible.

399
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:07,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that, you know, looking at what we do has to be a part of the phased rollout that the governor proposed.

400
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:14,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that we'd be able to meet prior to June 1st anyway, based upon the criteria that he's put forward.

401
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:15,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I sure wish we could.

402
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I definitely support councilor Caraviello's

403
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:26,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is a good measure to come up with some sort of outside-the-box solution to allow us to resume businesses normally as possible.

404
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:30,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilmember Knight.

405
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,939
[SPEAKER_05]: He was raising his hand a minute ago.

406
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a quick question for Councilmember Bears.

407
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a B paper or regular amendment?

408
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you said B paper but it could also be part of the

409
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:53,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions regarding the resolution, the B paper or the main resolution?

410
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments from the community?

411
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Clerk Hurtubise, have you received any emails?

412
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:00,901
[SPEAKER_05]: No emails.

447
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:01,943

[SPEAKER_05]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

452
00:31:09,195 --> 00:31:21,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, 20-364 offered by Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council then can congratulate Nancy White, Representative Paltinato on the years of service, chairing the Medford Democratic City Committee.

453
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:23,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

454
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:26,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell.

455
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Councilor Morell, I apologize.

456
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:30,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President and Councilor Bears.

457
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:37,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to put this out to thank Paul and Nancy for their many years of service to the interested residents of Medford.

458
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:41,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obviously a big fan of civic engagement, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.

459
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:45,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a laudable cause to volunteer your time in this way.

460
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:52,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to put it out there to thank and congratulate them on their many years of service to the residents of Medford that are interested.

461
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:57,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure I will have much more appreciation for their dedication in the coming months.

462
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

463
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:01,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears?

464
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. President.

465
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:06,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I completely second what Councilor Morell said.

466
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:13,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a part of the ward and city committee for almost four years now, and Nancy and Paula have done a ton of work to bring us together.

467
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:22,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also second Councilor Morell's statement that, you know, whatever committee of any partisanship, if there was a transition like this, we'd be congratulating them.

468
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:26,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So just want to thank Paul and Nancy for their years of service.

469
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

470
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

471
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:39,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to have had the privilege and pleasure of working with both Nancy White and Representative Donato.

472
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:48,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I can't tell you the amount of dedication and commitment they put forth to the democratic body in the city of Medford, but also in the community.

473
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:51,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you look at the work that they've done, it's really commendable.

474
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:54,283
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you look at Representative Donato and the

475
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,083
[SPEAKER_07]: amount of service that he's provided to the city.

476
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:01,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Years and years of service, always delivering, year in and year out, bringing home the bacon, Mr. President.

477
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:10,009
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, making sure that our local aid numbers are hitting the spot, making sure that we're able to provide certain infrastructure improvements in our community.

478
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:15,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Representative Donato has done an excellent job up on Beacon Health, and I'm really looking forward to supporting him again this year.

479
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:22,214
[SPEAKER_07]: When we look at Nancy White and the work that she's done in organizing the community and making sure that people stay active and involved,

480
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:28,967
[SPEAKER_07]: and want to be a part of the democratic process here in the community, fighting for the shared values that we all can agree upon.

481
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,327
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really commendable.

482
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:41,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of them are excellent, excellent resources, and I hope that they remain involved, remain active, because we certainly need them to be participants in our government, especially during these trying times.

483
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:47,337
[SPEAKER_07]: They bring years of experience and a wealth of knowledge, Mr. President, and these are people we need to keep in government.

484
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:51,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I thank them both for their service, and I thank the sponsors of this resolution.

485
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:53,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

486
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Councilor Marks.

487
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:58,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:03,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And I too want to thank Representative Donato and Nancy White.

489
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:12,542
[SPEAKER_06]: As a former ward chair of Ward 7, I appreciated all the work that they put in over the many years, Mr. President.

490
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:19,905
[SPEAKER_06]: When the times were tough in the Democratic Party, they kept the Democratic Party going.

491
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: and for many years.

492
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank them for their efforts over the years as the outgoing co-chairs, and I'd like to thank our own Councilor Morell and Henry Millerin as the incoming new Democratic Water and City Committee chairs.

493
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:45,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank them for their interest, and hopefully we can get the party back on its feet again, Mr. President.

494
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

495
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:49,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello.

496
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:51,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

497
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:58,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I want to reiterate the words of my fellow Councilors to Representative Donato and Nancy White.

498
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:07,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they put in countless hours of a thankless job that, you know, over the years, no one ever wanted to volunteer for.

499
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I want to thank them just for the

500
00:35:10,638 --> 00:35:17,389
[SPEAKER_02]: their years of work, and I want to thank Councilor Morell for stepping up and filling one of those positions.

501
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:22,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So good luck to her going forward, and thank you for the other two for their years of service.

502
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

503
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:26,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

504
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:28,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

505
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:49,098
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, just to reiterate what my colleagues have said, you're talking about two great people, pillars of our community that have made sure that the political word was spread throughout the community and that we were represented properly here in Medford.

506
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,239
[SPEAKER_10]: And we thank them very much for all their hard work.

507
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I echo

508
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Council night sentiments.

509
00:35:55,481 --> 00:36:07,247
[SPEAKER_10]: It's uh, it's a sense of relief knowing that um, you know, um representative Donato's Statehouse working for us and and you see his work every single day.

510
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:09,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank them both for a job well done

511
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:11,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

512
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:23,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I may echo the sentiments of my colleagues as well, Representative Paul Donato and Nancy White have given many years of service to the city in this capacity.

513
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We thank them for their time and their effort, their energy, and we wish them well.

514
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:30,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've given a ton of time and effort to this cause, and we say thank you.

515
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

516
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:37,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, are there any comments from the community?

517
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:38,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody want to speak?

518
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:38,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

519
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:39,647
[SPEAKER_05]: One minute, please.

520
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I would speak, Adam.

521
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:44,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

522
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul, if you could please have your name and address for the record.

523
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street in Medford.

524
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

525
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:56,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this when I should speak now?

526
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:57,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

527
00:36:58,189 --> 00:36:58,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

528
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:03,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the opportunity to express my concern about Ms.

529
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:08,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Morell and her election to the Democratic Party as co-chair in Medford.

530
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:15,803
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different parties and backgrounds, and I believe people want Medford to be Medford and not Somerville.

531
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:28,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Many in Medford own their own homes and condos, but in Somerville, approximately only 17% are able to because of the extreme level of taxes.

532
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:37,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Further, the open border policies of the Democratic Party bring people in tremendous needs, bring people in,

533
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:45,016
[SPEAKER_04]: with tremendous needs, which we must pay because sanctuary cities are costly to manage.

534
00:37:49,177 --> 00:38:04,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially important today, as we see how dependent we are on China for all our... We know taxation and regulation of entire industries by the Democratic Party must stop.

535
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,587
[SPEAKER_04]: People need more than minimum wage jobs.

536
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, policies of the Democratic Party need to be watched, challenged, and kept in control.

537
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Medford needs to be Medford.

538
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening, and I hope you will all stay well.

539
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:26,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

540
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:26,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul.

541
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:28,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions for the community?

542
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing and hearing none, oh, Councilor Knight?

543
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:44,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, as one member of this body, Mr. President also as, um, uh, registered Democrat here in the city of Medford, um, do not share the same concerns that Ms.

544
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:45,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul does.

545
00:38:46,198 --> 00:39:00,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, especially when it comes to my colleague here on the council, um, you know, partisan politics are one thing, but, um, you know, to express concern over a Councilor of morale's abilities or qualifications to serve in that capacity, I don't think is appropriate.

546
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:04,209
[SPEAKER_07]: quite frankly, Mr. President, I think she's been a breath of fresh air on this council.

547
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:10,519
[SPEAKER_07]: She's someone that I certainly enjoy working with and she has an open mind and brings different viewpoints to the table.

548
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to say that she's a pleasure to work with and I really don't think that hooking

549
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,590
[SPEAKER_07]: at the presentation that Ms.

550
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul made.

551
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:24,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand, Joyce, you know what I mean, that you're a representative of the Republican Party.

552
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:31,821
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is here to congratulate a member of our body on an achievement in not making a personal attack.

553
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:35,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to stand beside my colleague and support her and congratulate her.

554
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:39,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Joyce, I certainly respect your opinion and understand where you're coming from.

555
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,329
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, in times like this when

556
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:43,535
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much going on in the world.

557
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:45,796
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to stand together and focus on the positives.

558
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, the shared values that we have.

559
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:54,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Councilor Morell comes to the board with an open mind, and she's someone that's going to be able to do just fine in that role.

560
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,658
[SPEAKER_07]: They have big shoes to fill, and I think that they'll be able to fill them.

561
00:39:59,118 --> 00:39:59,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

562
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:00,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree.

563
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:08,099
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears, seconded by?

564
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello, clerk, please call the roll.

566
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears?

567
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:16,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

568
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:17,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello?

569
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:18,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

570
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:19,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

571
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:20,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

572
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

573
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:22,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

574
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:23,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell?

575
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:23,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

576
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:25,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

577
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:25,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

578
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:26,787
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco?

579
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:27,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

580
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

581
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:36,392
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point I would ask if Vice President Caraviello could take the chair and read resolutions 20-362 and

582
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:39,314
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-0-3-6-3.

583
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:43,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

584
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:56,291
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-0-3-6-2, offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Henry Miller and City Councilor Nicole Morell on being selected, elected co-chairs of the Medford Democratic Ward and City Committee.

585
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:57,553
[SPEAKER_02]: President Falco.

586
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

587
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to congratulate our colleague, Consular Nicole Morel, on her new role.

588
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:09,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And Henry Malorin, a good friend of all of ours, and his new role as well.

589
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:13,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I am sure they're ready to work hard because it'll take a lot of hard work, but I know they're up to the task.

590
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have big shoes to fill, but I know that they will do well in this new role.

591
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:24,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations to Consular Morel and to Henry Malorin in their new role.

592
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:26,532
[SPEAKER_05]: and we wish them well.

593
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:27,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

594
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:28,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, Mr. President.

595
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:29,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bez.

596
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:30,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

597
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to second that.

598
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to save my praise of Councilor Morell for this, this part of the agenda.

599
00:41:37,317 --> 00:41:46,582
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it speaks when anyone in this community volunteers their time for civic engagement for a community group for an organization to make the city better.

600
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,103
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good for all of us.

601
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:52,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Councilor Morell is doing that here and so many other people we had

602
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:59,499
[SPEAKER_09]: over 30 people on our call last week, you know, a ton of people who are really committed to this city and this community.

603
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:02,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Councilor Morell is going to be great.

604
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And Henry, I mean, you don't have to say anything about Henry.

605
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:12,367
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know how wonderful Henry is, leader in his community, brings people together, brought together the forum for council candidates last year.

606
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:17,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we have two great leaders to fill the big shoes of Representative Donato and Nancy White.

607
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

608
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:20,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else like to speak?

609
00:42:24,723 --> 00:42:33,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could just put a word in, I want to thank Henry for stepping up and taking over the position that's sort of the changing of the garden.

610
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:39,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Henry works tirelessly, even before he was the chairman of the committee.

611
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:41,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank him for stepping up.

612
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thankless job.

613
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,179
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of hours go in.

614
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:56,564
[SPEAKER_02]: for that work, and again, I'm proud to sit beside Councilor Morell, and I'm sure she's more than up to the task of being the co-chair of the committee, like Councilor Knight says.

615
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:07,367
[SPEAKER_02]: She brings a lot to the table, and I'm more than confident she's able to do the job, and I congratulate both Henry and Councilor Morell on their selections.

616
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

617
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:17,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Council Bears?

618
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:18,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

619
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Alphabetically now President Falco?

620
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:22,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

621
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:24,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

622
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

623
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:29,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

624
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:29,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

625
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:30,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell?

626
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:31,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Abstain.

627
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:34,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

628
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:34,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

629
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello?

630
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:37,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

631
00:43:37,977 --> 00:43:40,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Six in the affirmative, one abstention, motion passes.

632
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:44,476
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-0-3-6-3 offered by President Falco.

633
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:53,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the DPW install crossing signals at the intersection of Central Avenue and Spring Street in the interest of public safety.

634
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,019
[SPEAKER_02]: President Falco.

635
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

636
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:04,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I received a call this week from a resident regarding the lights at the intersection of Spring Street and Central Avenue.

637
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:08,105
[SPEAKER_05]: and how there's no crossing signal at that light.

638
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:09,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a regular street light.

639
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:12,427
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a heavily traversed area.

640
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:22,874
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of traffic coming from the Fellows Way, going to the Fellows Way, just a lot of traffic going back and forth down Spring Street, Twins Haynes Square, and Riverside Avenue.

641
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:30,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the interest of public safety, I'm asking that the DPW install a crossing signal at that intersection.

642
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:31,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's long overdue.

643
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a very, very

644
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,881
[SPEAKER_05]: busy intersection.

645
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:42,023
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of, you know, kids in the community that do walk in, cross here, it's narrow park.

646
00:44:42,624 --> 00:44:44,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So that really needs to be addressed.

647
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:48,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that this be addressed in the matter of public safety.

648
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:49,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

649
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Councilor Cavillo.

650
00:44:51,782 --> 00:44:52,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

651
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:54,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

652
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:55,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

653
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, thanks, Council President, for bringing this forward.

654
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:06,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe as we wait, we might ask for the temporary raised crosswalks.

655
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:15,431
[SPEAKER_10]: that were further down central to be maybe placed in that area to slow that, make that a traffic calming measure immediately.

656
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:29,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if I can, Council President, follow up with a resolution I put in months ago with the crosswalk on Locust Street in front of Wegmans.

657
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:35,059
[SPEAKER_10]: We've asked for some sort of crossing mechanism for

658
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,521
[SPEAKER_10]: for the kids and people that cross over Locust Street from the rink side.

659
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:45,123
[SPEAKER_10]: There is nowhere to cross in front of the stores.

660
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:57,186
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we can even put some cones or the traffic slowing cones that people have a chance to cross, because it is a dangerous area.

661
00:45:57,226 --> 00:46:02,507
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't mind, as a B paper, if we can add that or just add it to your amendment, I'd appreciate that.

662
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, did you get that?

663
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I got most of Councilor Scarpelli's amendment.

664
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:22,288
[SPEAKER_11]: He's asking for temporary raised crosswalks that are further down on Central to be placed near this intersection for traffic calming measures.

665
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:27,210
[SPEAKER_11]: He's also seeking a crosswalk or calming measures on Locust Street, is that correct?

666
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct, in front of Wegmans.

667
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:33,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and do you want that as a B paper or as an amendment to the main paper?

668
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:36,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's make it a B paper, if that's okay with Councilor Falco.

669
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:38,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way.

670
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:39,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

671
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:42,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, do you have anybody with any comments?

672
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not.

673
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bez.

674
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:47,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

675
00:46:48,052 --> 00:47:01,499
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's fine with Councilor Scarpelli, I'm wondering if we could add to that B paper, any updates from the city administration, from the traffic engineer on Locust Street, what they're going to do with Locust Street, given that that apartment building is opening and it's a mess, so.

676
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,480
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's a good idea.

677
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Mr. Scott, did you get that?

678
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:08,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

679
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:13,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think I see Mr. Navarre, did you have your hand up?

680
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:17,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Navarre, did you have your hand up?

681
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:24,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I wound up typing my comment, but I can read it.

682
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:29,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I know last week council asked for an update on tough square, because it's not clear what's going on there.

683
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:35,974
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to say that might be good in particular if council made a point about the crosswalks there.

684
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:41,356
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete street project to make it safer for pedestrians.

685
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:45,578
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems the first step they did when they did the construction was grind out all the crosswalks.

686
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:54,594
[SPEAKER_00]: which I was walking the other day, and it seemed a little dangerous to me, and it wasn't clear where you're supposed to cross, and it's been like that for quite a while.

687
00:47:56,195 --> 00:47:57,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

688
00:47:57,656 --> 00:47:58,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments?

689
00:48:00,158 --> 00:48:06,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll on the B paper?

690
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, is there a second on the B paper?

691
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second.

692
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:11,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

693
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:11,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

694
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:13,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

695
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

696
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if we can add in that the crosswalks be reviewed at Tufts Square, which was just mentioned by Mr. Navarre.

697
00:48:25,244 --> 00:48:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, can you add that into the paper, please?

698
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:27,825
[SPEAKER_02]: On the B paper?

699
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:29,926
[SPEAKER_11]: You want all these amendments added to the B paper, correct?

700
00:48:30,146 --> 00:48:30,686
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

701
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:31,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

702
00:48:32,506 --> 00:48:33,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second on the B paper?

703
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:34,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang on, hang on.

704
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:36,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

705
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:36,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

706
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:38,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

707
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is on the B paper.

708
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:53,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mr. Clark.

709
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:56,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is offered by council bear second by Councilman on the B paper.

710
00:48:58,396 --> 00:48:59,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, I think.

711
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:01,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

712
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:04,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears also amended the B paper.

713
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:13,045
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Councilor Scarpelli's B paper as amended by Councilors Bears and Marks and then seconded by Councilor Knight.

714
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:13,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

715
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:15,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Bears.

716
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:16,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

717
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:18,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

718
00:49:19,778 --> 00:49:20,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

719
00:49:20,718 --> 00:49:23,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I should have called President Falco next, so President Falco.

[SPEAKER_11]: And Council Member Marks, is that an amendment?

00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,754

741
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,655

914
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:52,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Grandmother, um, and she will be sorely missed anytime you saw them together in the city It was always amelia and john, mr. President no matter where you saw them.

[SPEAKER_06]: They were a loving couple for many decades And uh, she will be sorely missed.

916
00:57:57,598 --> 00:57:58,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

917
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:08,908

00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:23,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping to put this on next week's resolution agenda but I appreciate bringing that stuff tonight.

919
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:26,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Amelia was a very special person I had the privilege of.

920
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:35,111
[SPEAKER_10]: being her son's soccer coach in high school and knowing her in that level, then working together at the Osgoode School.

921
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:37,831
[SPEAKER_10]: She's exactly what Medford's all about.

922
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:45,413
[SPEAKER_10]: A person that worked very hard in her own home and then made sure she gave back to the community any way she could.

923
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:46,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And what her and John did,

924
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:49,294
[SPEAKER_10]: has passed that on to her children.

925
00:58:49,955 --> 00:58:52,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And you see John Jr.

926
00:58:52,355 --> 00:59:01,677
[SPEAKER_10]: walking around working in the city and volunteering his time and doing whatever he can do for the kids in the soccer community, especially, but for all kids.

927
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:04,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a sad day.

928
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:07,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that John Sr.

929
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,219
[SPEAKER_10]: has been fighting some issues, and he's pulling through.

930
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:14,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God with that.

931
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,521
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, Amelia was a little bit of a shock.

932
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:22,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it was a quick illness and, you know, it still hurts the same.

933
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:27,409
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's a great person, someone that I'll miss seeing around the basketball game.

934
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:32,032
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a devoted grandmother that didn't miss anything and made sure that she represented

935
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:34,834
[SPEAKER_10]: her family and the city of Medford well.

936
00:59:34,874 --> 00:59:43,036
[SPEAKER_10]: So I send my condolences and I know that the Harris Park community will definitely miss Amelia Prestigiovanni for sure.

937
00:59:43,076 --> 00:59:44,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So God bless her.

938
00:59:44,257 --> 00:59:44,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

939
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,197

00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:50,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

942
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:57,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, these are huge losses to the Medford community, both, and to the Mustang community and the Mustang band.

943
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:05,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually, I think at one time, Kaitlin DiBenedetto, Anthony Prestigiovanni, and I were all in the Medford High band at the same time.

944
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:16,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I can remember Anthony's graduation party and the food and just that family, really just, I can still remember the food as Councilor Scarpelli is laughing at.

945
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:22,928
[SPEAKER_09]: just great community leaders and raised the wonderful families who I had the benefit of being friends with.

946
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:26,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So, sad loss and send my condolences.

947
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:28,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

948
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:28,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

949
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:44,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, to John and Teresa and John and Jared, you know, her son-in-law and grandchildren, child, you know, it's just a tragic, tragic loss that happened so suddenly, you know,

950
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:51,955
[SPEAKER_07]: regardless of Amelia's role in the community, the role that she played to her family was far, far, far more important.

951
01:00:52,515 --> 01:01:06,245
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, having had the opportunity to go to school with Teresa and get to know her over the years through a relationship with her husband, John, I just want to say that they did a great job raising their children and she will be sorely missed.

952
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:08,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, my condolences to the family.

953
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:10,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

954
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:12,870

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I want to echo the sentiments of my fellow councilors.

957
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:20,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to know Amelia through my work with her up and out of the St.

958
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis Food Bank.

959
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, people forget the work that the volunteerism of the people that work at St.

960

[SPEAKER_02]: Francis, and she was one of them, her and her husband.

961
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:35,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, good family.

962

963
01:01:39,736 --> 01:01:42,298

1038
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:15,467

1039
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:20,829
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of the meeting was to receive an update from the administration regarding the fiscal year 2020 budget.

1040
01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:23,986
[SPEAKER_05]: in fiscal year 2021 city budget.

1041
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:24,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1042
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:41,662
[SPEAKER_05]: All the councillors were in attendance along with Mayor Lungo-Koehn and also Mr. Roselli, who is a outside auditing consultant who works for the city.

1043
01:05:42,723 --> 01:05:51,852
[SPEAKER_05]: He explained the situation that the city is in with a shortfall of about $8 million, assuming a local aid cut of 20%.

1044
01:05:53,239 --> 01:06:02,163
[SPEAKER_05]: He explained that the motor vehicle excise, mail tax, rooms excise, and building permits are other major revenue components that make up the deficit.

1045
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:10,747
[SPEAKER_05]: After speaking with the building commissioner, Mr. Roselli said that he's using a $2 million figure rather than a $4 million figure.

1046
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:15,829
[SPEAKER_05]: He basically explained that the costs are already known.

1047
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:18,170
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an $8 million, $2 million gap.

1048
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,110
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an estimate.

1049
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:22,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city will have more numbers within the next few weeks.

1050
01:06:23,252 --> 01:06:28,794
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mr. Roselli did say that the information will get better faster as more information comes in.

1051
01:06:29,394 --> 01:06:33,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But he believes that the $8.2 million gap is a worst case scenario.

1052
01:06:39,737 --> 01:06:43,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And after asking Mr. Roselli when it will be an appropriate time to meet,

1053
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,415
[SPEAKER_05]: again to get an update.

1054
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: He said in early June.

1055
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will move forward and try to schedule that meeting with the administration so we can get an update, so we can get an update.

1056
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:55,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I offer that in the way of a motion, Mr. President?

1057
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:57,584

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is fine.

1080
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:49,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I may, Mr. President, maybe we can extend an invitation to some of our colleagues on the school committee to come and attend this meeting after the first so that they can see what happens on the other side of the.

1081
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:55,734
