I'm sure Councilor Morrell will be joining us shortly.

4
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:10,318
It's going to take me a couple of minutes just to read this beginning piece.

5
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:11,318
So we'll get started.

6

Thank you.

21
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:43,171
Councilor Morrell.

22
00:00:43,492 --> 00:00:44,772
I still don't see Councilor Morrell.

23
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:46,493
I'll come back to her.

24
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:47,454
Councilor Scarpelli.

25
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:48,354
Here.

26
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:49,775

27
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:50,516
Present.

28
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:54,478
Six members present, one absent.

29
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,342
At this point, I ask everyone to please rise to salute the flag.

30
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:16,968
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,611
Councilor Morrell is here.

32
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:24,594
All seven members are present.

33
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:29,539

All seven members are present.

35
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:35,979
I think I actually have to call her name just to make it official.

36
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,560
Councilor Morrell, are you here?

37
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:38,481
Yes.

38
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:39,322

Two zero dash three five seven.

55
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:22,951
Be it resolved that the Memphis city council request that the city administration examine the benefits of offering an early retirement incentive program and report

56
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:28,471
to the council, its findings, council and I. Mr. President, thank you very much.

57
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:34,135
There's much uncertainty surrounding our financial situation in the city of Medford.

58
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:44,562
And I think the only certainty that we have is that times are bad right now and that we forecast the revenues that aren't meeting our expectations.

59
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:51,967
And when we come into situations like this, there are many ways that we can address the financial crisis.

60
00:04:52,707 --> 00:05:06,772
before us, and one of those ways is to offer early retirement incentives to employees that have been working in the City of Medford for an extended period of time, make a good deal of money, top staff.

61
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:16,339
and that sometimes payâ€”sometimes contribute less into the pension fund based upon, you know, whenever they were hired.

62
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,584
So, you know, this 5 percent contribution rate, 7 percent, 9 percent, 9 plus 2 percent.

63
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:30,551
So this is a way, Mr. President, of getting individuals off the rolls that were contributing at a lower rate.

64
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,863
which will, in essence, provide us with a cost savings.

65
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:41,644
Through the administration to the retirement board and report be issued back to the city council examining the feasibility of such.

66
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:43,985
Thank you, councilor.

67
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,505
Vice president Carviello.

68
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,066
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I thought you had your hand up.

69
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:50,426
Any other questions from the council?

70
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:52,907
Second the motion, Mr. President.

71
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,427
Any community participation on this?

72
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:57,888
Clerk Urtubez, any emails?

73
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,551
Mr. President, there are no emails on this.

74
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:06,315
So far, I have an email on one topic for tonight, and it's later in the evening.

75
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:07,416
OK, thank you.

76
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:13,661
OK, on the motion of council all night, seconded by Vice President Caviello.

77
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,463
Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

78
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,227
Councilor Behrs?

79
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:20,967
Yes.

80
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,909
Vice President Carabiello?

81
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:23,349
Yes.

82
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:24,629
Councilor Knight?

83
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,390
Yes.

84
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,450
Councilor Marks?

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,430
Yes.

86
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,490
Councilor Morrell?

87
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,410
Yes.

88
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,630
Councilor Scarpelli?

89
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:31,331
Yes.

90
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,691
President Falco?

91
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,831
Yes, seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

92
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,992
2-0-358 offered by Councilor Knight.

93
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:44,733
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request a report from the administration on the following items.

94
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:51,414
Number one, amount of private supplemental funds raised to date for the construction of the Memphis Public Library.

95
00:06:52,206 --> 00:07:02,274
Number two, amount of the grant received from the state for the construction of the Medford Public Library and whether or not it is anticipated this award will be reduced.

96
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,196
If so, to what amount?

97
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:09,640
And number three, the total cost for the construction of the Medford Public Library.

98
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:16,986
Number four, anticipated necessary appropriation by the city council to fund the construction of the Medford Public Library.

99
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:18,227
Councilor Knight.

100
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,890
Mr. President, thank you very much.

101
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:30,216
Again, as we look at the fiscal picture that's before CFO Fiscal Year 21, there are many uncertainties.

102
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,378
We met with our consultant just a couple weeks ago.

103
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:36,140
We talked about our fixed costs, what they were, knowing what they are.

104
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,843
We have made commitments in this community to capital projects and capital needs.

105
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:44,306
One of those projects that's underway right now is the library.

106
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:47,328
And there is going to have to be a

107
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:51,891
appropriation made by the city to complete construction for this project.

108
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:56,454
Then we have also a commitment for construction of a new fire station.

109
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:06,222
So when we look at these capital needs with the fiscal picture that's before us, Mr. President, I think it's important that we understand going forward what it is that we need to do.

110
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,344
Some of our colleagues in government have been very vocal

111
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:15,749
in their desires to borrow, spend, and tax their way out of this fiscal crisis.

112
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:19,472
And I don't necessarily think that that's the best practice, Mr. President.

113
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:27,258
So before we start determining what road we have to take, I think we need to get all the information before so that we can make an informed decision.

114
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,322
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution moving forward.

115
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:38,107
I think this information will provide helpful when we develop a budget capital plan.

116
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:40,764
Thank you, Councilor Night.

117
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:44,947
On the motion of Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Carvalho.

118
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,187
Thank you, Mr. President.

119
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:48,969
Mr. President, I can give you some insight.

120
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:58,053
I can't give you the exact numbers on this, but I'm a member of the private foundation that's raising supplemental funds.

121
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:07,298
We were going along at a pretty good clip raising funds, but unfortunately, this has kind of put a little bit of a halt

122
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:11,041
uh, to what we've been able to raise at this particular moment.

123
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:17,806
Um, we've raised a little bit over a million dollars so far that we have had commitments for our summer paid some months.

124
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:22,210
Uh, but I think the people who committed will continue to, uh, to commit.

125
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:33,999
Uh, so, and, uh, we have a private donation from, from, uh, the Bloomberg foundation, uh, which, which has been committed to, I'm not at liberty to say the number at this moment.

126
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,381
I think, I think many people have heard the number.

127
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:47,923
But, uh, we were hoping that, uh, we'd invite the Bloombergs into, into Medford, hopefully in September, October to make the official, uh, gift, uh, to us.

128
00:09:48,043 --> 00:10:03,431
And we're also hoping, uh, uh, Barry Sloan, who's, uh, uh, is going to maybe go back to them and maybe they'll have a change of heart, uh, and hopefully, uh, up the gift that they were going to give to a little higher number.

129
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,792
So again,

130
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,112
Question number two, the original grant was for $12 million.

131
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:18,514
That grant for the $12 million was based on the original estimate of the library, which came in at around the $33 million mark.

132
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,715
The library cost is now down to $27 and change, and you take away the $12.

133
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:53,988
It brings it down but as the as the as council may lose you as as the number of the the price of library goes down so does the grants so If I understand the grant now is down to about ten five From the original twelve in and as we keep cutting and changing then the grant is going to go down.

134
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,749
So As you cut yeah, you just sort of

135
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,340
doing nothing because you're cutting the grant.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,822
So that kind of makes no sense to do that.

137
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:14,930
The total cost for the construction with the original grant is somewhere around 17 and change.

138
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:23,898
We're hoping right now with the money raised and the gifts by the Bloomberg,

139
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:27,114
The number is down to about 13-ish.

140
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:40,181
We were hoping to get the number down into somewhere between the 10 to 12 area, which would be a steal for the city of Medford to get a library for $12 million or less.

141
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,202
So that's the original goal.

142
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:51,487
Hopefully, the fundraising has not stopped, but it's kind of at an impasse right now due to the situation here.

143
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:52,427
But like I said,

144
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:07,690
If if the library would it would no money raised Right now that the numbers around 17 and change but is a with it with the gifts and capital Money raised it's right now.

145
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:17,818
It's around the 13 ish area So again, hopefully the fundraiser will continue after this again fundraising, you know, it's a

146
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,649
It's a two or three-year commitment.

147
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:30,276
We haven't even gone out to the community yet to start raising money from the citizens of Medford, though a few have donated.

148
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,396
So that's where we're at.

149
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:40,863
But the number right now would be, if we would had to stop right now, it'd be in around the $13 million area.

150
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:42,224
It would take a few dollars.

151
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:45,566
Thank you, Councilor Cabello.

152
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,511
Thank you, Vice President.

153
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:52,116
The administration can give you a more specific numbers, but those are guesstimate numbers.

154
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:53,637
Okay, thank you.

155
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:55,399
Councilor Beers.

156
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,461
Thank you, Mr. President.

157
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,903
Just a clarification, Rick.

158
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:08,617
Use the phrase cutting and changing as are there cuts and changes being made to the project or are you saying that that might uh, Yeah, I know the administration, uh at the building meeting.

159
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:26,610
Let's say they've made some changes on the brick and things uh, let's say uh, let's say as the price drops so does the grant I gotta say because the original price of the library was in the 33 million dollar area and it came in at 27 so let's say the the 12 and change dropped to 10 to 10 5

160
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,829
So it might vary a little bit.

161
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,431
Hopefully, I've reached out to Representative Donato.

162
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:42,514
And maybe in his leadership position, we can get the library foundation to adhere to the $12 million grant.

163
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:48,916
And maybe we won't lose the money due to the cost of the project being less than anticipated.

164
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:50,877
So that would be a big plus.

165
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:52,957
Thanks, Rick.

166
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:53,918
Just one other quick question.

167
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:58,431
Is it cosmetic changes to reduce the price or are there substantive?

168
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,215
I think from what I'm hearing right now, it's just like cosmetic changes.

169
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,577
I would hope there aren't any substantive changes.

170
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:08,740
All right, so the building is still net zero and all that as far as you.

171
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:09,481
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:10,202
Got it, thank you.

173
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:14,165
Okay, thank you, Councilor Beers.

174
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,267
Thank you, Vice President Caviello for the update.

175
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:17,168
Councilor Marks.

176
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,535
Thank you, Mr. President.

177
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:29,285
It might be appropriate at this point that we have a project update also here, and I appreciate the work Vice President Capiello has done on this.

178
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:40,297
He was one of the leaders in moving this library forward and was the person that came out originally and alarmed the city that there was a potential grant out there some years ago.

179
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:45,519
And I think that's why we're in the situation we are now moving forward on a state-of-the-art library.

180
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:59,344
But I would ask, Mr. President, if we can have a separate meeting, maybe a committee of the whole, where we can have a project update on where we stand with construction and the private foundation, and if we are going to meet our goals.

181
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:01,465
Thank you, Councilor Mark.

182
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,746
Would you like to add that as an amendment?

183
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:05,146
Yes.

184
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,307
Second, Mr. President.

185
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:09,828
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

186
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,254
Any other comments from the council?

187
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,597
Any community participation on this matter?

188
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,199
Clerk Hertovich, have you received any emails?

189
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,001
Mr. President, I have not.

190
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,141
I've received no emails.

191
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:27,584
Just on one topic for later tonight, and that participant may speak at the meeting.

192
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:28,985
Okay, thank you.

193
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:36,350
On the motion of Council Night, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Marks, Clerk Hertovich, please call the roll.

194
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,421
Councilor Bears?

195
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:42,161
Yes.

196
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,504
Vice President Caravaglia?

197
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:45,044
Yes.

198
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:46,546
Councilor Knight?

199
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,167
Yes.

200
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:49,208
Councilor Marks?

201
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:50,630
Yes.

202
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,651
Councilor Morrell?

203
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:52,472
Yes.

204
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,794
Councilor Scarpelli?

205
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:55,635
Yes.

206
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:56,736
President Fevella?

207
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:57,497
Yes.

208
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,439
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

209
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,319
The motion passes.

210
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:03,684
20-359 offered by Councilor Knight.

211
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:14,931
Be it resolved that the Director of Substance Abuse Prevention conduct an analysis on the trends relative to substance abuse during the government shutdown and report back to the Council the findings.

212
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:15,991
Councilor Knight.

213
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,853
Mr. President, thank you very much.

214
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:28,499
In times like this, it's very odd because, you know, when crisis arises, people rely on government more.

215
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:37,291
I think that our Office of Substance Abuse Prevention has done an excellent job over the years in addressing the concerns that we've had in this community.

216
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:47,296
I certainly think that we've made great strides in combating the opioid addiction in the city of Medford and other substance abuse problems that we've seen here.

217
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:54,700
With that being said, Mr. President, with the government shutdown comes a change in our ability to deliver services at the same level.

218
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:56,228
that we were delivering them before.

219
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:10,813
So I just ask that the Office of Substance Abuse and Prevention report back to us what the current trends are, what they're seeing, so that we can be better informed and more aware of what approaches need to be taken to continue to be successful in combating opioid addiction in the city of Manhattan.

220
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:12,634
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

221
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,355
Any other comments from the Council?

222
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,376
Second, Mr. President.

223
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:21,697
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

224
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,238
Any comments from the community?

225
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,070
Okay, on that motion, clerk.

226
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,691
Mr. President, no emails.

227
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:33,893
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Beers, clerk, please call the roll.

228
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:35,174
Councilor Beers.

229
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:36,054
Yes.

230
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,375
Vice President Caravaglia.

231
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:37,835
Yes.

232
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:38,736
Councilor Knight.

233
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:39,596
Yes.

234
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:40,576
Councilor Marks.

235
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:41,597
Yes.

236
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:42,577
Councilor Morrell.

237
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:43,378
Yes.

238
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:44,478
Councilor Scarpelli.

239
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:45,018
Yes.

240
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,059
President Falco.

241
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,320
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

242
00:17:49,340 --> 00:18:03,809
20-360 offered by Council and I, be it resolved that the city administration provide the Memphis City Council with a copy of the emergency response plan preparing for an instance of or event where the coronavirus infects our essential personnel.

243
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:12,374
Council and I. Yeah, Mr. President, I think as we learn more and more about the coronavirus, one of the things we've

244
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:20,339
been able to really appreciate is the work that our first responders perform, our firefighters, our police officers, our DPW and the like.

245
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:30,287
And it gets me thinking, Mr. President, what happens if, say, there's a coronavirus outbreak among all the members of B group in the fire department?

246
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:31,227
What happens then?

247
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:36,792
Or if one firehouse becomes infected and two or three groups in the same firehouse become infected?

248
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,931
What's our emergency response plan?

249
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:47,996
What steps are we taking to be sure that the community is going to be safe and that we're going to be able to deliver the high level of quality public safety services that we've been able to deliver in the past?

250
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:56,720
So I offer this resolution, hoping to learn a little bit more about this, Mr. President, so that we operate to address any type of issue like this in the community.

251
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,942
You know, when we pick up the phone and we call 911, these are the people that we rely on.

252
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,884
So I think that it only makes sense that we show some concern.

253
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:12,694
as to what's going on in their lives, and be sure that there are plans in place to protect them, number one, and number two, to be sure to deliver the same levels of protection to the citizenry here in the city.

254
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:14,915
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

255
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:15,896
Councilor Behrs.

256
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:17,716
Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:21,658
I'd just like to propose a B paper to this, completely agree with Councilor Knight.

258
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:31,603
Also, getting an update on what efforts have been made to provide all the PPE that our first responders need, and any other safety

259
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,779
that we've been able to implement.

260
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,482
Second that, Mr. President.

261
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:39,425
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

262
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,307
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

263
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:43,589
Councilor Marks, one second.

264
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,993
Clerk Herterbeast, do you have the language on the... I've got it, yes.

265
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:47,494
I got it.

266
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:52,240
Okay, so on the motion of... Actually, Councilor Marks.

267
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:54,403
Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:19:54,543 --> 00:20:06,406
In line with this, which I support this resolution wholeheartedly, if we can get an update from our emergency preparedness office regarding what steps have been taken over the last three months, if any.

269
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,407
Councilor Marks, is that an amendment or is it a request?

270
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:16,528
Either way, if the councilor doesn't mind, I'll add it to his request.

271
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:17,708
If not, I'll do it as amendment.

272
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,355
Why don't we add that to the original?

273
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,317
We'll add that as an amendment to the original motion.

274
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,357
Is that okay, Councilor Knight?

275
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:24,318
That's fine.

276
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:25,819
Can I have that language back, please?

277
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:26,820
I didn't get it all down.

278
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:31,283
That we receive an update from the emergency preparedness office.

279
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:33,745
Okay.

280
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:42,292
Regarding what steps, as Councilor Knight mentioned, to safeguard our public safety officials and first responders.

281
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,034
Okay.

282
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,756
You know, every year, Mr. President, if I could add,

283
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:58,527
We fund the emergency preparedness office in the budget, and it's pitiful of the amount of money that we put in there.

284
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:07,376
I want to say maybe $1,500 for a city this size, maybe $2,000, and I can't remember the exact number.

285
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:10,639
But it's really next to nothing.

286
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:20,924
And in a time of need that we see now, it really makes you think, how are we prepared to handle issues that we confront as a community?

287
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:29,629
And so I think it's important maybe during the budget that we also revisit what's spent for emergency preparedness in our community as well.

288
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,650
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

289
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:34,312
Any other comments from the council?

290
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,273
Second the motion, Mr. President.

291
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,361
Any other comments from the community or any emails, Clark-Hernandez?

292
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,302
There are no emails, Mr. President.

293
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:45,942
Thank you.

294
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:50,584
We will take the B paper first that was offered by Councilor Beers and seconded by Councilor Knight.

295
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:54,405
Would you like to read the language back in the B paper, Clark-Hernandez?

296
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:06,450
The B paper is to get an update on efforts made to date to provide PPE to first responders.

297
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:11,287
On that motion, Clerk Kurtopis, please call the roll.

298
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:14,209
Councilor Behrs?

299
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,870
Yes.

300
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,411
Vice President Caraviello?

301
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:16,651
Yes.

302
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:17,812
Councilor Knight?

303
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:18,393
Yes.

304
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:19,393
Councilor Marks?

305
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:20,354
Yes.

306
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:21,355
Councilor Morrell?

307
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:22,075
Yes.

308
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:23,216
Councilor Scarlatti?

309
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:23,817
Yes.

310
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:24,897
President Falco?

311
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:25,618
Yes.

312
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:28,020
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

313
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,324
On the original paper that was offered by Councilor Knight, Clerk Kurtopis, did that have a second?

314
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:34,685
I second it, Mr. President.

315
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:42,274
Seconded by Vice President Caraviello as amended by Councilor Marks.

316
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:42,914
Please call the roll.

317
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,157
Councilor Behrs.

318
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:45,918
Yes.

319
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,299
Vice President Caraviello.

320
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:47,760
Yes.

321
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,741
Councilor Knight.

322
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:49,882
Yes.

323
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:50,743
Councilor Marks.

324
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:51,524
Yes.

325
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:52,485
Councilor Morrell.

326
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:53,326
Yes.

327
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,548
Councilor Scarpelli.

328
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:55,489
Yes.

329
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:56,410
President Falco.

330
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,096
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

331
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:04,761
2-0-361 offered by Vice President Caraviello.

332
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:15,271
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council ask the mayor to install clear plexiglass panels in all the chambers in an effort to safely separate council members.

333
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:20,236
Be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council is be administered COVID-19 testing.

334
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:26,182
With the upcoming budget meetings approaching, council members meet on a frequent basis.

335
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:30,405
It must feel comfortable working with each for extended periods of time.

336
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:32,287
Vice President Carviello.

337
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,568
Thank you, Mr. President.

338
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:41,012
Mr. President, we've been out of the chambers for a long time, and I know we're getting close to getting back there.

339
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:51,397
But similar to like what the grocery stores have done and everything, they put up pussy class barriers in between everybody to keep

340
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:57,980
When people are somewhat of a closer of a quarter, it keeps them separated from each other.

341
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:05,747
I think that would be a good step for a temporary measure until the situation passes.

342
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:16,357
Further, I know many members of City Hall have been tested already, but I think that the council should be tested also, seeing that we're going to be working with each other.

343
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:21,100
in close quarters for an extended period of time.

344
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,743
And just to make sure that everyone is comfortable with everybody, knowing that we're all safe with each other.

345
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:35,108
So it's a suggestion and hopefully my other councils agree and we can get back in the city hall and start working.

346
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:40,732
And it isn't just for the city council, it's for the school committee, it's for all the boards and commissions who meet.

347
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:45,435
So again, it's time we get back into the people's chamber.

348
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,172
Thank you, Vice President Carvio.

349
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:49,253
Councilor Morrell.

350
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:50,854
Thank you, Mr. President.

351
00:24:51,074 --> 00:25:00,417
I appreciate my colleagues focus on safety, but I'm just a little lost as to when we decided or how it was decided that we would be back in the chambers for this type of stuff.

352
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:03,699
I do understand the frustration with these types of meetings.

353
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:10,101
There's a certain amount that gets lost in them, but I think this, what we're doing right now is the temporary measure.

354
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,862
We think there is a challenge with testing.

355
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:14,083
We can test the city council and then we go and

356
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,095
around our spouses who might be going to work or going to places.

357
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,877
And that test doesn't matter if we're exposed in the next day.

358
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:28,604
And if you've been paying attention to the news, the things that matter as far as contracting this is space and time.

359
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:34,988
And if we're together for hours and we're in places where workers have to be because they can't work from home, I think it's just a risk.

360
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:41,253
And again, I appreciate the idea behind this, but I feel like I'm a little lost as to where

361
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:45,389
everyone going back to City Hall has been decided upon at this point.

362
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,910
For your information, Mr. President.

363
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,672
For your information, Councilor Cavillo.

364
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:58,818
Well, I think earlier this evening, I think it was the mayor says they're coming up with a plan for us to get back, open up City Hall and for us to get back in there.

365
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:02,000
So it's coming hopefully very soon.

366
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:09,265
So it's not, I don't think we're going to be out of there another month or two months, but it is getting close to it happening.

367
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:19,333
Councilor Morrell, no decision has formally been made for us to go back into Alden Chambers to conduct business yet.

368
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:25,997
I know there's been numerous agenda items on the agenda to talk about this.

369
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:31,200
There's been different, I know during our meetings, I know a lot of Councilors would like to get back to City Hall.

370
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:37,405
But no formal decision has been made to actually have our meetings back there yet.

371
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:42,929
I think the big thing was just to hear what Governor Baker had to say yesterday and then try to move forward from there.

372
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:47,073
So that's to give you a little bit more of an explanation, I guess.

373
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:47,933
Right, right.

374
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:48,914
Okay, thank you.

375
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:49,575
Thank you.

376
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,496
Councilor Beers and then Councilor Knight.

377
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:53,738
Thank you, Mr. President.

378
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:54,759
Yeah, just quickly.

379
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,223
Um, definitely appreciate the focus on safety and and I think it'd be great to get back when possible.

380
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:11,649
Um On the plexiglass My understanding of how this works from the epidemiologist is that that helps you if you're in a short A short period of time and interaction.

381
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:22,055
So like a grocery store We're only looking at someone for a minute or two You know if we're sitting there for hours the plexi our breath will eventually go over and around the plexiglass So I don't I don't know if that's um

382
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:24,890
That's the right way to do it.

383
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,892
I would like to propose a B paper.

384
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:30,194
Give the clerk a second.

385
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:34,878
Ready?

386
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,663
A B paper that it sounds like the city administration is putting together a plan.

387
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:50,792
So as part of that, I'd love for us to see the council, essentially this, that the city administration include information on what surrounding communities are doing.

388
00:27:51,568 --> 00:28:00,374
with in terms of public meetings, and also any guidance from Governor Baker on public meetings in person.

389
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:06,058
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

390
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:15,484
Any other comments regarding this resolution from the councilors?

391
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:17,786
Councilor Knight.

392
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:25,546
I've made my frustrations with this virtual governing well-known Mr. President.

393
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:34,869
I know that we've passed resolutions in the past calling for budget debates to be held in a non-virtual setting.

394
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,350
Have you gotten any update from them?

395
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:40,791
I have not.

396
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:41,472
I have not.

397
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:47,834
I will reach out to them tomorrow to see if we have an update, but I have not received anything as of yet.

398
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:57,178
And once I do find out, or if I get any type of an update, I will make sure that the council knows as soon as possible.

399
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:07,206
And I think that, you know, looking at what we do has to be a part of the phased rollout that the governor proposed.

400
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:14,171
And I don't think that we'd be able to meet prior to June 1st anyway, based upon the criteria that he's put forward.

401
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:15,752
I sure wish we could.

402
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,555
So, you know, I definitely support councilor Cabello's

403
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:26,257
I think it is a good measure to come up with some sort of outside-the-box solution to allow us to resume businesses normally as possible.

404
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:30,378
Thank you, Councilmember Knight.

405
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,939
He was raising his hand a minute ago.

406
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,080
I had a quick question for Councilmember Behrs.

407
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,040
Is that a B paper or regular amendment?

408
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,441
I think you said B paper but it could also be part of the

409
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:53,458
Any other questions regarding the resolution, the B paper or the main resolution?

410
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,320
Any other comments from the community?

411
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,181
Clerk Curtis, have you received any emails?

412
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:00,901
No emails.

413
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,543
So on the B paper offered by Councilor Behrs.

414
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:06,543

No.

446
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:01,202
Councilor Scarpelli.

447
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:01,943
Yes.

448
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:03,385
President Falco.

449
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:04,266
Yes.

450
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,948
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

451
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:06,729
The motion passes.

452
00:31:09,195 --> 00:31:21,722
Let's see, 20-364 offered by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council then can congratulate Nancy White, Representative Paltinato on the years of service, chairing the Memphis Democratic City Committee.

453
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:23,403
Councilor Beers.

454
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:26,145
Councilor Morrell.

455
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,106
Oh, Councilor Morrell, I apologize.

456
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:30,907
Thank you, Mr. President and Councilor Beers.

457
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:37,511
Yeah, I just wanted to put this out to thank Paul and Nancy for their many years of service to the interested residents of Medford.

458
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:41,744
I'm obviously a big fan of civic engagement, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.

459
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:45,326
I think it's a laudable cause to volunteer your time in this way.

460
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:52,410
And I just wanted to put it out there to thank and congratulate them on their many years of service to the residents of Medford that are interested.

461
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:57,173
And I'm sure I will have much more appreciation for their dedication in the coming months.

462
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,735
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

463
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:01,216
Councilor Pierce?

464
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,117
Yeah, thank you, Mr. President.

465
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:06,927
Yeah, I completely second what Councilor Morrell said.

466
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:13,670
I've been a part of the ward and city committee for almost four years now, and Nancy and Paula have done a ton of work to bring us together.

467
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:22,134
And I also second Councilor Morrell's statement that, you know, whatever committee of any partisanship, if there was a transition like this, we'd be congratulating them.

468
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:26,535
So just want to thank Paul and Nancy for their years of service.

469
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:28,776
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

470
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,568
Mr. President, thank you very much.

471
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:39,933
I'm glad to have had the privilege and pleasure of working with both Nancy White and Representative Donato.

472
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:48,199
And, you know, I can't tell you the amount of dedication and commitment they put forth to the democratic body in the city of Medford, but also in the community.

473
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:51,881
And when you look at the work that they've done, it's really commendable.

474
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:54,283
You know, you look at Representative Donato and the

475
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,083
amount of service that he's provided to the city.

476
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:01,705
Years and years of service, always delivering, year in and year out, bringing home the bacon, Mr. President.

477
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:10,009
You know, making sure that our local aid numbers are hitting the spot, making sure that we're able to provide certain infrastructure improvements in our community.

478
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:15,711
I mean, Representative Donato has done an excellent job up on Beacon Health, and I'm really looking forward to supporting him again this year.

479
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:22,214
When we look at Nancy White and the work that she's done in organizing the community and making sure that people stay active and involved,

480
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:28,967
and want to be a part of the democratic process here in the community, fighting for the shared values that we all can agree upon.

481
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,327
It's really commendable.

482
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:41,393
Both of them are excellent, excellent resources, and I hope that they remain involved, remain active, because we certainly need them to be participants in our government, especially during these trying times.

483
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:47,337
They bring years of experience and a wealth of knowledge, Mr. President, and these are people we need to keep in government.

484
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:51,859
So with that being said, I thank them both for their service, and I thank the sponsors of this resolution.

485
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:53,835
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

486
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,596
Oh, Councilor Marks.

487
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:58,997
Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:03,059
And I too want to thank Representative Donato and Nancy White.

489
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:12,542
As a former ward chair of Ward 7, I appreciated all the work that they put in over the many years, Mr. President.

490
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:19,905
When the times were tough in the Democratic Party, they kept the Democratic Party going.

491
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:21,845
and for many years.

492
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:37,589
So I want to thank them for their efforts over the years as the outgoing co-chairs, and I'd like to thank our own Councilor Morrell and Henry Millerin as the incoming new Democratic Water and City Committee chairs.

493
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:45,611
So I want to thank them for their interest, and hopefully we can get the party back on its feet again, Mr. President.

494
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,331
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

495
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:49,951
Vice President Caviello.

496
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:51,352
Thank you, Mr. President.

497
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:58,880
Again, I want to reiterate the words of my fellow counselors to Representative Donato and Nancy White.

498
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:07,028
I mean, they put in countless hours of a thankless job that, you know, over the years, no one ever wanted to volunteer for.

499
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,291
And again, I want to thank them just for the

500
00:35:10,638 --> 00:35:17,389
their years of work, and I want to thank Councillor Morrell for stepping up and filling one of those positions.

501
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:22,758
So good luck to her going forward, and thank you for the other two for their years of service.

502
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,509
Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

503
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:26,489
Councilor Scott Kelly.

504
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:28,130
Thank you, Mr. President.

505
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:49,098
And again, just to reiterate what my colleagues have said, you're talking about two great people, pillars of our community that have made sure that the political word was spread throughout the community and that we were represented properly here in Medford.

506
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,239
And we thank them very much for all their hard work.

507
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,620
And again, I echo

508
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,361
Council night sentiments.

509
00:35:55,481 --> 00:36:07,247
It's uh, it's a sense of relief knowing that um, you know, um representative Donato's Statehouse working for us and and you see his work every single day.

510
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:09,508
So I thank them both for a job well done

511
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:11,881
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

512
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:23,204
And if I may echo the sentiments of my colleagues as well, Representative Paul Donato and Nancy White have given many years of service to the city in this capacity.

513
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,424
We thank them for their time and their effort, their energy, and we wish them well.

514
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:30,765
But they've given a ton of time and effort to this cause, and we say thank you.

515
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:32,646
Let's see.

516
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:37,206
So at this point, are there any comments from the community?

517
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:38,367
Anybody want to speak?

518
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:38,827
Oh, OK.

519
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:39,647
One minute, please.

520
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,541
I would speak, Adam.

521
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:44,681
Ms.

522
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:48,043
Paul, if you could please have your name and address for the record.

523
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:51,065
Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street in Medford.

524
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,686
Thank you.

525
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:56,768
Is this when I should speak now?

526
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:57,808
Yeah, absolutely.

527
00:36:58,189 --> 00:36:58,509
Okay.

528
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:03,411
I appreciate the opportunity to express my concern about Ms.

529
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:08,014
Morrell and her election to the Democratic Party as co-chair in Medford.

530
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:15,803
We have different parties and backgrounds, and I believe people want Medford to be Medford and not Somerville.

531
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:28,733
Many in Medford own their own homes and condos, but in Somerville, approximately only 17% are able to because of the extreme level of taxes.

532
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:37,160
Further, the open border policies of the Democratic Party bring people in tremendous needs, bring people in,

533
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:45,016
with tremendous needs, which we must pay because sanctuary cities are costly to manage.

534
00:37:49,177 --> 00:38:04,463
Especially important today, as we see how dependent we are on China for all our... We know taxation and regulation of entire industries by the Democratic Party must stop.

535
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,587
People need more than minimum wage jobs.

536
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:17,071
Finally, policies of the Democratic Party need to be watched, challenged, and kept in control.

537
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,992
Again, Medford needs to be Medford.

538
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,454
Thank you for listening, and I hope you will all stay well.

539
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:26,215
Thank you, Ms.

540
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:26,515
Paul.

541
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:28,736
Any other questions for the community?

542
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:32,238
Seeing and hearing none, oh, Councilor Knight?

543
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:44,938
Um, I, as one member of this body, Mr. President also as, um, uh, registered Democrat here in the city of Medford, um, do not share the same concerns that Ms.

544
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:45,418
Paul does.

545
00:38:46,198 --> 00:39:00,345
Um, especially when it comes to my colleague here on the council, um, you know, partisan politics are one thing, but, um, you know, to express concern over a counselor of morale's abilities or qualifications to serve in that capacity, I don't think is appropriate.

546
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:04,209
quite frankly, Mr. President, I think she's been a breath of fresh air on this council.

547
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:10,519
She's someone that I certainly enjoy working with and she has an open mind and brings different viewpoints to the table.

548
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,708
So I just want to say that she's a pleasure to work with and I really don't think that hooking

549
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,590
at the presentation that Ms.

550
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,151
Paul made.

551
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:24,214
And I understand, Joyce, you know what I mean, that you're a representative of the Republican Party.

552
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:31,821
But this is here to congratulate a member of our body on an achievement in not making a personal attack.

553
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:35,924
And I just want to stand beside my colleague and support her and congratulate her.

554
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:39,347
Joyce, I certainly respect your opinion and understand where you're coming from.

555
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,329
But, you know, in times like this when

556
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:43,535
There's so much going on in the world.

557
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:45,796
We need to stand together and focus on the positives.

558
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,576
And again, the shared values that we have.

559
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:54,397
And I think Councilor Morrell comes to the board with an open mind, and she's someone that's going to be able to do just fine in that role.

560
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,658
They have big shoes to fill, and I think that they'll be able to fill them.

561
00:39:59,118 --> 00:39:59,938
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

562
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:00,598
I would agree.

563
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:08,099
On the motion of Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beers, seconded by?

564
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,040
Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,300
Vice President Caviello, clerk, please call the roll.

566
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,420
Councilor Behrs?

567
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:16,281
Yes.

568
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:17,742
Vice President Caravaglio?

569
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:18,202
Yes.

570
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:19,262
Councilor Knight?

571
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:20,143
Yes.

572
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,123
Councilor Marks?

573
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:22,064
Yes.

574
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:23,065
Councilor Morrell?

575
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:23,965
Yes.

576
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:25,086
Councilor Scarpelli?

577
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:25,726
Yes.

578
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:26,787
President Falco?

579
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:27,367
Yes.

580
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,289
Seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

581
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:36,392
At this point I would ask if Vice President Caravaglio could take the chair and read resolutions 20-362 and

582
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:39,314
2-0-3-6-3.

583
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:43,298
Thank you, Mr. President.

584
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:56,291
2-0-3-6-2, offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Henry Miller and City Councilor Nicole Morrell on being selected, elected co-chairs of the Memphis Democratic Ward and City Committee.

585
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:57,553
President Falco.

586
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,194
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

587
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:04,797
I just wanted to congratulate our colleague, Consular Nicole Morel, on her new role.

588
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:09,099
And Henry Malorin, a good friend of all of ours, and his new role as well.

589
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:13,901
I am sure they're ready to work hard because it'll take a lot of hard work, but I know they're up to the task.

590
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:18,864
They do have big shoes to fill, but I know that they will do well in this new role.

591
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:24,687
So congratulations to Consular Morel and to Henry Malorin in their new role.

592
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:26,532
and we wish them well.

593
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:27,392
So, thank you.

594
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:28,353
Second, Mr. President.

595
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:29,693
Councilor Bez.

596
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:30,814
Thank you.

597
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,175
I'd like to second that.

598
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:37,277
And I was going to save my praise of Councilor Morrell for this, this part of the agenda.

599
00:41:37,317 --> 00:41:46,582
But I think it speaks when anyone in this community volunteers their time for civic engagement for a community group for an organization to make the city better.

600
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,103
That's good for all of us.

601
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:52,045
And I think Councilor Morrell is doing that here and so many other people we had

602
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:59,499
over 30 people on our call last week, you know, a ton of people who are really committed to this city and this community.

603
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:02,561
And I think Councilor Morrell is going to be great.

604
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,183
And Henry, I mean, you don't have to say anything about Henry.

605
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:12,367
We all know how wonderful Henry is, leader in his community, brings people together, brought together the forum for council candidates last year.

606
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:17,451
So I think we have two great leaders to fill the big shoes of Representative Donato and Nancy White.

607
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:19,712
Thank you, Councilor Beas.

608
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:20,493
Anyone else like to speak?

609
00:42:24,723 --> 00:42:33,850
And if I could just put a word in, I want to thank Henry for stepping up and taking over the position that's sort of the changing of the garden.

610
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:39,475
Henry works tirelessly, even before he was the chairman of the committee.

611
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:41,316
So I want to thank him for stepping up.

612
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:42,678
It's a thankless job.

613
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,179
A lot of hours go in.

614
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:56,564
for that work, and again, I'm proud to sit beside Councillor Morrell, and I'm sure she's more than up to the task of being the co-chair of the committee, like Councillor Knight says.

615
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:07,367
She brings a lot to the table, and I'm more than confident she's able to do the job, and I congratulate both Henry and Councillor Morrell on their selections.

616
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:13,629
On the motion by Councillor Falcone, seconded by Councillor Bares, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

617
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:17,844
Okay, Council Bears?

618
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:18,584
Yes.

619
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,926
Alphabetically now President Falco?

620
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:22,907
Yes.

621
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:24,148
Councilor Knight?

622
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,470
Yes.

623
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:29,231
Councilor Marks?

624
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:29,952
Yes.

625
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:30,932
Councilor Morrell?

626
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:31,873
Abstain.

627
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:34,174
Councilor Scarpelli?

628
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:34,755
Yes.

629
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,156
Vice President Caraballo?

630
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:37,777
Yes.

631
00:43:37,977 --> 00:43:40,739
Six in the affirmative, one abstention, motion passes.

632
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:44,476
2-0-3-6-3 offered by President Falco.

633
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:53,119
Be it resolved that the DPW install crossing signals at the intersection of Central Avenue and Spring Street in the interest of public safety.

634
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,019
President Falco.

635
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:56,440
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

636
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:04,823
I received a call this week from a resident regarding the lights at the intersection of Spring Street and Central Avenue.

637
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:08,105
and how there's no crossing signal at that light.

638
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:09,466
It's just a regular street light.

639
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:12,427
That is a heavily traversed area.

640
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:22,874
We have a lot of traffic coming from the Fellows Way, going to the Fellows Way, just a lot of traffic going back and forth down Spring Street, Twins Haynes Square, and Riverside Avenue.

641
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:30,018
So in the interest of public safety, I'm asking that the DPW install a crossing signal at that intersection.

642
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:31,819
I think it's long overdue.

643
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,360
That is a very, very

644
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,881
busy intersection.

645
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:42,023
There are a lot of, you know, kids in the community that do walk in, cross here, it's narrow park.

646
00:44:42,624 --> 00:44:44,324
So that really needs to be addressed.

647
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:48,266
So I would ask that this be addressed in the matter of public safety.

648
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:49,426
Thank you.

649
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:51,367
And thank you, Councilor Cavillo.

650
00:44:51,782 --> 00:44:52,902
Thank you, Mr. President.

651
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:54,023
Councilor Scott Pelli.

652
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:55,864
Thank you, Mr. President.

653
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,685
Again, thanks, Council President, for bringing this forward.

654
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:06,168
Maybe as we wait, we might ask for the temporary raised crosswalks.

655
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:15,431
that were further down central to be maybe placed in that area to slow that, make that a traffic calming measure immediately.

656
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:29,877
And then if I can, Council President, follow up with a resolution I put in months ago with the crosswalk on Locust Street in front of Wegmans.

657
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:35,059
We've asked for some sort of crossing mechanism for

658
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,521
for the kids and people that cross over Locust Street from the rink side.

659
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:45,123
There is nowhere to cross in front of the stores.

660
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:57,186
And if we can even put some cones or the traffic slowing cones that people have a chance to cross, because it is a dangerous area.

661
00:45:57,226 --> 00:46:02,507
If you don't mind, as a B paper, if we can add that or just add it to your amendment, I'd appreciate that.

662
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,088
Mr. Clerk, did you get that?

663
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,404
I got most of Councilor Scarpelli's amendment.

664
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:22,288
He's asking for temporary raised crosswalks that are further down on Central to be placed near this intersection for traffic calming measures.

665
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:27,210
He's also seeking a crosswalk or calming measures on Locust Street, is that correct?

666
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,090
Correct, in front of Wegmans.

667
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:33,612
Okay, and do you want that as a B paper or as an amendment to the main paper?

668
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:36,033
Let's make it a B paper, if that's okay with Councilor Falcone.

669
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:38,427
Either way.

670
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:39,688
Second.

671
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:42,729
Mr. Clerk, do you have anybody with any comments?

672
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,050
I do not.

673
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,231
Councilor Bez.

674
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:47,492
Thank you, Mr. President.

675
00:46:48,052 --> 00:47:01,499
If it's fine with Councilor Scarpelli, I'm wondering if we could add to that B paper, any updates from the city administration, from the traffic engineer on Locust Street, what they're going to do with Locust Street, given that that apartment building is opening and it's a mess, so.

676
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,480
No, that's a good idea.

677
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,601
Okay, Mr. Scott, did you get that?

678
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:08,461
I got it.

679
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:13,284
Okay, I think I see Mr. Navarro, did you have your hand up?

680
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:17,706
Mr. Navarro, did you have your hand up?

681
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:24,008
I wound up typing my comment, but I can read it.

682
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:29,751
I know last week council asked for an update on tough square, because it's not clear what's going on there.

683
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:35,974
But I wanted to say that might be good in particular if council made a point about the crosswalks there.

684
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:41,356
It's a complete street project to make it safer for pedestrians.

685
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:45,578
It seems the first step they did when they did the construction was grind out all the crosswalks.

686
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:54,594
which I was walking the other day, and it seemed a little dangerous to me, and it wasn't clear where you're supposed to cross, and it's been like that for quite a while.

687
00:47:56,195 --> 00:47:57,596
Thank you.

688
00:47:57,656 --> 00:47:58,337
Any other comments?

689
00:48:00,158 --> 00:48:06,263
Okay, Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll on the B paper?

690
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,466
Yes, is there a second on the B paper?

691
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,707
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second.

692
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:11,207
Second.

693
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:11,608
Second.

694
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:13,669
Mr. President.

695
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,131
Councilor Mox.

696
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:23,324
Also, if we can add in that the crosswalks be reviewed at Tufts Square, which was just mentioned by Mr. Navarro.

697
00:48:25,244 --> 00:48:26,885
Mr. Clerk, can you add that into the paper, please?

698
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:27,825
On the B paper?

699
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:29,926
You want all these amendments added to the B paper, correct?

700
00:48:30,146 --> 00:48:30,686
That is correct.

701
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:31,106
Please.

702
00:48:32,506 --> 00:48:33,787
Do we have a second on the B paper?

703
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:34,627
Hang on, hang on.

704
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:36,127
Second.

705
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:36,827
Second.

706
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:38,488
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

707
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,471
Okay, this is on the B paper.

708
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:53,033
Mr. Mr. Clark.

709
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:56,075
Okay, this is offered by council bear second by Councilman on the B paper.

710
00:48:58,396 --> 00:48:59,477
Councilor Scarpelli, I think.

711
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:01,758
I'm sorry, I apologize.

712
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:04,140
Councilor Bears also amended the B paper.

713
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:13,045
It's Councilor Scarpelli's B paper as amended by Councilors Bears and Marks and then seconded by Councilor Knight.

714
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:13,546
Okay.

715
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:15,547
Council Bears.

716
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:16,977
Yes.

717
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:18,357
Councilor Knight.

718
00:49:19,778 --> 00:49:20,018
Yes.

719
00:49:20,718 --> 00:49:23,698
I'm sorry, I should have called President Falco next, so President Falco.

720
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:24,359
Yes.

721
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:25,979
Councilor Marks.

722
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:26,999
Yes.

723
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:28,099
Councilor Morrell.

724
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:28,899
Yes.

725
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,220
Councilor Scarpelli.

726
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:30,780
Yes.

727
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,540
Vice President Caravaglia.

728
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:33,540
Yes.

729
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:36,641
Seven in the affirmative motion passes.

730
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:41,522
On the original motion by President Falco, seconded by

731
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:43,259
Second.

732
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:44,860
Seconded by Councilor Ney.

733
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,960
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

734
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:58,706
Mr. President, Mr. President, just if we could, you know, now from what I recall, and I think other Councils offered this, a crosswalk at the intersection of Salem and Everett

735
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:00,316
street.

736
00:50:00,356 --> 00:50:03,618
We've been asking for that for probably close to two years now.

737
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:09,603
Another dangerous area on Salem Street, and a crosswalk is warranted in that area as well.

738
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:19,190
So if I can further amend it, that a crosswalk once again be placed at the intersection of Salem and Everett Street.

739
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,332
And Council Member Marks, is that an amendment?

740
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,754
Is that a C paper or is that an amendment to the main paper?

741
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,655
That's an amendment to the amendment to the amendment.

742
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:27,436
All right, got it.

743
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:30,614
I actually have that one.

744
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:38,740
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

745
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:39,400
Yes.

746
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:42,263
Yes.

747
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:42,383
Yes.

748
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:42,643
Yes.

749
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:43,383
Yes.

750
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:43,964
Yes.

751
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:44,124
Yes.

752
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:44,364
Yes.

753
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:44,684
Yes.

754
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:45,525
Yes.

755
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:58,822
Thank you.

756
00:50:58,842 --> 00:51:01,505
Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

757
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:02,906
Reports of committees.

758
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:16,118
2-0-3-2 on May 5th, 2020, we had a committee, the whole meeting, the purpose of the meeting was to receive an update from the administration regarding the 2020 census.

759
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,260
That night we were joined by

760
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:21,569
Neil Osborne from the administration.

761
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:28,931
He actually brought with him a representative from the census, Ms.

762
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:29,451
Marquis.

763
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:32,471
They talked a little bit about the census.

764
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:37,053
They talked about the response rate in our city so far.

765
00:51:37,913 --> 00:51:40,534
For Massachusetts, 59.1% of the households responded.

766
00:51:40,654 --> 00:51:41,574
And in Medford, it was 62.4%.

767
00:51:46,756 --> 00:51:59,389
And we talked about the census, what they were doing to the process they go through to get people to respond and how they have people go out and actually knock on the door if they don't respond by by mail.

768
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,041
And Ms.

769
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:11,505
Marquis said that October 31st is the last date to respond as of now.

770
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,888
So that was the brief summary of the committee report for May 5th, 2020.

771
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:20,651
Is there a motion to approve?

772
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:21,111
Motion to accept.

773
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,632
Motion to accept.

774
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:27,916
On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly to accept the committee report seconded by Councilor Marks.

775
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:29,677
Clerk Herdiby, please call the roll.

776
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:31,778
Councilor Behrs.

777
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:32,559
Yes.

778
00:52:35,763 --> 00:52:36,603
Vice President Carabiello.

779
00:52:36,884 --> 00:52:37,104
Yes.

780
00:52:38,585 --> 00:52:39,025
Councilor Knight.

781
00:52:39,545 --> 00:52:39,805
Yes.

782
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:40,686
Councilor Marks.

783
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:41,566
Yes.

784
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:42,507
Councilor Morrell.

785
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:43,307
Yes.

786
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,408
Councilor Scarpelli.

787
00:52:44,748 --> 00:52:44,968
Yes.

788
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:46,049
President Falco.

789
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:48,990
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

790
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:50,872
Mr. President, move suspension of the rules.

791
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:54,654
On the motion, Councilor Marks to suspend the rules, seconded by.

792
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:57,987
Vice President Cabello, Councilor Marks.

793
00:52:58,767 --> 00:52:59,788
Thank you, Mr. President.

794
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:06,814
I have two condolences and a congratulatory statement I'd like to make.

795
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:09,656
If we can take paper 20-316.

796
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,723
which is the loan order on the city sidewalks.

797
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:18,407
It's up for a third reading today, Mr. President.

798
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:20,349
Okay.

799
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:24,273
So why don't we take the loan order first, Councilor Marks, if that's okay?

800
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:24,893
That's great.

801
00:53:25,274 --> 00:53:26,195
I got a roll call.

802
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:31,014
Yes, okay, so this would be the third reading of the loan order for the city side.

803
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,496
I can take the roll call on the motion to suspend first.

804
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:35,298
Okay, the motion is suspended.

805
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:36,839
There were several items in there.

806
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,323
That can all be one motion, but I have to call the roll on it.

807
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:41,164
Absolutely.

808
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,746
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll to suspend the rules.

809
00:53:44,186 --> 00:53:44,827
Councilor Behrs.

810
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,008
Yes.

811
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:47,490
Vice President Caravaglia.

812
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:47,950
Yes.

813
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:49,632
Councilor Knight.

814
00:53:50,422 --> 00:53:50,663
Yes.

815
00:53:51,063 --> 00:53:51,644
Councilor Marks.

816
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:52,486
Yes.

817
00:53:52,806 --> 00:53:53,447
Councilor Morrell.

818
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:54,289
Yes.

819
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:55,371
Councilor Scarpelli.

820
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:55,872

00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:57,474
Yes.

823
00:53:57,494 --> 00:53:59,598
7-8 permanent, zero to the negative.

824
00:53:59,618 --> 00:54:00,399
The motion passes.

825
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,381
The rules are suspended.

826
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:02,543
Councilor Marks.

827
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,761
Thank you, Mr. President.

828
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:09,285
If we can take paper 20-316 up for a third reading tonight.

829
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:11,547
It's the loan order on the city sidewalks.

830
00:54:11,888 --> 00:54:12,968
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

831
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:15,751
Councilor Marks is correct.

832
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:19,014
This is 20-316, loan order for the city sidewalks.

833
00:54:19,634 --> 00:54:23,538
The administration was before us a few weeks ago to present on this matter.

834
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:26,400
It had its first reading on April 28th, 2020.

00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,692
and then it was advertised in the Metro Transcript on May 7th, 2020.

836
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:36,575
Tonight it is eligible for its third reading May 19th, 2020.

837
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:39,096
On the motion of Council of Marks.

00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:40,137

Yes.

843
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:51,408

854
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:00,850
Yes.

855
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:03,290
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

856
00:55:03,891 --> 00:55:07,872
While we're under suspension, Councilor Marks, I believe you had a congratulatory resolution.

857
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,532
I do, Mr. President.

858
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:12,953
Irene, a longtime Method resident, Irene Fleming,

859
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:20,970
is turning 80 years young, Mr. President, and is a very active and vibrant member of our community.

860
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:27,514
And I want to wish her a happy 80th birthday and many, many more to come, Mr. President.

861
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:29,255
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

862
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:29,616
Second.

863
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:35,720
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, I believe.

864
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:36,901
Correct.

865
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:38,562
Councilor Knight.

866
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:40,183
Clerk Arnabis, please call the roll.

867
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:41,379

Yes.

869
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,581
Vice President Caravaglia?

870
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:44,162
Yes.

871
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:45,003
Councilor Knight?

872
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:45,603
Yes.

Councilor Marks?

874
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:47,385
Yes.

875
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:48,246
Councilor Morrell?

876
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:49,067
Yes.

877
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:50,108
Councilor Scarpelli?

878
00:55:50,428 --> 00:55:50,669
Yes.

879
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:51,730
Vice President Falco?

880
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,874
Yes, seven in favor, zero in the negative, the motion passes, happy birthday.

881
00:55:56,795 --> 00:55:57,356
Councilor Marks?

882
00:55:58,248 --> 00:55:59,309
Thank you, Mr. President.

883
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:02,912
I have, unfortunately, two condolences, Mr. President.

884
00:56:02,952 --> 00:56:06,995
We lost two great Method residents recently, Marie DeBenedetto.

885
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:17,803
She is the mother-in-law of former school committee member, Erin DeBenedetto, and her husband, Joe, who we all know, she passed away recently.

886
00:56:17,823 --> 00:56:27,490
A loving wife, mother, grandmother, love to cook, very involved with the family, and she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

887
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,100
Thank you, council members.

888
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:36,142
Would you like to read just, we'll do one at a time.

889
00:56:36,942 --> 00:56:39,023
On the motion of council Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight.

890
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,203
Clerk, please call the roll.

891
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,183
Councilor Behrs.

892
00:56:41,884 --> 00:56:42,124
Yes.

893
00:56:42,564 --> 00:56:43,504
Vice President Caravaglio.

894
00:56:43,724 --> 00:56:43,944
Yes.

895
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:44,845
Councilor Knight.

896
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:45,485
Yes.

897
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:46,385
Councilor Marks.

898
00:56:46,965 --> 00:56:47,285
Yes.

899
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:48,146
Councilor Morrell.

900
00:56:48,646 --> 00:56:48,886
Yes.

901
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,066
Councilor Scarpelli.

902
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:50,506
Yes.

903
00:56:50,846 --> 00:56:51,607
President Falco.

904
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:52,327
Yes.

905
00:56:53,387 --> 00:56:55,788
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

906
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:02,348
Councilor Marks, do you want to tell us a second condolence resolution?

907
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:04,490
Thank you, Mr. President.

908
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,374
We also lost Amelia Prestigiovanni, Mr. President.

909
00:57:10,195 --> 00:57:12,517
If anyone is familiar with the Prestigiovannis,

910
00:57:13,257 --> 00:57:21,620
John and Amelia were a staple in this community for many years, involved in many civic activities, very active in the community.

911
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,541
Amelia was very active in the food pantry at St.

912
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:35,304
Francis Church, and also served 30 years in the food service, Mr. President, for the Meffitt Public Schools.

913
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:42,026
So she had a love of family as well, a loving wife, mother,

914
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:52,154
Grandmother, um, and she will be sorely missed anytime you saw them together in the city It was always amelia and john, mr. President no matter where you saw them.

915
00:57:52,574 --> 00:57:57,578
They were a loving couple for many decades And uh, she will be sorely missed.

916
00:57:57,598 --> 00:57:58,239
Mr. President.

917
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:08,908
I'd like to also if I could dedicate this meeting After amelia and marie de benedetto, mr. President and their names Thank you very much councillor marx

918
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:23,193
I was hoping to put this on next week's resolution agenda but I appreciate bringing that stuff tonight.

919
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:26,578
Amelia was a very special person I had the privilege of.

920
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:35,111
being her son's soccer coach in high school and knowing her in that level, then working together at the Osgoode School.

921
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:37,831
She's exactly what Medford's all about.

922
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:45,413
A person that worked very hard in her own home and then made sure she gave back to the community any way she could.

923
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:46,994
And what her and John did,

924
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:49,294
has passed that on to her children.

925
00:58:49,955 --> 00:58:52,295
And you see John Jr.

926
00:58:52,355 --> 00:59:01,677
walking around working in the city and volunteering his time and doing whatever he can do for the kids in the soccer community, especially, but for all kids.

927
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:04,117
So it's a sad day.

928
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:07,818
I know that John Sr.

929
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,219
has been fighting some issues, and he's pulling through.

930
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:14,260
Thank God with that.

931
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,521
But, you know, Amelia was a little bit of a shock.

932
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:22,265
I think that it was a quick illness and, you know, it still hurts the same.

933
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:27,409
So she's a great person, someone that I'll miss seeing around the basketball game.

934
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:32,032
She was a devoted grandmother that didn't miss anything and made sure that she represented

935
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:34,834
her family and the city of Medford well.

936
00:59:34,874 --> 00:59:43,036
So I send my condolences and I know that the Harris Park community will definitely miss Amelia Prestigiovanni for sure.

937
00:59:43,076 --> 00:59:44,197
So God bless her.

938
00:59:44,257 --> 00:59:44,577
Thank you.

939
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,197
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

940
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:48,238
Councilor Piers and Councilor Knight.

941
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:50,379
Thank you, Mr. President.

942
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:57,751
Yeah, I mean, these are huge losses to the Medford community, both, and to the Mustang community and the Mustang band.

943
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:05,293
I actually, I think at one time, Kaitlin DiBenedetto, Anthony Prestigiovanni, and I were all in the Medford High band at the same time.

944
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:16,095
So, you know, I can remember Anthony's graduation party and the food and just that family, really just, I can still remember the food as Councilor Scarpelli is laughing at.

945
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:22,928
just great community leaders and raised the wonderful families who I had the benefit of being friends with.

946
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:26,389
So, sad loss and send my condolences.

947
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:28,349
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

948
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:28,970
Councilor Knight?

949
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:44,673
Yes, Mr. President, to John and Teresa and John and Jared, you know, her son-in-law and grandchildren, child, you know, it's just a tragic, tragic loss that happened so suddenly, you know,

950
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:51,955
regardless of Amelia's role in the community, the role that she played to her family was far, far, far more important.

951
01:00:52,515 --> 01:01:06,245
And, you know, having had the opportunity to go to school with Teresa and get to know her over the years through a relationship with her husband, John, I just want to say that they did a great job raising their children and she will be sorely missed.

952
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:08,447
So with that being said, my condolences to the family.

953
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:10,929
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

954
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:12,870
Councilor Carvillo, Vice President Carvillo.

955
01:01:13,094 --> 01:01:13,835
Thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:17,177
Again, I want to echo the sentiments of my fellow councilors.

957
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:20,920
I got to know Amelia through my work with her up and out of the St.

958
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,821
Francis Food Bank.

959
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:31,389
And again, people forget the work that the volunteerism of the people that work at St.

960
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:33,371
Francis, and she was one of them, her and her husband.

961
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:35,592
And again, you know, good family.

962
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:39,676
I mean, you can see her family around the community, good members of the community.

963
01:01:39,736 --> 01:01:42,298
Again, it's a loss of the community.

964
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:44,729
Thank you, Vice President Carvalho.

965
01:01:45,229 --> 01:01:47,690
And if I may echo the sentiments of my colleagues as well.

966
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:52,312
I did know Mrs. Prestigi Giovanni through the St.

967
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:54,133
Francis, just the St.

968
01:01:54,153 --> 01:01:54,974
Francis family.

969
01:01:55,374 --> 01:02:00,096
Just seeing her at church and seeing her, you know, helping out with the food bank.

970
01:02:00,156 --> 01:02:01,717
She was always very involved.

971
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:06,605
just like the entire family, all very involved in everything that happens in our city.

972
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:11,926
So I thought some prayers go out to the D. Benedetto and the President Giovanni family.

973
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:14,507
On the motion of Councilor Marks.

974

1013
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,920

1039
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:20,829
The purpose of the meeting was to receive an update from the administration regarding the fiscal year 2020 budget.

1040
01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:23,986
in fiscal year 2021 city budget.

1041
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:24,267
Let's see.

1042
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:41,662
All the councillors were in attendance along with Mayor Lungo Kern and also Mr. Roselli, who is a outside auditing consultant who works for the city.

1043
01:05:42,723 --> 01:05:51,852
He explained the situation that the city is in with a shortfall of about $8 million, assuming a local aid cut of 20%.

1044
01:05:53,239 --> 01:06:02,163
He explained that the motor vehicle excise, mail tax, rooms excise, and building permits are other major revenue components that make up the deficit.

1045
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:10,747
After speaking with the building commissioner, Mr. Roselli said that he's using a $2 million figure rather than a $4 million figure.

1046
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:15,829
He basically explained that the costs are already known.

1047
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:18,170
There's an $8 million, $2 million gap.

1048
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,110
That's an estimate.

1049
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:22,212
And the city will have more numbers within the next few weeks.

1050
01:06:23,252 --> 01:06:28,794
But Mr. Roselli did say that the information will get better faster as more information comes in.

1051
01:06:29,394 --> 01:06:33,915
But he believes that the $8.2 million gap is a worst case scenario.

1052
01:06:39,737 --> 01:06:43,758
And after asking Mr. Roselli when it will be an appropriate time to meet,

1053
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,415
again to get an update.

1054
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:46,616
He said in early June.

1055
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:52,920
So I will move forward and try to schedule that meeting with the administration so we can get an update, so we can get an update.

1056
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:55,702
Can I offer that in the way of a motion, Mr. President?

1057
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:57,584

1058
01:06:58,725 --> 01:07:00,026

01:07:00,586 --> 01:07:00,826
Yes.

1060
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:03,989
That we meet in the first week in June, if possible?

1061
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:05,470
Yes, that is fine.

1062
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:10,273
That's actually on the motion of Counselor Knight, seconded by... Second, Mr. President.

Scott, it's all right.

1080
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:49,995
And if I may, Mr. President, maybe we can extend an invitation to some of our colleagues on the school committee to come and attend this meeting after the first so that they can see what happens on the other side of the.

1081
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:55,734
when we're looking at each department here in the community and the competing needs that lay before us.

1082
01:07:55,894 --> 01:08:07,119
So I'd also offer them the form of a motion that we extend an invitation to the members of the school committee to appear as spectators at this public meeting so that they can hear it firsthand from the consultant at the same time we do.

1083

Have you received any follow-up from the SHOP if we've heard back from them?
