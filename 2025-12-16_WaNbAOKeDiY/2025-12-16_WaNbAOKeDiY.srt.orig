00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:29,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Quote, Ladder 2, Lieutenant Marino and Firefighter Patton made entry through the front entrance and encountered a heavy smoke condition.

40
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,219
[SPEAKER_22]: First floor hallway.

41
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:33,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Working fire ordered.

42
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:41,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Ladder 2 located the fire apartment, Unit 3, and made entry ahead of the attack line to conduct a primary search and locate the fire.

43
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,760
[SPEAKER_22]: Zero visibility inside the fire apartment.

44
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,544
[SPEAKER_22]: Ladder 2 located an adult male passed out in the living room.

45
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:51,048
[SPEAKER_22]: Occupant was removed and evaluated by Armstrong.

46
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:52,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Simultaneously, one occupant was

47
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:55,245
[SPEAKER_22]: showing from a third-floor fire balcony.

48
00:15:55,785 --> 00:16:02,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Ladder 2's driver, Firefighter McFeely, removed the occupant over a 28-foot ground ladder.

49
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:06,932
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, I commend this crew for their bravery, composure, and commitment to saving lives.

50
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:10,273
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations on the job well done.

51
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:12,135
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I...

52
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:25,991
[SPEAKER_22]: privilege of chatting with Lieutenant Marino before this.

53
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:32,996
[SPEAKER_22]: And he said that he didn't want to, didn't feel the need to come up here and talk publicly tonight about this.

54
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,638
[SPEAKER_22]: And I respect that.

55
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:42,304
[SPEAKER_22]: He did tell me that anybody from ladder two that was in his position would have done the exact same thing.

56
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:44,806
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have no doubt that that's true.

57
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Jobs like these are the type where you

58
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:52,240
[SPEAKER_22]: wait around for a long time until something goes wrong.

59
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when things do go wrong, you put everything on the line and you make them better and you end up saving lives.

60
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:04,466
[SPEAKER_22]: And we are so grateful to have all of you here on the job tonight to do that, to protect our city.

61
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:09,429
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm proud that you're part of the Medford Fire Department.

62
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,131
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm proud that you're there 24-7 protecting our city.

63
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,266
[SPEAKER_22]: Once again, just very thankful to have all of you here.

64
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:30,432
[SPEAKER_22]: After my colleagues speak, I would be honored if y'all could come up for a small photo op so that we can have some to remember the evening by.

65
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:31,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

66
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:33,774
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

67
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:35,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

68
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:37,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

69
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:42,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to all the brave men on Ladder 2.

70
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:54,167
[SPEAKER_17]: who are here with us tonight for joining us and everyone at Ladder 2 and the Medford Fire Department writ large for your bravery and heroism in this city.

71
00:17:55,588 --> 00:18:04,654
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Councilor Leming alluded to, not everyone would or could do this job.

72
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:06,215
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes

73
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:16,116
[SPEAKER_17]: immense sacrifice and bravery knowing that you're walking into a dangerous situation and saving lives.

74
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:25,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And our city and all of our residents are eternally grateful for you helping and saving valued members of our community.

75
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:37,238
[SPEAKER_17]: When you read the conditions in Chief Evans' reports, they really just illustrate how scary and dangerous the situation is or was.

76
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:47,347
[SPEAKER_17]: And for, you know, people to charge into that environment and be so brave and valiant in doing so truly means a lot.

77
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:53,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a really, really speaks highly to the character that we have in our fire department.

78
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:54,253
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you so much.

79
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:56,841
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

80
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:57,642
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan.

81
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:58,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

82
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,663
[SPEAKER_02]: What a pleasure to be here with you.

83
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:07,606
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that this is not the only story that the firefighters could tell.

84
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,307
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their job.

85
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:10,687
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their everyday lives.

86
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:19,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to recognize that every single firefighter has their own, they have their own life, they have their own family, they have their own home.

87
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:32,002
[SPEAKER_02]: things going on, and for each of those people to make this choice day to day, to be the kind of person that doesn't hesitate and that is willing to

88
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,497
[SPEAKER_02]: leap towards the flames instead of away.

89
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:47,386
[SPEAKER_02]: What an honor for us to have those kind of people in our community as individuals, to have that kind of team in our community doing the job that you do.

90
00:19:47,406 --> 00:20:00,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I so appreciate it, and I'm happy that we can take this moment to recognize you, not only for what we're reading here, but for the jobs, the many stories that we're not telling today that you do every day in your job.

91
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

92
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,358
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

93
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:05,218
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazaro.

94
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:07,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all so much for being here.

95
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:17,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I don't want to be repetitive, but I think it's really valuable to take a minute to express gratitude for

96
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:35,466
[SPEAKER_10]: The ongoing work that our public servants do in the city that we expect to continue always and don't always take the time to say, by the way, this is going on all the time without us paying attention.

97
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:47,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really, really, really rely on you all showing up every day and doing things far beyond what most people

98
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:51,540
[SPEAKER_10]: risk, and we're very grateful.

99
00:20:52,681 --> 00:21:01,770
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a well-deserved commendation, and grateful to have all of you here and to celebrate your accomplishments.

100
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

101
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,673
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Council Lizara.

102
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:05,574
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins.

103
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:09,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

104
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:20,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to echo the words of my colleagues and extend my most heartfelt gratitude, especially to Lieutenant Marino, Firefighter McFeely, and Patton, and to the entire crew.

105
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:31,794
[SPEAKER_08]: We are so lucky that we can rest easy with the knowledge that if this had happened when any other team happened to be on shift, you would have reacted with the same professionalism and commitment and bravery.

106
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,075
[SPEAKER_08]: We are so grateful.

107
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:44,103
[SPEAKER_08]: for the life that you saved that night, and thank you for your incredibly committed, brave stewardship of our city every single day.

108
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:53,249
[SPEAKER_08]: We are very, very lucky to have you, and thank you for being here with us to recognize just this one instance of heroism in a career that I'm sure is full of them for all of you.

109
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:53,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

110
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:56,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

111
00:21:56,622 --> 00:22:08,587
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, on behalf of the council and as the president, I want to thank all of you for serving our city, keeping us safe and saving lives, not just in this incident, but all the time.

112
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,528
[SPEAKER_26]: We do have a citation here to present.

113
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,429
[SPEAKER_26]: I see we have a couple of family members here tonight.

114
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:19,052
[SPEAKER_26]: If you'd like to come up, we can, you know, Councilor Lemming can present this to you.

115
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:19,933
[SPEAKER_26]: We can take a photo.

116
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:21,355
[SPEAKER_26]: Colleagues are welcome.

117
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:28,042
[SPEAKER_26]: But on behalf of all of us, we really just thank you so much for this and for everything you do for our community.

118
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,161
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by?

119
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,063
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

120
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:02,905
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

121
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:04,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed?

122
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:04,987
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

123
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:06,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you again. 25187.

124
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:17,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Resolution to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the West Medford Community Center.

125
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:27,067
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we celebrate the West Medford Community Center on its 90th anniversary and its role as a cornerstone of resilience, service, and community building for our city.

126
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:34,652
[SPEAKER_26]: The WMCC is at the heart of Medford's past, present, and future, and we honor and celebrate every person who has built this incredible legacy and history.

127
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,133
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Sang.

128
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:37,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

129
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:47,994
[SPEAKER_17]: The West Medford Community Center is a home for so many of our residents here in Medford.

130
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:59,681
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a place for West Medford residents and our historically black neighborhood in West Medford to get together, make friends, have a good time.

131
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:03,123
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a place for them to get involved civically for

132
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:06,533
[SPEAKER_17]: folks like us to be able to meet people where they're at.

133
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:18,598
[SPEAKER_17]: And the West Medford Community Center is, in my experience as a counselor and as a candidate in Medford, one of the happiest places in the city.

134
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:38,565
[SPEAKER_17]: From the music events, the poetry readings, the markets of, you know, small business people and artists and artisans in the city, it's just a very radiant spot in our community that we should celebrate every single day.

135
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:44,427
[SPEAKER_17]: And the 90th anniversary is an amazing day to celebrate.

136
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,008
[SPEAKER_17]: One last note on this is

137
00:25:50,026 --> 00:26:09,699
[SPEAKER_17]: just how important the West Medford Community Center has been in helping us preserve our history as a city and helping us connect to our roots and connecting us to our history of Black Medfordians who for so long have gone forgotten.

138
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:18,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And their narratives, their stories haven't been told by the city, by people researching the city.

139
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:27,386
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it really serves as a repository of history as well for our community and a resource for all of us to learn more about and tap into.

140
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,627
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councillor Tsang.

141
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:31,808
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Lazaro.

142
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:36,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for bringing this forward, Councilor Seng.

143
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

144
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,452
[SPEAKER_10]: My children, Evan and Sally, are in third and fifth grade.

145
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:42,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Reverse that.

146
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Evan's in fifth, Sally's in third.

147
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:49,336
[SPEAKER_10]: They just started this year at the West Medford Community Center for afterschool.

148
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:59,861
[SPEAKER_10]: The West Medford Community Center didn't used to offer an afterschool program for third graders, but they opened it up because they heard this year in the community that there was a big gap.

149
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:04,459
[SPEAKER_10]: where there weren't enough programs for third graders.

150
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:18,341
[SPEAKER_10]: This community center being intrinsically part of the Medford community and understanding when there's a service that is needed in the city, they offered that service.

151
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:28,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are a ton of kids who had aged out of one program, aged out of another program, and suddenly they needed something, and this program

152
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:35,076
[SPEAKER_10]: appeared for them because that's what the West Bedford Community Center is for.

153
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:41,139
[SPEAKER_10]: They show up as a beacon when they're needed.

154
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they've always been that way.

155
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:45,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot believe they've been open for 90 years.

156
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,062
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

157
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm delighted.

158
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:54,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to tell one other story, which is that I attended the ribbon cutting or the groundbreaking ceremony for

159
00:27:54,726 --> 00:28:08,417
[SPEAKER_10]: when they finally were able to start construction of a path from the backyard of the West Medford Community Center into Duggar Park, where the basketball courts are and the river.

160
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:19,206
[SPEAKER_10]: It took 10 years of lobbying and rabble-rousing at the state level because that road

161
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And that park is controlled by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

162
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:39,693
[SPEAKER_10]: And if anybody has ever tried to get a parks department that is in control of all these parks all over the whole state to do something that's relatively small for one town, one community center, it's very challenging.

163
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,433
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't seem like that big a deal.

164
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:45,835
[SPEAKER_10]: DCR has had their commissioners turn over every year for a long time.

165
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:46,996
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like a,

166
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:50,097
[SPEAKER_10]: defense against the dark arts teacher situation.

167
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:52,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really understand it, but it's really hard to make things happen there.

168
00:28:53,378 --> 00:29:00,721
[SPEAKER_10]: But the commitment of this group of people has been unmatched anywhere else that I've seen.

169
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:12,446
[SPEAKER_10]: The people of the West Bedford Community Center are devoted to the city and devoted to their morals and

170
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:30,986
[SPEAKER_10]: doing right by the people they serve, and I'm inspired by the work that's been accomplished there, and I'm grateful to be part of a community that this community center is intrinsically sort of the backbone of.

171
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,188
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for putting this forward.

172
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:39,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very excited to celebrate it, very excited to pick my kids up there from after school all the time and watch them, you know,

173
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:43,517
[SPEAKER_10]: playing and doing crafts and, you know, having a great time.

174
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

175
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,623
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councillor Lozaro.

176
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:48,284
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Callahan.

177
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:49,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

178
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:53,691
[SPEAKER_02]: The West Bedford Community Centre really

179
00:29:54,997 --> 00:29:56,558
[SPEAKER_02]: does community right.

180
00:29:57,439 --> 00:30:14,171
[SPEAKER_02]: They are dedicated to serving, in part, the historic black community here in Medford, but they are also not exclusive, and so they also serve the wider West Medford community.

181
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:19,374
[SPEAKER_02]: They serve both of those communities incredibly well, providing art and music and, you know,

182
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,758
[SPEAKER_02]: activities and so many different events.

183
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:32,059
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a seniors group and they have so many different groups.

184
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:37,080
[SPEAKER_02]: They really listen to what people want and what people need.

185
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They provide lunches for like $2 or something for folks.

186
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:46,002
[SPEAKER_02]: They just do so many wonderful services.

187
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:49,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have thought a lot about how can we

188
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:58,846
[SPEAKER_02]: create more of these in Medford that do similar things that serve multiple different communities at the same time so well.

189
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:09,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm incredibly grateful for all of the folks who work together and put together their programming and really, really proud to live in a city where they do such great work.

190
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:12,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

191
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lemming.

192
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,232
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been to a couple of those $2 lunches that my colleague just mentioned.

193
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:24,753
[SPEAKER_22]: They're really wonderful events to go to.

194
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:42,239
[SPEAKER_22]: It's one of the best ways that I could think of to meet your neighbors, which I've done on a couple of Thursdays, Thursday around 12 o'clock over the last couple of months.

195
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:52,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Something about building community that often isn't emphasized is that it takes a lot of effort to do that.

196
00:31:53,451 --> 00:32:01,841
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes a group of people constantly working to sustain the community, to bring new life into it, to resolve conflicts.

197
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:19,899
[SPEAKER_22]: And the West Medford Community Center works so well because there are always people there who are working so hard to make that happen, to put on events, to organize those lunches, to fundraise when funding is constantly being cut.

198
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,064
[SPEAKER_22]: And they executed so impressively

199
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:36,792
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, they're one of the only handful of organizations around the city that I've literally never heard anybody say anything bad about them.

200
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:46,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Like the feedback on my own experiences with the West Medford Community Center have always been completely 100% positive.

201
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:54,963
[SPEAKER_22]: And not only that, but they make, not only do they build community, but they put a lot of effort into

202
00:32:56,091 --> 00:33:02,134
[SPEAKER_22]: educating the community about Medford's history, about national history, about the history of civil rights.

203
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:05,736
[SPEAKER_22]: And they put a lot of effort into keeping that memory going.

204
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:10,619
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you haven't been to one of their events, I would highly recommend going.

205
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:15,342
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you haven't been to one of their afternoon lunches, I would also suggest that as well.

206
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:15,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

207
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you to my colleagues.

208
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,462
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Sang for joining me on this resolution.

209
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:30,287
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, the West Bedford Community Center, I went to after school there in elementary school and have been going back since.

210
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:36,490
[SPEAKER_26]: And it really serves kids, adults, elders in all aspects.

211
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,551
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a really wonderful, wonderful part of our community.

212
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:43,594
[SPEAKER_26]: They had a gala over the weekend to celebrate their 90th anniversary.

213
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,075
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's part of why we're

214
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,636
[SPEAKER_26]: We're putting this on the agenda.

215
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,317
[SPEAKER_26]: I wanna thank Lisa Crossman, Terry Carter.

216
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:53,019
[SPEAKER_26]: And if I go through any more names, the list will be too long.

217
00:33:53,139 --> 00:34:07,046
[SPEAKER_26]: So both of them for their work for the West Bedford Community Center, representing so many others who are working on their projects every day, and also who have worked on them for 90 years.

218
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,508
[SPEAKER_26]: Got a new building, they got a new path.

219
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:32,108
[SPEAKER_26]: Mississippi River Road's improved, and I think it really goes to show its central place, not just in events and community, but also it's a physical representation of all of the work that so many people have put into it, both the building and now the path to Duggar Park and their own tennis courts.

220
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:36,230
[SPEAKER_26]: So next step is more improvements to Duggar Park, I think.

221
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:46,648
[SPEAKER_26]: But West Benford Community Center is just really wonderful and I'm going to get this citation over to Lisa and Terry and everyone else over there in due course.

222
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:53,931
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a motion on the motion to approve by Councilor Sang seconded by Councilors are all those in favor.

223
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,052
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed.

224
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:55,732
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

225
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:03,666
[SPEAKER_26]: 25188 offered by President Behrs and Councilor Seng, resolution to commend Vice President Collins for her outstanding service.

226
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:10,331
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend Vice President Collins for her outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2022 to 2026.

227
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:12,573
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Seng.

228
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:26,403
[SPEAKER_17]: This certainly will not be said with the eloquence it deserves, but Vice President Collins has been one of my best friends that I've ever made.

229
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:33,111
[SPEAKER_17]: She's definitely a bestie here on the city council for me.

230
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:37,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And in so many different ways, I look up to her.

231
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:56,726
[SPEAKER_17]: In her position as a counselor, I was just stunned by Councilor Collins' work ethic and how much time she dedicates to our city, getting really nitty gritty into really technical details of many ordinances.

232
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:08,098
[SPEAKER_17]: And the mark that those ordinances will leave on the city will create benefits for all of our residents for a really long time to come.

233
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:19,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Her steadfast work on zoning, shepherding that through, despite its many challenges and difficulties, is no easy feat.

234
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:24,887
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no feat that any regular councilor in any city in Massachusetts has done.

235
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:30,530
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really is a testament to that work ethic that I was talking about.

236
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I admire so much how Councilor Collins really

237
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:54,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Is just so principled in the work that she does for our city and her approach to thinking about really complex problems and in fighting every day and certainly at every meeting here for the everyday resident who for far too long didn't have their voices heard.

238
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,548
[SPEAKER_17]: who didn't feel represented on the city council.

239
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:01,189
[SPEAKER_17]: And that voice has made such an impact.

240
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,730
[SPEAKER_17]: And residents see it, they hear it.

241
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:07,552
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really, something I think about is just.

242
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:16,548
[SPEAKER_17]: when folks found out, when we found out that you weren't running again, just the outpouring of love that residents showed to you.

243
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:21,391
[SPEAKER_17]: I was reading through all the comments, and I was like, wow, I really couldn't have said it better.

244
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:25,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Kit deserves all the praise that she's getting.

245
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:28,975
[SPEAKER_17]: But more importantly, on a personal level,

246
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Collins is just someone I've been able to turn to in really difficult moments, when this job gets really tough.

247
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:53,452
[SPEAKER_17]: She's always a calm presence to talk to, to bounce ideas off of, to get me back in a place to pick up the pieces and move forward, and to think about, to help me strategize about how to do that and how to move forward.

248
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,160
[SPEAKER_17]: On top of that, she does it with a smile.

249
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:09,273
[SPEAKER_17]: She does it with humor, a really funny, dry humor that we'll lose here on the city council, that we will surely come to miss.

250
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:14,280
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just, you know, I think it

251
00:38:15,171 --> 00:38:18,373
[SPEAKER_17]: It means a lot to me, especially since we got elected together.

252
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:21,094
[SPEAKER_17]: We came onto the city council together.

253
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:28,897
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been through the trenches together, both on the campaign and as councillors.

254
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:35,780
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was going through my phone and looking at old photos, and it was just really emotional for me.

255
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:39,482
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll leave it there so I don't hog up too much time.

256
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:43,624
[SPEAKER_17]: But you certainly deserve all the love that I suspect

257
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,197
[SPEAKER_17]: other counselors will join me in sharing tonight.

258
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:49,919
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

259
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:50,659
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lemming.

260
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:54,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do you have to go?

261
00:38:54,061 --> 00:39:02,567
[SPEAKER_22]: I could repeat a lot of what Councilor Seng just said.

262
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:03,968
[SPEAKER_22]: We could talk about

263
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:10,898
[SPEAKER_22]: how Council Vice President Collins led us through an extremely difficult zoning process.

264
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:15,899
[SPEAKER_22]: We could talk about the grace with which she did that.

265
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:31,223
[SPEAKER_22]: We could talk about her work ethic and how she has put so much into it behind the scenes, how she put so much into her campaigns, how much effort she put into connecting with residents, how much she

266
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:41,563
[SPEAKER_22]: worked to elevate the status of renters and lower income people around Medford and give them a voice on council.

267
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:45,265
[SPEAKER_22]: We could talk about that, but we don't have to talk about that.

268
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:57,653
[SPEAKER_22]: The thing about Council Vice President Collins that I, the quality that I think about the most is the grace and

269
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:08,855
[SPEAKER_22]: respect that she always manages to give during meetings and interpersonally.

270
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:15,980
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a quality that I've tried and often failed to emulate, but I do try.

271
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,023
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's gotten to the point where initially I

272
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,543
[SPEAKER_22]: admired it.

273
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:40,997
[SPEAKER_22]: And now after I see how difficult this job is and how she's still managed after four years to consistently have this attitude and speak eloquently during council meetings, it's gotten to the point where it confuses me how

274
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:45,899
[SPEAKER_22]: an individual is able to do that after all this time.

275
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:52,081
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm going to try, but like I do try to learn from that example.

276
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:56,322
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, I don't think I'll reach those heights.

277
00:40:57,843 --> 00:41:00,044
[SPEAKER_22]: All I can say is that we'll miss you.

278
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:04,065
[SPEAKER_22]: You put so much work into serving this city.

279
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:05,425
[SPEAKER_22]: You did such a good job.

280
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,073
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be losing a lot when you step down.

281
00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:22,418
[SPEAKER_22]: But thank you very much from myself, from my colleagues, and from everybody in Medford for the work that you've put in.

282
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

283
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:26,261
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan.

284
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:32,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I will try to be brief.

285
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:39,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I will sorely miss Council Vice President Collins.

286
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:50,238
[SPEAKER_02]: We lived a block apart and we were there if we needed each other to start each other's cars and do things like that.

287
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am,

288
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:58,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I agree with all the things that my fellow councilor said.

289
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:06,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a number of photos of Councilor Collins from this perspective right here last time we were in the chambers.

290
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:22,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purpose is that I'm going to print them physically and I'm going to keep them in my drawer and then I will pull them out during each council meeting hopefully to remind me to do what Councilor Collins is so good at doing which

291
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:40,430
[SPEAKER_02]: before speaking her mind, to thank everyone, to thank the people who put forward the resolution, to thank the people who have shown up to speak, to thank the staff members who helped in writing the ordinance, to thank everyone who was involved.

292
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:43,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes such a difference.

293
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:52,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that, again, like Councilor Lemming, I'm going to make it my best effort to do that, and I will probably not reach those heights.

294
00:42:55,027 --> 00:43:03,390
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is one of the many things that I will remember about Councilor Collins and she will be sorely missed.

295
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:06,792
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

296
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:07,572
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazaro.

297
00:43:09,693 --> 00:43:10,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

298
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:14,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to write down what I'm going to say because I'm going to try not to cry.

299
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:27,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins is an incredible city councilor but also an incredible friend and her support has been so enduring and permeated so many of my days over this term that I have a hard time putting it into words.

300
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:33,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Her steady assurance has kept me from losing my mind so many times.

301
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,019
[SPEAKER_10]: How does one say thank you for that?

302
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:41,159
[SPEAKER_10]: for one's own sanity or even for the further clarification of one's own self.

303
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you just say, thank you.

304
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:53,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Strong bonds are forged in emotional, stressful environments, places where we're forced to reckon with our deepest fears and stand up for our most strongly held beliefs.

305
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:56,067
[SPEAKER_10]: When this term challenged us, I think we

306
00:43:56,668 --> 00:44:01,810
[SPEAKER_10]: helped each other keep our feet firmly on the ground to go back to our values and let them guide us.

307
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:10,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I was ever tempted to lose my way, Vice President Collins was able to bring me back, which was incredibly valuable, and I hope I was sometimes able to do the same.

308
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,595
[SPEAKER_10]: You give wonderful advice.

309
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,937
[SPEAKER_10]: You are driven by a firm moral center, and you have an incomparable ability

310
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:24,617
[SPEAKER_10]: to see the forest for the trees in every scenario.

311
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so happy to have gotten to know you this well.

312
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:28,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel so lucky.

313
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,484
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a gift and a privilege to know you.

314
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:39,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And just one more thing that I didn't write down, which is that Kit is so empathetic that

315
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:53,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to, if I ever got mean emails or comments, and I would tell her about them, she would tell me, oh, that person is probably going through something.

316
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,432
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would be like, yeah, that's a really good point.

317
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:58,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I started doing that.

318
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:06,497
[SPEAKER_10]: When other people would tell me similar stories, I would be like, yeah, that person's really got a lot of personal stuff going on.

319
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:09,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I was like, oh, no, I've started

320
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:13,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Kit got to me.

321
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:20,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Her empathy became part of my way of going about seeing the world.

322
00:45:21,627 --> 00:45:30,153
[SPEAKER_10]: She's so loving and empathetic, and the way that she views the world influences the people around her.

323
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:32,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's a wonderful way to govern.

324
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:38,999
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a great way to run a city, and you've made all of us better.

325
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,100
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

326
00:45:43,183 --> 00:45:44,224
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Lozaro.

327
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:49,846
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it goes without saying from what everyone else just said, we're in big trouble.

328
00:45:52,988 --> 00:45:57,970
[SPEAKER_26]: It seems that our balance and our calm may be leaving us.

329
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:06,414
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're all gonna have to work really hard to ask ourselves what would Kit Collins do.

330
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,376
[SPEAKER_26]: And I really echo

331
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:13,097
[SPEAKER_26]: the comments of my fellow colleagues.

332
00:46:13,157 --> 00:46:22,586
[SPEAKER_26]: I think kids' principled, detail-oriented, determined, tough leadership has gotten this council through some hard meetings.

333
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:26,490
[SPEAKER_26]: It's gotten good policy passed, good ordinances passed.

334
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:31,595
[SPEAKER_26]: It's gotten all of us, made all of us better.

335
00:46:33,683 --> 00:46:39,209
[SPEAKER_26]: hard discussions that have made our city better, that has made real progress for our community.

336
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:51,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Investing in our schools, passing surveillance privacy protections for our community, updating so many ordinances that I couldn't possibly list them.

337
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,803
[SPEAKER_26]: I think there's two more on the agenda tonight.

338
00:46:54,903 --> 00:47:00,244
[SPEAKER_26]: to about quality of life, keeping our communities, our different neighborhoods cleaner and safer.

339
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:05,026
[SPEAKER_26]: And that product of work is so deeply impressive.

340
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:08,426
[SPEAKER_26]: This council, this term has done a lot.

341
00:47:08,786 --> 00:47:12,227
[SPEAKER_26]: Kit has been at the head of that, at the helm of so much of that.

342
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:21,990
[SPEAKER_26]: We worked on a very big, difficult project with our zoning updates project where Kit essentially was a volunteer

343
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:31,196
[SPEAKER_26]: Web editor, communications director, meeting coordinator, and you know, I think one of the lessons we learn from that is.

344
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:39,138
[SPEAKER_26]: We shouldn't, even though Kit did it, it's probably not something we should ask any one person to do because there's probably no one else who could have done it.

345
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:58,112
[SPEAKER_26]: And that lesson is gonna inform our work for the next two years, where we're gonna finish out this really, really, really important project that Kit made so much headway and progress on and where we're already seeing really major improvements in the parts of our city where we were able to update our zoning.

346
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:02,122
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, that's the policy side of things.

347
00:48:02,222 --> 00:48:06,923
[SPEAKER_26]: Everyone else talked about their personal items, and here I am just listing ordinances.

348
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:17,845
[SPEAKER_26]: Which I think doesn't even begin to go into the fact that if I do start talking about the personal thing, I won't be able to keep chairing the meeting for a little while.

349
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:26,086
[SPEAKER_26]: So Kit has just been an amazing, amazing, amazing colleague and friend, and done amazing service to our city here in Medford.

350
00:48:26,526 --> 00:48:29,327
[SPEAKER_26]: And it won't be the same to be behind this rail without Kit.

351
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:31,268
[SPEAKER_26]: for the next term.

352
00:48:32,468 --> 00:48:42,294
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you, Vice President Collins, and good luck to the rest of us in trying to live up to what Kit has brought to this council and to our city.

353
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:47,137
[SPEAKER_26]: Would you like to say anything, Vice President Collins?

354
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:53,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

355
00:48:55,238 --> 00:49:02,363
[SPEAKER_08]: To say that I am touched and moved by the words of my colleagues truly does not even begin to encompass how I feel about it.

356
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:08,027
[SPEAKER_08]: If I don't seem...

357
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say that I'm gutted at the moment of my last meeting on this city council.

358
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:21,135
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only because I've been emotionally processing not working with you all and serving as your representative for several months now.

359
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:39,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It has been emotional for me to anticipate not having the kind of relationship with my colleagues that I've enjoyed for two years for some of you and four years for some of you and to continue.

360
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:47,057
[SPEAKER_08]: feeling so invested and in love with this community but to have that relationship change as well.

361
00:49:48,058 --> 00:49:54,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been very emotional for me because this has been an extremely meaningful, important, lucky time of my life.

362
00:49:56,965 --> 00:50:02,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank all of you and I'll include George in this even though he's sick today which is really sad because I was hoping to give him one last hug as well.

363
00:50:03,991 --> 00:50:06,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you for being such incredible colleagues.

364
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:08,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It is

365
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:23,902
[SPEAKER_08]: a really rare privilege to get to collaborate in such a meaningful way with people with whom I am so aligned in every way that matters.

366
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:40,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I think most people don't get the chance to experience that, and I have, and that is probably one of the best things that will happen to me in my entire life, is the chance to collaborate with you and other people in the community who share our goal of making Medford better for all of us

367
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:55,215
[SPEAKER_08]: and to be able to make real headway towards those goals in many ways, and to be able to collaborate with the public servants who have dedicated so much of their lives towards those goals, and sacrificed so much towards those goals, and to see what we have been able to do together.

368
00:50:55,235 --> 00:51:07,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a really rare and precious thing that we've gotten to do together, and I feel incredibly grateful that I have gotten to do it at all, and that I've gotten to do it with all of you.

369
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,517
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a lot that I would like to say about each of you individually as well.

370
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:17,659
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have a lot of other items on the agenda.

371
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:25,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to keep in touch and you'll keep hearing it from me anyway.

372
00:51:25,144 --> 00:51:26,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I would feel.

373
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:40,131
[SPEAKER_08]: much more bereft to be leaving my post if I didn't feel so incredibly heartened and confident by the incoming city council and school committee for that matter.

374
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:48,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the city of Medford is in incredibly good hands with the school committee and the city council that was elected in November.

375
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:53,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I am so excited to see where you will take the things that we have worked on together.

376
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:55,639
[SPEAKER_08]: especially zoning.

377
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:15,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that Medford is in incredibly good hands and for as long as you are working behind this rail and as long as we collectively are working for the betterment of this community, I'll be on your team, I'll be in your corner and I will be eager to

378
00:52:16,153 --> 00:52:24,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Be your cheerleader and support the things that we care about in Medford in any way that we can so Thank you to the community so much for entrusting me with this role.

379
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been an honor of a lifetime And thank you to thank you so much to all of my colleagues who I can call My friends and some of my my very favorite people Thank you

380
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,201
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

381
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:43,504
[SPEAKER_26]: We do have some folks who'd like to speak, offering you further praise.

382
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:49,068
[SPEAKER_26]: So we'll go, if anyone in the chamber would like to speak, you can approach the podium.

383
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:51,149
[SPEAKER_26]: And we also have a couple of folks on Zoom.

384
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,252
[SPEAKER_26]: Looks like we'll start on Zoom.

385
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:58,395
[SPEAKER_26]: Or maybe we'll start with Barry at the podium.

386
00:52:59,175 --> 00:52:59,756
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what we'll do.

387
00:52:59,956 --> 00:53:00,776
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll start with Barry.

388
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:04,479
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, Barry, and you'll have three minutes.

389
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,181
[SPEAKER_29]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

390
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:13,733
[SPEAKER_29]: And I have not thought through what I want to say.

391
00:53:14,193 --> 00:53:21,754
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to say that all the praise that has come from your side of the rail exists on this side of the rail as well.

392
00:53:22,094 --> 00:53:22,715
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel it.

393
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:27,375
[SPEAKER_29]: I hear it from other people that I work with in the community all the time.

394
00:53:27,855 --> 00:53:36,157
[SPEAKER_29]: People are always, in particular, referring to how incredible Kit is as a city councilor.

395
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:50,421
[SPEAKER_29]: your moral clarity, your steadfast unflappability, and your very deep kindness towards everybody, and your honesty.

396
00:53:50,781 --> 00:54:02,965
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, not only in my political life, but in my life generally, I've rarely come across people who I feel as much trust with as I feel with you.

397
00:54:03,948 --> 00:54:10,050
[SPEAKER_29]: And I thank you for your four years and wish you luck as you move on.

398
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,611
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Kit.

399
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,151
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

400
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:18,593
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go to Andrew Casanetti on Zoom.

00:54:20,954 --> 00:54:22,114
[SPEAKER_26]: Andy, I'm going to unmute you.

405
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:47,751
[SPEAKER_32]: Briefly, I would like, I would be amiss or remiss not to wish City Councilor Kit Collins happy trails to wherever you're going and shalom.

406
00:54:52,015 --> 00:54:53,176
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. Castanete.

407
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,740
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go to Mounir Jermaine.

408
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:59,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we'll go to the podium.

409
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:00,822
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

410
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,341
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go to Munir.

411
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:06,789
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

412
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:07,931
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

413
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:13,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Munir Germanis, 3 Summit Road.

414
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:41,136
[SPEAKER_23]: I had the pleasure of starting to meeting, well, maybe not personally at first, Kit, when she worked with a group of us, Palestinian Americans, to make the proper words and pass the ceasefire resolution a few years ago.

415
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:48,256
[SPEAKER_23]: as the only Jewish councillor on the city council.

416
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:50,177
[SPEAKER_23]: This was amazing.

417
00:55:52,078 --> 00:55:57,420
[SPEAKER_23]: We will forever be grateful for her support and for the

418
00:55:58,265 --> 00:56:09,570
[SPEAKER_23]: wonderful other ordinances that she has championed and passed and spoke about her integrity as I as everybody has said is incredible.

419
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:16,873
[SPEAKER_23]: So in passing I'd like to say may the road rise to meet you

420
00:56:17,992 --> 00:56:30,403
[SPEAKER_23]: May the wind be always at your back, and until the day we meet again, may you rest in the palm of God's hand.

421
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,565
[SPEAKER_23]: So we look forward to having you back again.

422
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:33,085
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

423
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:40,712
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we should have a little more music in these meetings.

424
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:42,520
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Munir.

425
00:56:43,221 --> 00:56:43,983
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go to the podium.

426
00:56:44,323 --> 00:56:46,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Jennifer, name and address for the record, please.

427
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:47,990
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

428
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:50,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

429
00:56:51,945 --> 00:57:04,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say, Kit, that it's been really illuminating for me to work with you and to see how you have led the city council as vice president.

430
00:57:06,277 --> 00:57:15,005
[SPEAKER_16]: You have this amazing way of demonstrating what true integrity in public office is.

431
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:22,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Integrity with grace and that's very rare and it's been a wonderful gift to the city and we'll miss you a lot.

432
00:57:24,355 --> 00:57:33,584
[SPEAKER_16]: And on another note, if I may just add this, since it's the last meeting of the year, you may have noticed that I've been knitting during the meetings.

433
00:57:36,182 --> 00:57:56,239
[SPEAKER_16]: I managed to knit seven hats, one for each counselor, and I know that maybe that you have, in a way of thanking all of you for your work in this session, and Kit, since you're leaving, you can choose the first hat, but into these hats is knit

434
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,375
[SPEAKER_16]: All kinds of things.

435
00:57:58,895 --> 00:58:04,577
[SPEAKER_16]: You can, you know, give them to your dog or your favorite uncle or maybe wear them, whatever.

436
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:26,162
[SPEAKER_16]: But know that whatever you do with them, crocheted or knit into each one, is discussions of the welcoming city ordinance, the values aligned local investments ordinance, the gender affirming care and reproductive health ordinance, an ordinance establishing a new human rights commission, which we may hear about later.

437
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:31,524
[SPEAKER_16]: The new charter that's now, that was on the ballot and passed.

438
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:38,386
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of this interspersed with discussions of zoning and so many other things.

439
00:58:39,046 --> 00:58:42,988
[SPEAKER_16]: So, these were all, almost all done during meetings.

440
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:45,029
[SPEAKER_16]: And here they are.

441
00:58:46,129 --> 00:58:47,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all.

442
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you especially Kit, and I wish you all the best.

443
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,111
[SPEAKER_16]: And thanks to each of you.

444
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:53,992
[SPEAKER_16]: We're really, really very lucky.

445
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:59,672
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm so proud to be a resident of Medford, a city that has such an incredible council.

446
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:03,013
[SPEAKER_16]: We're really unusual and lucky.

447
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:04,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all.

448
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:05,894
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Jennifer.

449
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:09,134
[SPEAKER_26]: Anna, would you grab the hats?

450
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:14,556
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

451
00:59:14,756 --> 00:59:17,096
[SPEAKER_26]: Next, we're going to go to Steve Schnapp.

452
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:19,677
[SPEAKER_26]: Steve, name and address for the record, please.

453
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:20,697
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

454
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:25,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Steve Schnapp, 36 Hillside Ave, Medford Square.

455
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:39,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to add to all the accolades for Kit is my great appreciation for her recognition that social change happens when people are involved.

456
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:49,477
[SPEAKER_12]: That it's not just our representative democracy that gets rules changed and policies implemented.

457
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:51,598
[SPEAKER_12]: It's people.

458
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:58,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Kit has always recognized that participatory democracy is important for our future.

459
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:03,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I greatly appreciate that, and I wish you the best, Kit.

460
01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:04,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

461
01:00:07,129 --> 01:00:07,910
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Steve.

462
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:10,970
[SPEAKER_26]: We will go back to the podium.

463
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,191
[SPEAKER_26]: Micah, name and address for the record, please.

464
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:14,111
[SPEAKER_26]: You'll have three minutes.

465
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:14,951
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

466
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:16,292
[SPEAKER_06]: 499 Main Street, Micah Kesselman.

467
01:00:18,536 --> 01:00:23,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of great things have been said, Kit, and I echo all of them, certainly.

468
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:33,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you for being a critical ally and champion of so many things that have been so deeply important to this community over the years.

469
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:41,194
[SPEAKER_06]: And on a more personal side of it, I want to thank you for being

470
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:49,083
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing what I think is a Yiddish circle to the city council chambers.

471
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:58,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you, as the only Jewish city council member, and I think in Medford history, right?

472
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:10,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you have your chutzpah, your commitment to improving the community and working with the community, your

473
01:01:12,952 --> 01:01:31,984
[SPEAKER_06]: adherence to your moral compass and ethical values are a represent and implement the shared culture and heritage that is so dear to both of us, I think.

474
01:01:32,765 --> 01:01:39,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't help but feeling a bit of nahas for how you have

475
01:01:40,255 --> 01:01:43,998
[SPEAKER_06]: held yourself and performed on this city council and in these chambers.

476
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for your service and all your work, Councilor Collins.

477
01:01:48,142 --> 01:01:54,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that whatever you are going on to do is wonderful and great and full of learning and adventure.

478
01:01:54,607 --> 01:02:06,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And I very sincerely hope that we will have the benefit of having you back in our city sometime in the future to continue helping us make Medford the wonderful community it should be.

479
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:09,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

480
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:13,105
[SPEAKER_26]: And we'll go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

481
01:02:13,346 --> 01:02:15,207
[SPEAKER_26]: Eileen, name and address for the record, please.

482
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:16,347
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

483
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'd like to echo.

484
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:24,373
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't go off.

485
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:25,413
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

486
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:27,615
[SPEAKER_26]: We can hear you.

487
01:02:27,635 --> 01:02:27,675
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

488
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:35,059
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to echo everything that everybody has said about Kit Collins.

489
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very, very sad to see her go.

490
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:59,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I love her very much and I think the most outstanding thing about Kit is how she is so principled and even in the face of you know people criticizing her and yelling and screaming and she

491
01:03:00,536 --> 01:03:04,717
[SPEAKER_15]: maintains her position and that's been so important.

492
01:03:05,617 --> 01:03:13,379
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so proud of her and I'm proud of all of you and the ways in which the city has changed since I've moved here.

493
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know we all hope that Kit comes back in a couple of years.

494
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:25,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So please know Kit, you have a place at our table always.

495
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

496
01:03:29,855 --> 01:03:30,336
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

497
01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:36,770
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, anyone else would like to speak on this paper?

498
01:03:40,037 --> 01:03:52,880
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, the next step is we will take a vote, and then anyone who would like to take a photo with us in the well, you're welcome to come up and take a photo with us and with Kit, and we'll go from there.

[SPEAKER_26]: Kit absolutely cannot go home, because the records of the meeting of December 2nd, 2025 were passed to Vice President Collins.

[SPEAKER_26]: As it says in the draft, the purpose of this chapter is to assure that employees of the City of Medford building service contractors and subcontractors earn an hourly wage that is needed to support a family of four and to promote labor peace in building service work contracted by the City of Medford.

550
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:22,488
[SPEAKER_26]: This ordinance

551
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:32,764
[SPEAKER_26]: The reasoning for it comes from identified gaps in our current city ordinances and procurement ordinances that other communities have fixed.

552
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:53,648
[SPEAKER_26]: We recently had a procurement process for custodial services in the Medford Public Schools where a union contractor was essentially replaced with a non-union contractor and through research it was determined mainly because the procurement process is inadequate.

553
01:09:54,749 --> 01:10:03,615
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a union contractor who had submitted a competitive bid but was not selected because the process is just out of date and the ordinance is old.

554
01:10:03,935 --> 01:10:18,445
[SPEAKER_26]: So this ordinance would update our procurement laws here in the city to make sure that when we're doing contracted or subcontracted services that the folks who are doing those jobs get

555
01:10:19,446 --> 01:10:35,210
[SPEAKER_26]: and that in the bidding process, that compensation, there's no advantage to go non-union because there's a floor where every person who is being contracted by the city has to meet a basic wage floor.

556
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:39,863
[SPEAKER_26]: This is something that has been adopted in several communities.

557
01:10:39,883 --> 01:10:42,144
[SPEAKER_26]: This language largely comes from that.

558
01:10:42,604 --> 01:10:53,948
[SPEAKER_26]: Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and other communities have adopted these ordinances to make sure that our procurement process is not negatively affecting workers.

559
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:59,670
[SPEAKER_26]: We have some workers here tonight who were affected by the custodial contract.

560
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:03,211
[SPEAKER_26]: We also have some of their representatives here from 32JSNU, their union.

561
01:11:06,373 --> 01:11:20,653
[SPEAKER_26]: And that, I'd love to hear from them after I hear from my fellow colleagues, but they can share more of their personal stories of what it's been like to be impacted by this procurement issue here in our city.

562
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:32,287
[SPEAKER_26]: that the decision makers in the Medford Public Schools were only able to make the decision with the information they had and that was based on a process that's out of date.

563
01:11:32,848 --> 01:11:40,698
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, going forward whether it's city side, school side, getting this process up to date and making sure there's a fair wage floor for every worker.

564
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:47,882
[SPEAKER_26]: It means that an issue like this will not happen again, at very least will not happen again the way that it happened here.

565
01:11:49,063 --> 01:11:52,104
[SPEAKER_26]: So I am really glad to be putting this forward.

566
01:11:53,165 --> 01:12:07,853
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to move forward on it if at all possible and really would appreciate hearing from my colleagues and then hearing from our friends from who were until relatively recently working in a contract position for the city as well as their union.

567
01:12:08,854 --> 01:12:09,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

568
01:12:10,412 --> 01:12:11,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Behrs.

569
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:12,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go first to Councilor Sang.

570
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:17,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Behrs, for introducing this.

571
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:29,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Our council was frustrated when we learned that what you described had happened and about the switch from union staff to non-union staff.

572
01:12:29,832 --> 01:12:31,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Unions are such an important

573
01:12:32,595 --> 01:12:34,996
[SPEAKER_17]: part of our economy, of our city.

574
01:12:36,076 --> 01:12:37,116
[SPEAKER_17]: They are our neighbors.

575
01:12:37,876 --> 01:12:39,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Union members have created this country.

576
01:12:39,797 --> 01:12:40,777
[SPEAKER_17]: They've created the city.

577
01:12:41,597 --> 01:12:47,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And particularly in a time, and of course, when it comes to economic justice, unions are always important.

578
01:12:47,878 --> 01:13:00,161
[SPEAKER_17]: But particularly at a time of rising affordability concerns, challenging economic environments, it's more important now than ever to fix these problems and to identify the gaps

579
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:13,066
[SPEAKER_17]: in our laws that allow for things to go wrong and to make them right so that the next time this rolls around, we're doing things the fair, just, and correct way.

580
01:13:14,447 --> 01:13:16,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

581
01:13:17,848 --> 01:13:24,875
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm looking forward to hearing from the union reps and from the staff who were affected by this change.

582
01:13:25,997 --> 01:13:34,265
[SPEAKER_17]: This doesn't fix everything, but it is certainly a big step forward in making things right for the people who come next.

583
01:13:35,046 --> 01:13:35,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

584
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:38,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

585
01:13:40,845 --> 01:13:41,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.

586
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:48,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hear about this when I was knocking on doors and I know that.

587
01:13:50,501 --> 01:14:06,164
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who voted for me, the people who voted, you know, people in Medford who voted for many of the people who currently sit in school committee and on the city council, trust us to be supportive of unions and of workers.

588
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:12,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want to commend President Behrs for

589
01:14:13,146 --> 01:14:26,999
[SPEAKER_02]: taking quick action on this and working to to find legislation that other cities have used here in Massachusetts to ensure that this is going to to work for our city as well.

590
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:36,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know just really identifying something that was was did not end the way that I think

591
01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who worked there wanted it to end and did not end the way that I think the majority of our voters also want.

592
01:14:47,602 --> 01:14:56,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate his immediate action and attention and the thoroughness of this ordinance.

593
01:14:57,449 --> 01:15:01,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do look forward to hearing from the folks from 32BJ.

594
01:15:01,352 --> 01:15:02,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you all for being here.

595
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:06,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

596
01:15:06,741 --> 01:15:12,090
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are no other councillors who would like to speak right now, I think we'd all love to hear from the representatives from the union.

597
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:22,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, and as you approach the mic, please feel free to just state your name and your address.

598
01:15:22,165 --> 01:15:26,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be a business address for the record, and thank you for being here.

599
01:15:26,849 --> 01:15:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

600
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:32,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I think, our member, Dina, will read her remarks in Spanish, and I'll translate if that's okay.

601
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:33,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

602
01:15:33,656 --> 01:15:34,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And just both of your names.

603
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:35,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

604
01:15:35,057 --> 01:15:37,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Dina, do you want to say her?

605
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she'll say her name and I'll say my name.

606
01:15:39,282 --> 01:15:39,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

607
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:41,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Buenas noches.

608
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:48,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Y agradezco a los consejeros por considerar mi comentario.

609
01:15:49,951 --> 01:15:51,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Mi nombre es Dina Landaverde.

610
01:15:53,492 --> 01:15:59,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Soy uno de los 14, de los 14 limpiadores que perdimos nuestro trabajo.

611
01:15:59,814 --> 01:16:05,135
[SPEAKER_00]: El 30 de julio, cuando las escuelas cambiaron contra

612
01:16:06,472 --> 01:16:12,553
[SPEAKER_00]: por una compañía sin unión, Partner Facility Solution.

613
01:16:14,294 --> 01:16:27,176
[SPEAKER_00]: La pérdida del trabajo era un golpe enorme de los cuales estamos todavía sufriendo las repercusiones.

614
01:16:28,536 --> 01:16:33,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Muchos de nosotros no hemos podido encontrar trabajo nuevo.

615
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:45,530
[SPEAKER_00]: In mi hogar, nuestra vida es más difícil ahora que no estoy aumentando el ingreso de mi marido.

616
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:55,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Además de eso, siento mucho la pérdida de un trabajo, trabajo que me gustaba hacer.

617
01:16:56,928 --> 01:17:06,215
[SPEAKER_00]: limpiar bien y mantener seguro muchas de las áreas públicas del high school Medford.

618
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:24,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Quiero mencionar también que gracias a este trabajo sindical yo tenía un beneficio que permitió tomar clases de ciudadanía y me hice ciudadana este año.

619
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:37,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo supongo que esa perdida tiene que ver con los salarios más bajos que normalmente ofrece esta compañía sin unión.

620
01:17:38,335 --> 01:17:54,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Y por esa razón les agradezco mucho al concejal por considerar esta propuesta a garantizar el salario estándar para todos los limpiadores que

621
01:17:54,963 --> 01:17:58,165
[SPEAKER_00]: trabajamos por la ciudad de Medford.

622
01:17:59,505 --> 01:18:07,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Otra vez, mis agradecimientos a ustedes por su preocupación por lo que nos ha sucedido.

623
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:10,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

624
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:12,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read it in English.

625
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:15,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, everyone.

626
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:16,974
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rahm Avarnasi.

627
01:18:16,994 --> 01:18:19,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the political coordinator for 32BJ.

628
01:18:19,615 --> 01:18:20,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read in English now.

629
01:18:21,975 --> 01:18:25,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening and thank you to the council members for considering my comments.

630
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,983
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Dino Landa Verde.

631
01:18:28,483 --> 01:18:39,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one of the 14 custodians who lost our jobs on July 30th when the school switched contractors to a non-union company Partners Facility Solution, the current contractor.

632
01:18:39,997 --> 01:18:44,360
[SPEAKER_07]: The job loss was a huge blow, and we are all still suffering the repercussions.

633
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us have not been able to find new jobs.

634
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:55,346
[SPEAKER_07]: In my own household, in Dina's household, life is much harder now because she's not able to contribute to her family's income.

635
01:18:56,187 --> 01:19:04,292
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of that, she deeply misses the job that she enjoyed doing, cleaning and keeping safe many of the public areas of Medford High School.

636
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:13,373
[SPEAKER_07]: She wants to mention that thanks to this union job, she had benefits that allowed her to take citizenship classes, and she became a citizen this year.

637
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:19,258
[SPEAKER_07]: She assumes this job has to do with the lower wages that these non-union companies typically offer.

638
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:30,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And for that reason, she's very grateful to this council, as am I, for considering this proposal to guarantee a standard wage for all custodians who work in this great city of Medford.

639
01:19:31,177 --> 01:19:36,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, thank you for your concern for all that has passed since this contract flipped at the end of June, of July.

640
01:19:37,121 --> 01:19:37,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

641
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:38,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

642
01:19:38,302 --> 01:19:38,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

643
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:40,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, thank you all so much for considering this.

644
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:47,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really believe that this can make a big difference in the lives of our members, but all sorts of property service workers in the city.

645
01:19:48,588 --> 01:19:49,589
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys do so much great stuff.

646
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:54,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this could be another area to really push the city of Bedford forward.

647
01:19:54,132 --> 01:19:54,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really appreciate it.

648
01:19:55,153 --> 01:19:55,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

649
01:19:55,593 --> 01:19:56,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

650
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:57,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Do any other members want to speak?

651
01:19:58,015 --> 01:19:58,696
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't think so.

652
01:19:58,997 --> 01:20:00,680
[SPEAKER_07]: The shy group, this is great.

653
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,782
[SPEAKER_07]: But we really appreciate it.

654
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:02,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

655
01:20:02,463 --> 01:20:02,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.

656
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:03,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Gracias.

657
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:04,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comments.

658
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:05,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're good.

659
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

660
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:07,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

661
01:20:07,612 --> 01:20:07,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

662
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:08,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

663
01:20:10,817 --> 01:20:11,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go back to President Behrs.

664
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:17,006
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah and I just wanted to again say thank you to all of you for sharing your stories.

665
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:31,562
[SPEAKER_26]: I know you've shared it here in the city council chamber and also with the school committee and I know it's especially been hard for some members who have been looking for work at the holidays trying to get

666
01:20:32,403 --> 01:20:45,528
[SPEAKER_26]: a second job to become a first job and, you know, the fact that such real and difficult impacts on the lives of people who were working, you know, as contractors for the city of Medford.

667
01:20:47,850 --> 01:21:00,682
[SPEAKER_26]: is just awful and something that we have to correct the law, make sure that there's really a truly fair shot every time and that the floor for everyone who works for the city is a fair prevailing living wage.

668
01:21:00,983 --> 01:21:07,389
[SPEAKER_26]: And the fact that that wasn't the law and it resulted in this impact is just an awful thing.

669
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:11,133
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're gonna fix the law and then hopefully we can come around and

670
01:21:12,228 --> 01:21:16,769
[SPEAKER_26]: make sure that everyone who's working in the contracted roles for our city is treated fairly.

671
01:21:16,849 --> 01:21:18,950
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you all for coming and sharing your story.

672
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:22,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

673
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:23,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazaro.

674
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:27,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

675
01:21:27,192 --> 01:21:33,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you bringing this forward, President Behrs, and I appreciate you all coming out here and speaking on this issue.

676
01:21:38,974 --> 01:21:53,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford frequently has situations where we attempt to fill budget gaps in whichever creative way we try to find, but I don't think this is a good way to try to do that.

677
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:59,033
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be making sure that our employees are, you know,

678
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,089
[SPEAKER_10]: being paid in a way that's sustainable.

679
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:09,554
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not safe to have employees in the schools that are not being paid a living wage.

680
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:15,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate what you mentioned about the sense of pride and keeping our schools clean and safe.

681
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:18,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's really a wonderful way to look at it.

682
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:28,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also appreciate the framing around it being closing the gaps, updating our ordinances, and keeping our codes

683
01:22:30,038 --> 01:22:31,799
[SPEAKER_10]: up to the standards of our surrounding communities.

684
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like that way of thinking about it.

685
01:22:36,142 --> 01:22:49,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Would there be any opportunity for us to dig a little bit more into this ordinance or is there a drive to have this be kind of quickly moving forward?

686
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this standard language?

687
01:22:52,331 --> 01:22:57,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if there's any kind of, just because we haven't really,

688
01:22:58,703 --> 01:23:01,564
[SPEAKER_10]: done a lot of discussion on this ordinance prior to today.

689
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:10,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just wondering if that's something that we feel is there's an urgency behind it, or if there's more discussion that we would want to do in committee.

690
01:23:10,448 --> 01:23:11,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need it to go to committee.

691
01:23:11,548 --> 01:23:15,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious about, just because we haven't really seen it, we haven't talked about it in depth yet.

692
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:18,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just offer that to, through the chair.

693
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:19,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

694
01:23:19,551 --> 01:23:20,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to President Behrs.

695
01:23:21,932 --> 01:23:22,132
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

696
01:23:22,172 --> 01:23:22,252
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

697
01:23:22,272 --> 01:23:24,953
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I'm open to taking a deeper look at it.

698
01:23:25,553 --> 01:23:26,174
[SPEAKER_26]: The main reason

699
01:23:28,392 --> 01:23:39,194
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't propose that route on this where we did propose that on condo conversion at planning and permitting is it's basically just taking what's working somewhere else and putting it into our ordinance.

700
01:23:39,694 --> 01:23:44,896
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think one of the things that we've somewhat struggled with as a council is like not having a role in contracts.

701
01:23:45,356 --> 01:23:49,297
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't know what's up for bid, if there are services up for bid.

702
01:23:51,097 --> 01:23:54,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably there's not a bidding process that's going to happen in the next two months.

703
01:23:56,283 --> 01:23:58,183
[SPEAKER_26]: My inclination was to approve it for first reading.

704
01:23:59,964 --> 01:24:05,365
[SPEAKER_26]: We could have another meeting on it, but if we wanted to send it to committee of the whole, that would be fine with me as well.

705
01:24:07,466 --> 01:24:08,346
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we can go either way.

706
01:24:09,506 --> 01:24:20,429
[SPEAKER_26]: My only, well, I'm just, you know, we have a very hard time getting council to respond in a timely way in this community right now, at least to city council requests.

707
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,890
[SPEAKER_26]: And that inclines me to.

708
01:24:25,696 --> 01:24:33,898
[SPEAKER_26]: kind of put the ball back in their court to send responses and replies if there are questions.

709
01:24:34,398 --> 01:24:35,158
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's just my thinking.

710
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:35,939
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

711
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:39,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Councilor Latero.

712
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:52,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I actually think that that's a great point, that the necessity of the three readings leaves time for the administration, any council responses, that's built in.

713
01:24:53,009 --> 01:24:57,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe it's not necessary for us to drag out anything else.

714
01:24:57,672 --> 01:25:06,458
[SPEAKER_10]: My thought is there may be some elements of this that I I wouldn't I certainly wouldn't know what it would apply to in other areas.

715
01:25:06,558 --> 01:25:13,162
[SPEAKER_10]: But if this is standard language that's happening in our surrounding communities that's just been lifted.

716
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:16,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that's we we we practice.

717
01:25:18,258 --> 01:25:22,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not plagiarism.

718
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:30,862
[SPEAKER_10]: It's common practice to lift ordinance language from other communities, especially when it's been carefully reviewed and it's been implemented successfully.

719
01:25:31,402 --> 01:25:35,284
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done that with a number of our other ordinances.

720
01:25:35,324 --> 01:25:44,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that makes me feel comfortable if this is very close to the language that's being used in Boston and Cambridge and being successfully implemented, then I wouldn't have

721
01:25:46,306 --> 01:25:55,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't have a problem with allowing the three reading structure to necessitate any responses from the administration and council.

722
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:59,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So then we could just move forward and let that work that way.

723
01:25:59,937 --> 01:26:09,045
[SPEAKER_10]: If this is the mechanism that we as a city council have to impact the negotiation of contracts because

724
01:26:10,313 --> 01:26:36,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't feel comfortable with contracts like necessarily being negotiated in a way that's going to cut things in order to cover our budget shortfalls on the backs of our lowest paid employees and making them the even lower paid employees who are then not taken care of and leaving people high and dry who previously were taken care of or could be better taken care of.

725
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:37,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

726
01:26:40,538 --> 01:26:41,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

727
01:26:41,098 --> 01:26:42,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go back to President Behrs and then to Councilor Calion.

728
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,581
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, yeah.

729
01:26:44,921 --> 01:26:47,502
[SPEAKER_26]: I think Councilor Seng might call this good law.

730
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:50,925
[SPEAKER_26]: There's good law and bad law.

731
01:26:50,965 --> 01:26:53,286
[SPEAKER_26]: Good law is generally law that's working elsewhere.

732
01:26:53,306 --> 01:26:57,949
[SPEAKER_26]: In parlance that I'm sure Councilor Seng is more familiar with.

733
01:26:57,989 --> 01:27:03,593
[SPEAKER_26]: But essentially what this does is it, I think the worst part of this is I don't even know that we saved money.

734
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:04,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Right?

735
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:05,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

736
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:09,573
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just that the process is really, like, not working well.

737
01:27:10,774 --> 01:27:14,316
[SPEAKER_26]: And there's not really a... Yeah.

738
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:25,602
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just not clear that the decision makers are getting all of the information on all of the bids in a way where they could...

739
01:27:27,257 --> 01:27:28,678
[SPEAKER_26]: necessarily make a fair comparison.

740
01:27:29,799 --> 01:27:33,922
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to go through the specifics of the step to step to step to step to step.

741
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:49,653
[SPEAKER_26]: I can certainly connect you with Rama and the 32BJ team who did a lot of work asking why did this happen and, you know, who made what decisions that led to the information that the Medford Public Schools got to then pick a contract.

742
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:59,789
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I think it just really reflects that the procurement process itself, not having these protections that other communities have, is really what the issue was.

743
01:27:59,829 --> 01:28:03,472
[SPEAKER_26]: It wasn't even like anyone made an intentional choice to try to save money or anything.

744
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:06,074
[SPEAKER_26]: It was just like the two bids that got to the decision maker.

745
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:18,563
[SPEAKER_26]: didn't have a full, there wasn't a full picture provided, and because of this didn't exist, there wasn't like a floor for wages that every person, every bidder had to meet.

746
01:28:19,204 --> 01:28:21,006
[SPEAKER_26]: So in here, in section...

747
01:28:26,627 --> 01:28:35,956
[SPEAKER_26]: 2937, it talks about prescribed rates of pay pursuant to Director of Department of Labor Standards for janitorial security service employees.

748
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:40,440
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's similar to some things that we already have in our ordinance around.

749
01:28:41,842 --> 01:28:48,907
[SPEAKER_26]: construction and contracting projects which essentially ties things to the prevailing wage standards set out by the Commonwealth.

750
01:28:49,827 --> 01:28:54,110
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's the mechanism that's being used here.

751
01:28:55,191 --> 01:29:02,856
[SPEAKER_26]: We have I think what's titled in our ordinances like a responsible wage ordinance.

752
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:10,774
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't remember the exact title, but it's actually the chapter that would be, that is right before what this would be in our ordinances.

753
01:29:11,294 --> 01:29:21,080
[SPEAKER_26]: So essentially we have something very similar to this for contracted construction, but not for contracted service work.

754
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:22,141
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

755
01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:27,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

756
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:29,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

757
01:29:31,226 --> 01:29:31,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

758
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:56,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate your question, and I do think that it's a good process for our community to have an ordinance like this go, to have the kinds of discussions that I personally know happened before it came here, to have some of those in public, and I am going to move that we request legal opinion from

759
01:29:58,049 --> 01:30:00,711
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever city council we have at the moment.

760
01:30:02,092 --> 01:30:19,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we also send this to a committee of the whole, where we can let the public know a little bit more about the process and the circumstances, as well as review the legal advice from council.

761
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:24,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

762
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, if I may.

763
01:30:29,121 --> 01:30:29,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

764
01:30:29,521 --> 01:30:29,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

765
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:36,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to say I am fully in favor of this, and I do hope that it moves through quickly.

766
01:30:37,103 --> 01:30:48,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to delay it, but I just think from a process of passing an ordinance that actually has a little bit of meat to it, I would love for our community to know more about the situation and what's in it.

767
01:30:49,347 --> 01:30:49,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

768
01:30:51,402 --> 01:30:52,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

769
01:30:52,703 --> 01:30:59,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a motion by Councilor Callahan to request a legal opinion from KP Law, unfortunately.

770
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:07,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And also to schedule a committee of the whole to further discuss this ordinance before taking future action on it.

771
01:31:09,174 --> 01:31:10,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by President Behrs.

772
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:16,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any further commentary or questions from councilors?

773
01:31:19,461 --> 01:31:19,521
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

774
01:31:20,264 --> 01:31:22,105
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Councilor Callahan.

775
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:23,465
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor?

776
01:31:23,485 --> 01:31:23,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

777
01:31:24,886 --> 01:31:25,346
[SPEAKER_08]: All opposed?

778
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:29,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, one opposed.

779
01:31:29,807 --> 01:31:31,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Five in favor, one opposed.

780
01:31:31,748 --> 01:31:32,468
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

781
01:31:32,668 --> 01:31:32,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Five?

782
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:33,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, five of us.

783
01:31:35,169 --> 01:31:36,349
[SPEAKER_08]: That was five in favor, one opposed.

784
01:31:36,389 --> 01:31:37,050
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

785
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:38,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

786
01:31:42,771 --> 01:31:42,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

787
01:31:44,252 --> 01:31:45,332
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't need to have disputed voice votes.

788
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,201
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't count.

789
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:55,761
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

790
01:31:56,082 --> 01:31:57,403
[SPEAKER_26]: It's still like the yeses.

791
01:31:57,523 --> 01:31:59,244
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, just you would say not unanimously.

792
01:31:59,424 --> 01:32:02,667
[SPEAKER_26]: We just very rarely have non-unanimous voice votes.

793
01:32:04,008 --> 01:32:04,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of cool.

794
01:32:04,348 --> 01:32:05,369
[SPEAKER_08]: A treat for the audience.

795
01:32:10,753 --> 01:32:10,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

796
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:12,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

797
01:32:12,374 --> 01:32:15,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you again to the union representatives for being here for the

798
01:32:16,869 --> 01:32:18,829
[SPEAKER_08]: start of this really important ordinance.

799
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:26,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we're all hoping that it will see a favorable resolution very, very quickly after just a little bit more discussion in public.

800
01:32:26,431 --> 01:32:31,672
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you again for turning what you have gone through into a positive step forward for our community.

801
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:32,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

802
01:32:34,973 --> 01:32:39,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving forward, paper 25-190 offered by President Behrs.

803
01:32:42,668 --> 01:32:46,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Acceptance of Mass General Law, Chapter 40, Section 71, Chapter 399 of Act of 2024, School Bus Safety Enforcement.

804
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:54,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it ordered that the city of Medford hereby accepts Mass.

805
01:32:54,618 --> 01:33:13,027
[SPEAKER_08]: General Law, Chapter 40, Section 71, Chapter 399 of the Acts of 2024, enabling the city to install, operate, and maintain school bus violation detection monitoring systems on school buses to enforce violations pursuant to Sections 14 and 14C of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 90.

806
01:33:14,267 --> 01:33:21,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Any system put in place shall be limited to monitoring and detecting violations of motor vehicle operators who fail to stop for a school bus.

807
01:33:22,469 --> 01:33:22,969
[SPEAKER_08]: President Behrs.

808
01:33:23,809 --> 01:33:24,229
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

809
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:30,470
[SPEAKER_26]: And we also have a letter here from the school committee.

810
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:37,071
[SPEAKER_26]: And I did have some meetings with member Graham, vice chair Graham on this as well.

811
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:39,932
[SPEAKER_26]: But this was a resolution presented

812
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:48,031
[SPEAKER_26]: on the agenda from September 8th, 2025 of the School Committee, along with the meeting minutes approved September 22nd.

813
01:33:49,051 --> 01:34:09,876
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have Medford School Committee resolution requesting City Council adoption of Chapter 399, school bus stop arm camera enforcement, whereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted Chapter 399 of the Acts of 2024, titled an act concerning the safety of school children embarking and disembarking school buses, which authorizes municipalities to install and operate school bus violation detection and monitoring systems.

814
01:34:12,076 --> 01:34:18,739
[SPEAKER_26]: And whereas pilot programs in PVD and SEM have demonstrated the effectiveness of those systems with thousands of violations recorded in a single school year.

815
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:27,162
[SPEAKER_26]: Whereas the law includes strict privacy protections requiring that non-violation recordings be destroyed within 30 days and violation recordings within one year of final disposition.

816
01:34:27,723 --> 01:34:35,806
[SPEAKER_26]: And whereas the safety of Medford's children is a top priority and the implementation of stop arm cameras has been shown to deter illegal passing and improve compliance with school safety laws.

817
01:34:36,446 --> 01:34:48,732
[SPEAKER_26]: Now therefore be it resolved that the school committee respectfully request that the city council formally accept the provisions of chapter 399 of the acts of 2024, thereby enabling the city of Medford to install and operate school bus violation detection monitoring systems.

818
01:34:51,331 --> 01:35:06,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the school committee recommends the establishment of a joint committee, including a representative from the school committee, a representative of the city council, the chief of police, the superintendent of schools, and the mayor or designee to evaluate and recommend policies regarding the use of revenue generated from citations.

819
01:35:06,652 --> 01:35:14,115
[SPEAKER_26]: And be it further resolved that the school committee respect the request that the mayor agree to earmark citation revenue for exclusive use as directed by the recommendations of this committee.

820
01:35:14,536 --> 01:35:20,178
[SPEAKER_26]: With a priority given to student safety initiatives, transportation, infrastructure improvements, and public awareness campaigns.

821
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:24,740
[SPEAKER_26]: A motion to approve by member Antapa, seconded by member Brandley.

822
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:28,021
[SPEAKER_26]: And this was unanimously approved September 8th, 2025 by the school committee.

823
01:35:30,083 --> 01:35:39,093
[SPEAKER_26]: So our role here is to accept the provision of state law, Chapter 40, Section 71, also known as the Chapter 399 of the Acts of 2024.

824
01:35:40,094 --> 01:35:48,845
[SPEAKER_26]: The school committee did recommend establishing a joint committee, including those members and my understanding from their resolution.

825
01:35:49,505 --> 01:36:04,774
[SPEAKER_26]: and talking to Vice Chair Jenny Graham, is that the citation revenue will be used for safety improvements for transportation infrastructure, focusing on student safety first and foremost.

826
01:36:05,654 --> 01:36:08,976
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think this is a one-two punch, if you ask me.

827
01:36:09,617 --> 01:36:11,738
[SPEAKER_26]: We deter people

828
01:36:12,772 --> 01:36:21,197
[SPEAKER_26]: buzzing by school buses when they have their stop arms out and we bring in some revenue that can go right back into safety improvements.

829
01:36:22,317 --> 01:36:25,139
[SPEAKER_26]: So that is the resolution.

830
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:32,003
[SPEAKER_26]: Remember Graham and I also were able to meet with Mike Gorman from Bus Patrol which is

831
01:36:33,082 --> 01:36:36,783
[SPEAKER_26]: one of the, they're the folks who do this the best.

832
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:40,524
[SPEAKER_26]: They've been doing this in multiple communities around Massachusetts.

833
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:48,386
[SPEAKER_26]: I won't speak more on that other than that we had some great conversations both about the program and the law, but also about privacy.

834
01:36:48,907 --> 01:36:56,569
[SPEAKER_26]: And we were able to incorporate a few amendments to draft contracts to further address some privacy concerns that we

835
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:11,309
[SPEAKER_26]: I had heard from some residents from our ACLU Medford People Power chapter, and they were very amenable, very clear that their intent is not about collecting data, but stopping people from

836
01:37:13,062 --> 01:37:15,003
[SPEAKER_26]: putting kids in danger by zipping by school buses.

837
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:20,325
[SPEAKER_26]: So I felt really good about that and I'm thankful for the conversations that we had.

838
01:37:20,705 --> 01:37:31,189
[SPEAKER_26]: And I would move approval pending discussion by members of the council and I know that Mike is here to talk about, answer any questions, kind of talk a little bit more about their program as well.

839
01:37:31,589 --> 01:37:33,370
[SPEAKER_26]: And you guys presented to the school committee as well?

840
01:37:34,671 --> 01:37:36,911
[SPEAKER_31]: To Councilor Graham, school committee member Graham.

841
01:37:36,931 --> 01:37:38,712
[SPEAKER_26]: To member Graham, yeah, okay, great.

842
01:37:38,972 --> 01:37:40,973
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all I have, thank you Chair Collins.

843
01:37:41,512 --> 01:37:41,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

844
01:37:42,052 --> 01:37:45,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any initial comments or questions from counselors before we turn it over to the presenters?

845
01:37:47,037 --> 01:37:47,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Lazzaro.

846
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:49,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

847
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:57,546
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of the state laws that is in the direction of

848
01:37:59,232 --> 01:38:17,937
[SPEAKER_10]: automating traffic enforcement that relieves some of the inherent biases of some of the, you know, the complications with police enforcement, with traffic violations, like the, so the bus, the bus thing is one of them.

849
01:38:18,237 --> 01:38:27,560
[SPEAKER_10]: There is another thing that I went to the State House to speak in favor of that was red lights and speeding, but all of these,

850
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:45,025
[SPEAKER_10]: laws are great because it sort of, if you can build in the privacy, which the laws try to, but there's some questions about it, so it's a little bit tricky, but it sort of

851
01:38:46,324 --> 01:38:53,648
[SPEAKER_10]: allows people to understand that implementation of the law is happening inherently.

852
01:38:54,248 --> 01:38:57,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can't break the law, because you will automatically get a ticket.

853
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:01,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So people, it's like a psychological experiment.

854
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:03,233
[SPEAKER_10]: People will then follow the law.

855
01:39:03,633 --> 01:39:06,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And if people are following the law, they drive more safely, and then

856
01:39:08,336 --> 01:39:21,137
[SPEAKER_10]: There are less traffic accidents and something I've spent a lot of this term talking about is trying to make our roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists and this is a great example of an obvious.

857
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:35,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, for me, but I think it should be for everybody that we don't want anybody, but especially young children who are getting off the school buses and having to cross the street, being hit by cars.

858
01:39:37,135 --> 01:39:39,917
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many, many near misses in Medford.

859
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:44,240
[SPEAKER_10]: associated with kids walking to school, getting off of buses.

860
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:48,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Mystic Ave has a big issue with people.

861
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:57,772
[SPEAKER_10]: This happens with city buses, but crosswalks, there's a spot on Fellsway at a crosswalk that kids take to school.

862
01:39:58,272 --> 01:39:59,833
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot that we still have to do.

863
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:01,235
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one step in that direction.

864
01:40:01,475 --> 01:40:04,097
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a clear yes, I believe.

865
01:40:06,015 --> 01:40:14,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very excited about this one step closer to using technology for something that's actually good and not just writing screenplays.

866
01:40:14,178 --> 01:40:15,458
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something nice.

867
01:40:16,638 --> 01:40:20,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But I look forward to hearing more about what you have to say about this.

868
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:26,381
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm excited about future ways to implement this type of thing as well.

869
01:40:26,662 --> 01:40:26,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

870
01:40:28,342 --> 01:40:28,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

871
01:40:29,283 --> 01:40:30,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Please go ahead, just name and address for the record, please.

872
01:40:31,004 --> 01:40:31,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for being here.

873
01:40:31,964 --> 01:40:32,745
[SPEAKER_31]: Michael Gorman.

874
01:40:33,245 --> 01:40:34,846
[SPEAKER_31]: I live in Middleton, Massachusetts.

875
01:40:34,966 --> 01:40:43,551
[SPEAKER_31]: I have with me Ezra Orkin from Medford, resident the last few years, and we both are employed by Bus Patrol.

876
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:49,075
[SPEAKER_31]: And our company's core purpose is to enhance child safety.

877
01:40:50,716 --> 01:40:53,698
[SPEAKER_31]: We're in 27 states across America where

878
01:40:54,503 --> 01:41:00,288
[SPEAKER_31]: covering New England as quickly as we can, specifically Connecticut and Rhode Island.

879
01:41:00,768 --> 01:41:15,380
[SPEAKER_31]: Now that this is a state law in Massachusetts as of January, we've been crisscrossing the Commonwealth to make sure that we are speaking to the communities like Medford as best we can, as quickly as we can, to take our program

880
01:41:16,585 --> 01:41:29,505
[SPEAKER_31]: to the streets of these communities, which in essence, when these programs are enacted in these communities, it's true, tested that drivers become more.

881
01:41:31,265 --> 01:41:35,366
[SPEAKER_31]: rational around buses, around school buses.

882
01:41:35,546 --> 01:41:43,709
[SPEAKER_31]: Their aptitude to understand the ramifications of receiving a ticket is real.

883
01:41:44,209 --> 01:41:48,450
[SPEAKER_31]: The propensity to be a repeat offender diminishes down to 10%.

884
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:55,452
[SPEAKER_31]: And what happens with this education, because that's what we're really built on,

885
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:06,528
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, counselor, you mentioned the ticketing, which is in effect here, but we are an educational company.

886
01:42:06,909 --> 01:42:15,977
[SPEAKER_31]: Our core mission to enhance child safety is through the repetition of educating drivers and residents that this law

887
01:42:17,047 --> 01:42:28,232
[SPEAKER_31]: is important, important to the safety of your community, to the children that are depending on these buses for safe transportation, and for everyone that are on the roads in cities like Medford.

888
01:42:29,692 --> 01:42:41,497
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a program we're quite proud of because it works, the technology is sound and effective, and we're thrilled and grateful

889
01:42:42,554 --> 01:42:45,595
[SPEAKER_31]: We're grateful that you're considering us tonight.

890
01:42:45,615 --> 01:42:50,116
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'll let Ezra say a couple of words because this is his town.

891
01:42:51,697 --> 01:42:52,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, everyone.

892
01:42:52,477 --> 01:42:53,397
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Ezra Okon.

893
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,078
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the Chief Operating Officer of Bus Patrol.

894
01:42:55,698 --> 01:43:03,000
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here not as the Chief Operating Officer of Bus Patrol, but an advocate for student safety that's lived in Medford with my daughter for the last four years.

895
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm extremely passionate about this topic.

896
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:07,942
[SPEAKER_19]: I've watched hundreds of millions of school bus stops.

897
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:13,904
[SPEAKER_19]: over my time at bus patrol, and I can unequivocally say that this program changes behavior.

898
01:43:14,484 --> 01:43:15,545
[SPEAKER_19]: The law changes behavior.

899
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:21,847
[SPEAKER_19]: And it only changes when we can evaluate and watch and monitor every single stop in the community.

900
01:43:22,588 --> 01:43:25,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Our program is unique in that we serve every single bus in the community.

901
01:43:26,469 --> 01:43:30,511
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not discriminate based on location, based on bus type, based on area in the community.

902
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:32,712
[SPEAKER_19]: Every bus has the opportunity to get this technology.

903
01:43:33,112 --> 01:43:38,434
[SPEAKER_19]: which means every child getting on or off the bus has an opportunity to be protected by the technology.

904
01:43:38,554 --> 01:43:40,235
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we're very excited and honored to be here.

905
01:43:40,795 --> 01:43:49,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Me personally, having been working on this mission for four or five years to be presenting in my own community is extremely exciting and moving.

906
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:51,960
[SPEAKER_19]: And so thank you for the time and the consideration.

907
01:43:54,881 --> 01:43:55,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

908
01:43:55,301 --> 01:43:55,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for being here.

909
01:43:58,002 --> 01:43:59,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions from my fellow counselors?

910
01:44:05,248 --> 01:44:06,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Councilor Sang.

911
01:44:07,649 --> 01:44:12,051
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have questions, but I just wanted to say on the record that I think this is a no brainer.

912
01:44:12,892 --> 01:44:19,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Protecting our kids is the chief priority, one of the chief priorities of any local government.

913
01:44:21,676 --> 01:44:29,119
[SPEAKER_17]: And there, you know, we, we have, we've heard from kids themselves at city council meetings about how dangerous it can be on the roads for them.

914
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,561
[SPEAKER_17]: And school bus stops are no different than that.

915
01:44:35,534 --> 01:44:41,379
[SPEAKER_17]: The law that we would accept is also really straightforward when you look at it.

916
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,441
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a win-win for everyone.

917
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:45,842
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a win for city government.

918
01:44:47,023 --> 01:44:51,327
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a win for you guys, of course, and it's a win for residents.

919
01:44:52,608 --> 01:44:55,550
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't something that is extremely costly.

920
01:44:55,590 --> 01:45:01,335
[SPEAKER_17]: This is something that's basic and that is, you know, just common sense.

921
01:45:02,055 --> 01:45:03,657
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm happy to support this.

922
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:05,680
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you very much for saying that.

923
01:45:08,283 --> 01:45:09,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Councilor Sang.

924
01:45:10,185 --> 01:45:10,645
[SPEAKER_08]: President Behrs.

925
01:45:12,207 --> 01:45:12,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

926
01:45:12,468 --> 01:45:16,913
[SPEAKER_26]: Just wanted to thank you guys again for your work and for being a resident.

927
01:45:16,973 --> 01:45:24,622
[SPEAKER_26]: I know it can feel really great to have something you've been working on at a large scale come home and

928
01:45:25,742 --> 01:45:31,063
[SPEAKER_26]: Having kids in the community, I'm sure that that makes this issue even closer to your heart.

929
01:45:31,623 --> 01:45:32,623
[SPEAKER_26]: So I really appreciate that.

930
01:45:33,524 --> 01:45:37,484
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we worked out some of the questions around privacy and I really appreciate that.

931
01:45:37,844 --> 01:45:43,125
[SPEAKER_26]: Got a couple more that I think we can engage in some dialogue on after the meeting.

932
01:45:44,486 --> 01:45:51,987
[SPEAKER_26]: Just to make sure that, you know, that the provisions of the contract are really keeping

933
01:45:52,857 --> 01:45:56,758
[SPEAKER_26]: Keeping the data safe and I know that that's something you've really talked about.

934
01:45:57,198 --> 01:45:59,879
[SPEAKER_26]: The focus is on keeping kids safe keeping our community safe.

935
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:01,039
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what you guys do.

936
01:46:01,999 --> 01:46:10,662
[SPEAKER_26]: So feeling good about that myself and I'll make sure to share any additional questions or language suggestions with you guys.

937
01:46:11,522 --> 01:46:15,443
[SPEAKER_26]: And I appreciate it just really the willingness and openness to just put that in.

938
01:46:16,127 --> 01:46:22,251
[SPEAKER_26]: in the agreement and make it clear, like, we're just putting these cameras on to keep the kids safe.

939
01:46:23,691 --> 01:46:25,672
[SPEAKER_26]: And beyond that, privacy is really important to you guys, too.

940
01:46:25,893 --> 01:46:26,953
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's really meaningful.

941
01:46:27,474 --> 01:46:29,935
[SPEAKER_26]: It's another value we share as a council.

942
01:46:30,755 --> 01:46:33,337
[SPEAKER_26]: We've spent quite a bit of time on data privacy.

943
01:46:33,397 --> 01:46:34,658
[SPEAKER_26]: And honestly, you know, I think

944
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:54,056
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, having relationships with folks that we trust around that is really important because, sadly, we are regulating this at the local level, you know, when privacy, I think, really is a right that we all think should be much more clearly enshrined and addressed at the state and federal level.

945
01:46:54,157 --> 01:47:00,202
[SPEAKER_26]: So I appreciate us having to work that out since the people who should be working it out haven't done it.

946
01:47:01,503 --> 01:47:09,949
[SPEAKER_31]: We look forward to working alongside the police, the school department, and you, the council board, to pursue this endeavor.

947
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:10,550
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

948
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:11,631
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much.

949
01:47:13,392 --> 01:47:13,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

950
01:47:14,253 --> 01:47:16,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any public comment on this item?

951
01:47:16,775 --> 01:47:19,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

952
01:47:20,698 --> 01:47:21,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

953
01:47:21,578 --> 01:47:22,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not opposed to

954
01:47:27,998 --> 01:47:53,539
[SPEAKER_06]: bus cams and all of this, and I'd love to talk to you guys some more later about some issues, some concerns, but as far as this enacting ordinance goes that enacts the mass gen law, I do want to bring it to your attention and ask if it's possible that some sort of amendment be put in to the enacting ordinance

955
01:47:54,862 --> 01:48:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I say that not totally knowing how this works at this level, that further limits the data derived from recordings to only be used and preserved in aggregated statistical form and only after a plan of such usage has been approved by the current sitting city council.

956
01:48:12,691 --> 01:48:14,632
[SPEAKER_06]: The issue is because, is that,

957
01:48:17,823 --> 01:48:21,205
[SPEAKER_06]: In my day job, I am an IP and advanced software attorney.

958
01:48:22,305 --> 01:48:26,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I have worked with ML enabled, machine learning enabled technologies for over a decade.

959
01:48:27,547 --> 01:48:28,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very good at what I do.

960
01:48:29,148 --> 01:48:39,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And using the derivative data is more valuable often than the raw data.

961
01:48:41,585 --> 01:49:06,904
[SPEAKER_06]: would be very much to the city's benefit and to our privacy rights and whole bunch of other derived issues for there to be black letter law in our city code that gives us insight and control over all data aspects related to these types of monitoring and automation services.

962
01:49:07,989 --> 01:49:09,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all I'm really asking for.

963
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:10,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

964
01:49:11,751 --> 01:49:11,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

965
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:12,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

966
01:49:18,055 --> 01:49:18,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Next.

967
01:49:18,675 --> 01:49:19,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

968
01:49:21,117 --> 01:49:22,678
[SPEAKER_29]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

969
01:49:24,299 --> 01:49:35,125
[SPEAKER_29]: I have, I just want to echo the concerns about privacy and just make sure that whatever we end up with is consistent with our CCOPS ordinance.

970
01:49:37,825 --> 01:49:46,652
[SPEAKER_29]: and while totally being supportive of the idea of enforcing school bus stops.

971
01:49:48,394 --> 01:49:50,996
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a couple of questions for the bus patrol people.

972
01:49:51,036 --> 01:49:55,520
[SPEAKER_29]: I wonder if I may have permission to ask them directly or do I need to go through?

973
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,781
[SPEAKER_24]: Through me, thank you.

974
01:49:57,021 --> 01:49:58,582
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

975
01:49:58,702 --> 01:50:04,027
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Collins, one question I would have for the bus patrol people is,

976
01:50:05,948 --> 01:50:18,573
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm assuming I drive past a stopped school bus, my car is photographed, I get a ticket, I deserve it.

977
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:30,018
[SPEAKER_29]: My neighbor Ezra, who's a better citizen than I, stops for the school bus, does his car get photographed?

978
01:50:31,909 --> 01:50:32,910
[SPEAKER_29]: That's one question.

979
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:50,495
[SPEAKER_29]: And a second question is, some of the materials that we've seen refer to a beyond enforcement program, and we have no idea what that is or if that even pertains to Medford, but I think it would be important for us to know that.

980
01:50:51,095 --> 01:50:51,815
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

981
01:50:51,995 --> 01:50:52,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

982
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:52,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Barry.

983
01:50:56,557 --> 01:50:58,757
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to speak to those questions now, you're certainly welcome to.

984
01:50:59,058 --> 01:51:00,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Or President Barrett, go ahead.

985
01:51:01,223 --> 01:51:04,305
[SPEAKER_26]: I will ask those questions of you.

986
01:51:04,926 --> 01:51:18,436
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think it would be helpful to talk a little bit about what gets collected, basically what an interaction looks like when someone drives by, what's collected, how long does it stick around for, that's helpful.

987
01:51:18,856 --> 01:51:21,258
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, if you could talk about beyond enforcement as well a little bit.

988
01:51:21,298 --> 01:51:24,160
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that the last thing I'll say to what Micah and

989
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:34,506
[SPEAKER_26]: Barry were talking about is this, what we're doing tonight is adopting the state law, which allows us to enter into a procurement process.

990
01:51:35,087 --> 01:51:36,768
[SPEAKER_26]: And so then there would be an agreement signed.

991
01:51:37,188 --> 01:51:41,831
[SPEAKER_26]: And then we also have a city ordinance called Community Control over Public Surveillance.

992
01:51:41,871 --> 01:51:44,253
[SPEAKER_26]: This would probably qualify as a surveillance technology.

993
01:51:44,693 --> 01:51:53,761
[SPEAKER_26]: So the city likely in this case Medford Public Schools through the bus contractor would just have a policy in place saying this is essentially how we use this.

994
01:51:54,201 --> 01:52:00,046
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm guessing a lot of it would be pulled from the agreement itself but just to clarify some procedural elements as well.

995
01:52:01,027 --> 01:52:06,511
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah I think talking about what does an interaction look like and just a little bit about beyond enforcement would be helpful.

996
01:52:08,014 --> 01:52:08,314
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

997
01:52:09,115 --> 01:52:32,068
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, if using the example one of your residents just raised, if a car did go through wrongly and was videoed and photographed, that information would be utilized for that moment for the police to determine whether or not that was a valid

998
01:52:36,174 --> 01:52:40,616
[SPEAKER_31]: a digression from the way a car should be stopping.

999
01:52:41,196 --> 01:52:49,359
[SPEAKER_31]: And what happens is the police then accept the violation, the alleged violation.

1000
01:52:49,539 --> 01:52:50,659
[SPEAKER_31]: It gets sent out.

1001
01:52:51,599 --> 01:53:00,722
[SPEAKER_31]: But once that citation is paid, that data, that information is no longer saved over a period of time.

1002
01:53:00,742 --> 01:53:05,164
[SPEAKER_31]: It's kept until that moment runs its course.

1003
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:24,922
[SPEAKER_31]: And what happens is the car, the other example of the car that was photographed possibly when the alleged other vehicle was taken, that car's no longer required to save data because that car

1004
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:29,112
[SPEAKER_31]: is not going to be receiving a citation.

1005
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:34,257
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's no longer information that's relevant to that moment.

1006
01:53:34,917 --> 01:53:38,420
[SPEAKER_31]: So that information gets destroyed rather quickly.

1007
01:53:46,526 --> 01:53:50,249
[SPEAKER_26]: The Beyond Enforcement Program, we're not doing that here, right?

1008
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:51,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Or could you explain what that is a little bit more?

1009
01:53:54,406 --> 01:54:04,450
[SPEAKER_19]: So the Beyond Enforcement Program is an optional add-on that we offer generally at no additional cost for school districts that is not related to the enforcement program at all.

1010
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,711
[SPEAKER_19]: The enforcement cameras are outward facing.

1011
01:54:07,311 --> 01:54:08,692
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't record the inside of the bus.

1012
01:54:08,712 --> 01:54:10,372
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't record any goings on with the driver.

1013
01:54:10,492 --> 01:54:12,233
[SPEAKER_19]: They're strictly for enforcement.

1014
01:54:12,633 --> 01:54:25,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Beyond enforcement is an option that we offer for additional cameras separate from the enforcement cameras that allow the school districts to take advantage of other security they might want to put in place inside the school bus and around the school bus.

1015
01:54:26,123 --> 01:54:31,006
[SPEAKER_19]: So it would be interior cameras along with the ability to pull the interior cameras in the event of

1016
01:54:31,692 --> 01:54:42,977
[SPEAKER_19]: an incident with a child, a child missing, bullying, altercations, those types of items, but they are completely optional and not a required part of the program.

1017
01:54:43,137 --> 01:54:43,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1018
01:54:43,397 --> 01:54:49,120
[SPEAKER_26]: My understanding from our conversations is that the city is not going to be participating in that program.

1019
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,781
[SPEAKER_19]: It's completely at their option.

1020
01:54:50,881 --> 01:54:51,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1021
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:51,521
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1022
01:54:51,561 --> 01:54:51,741
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1023
01:54:52,021 --> 01:54:56,703
[SPEAKER_26]: That was my understanding from the conversations with member Graham and the school committee resolution.

1024
01:54:56,904 --> 01:54:59,665
[SPEAKER_26]: This is just about the safety outside the bus.

1025
01:55:01,518 --> 01:55:01,738
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1026
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:04,620
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, at least for me.

1027
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1028
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:06,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1029
01:55:07,441 --> 01:55:07,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1030
01:55:08,502 --> 01:55:13,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate you speaking to those questions and fleshing out the picture of how this could work in our community a little bit more.

1031
01:55:13,764 --> 01:55:14,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for being here.

1032
01:55:16,506 --> 01:55:20,968
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion to approve from President Behrs.

1033
01:55:21,008 --> 01:55:21,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a second?

1034
01:55:21,989 --> 01:55:23,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Second from Councilor Sang.

1035
01:55:23,409 --> 01:55:26,211
[SPEAKER_26]: There's one amendment, if you don't mind.

1036
01:55:26,351 --> 01:55:26,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

1037
01:55:27,051 --> 01:55:28,172
[SPEAKER_26]: Should say be it ordered.

1038
01:55:29,553 --> 01:55:29,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1039
01:55:29,853 --> 01:55:30,153
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

1040
01:55:30,434 --> 01:55:36,418
[SPEAKER_26]: So that would be a motion to approve, motion to accept and approve as amended.

1041
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:36,978
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1042
01:55:37,218 --> 01:55:37,898
[SPEAKER_26]: And we should roll call.

1043
01:55:37,918 --> 01:55:38,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1044
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve and accept as amended.

1045
01:55:43,262 --> 01:55:45,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, if you'll please call the roll.

1046
01:55:49,066 --> 01:55:49,906
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan.

1047
01:55:52,688 --> 01:55:52,868
Yes.

1048
01:55:53,269 --> 01:55:54,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Collins.

1049
01:55:54,329 --> 01:55:54,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1050
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:56,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lazaro.

1051
01:55:56,391 --> 01:55:56,511
Yes.

1052
01:55:57,751 --> 01:55:58,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lemming.

1053
01:56:00,094 --> 01:56:01,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scapelli?

1054
01:56:01,875 --> 01:56:02,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scapelli is absent.

1055
01:56:03,096 --> 01:56:03,777
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Seng?

1056
01:56:05,178 --> 01:56:05,859
[SPEAKER_20]: President Pierce?

1057
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:06,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1058
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:07,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1059
01:56:08,241 --> 01:56:09,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Six in favor, none opposed.

1060
01:56:10,302 --> 01:56:11,944
[SPEAKER_08]: The resolution, the motion passes.

1061
01:56:12,704 --> 01:56:13,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much again.

1062
01:56:28,697 --> 01:56:30,179
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Sang.

1063
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1064
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:35,604
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like, oh, sorry.

1065
01:56:35,884 --> 01:56:36,325
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

1066
01:56:36,385 --> 01:56:36,745
[SPEAKER_17]: No worries.

1067
01:56:37,726 --> 01:56:44,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to motion to take 20, let me get the number right, 24-069 off the table.

1068
01:56:45,814 --> 01:56:48,457
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the human rights ordinance for third reading.

1069
01:56:50,050 --> 01:56:57,633
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councillor saying to take paper 24 0 6 9 from the table and to take it from the table.

1070
01:56:57,853 --> 01:56:58,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1071
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:01,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1072
01:57:02,014 --> 01:57:02,554
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor.

1073
01:57:02,854 --> 01:57:02,954
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1074
01:57:03,374 --> 01:57:03,775
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed.

1075
01:57:03,835 --> 01:57:04,395
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1076
01:57:04,435 --> 01:57:04,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Sang.

1077
01:57:05,778 --> 01:57:08,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to the council for allowing me to take this out of order.

1078
01:57:08,739 --> 01:57:16,463
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we have residents on Zoom and in the audience tonight who wish to speak, I believe, on this.

1079
01:57:18,144 --> 01:57:32,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Essentially, this is the Human Rights Commission ordinance, which would refresh, revitalize, and re-envision what the HRC is allowed to do in our city to expand

1080
01:57:34,711 --> 01:57:39,695
[SPEAKER_17]: their scope and empower them to do even more in these trying times.

1081
01:57:40,815 --> 01:57:51,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've all seen on a personal level how important human rights is to all of our residents here, especially in this past year.

1082
01:57:52,443 --> 01:57:57,127
[SPEAKER_17]: We've seen the threats, especially from the federal administration, with regards to this issue.

1083
01:57:58,668 --> 01:58:02,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've also heard through the process, through our committee meetings and through

1084
01:58:03,452 --> 01:58:12,812
[SPEAKER_17]: our meetings in regular session about this from residents about why it's so important that we reconstitute the Human Rights Commission.

1085
01:58:14,328 --> 01:58:30,136
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, after chats with legal counsel and city staff, members of our community, there's some small edits that I'd like to make a motion to adopt the amendments of.

1086
01:58:31,017 --> 01:58:35,919
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll quickly share the screen so residents can see this and comment on this as well.

1087
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:41,382
[SPEAKER_17]: I've sent this to the counselors before time, ahead of this meeting as well.

1088
01:58:42,823 --> 01:58:44,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Just give me one second to find it.

1089
01:59:02,619 --> 01:59:04,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, my screen share is not really working.

1090
01:59:12,543 --> 01:59:14,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Leming, are you on the Zoom as well?

1091
01:59:14,704 --> 01:59:15,964
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you need to be a co-host?

1092
01:59:16,745 --> 01:59:17,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, maybe.

1093
01:59:17,245 --> 01:59:19,686
[SPEAKER_17]: It might also just be my Zoom app.

1094
01:59:20,326 --> 01:59:21,106
[SPEAKER_26]: You are a co-host.

1095
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:21,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, OK.

1096
01:59:21,866 --> 01:59:23,367
[SPEAKER_17]: So it might be my computer.

1097
01:59:24,247 --> 01:59:26,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt, did you receive the email?

1098
01:59:30,089 --> 01:59:30,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1099
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:30,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1100
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:34,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, if you could screen share for me.

1101
01:59:36,512 --> 01:59:36,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1102
01:59:41,342 --> 01:59:50,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to get ahead of schedule, most of the edits you'll see in the very first section, the establishment and purpose section are just to tighten up the language a little bit.

1103
01:59:51,088 --> 01:59:57,392
[SPEAKER_17]: There's suggested edits from Kevin Foley, our city solicitor.

1104
01:59:59,987 --> 02:00:03,372
[SPEAKER_17]: It does look like a big block of edits, but most of it is actually what we passed.

1105
02:00:03,452 --> 02:00:09,561
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just adding in a few sentences and restructuring the paragraphs to separate out the fourth point.

1106
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:14,528
[SPEAKER_17]: The edits in the second section are to make sure that we are not

1107
02:00:16,769 --> 02:00:20,712
[SPEAKER_17]: insinuating or referring to any quotas for appointments.

1108
02:00:21,172 --> 02:00:28,357
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's removing the language that was there that kind of pointed to that to make sure that this is in compliance with constitutional law.

1109
02:00:29,858 --> 02:00:37,823
[SPEAKER_17]: And to address one of the concerns about self-appointment as well, to place that appointment authority in the council.

1110
02:00:39,364 --> 02:00:45,190
[SPEAKER_17]: for the members that are meant to be on different boards in the city.

1111
02:00:45,910 --> 02:01:03,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Part of the goal with this revision is to make sure that we have essentially an umbrella group that is looking at issues intersectionally from the different commissions that we already have in the city whose work already is human rights related.

1112
02:01:05,348 --> 02:01:18,558
[SPEAKER_17]: And so essentially the newer system would say that the HRC would craft a list of candidates for the city council to appoint to the HRC out of those groups.

1113
02:01:19,539 --> 02:01:24,022
[SPEAKER_17]: The second amendment in this section is what I talked about first.

1114
02:01:25,363 --> 02:01:28,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving down, the next

1115
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:32,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Changes are more typographical.

1116
02:01:32,382 --> 02:01:39,226
[SPEAKER_17]: We've already discussed them in committee, or in the council section, removing the words city council liaison.

1117
02:01:40,886 --> 02:01:48,490
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that that was accidentally left out of the motion to amend at first reading, so we've made that change this time.

1118
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:50,071
[SPEAKER_17]: We've already discussed it as a council.

1119
02:01:54,447 --> 02:01:56,949
[SPEAKER_17]: There are kind of two last changes.

1120
02:01:57,409 --> 02:02:22,886
[SPEAKER_17]: The first one is about ensuring that we're complying with privacy laws at the state and federal level to make sure that we refer to those as superseding this and to allow flexibility for city departments to anonymize sensitive information and redact really sensitive information that could potentially identify individuals

1121
02:02:24,091 --> 02:02:28,778
[SPEAKER_17]: who are engaged in human rights complaints or filing these complaints.

1122
02:02:30,996 --> 02:02:45,605
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the very last or the last real change to this that you'll see removes the words exert moral authority just because that is tougher to measure.

1123
02:02:47,025 --> 02:02:52,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard from community members that that was potentially an item of concern there.

1124
02:02:52,749 --> 02:02:55,410
[SPEAKER_17]: So this amendment removes that language.

1125
02:02:55,631 --> 02:02:59,493
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't necessarily change what the HRC is.

1126
02:03:00,133 --> 02:03:05,736
[SPEAKER_17]: allowed to do, but it just removes language that is vague and potentially confusing.

1127
02:03:07,897 --> 02:03:11,519
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are the amendments I'm proposing tonight.

1128
02:03:11,539 --> 02:03:17,081
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

1129
02:03:17,101 --> 02:03:21,784
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have questions or discussion by members of the council?

1130
02:03:23,445 --> 02:03:24,125
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazaro.

1131
02:03:25,867 --> 02:03:31,869
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any questions, I just wanted to say thank you to Councilor Singh for his hard work on this ordinance.

1132
02:03:31,989 --> 02:03:49,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a lot of back and forth and a lot of effort and I appreciate him doing that work and that we can move forward with something that is meaningful and I'm looking forward to it, so thank you very much.

1133
02:03:50,715 --> 02:03:51,415
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you Councilor Zaro.

1134
02:03:53,096 --> 02:03:56,161
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further questions or discussion by members of the council?

1135
02:03:56,281 --> 02:03:57,002
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Collins.

1136
02:04:00,222 --> 02:04:00,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you President Behrs.

1137
02:04:01,882 --> 02:04:15,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I first want to thank Councilor Seng for working so hard for so long on this ordinance and thank you as well to the community members that have put forth such an incredible effort to make sure that our Human Rights Commission in the City of Medford is what it needs to be.

1138
02:04:15,166 --> 02:04:21,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's so important that this reform effort happened this term and I'm really grateful to see it.

1139
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:28,153
[SPEAKER_08]: To see it be moved, to see it be moved along, to see it resolved before the end of the year.

1140
02:04:28,173 --> 02:04:39,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we are in a moment where it is more important than ever that the Human Rights Commission in our community is empowered and has discretion.

1141
02:04:40,443 --> 02:04:48,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And is unfettered by, is empowered not unfettered by our code of ordinances so that the community members who wish to be on it.

1142
02:04:50,332 --> 02:04:59,320
[SPEAKER_08]: are able to really use their power and discretion and latitude to make sure that human rights are proactively safeguarded and protected within our community.

1143
02:05:01,142 --> 02:05:05,946
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of those very bureaucratic, I think, things within city government that

1144
02:05:08,267 --> 02:05:16,370
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the, the volume of text and the wordsmithing that go into them kind of obscure how consequential it really is and how much it speaks to our values.

1145
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:19,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you counselor for your diligent work on this.

1146
02:05:19,771 --> 02:05:23,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that this was a product of negotiation with the administration.

1147
02:05:24,552 --> 02:05:33,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And this required a, a really delicate hand in making sure that this commission could be something that our community really needs it to be.

1148
02:05:37,327 --> 02:05:43,151
[SPEAKER_08]: and that the administration is also willing to support and willing to enforce.

1149
02:05:48,248 --> 02:05:49,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is really important.

1150
02:05:50,208 --> 02:06:01,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it does bear saying that it shouldn't be so difficult to get our administration to the table when it comes to empowering a community group that wants to safeguard human rights within the city of Medford.

1151
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:07,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for being that person to try to bring all of the parties together so that this can be what it needs to be in our community.

1152
02:06:08,612 --> 02:06:08,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1153
02:06:12,852 --> 02:06:14,833
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1154
02:06:14,953 --> 02:06:15,673
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further discussion?

1155
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:23,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, is there anyone who'd like to speak on this ordinance?

1156
02:06:23,972 --> 02:06:26,914
[SPEAKER_26]: I have one hand on Zoom.

1157
02:06:27,114 --> 02:06:28,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyone in person?

1158
02:06:28,234 --> 02:06:28,454
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

1159
02:06:28,595 --> 02:06:30,656
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're in person, please come to the podium.

1160
02:06:30,676 --> 02:06:36,338
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll alternate between in-person and Zoom, and everyone will have three minutes.

1161
02:06:38,379 --> 02:06:39,460
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1162
02:06:39,761 --> 02:06:41,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

1163
02:06:42,682 --> 02:06:45,322
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank all of you for moving this forward.

1164
02:06:45,442 --> 02:06:46,663
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been a long process.

1165
02:06:48,183 --> 02:06:58,645
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's so important, as Vice President Collins has just noted, in this moment to have an active and vibrant Human Rights Commission.

1166
02:07:00,886 --> 02:07:09,528
[SPEAKER_16]: And I particularly want to thank Councilor Tseng for shepherding this through a very, perhaps, mountainous territory for the sheep.

1167
02:07:12,209 --> 02:07:16,252
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to offer a friendly amendment, if it's not too late.

1168
02:07:17,793 --> 02:07:32,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to bring, and this is something that I probably should have thought of a few years ago, but I wanted to bring to our attention the fact that at present there is no reference in the ordinance to the universal declaration of human rights.

1169
02:07:34,352 --> 02:07:51,047
[SPEAKER_16]: This instrument, adopted by the United Nations December 10, 1948, and voted affirmatively in by the United States, outlines the various rights and freedoms which adhere to each of us by virtue of our being members of the human race.

1170
02:07:53,149 --> 02:07:54,992
[SPEAKER_16]: that we are all obliged to respect.

1171
02:07:56,654 --> 02:08:08,871
[SPEAKER_16]: I just note that upon my graduation from public health school, along with our diplomas, we were each presented with a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which normally is on my wall, but I brought it this evening in case anyone wants to refer to it.

1172
02:08:10,753 --> 02:08:34,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I think having no reference to it in the ordinance would seem to be a rather major oversight, and one that I suggest be corrected by adding at the end of the first sentence in Section 5061, which is entitled Establishment and Purpose, number three, if we add the following words to complete the sentence, and as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

1173
02:08:43,055 --> 02:08:47,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, which says in accordance with local, state, federal.

1174
02:08:49,159 --> 02:08:50,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have it right in front of me.

1175
02:08:50,339 --> 02:08:53,521
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's the very first section, establishment and purpose.

1176
02:08:54,682 --> 02:08:55,122
[SPEAKER_16]: You see that?

1177
02:08:57,163 --> 02:08:57,704
[SPEAKER_16]: The very top.

1178
02:09:00,225 --> 02:09:04,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Seems to be, I think we might have moved that language around, but I think I,

1179
02:09:06,130 --> 02:09:15,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would fit within subsection 4, which I think is what that section used to, sentence used to be.

1180
02:09:15,676 --> 02:09:16,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1181
02:09:17,437 --> 02:09:28,865
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would make sense to add it after the references to state and federal law, Mass General Law, Chapter 151B, and then we can add.

1182
02:09:28,905 --> 02:09:29,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

1183
02:09:29,866 --> 02:09:32,367
[SPEAKER_16]: And as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

1184
02:09:34,108 --> 02:09:34,969
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm suggesting.

1185
02:09:38,464 --> 02:09:40,685
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was my friendly amendment.

1186
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:42,226
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1187
02:09:44,247 --> 02:09:45,167
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, lovely.

1188
02:09:49,409 --> 02:09:50,850
[SPEAKER_26]: Usually that's a beep.

1189
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:51,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Unroll this roll.

1190
02:09:56,452 --> 02:09:58,233
[SPEAKER_26]: For some reason, that's the default.

1191
02:09:58,573 --> 02:09:59,614
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't explain why.

1192
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:07,362
[SPEAKER_26]: I will go to Munir Jermanis on Zoom.

1193
02:10:07,622 --> 02:10:08,903
[SPEAKER_26]: Munir, name and address for the record, please.

1194
02:10:08,923 --> 02:10:09,824
[SPEAKER_26]: You'll have three minutes.

1195
02:10:11,665 --> 02:10:14,127
[SPEAKER_23]: Munir Jermanis, Three Summit Road.

1196
02:10:16,049 --> 02:10:26,258
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a previous member of the Human Rights Commission and part of the group that initiated this effort.

1197
02:10:27,639 --> 02:10:31,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And especially after seeing how

1198
02:10:32,113 --> 02:10:37,601
[SPEAKER_23]: The Human Rights Commission has been dormant for the past several months.

1199
02:10:38,862 --> 02:10:48,335
[SPEAKER_23]: We wanted to establish a vibrant and independent Human Rights Commission, so that was the intent of

1200
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:50,161
[SPEAKER_23]: this effort.

1201
02:10:51,242 --> 02:11:12,383
[SPEAKER_23]: And personally, I would like to thank Councillor Tsang for his tireless efforts in negotiating with the administration and to reach a version that is acceptable to all parties and that ensures

1202
02:11:12,869 --> 02:11:21,093
[SPEAKER_23]: that the Human Rights Commission will be independent of everything else around it, including the administration.

1203
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:29,958
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you very much, and I urge and hope that each and every one of you will vote to accept this ordinance.

1204
02:11:30,278 --> 02:11:30,638
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1205
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:34,721
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1206
02:11:35,661 --> 02:11:38,583
[SPEAKER_26]: And seeing no – well, we'll go back to the podium.

1207
02:11:38,623 --> 02:11:40,824
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1208
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:52,232
[SPEAKER_06]: My testimony for nine and Main Street I echo the previous speakers and residents in supporting the passage of this ordinance.

1209
02:11:53,073 --> 02:11:53,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I.

1210
02:11:56,200 --> 02:12:13,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make a comment just to emphasize, though, and this is as much for the administration as it is for all of you sitting in the council seats tonight, of how important and imperative it is that we do, in fact, have an independent and effective and fully enabled and functional human rights

1211
02:12:13,648 --> 02:12:23,138
[SPEAKER_06]: our body dedicated to protecting basic human rights and maybe not so basic human rights, just human rights in general of all the residents in our city right now.

1212
02:12:23,558 --> 02:12:33,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a time when the federal government literally won't say that it won't shoot American citizens and execute them with the military.

1213
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:36,312
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a time where

1214
02:12:37,432 --> 02:12:45,016
[SPEAKER_06]: large swaths of our immigrant residents here in Medford itself are directly under attack.

1215
02:12:46,316 --> 02:12:51,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And in mere months, many more of them are going to be in very perilous territory because of

1216
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:56,684
[SPEAKER_06]: some issues with the administration.

1217
02:12:58,025 --> 02:13:14,841
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a time when there are people literally prowling streets, unidentified, wearing masks, hiding behind sunglasses, and Costco military fatigues, and abducting people off the street in

1218
02:13:16,943 --> 02:13:31,320
[SPEAKER_06]: absolute, bold violation of their basic fundamental rights to be free from arrest and detention without cause, and are being lost in a system that is inhumane and is killing people on

1219
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:35,343
[SPEAKER_06]: a weekly, at least, but probably more basis.

1220
02:13:36,664 --> 02:13:38,245
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a very dangerous time.

1221
02:13:38,625 --> 02:13:50,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to emphasize to this council, but more importantly to the executive and administration that will have to be putting this into effect and implementing it, that it is

1222
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:58,322
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the most critical things that you can actually do in the coming calendar year for the safety of our city.

1223
02:13:58,742 --> 02:14:02,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So take it seriously and continue to do your job, I guess.

1224
02:14:02,943 --> 02:14:03,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, guys.

1225
02:14:03,464 --> 02:14:04,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you all.

1226
02:14:05,964 --> 02:14:06,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1227
02:14:08,305 --> 02:14:09,966
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

1228
02:14:10,266 --> 02:14:11,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1229
02:14:11,406 --> 02:14:12,206
[SPEAKER_26]: You'll have three minutes.

1230
02:14:13,967 --> 02:14:15,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

1231
02:14:16,668 --> 02:14:18,288
[SPEAKER_29]: And keep it really brief.

1232
02:14:19,249 --> 02:14:20,389
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor Tang.

1233
02:14:22,608 --> 02:14:22,928
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.

1234
02:14:28,995 --> 02:14:30,497
[SPEAKER_26]: Lesson for counselors there.

1235
02:14:35,041 --> 02:14:37,804
[SPEAKER_26]: As Owen looks at me longingly wishing to go home.

1236
02:14:39,967 --> 02:14:40,688
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Barry.

1237
02:14:42,028 --> 02:14:47,633
[SPEAKER_26]: on the motion of Councilor Sang to adopt for third read to ordain.

1238
02:14:48,353 --> 02:14:53,998

1242
02:15:00,843 --> 02:15:05,386
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Sang, can you give us a non-red line version, too rich for the records.

1243
02:15:05,406 --> 02:15:05,567
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1244
02:15:05,947 --> 02:15:07,028
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly what it should say.

1245
02:15:07,048 --> 02:15:07,448
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1246
02:15:07,748 --> 02:15:08,349
[SPEAKER_26]: No more, no less.

1247
02:15:09,546 --> 02:15:14,190

02:15:42,598 --> 02:15:44,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor.

1266
02:15:45,662 --> 02:15:49,709
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor by Vice President Collins, seconded by?

1267
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,612
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1268
02:15:51,672 --> 02:15:52,233
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1269
02:15:52,253 --> 02:15:52,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1270
02:15:53,134 --> 02:15:53,615
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed?

1271
02:15:53,715 --> 02:15:54,636
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1272
02:15:56,208 --> 02:16:00,110
[SPEAKER_26]: Communications from the Mayor, 25186, submitted by Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern.

1273
02:16:00,791 --> 02:16:06,154
[SPEAKER_26]: Authorization of contract period in excess of three years, McGlynn School Solar Panels, 20-year contract with Solect Energy.

1274
02:16:06,854 --> 02:16:16,660
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear President Behrs and City Councilors, I respect the request and recommend that the City Council approves the following contract with Solect, 20-year term for the contract with Solect Energy.

1275
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:21,803
[SPEAKER_26]: As the Council is aware, Mass General Law Chapter 30B, Section 12 requires City Council to approve

1276
02:16:22,583 --> 02:16:25,285
[SPEAKER_26]: authorization of a contract term that exceeds three years.

1277
02:16:26,045 --> 02:16:30,108
[SPEAKER_26]: And so this would be authorizing the city to enter into a 20 year lease agreement.

1278
02:16:32,209 --> 02:16:40,854
[SPEAKER_26]: And we did have a discussion and committee of the whole last week with Brenda Pike from our Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

1279
02:16:41,555 --> 02:16:43,776
[SPEAKER_26]: I know we had a few questions and Brenda did.

1280
02:16:46,198 --> 02:16:47,599
[SPEAKER_26]: get some answers to those questions.

1281
02:16:49,059 --> 02:16:57,225
[SPEAKER_26]: We should be able to give you sharing power, Brenda, or one of us could maybe share the slides, whatever's easier for you.

1282
02:16:59,306 --> 02:16:59,627
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1283
02:17:00,527 --> 02:17:01,648
[SPEAKER_26]: Matt, could you share the slides?

1284
02:17:09,233 --> 02:17:10,294
[SPEAKER_26]: Give me one second, actually.

1285
02:17:10,374 --> 02:17:11,594
[SPEAKER_25]: I might be the only one who has them.

1286
02:17:15,123 --> 02:17:15,784
[SPEAKER_25]: One second.

1287
02:17:20,389 --> 02:17:20,649
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1288
02:17:20,890 --> 02:17:21,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1289
02:17:21,430 --> 02:17:21,991
[SPEAKER_25]: I will do that.

1290
02:17:31,382 --> 02:17:32,883
[SPEAKER_26]: This will load for me.

1291
02:17:34,826 --> 02:17:35,747
[SPEAKER_26]: One second there.

1292
02:17:42,375 --> 02:17:42,855
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1293
02:17:44,157 --> 02:17:44,917
[SPEAKER_26]: Can folks see that?

1294
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:48,941
[SPEAKER_26]: I can zoom in a little bit.

1295
02:17:58,930 --> 02:17:59,130
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1296
02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,691
[SPEAKER_26]: Go ahead, Brenda.

1297
02:18:00,141 --> 02:18:00,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1298
02:18:01,181 --> 02:18:10,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am back with slightly different numbers than last week because the updated proposal has a different brand of solar panel than our original proposal did.

1299
02:18:12,004 --> 02:18:20,125
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now looking at 641 panels totaling roughly 375 kilowatts with slightly more annual production than before.

1300
02:18:21,286 --> 02:18:23,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And that change was due to supply chain issues.

1301
02:18:23,866 --> 02:18:27,967
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of demand for these projects at the end of this year because of the tax credit deadlines.

1302
02:18:31,079 --> 02:18:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week there were questions about liability and our roof warranty.

1303
02:18:36,825 --> 02:18:42,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to confirm select will be repairing any damage caused by the project if that happens.

1304
02:18:43,391 --> 02:18:46,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And any work that they perform will comply with our roof warranty.

1305
02:18:47,074 --> 02:18:55,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, they prefer to hire our roofing vendor to do the actual penetration work in order to preserve that warranty.

1306
02:18:57,617 --> 02:18:59,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go to the next slide?

1307
02:18:59,378 --> 02:19:02,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1308
02:19:02,801 --> 02:19:06,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And last week there were also questions about the return on investment.

1309
02:19:06,923 --> 02:19:18,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see here, there is more financial benefit over the 20-year term of the contract if we were to purchase the panels.

1310
02:19:19,112 --> 02:19:22,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But we would need to pay the upfront cost

1311
02:19:23,435 --> 02:19:28,818
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.1 million, and we would not see any payback on that for five and a half years.

1312
02:19:30,519 --> 02:19:43,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas with the power purchase agreement, we would be seeing a significantly lower rate, electricity rate than we are paying right now, and we'd be seeing $59,000 in savings in year one.

1313
02:19:49,199 --> 02:19:58,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to clarify something that I don't think I was very clear about last week, which is the tax credit is available for contracts signed through June of 2026.

1314
02:20:00,064 --> 02:20:08,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are some changes to what can be done if we sign the contract in January rather than by the end of this year.

1315
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:39,238
[SPEAKER_03]: There, starting in January, in order to be eligible for the tax credit, you need to use a foreign entity of concern compliant panels, which basically means no Chinese panels, and that is leading to supply chain issues for those fiat compliant panels, which leads to increased costs, uncertain timelines, and uncertain costs, and then also,

1316
02:20:40,041 --> 02:21:01,405
[SPEAKER_03]: any contract signed between January and the end of June will need to be interconnected to the grid by the end of 2027, which normally should not be a problem, but with any situation where we're waiting on something from National Grid, that can be a little uncertain.

1317
02:21:01,605 --> 02:21:05,866
[SPEAKER_03]: We waited a year and a half for an electric vehicle charging station to be connected to the grid.

1318
02:21:07,387 --> 02:21:13,692
[SPEAKER_03]: just to sort of reduce the city's risk and uncertainty around these contracts.

1319
02:21:13,732 --> 02:21:17,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good idea for us to be signing this by the end of this year.

1320
02:21:22,179 --> 02:21:22,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1321
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:25,582
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have any questions for Planner Pike?

1322
02:21:27,884 --> 02:21:28,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Collins.

1323
02:21:30,569 --> 02:21:30,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1324
02:21:31,169 --> 02:21:31,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1325
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:32,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being here.

1326
02:21:32,430 --> 02:21:34,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the really thorough presentation last week as well.

1327
02:21:34,512 --> 02:21:35,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any follow-up questions.

1328
02:21:35,752 --> 02:21:38,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you.

1329
02:21:38,694 --> 02:21:41,056
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a really robust discussion and committee of the whole.

1330
02:21:41,156 --> 02:21:42,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was just last week.

1331
02:21:42,677 --> 02:21:44,618
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like longer ago for some reason, holiday season.

1332
02:21:45,879 --> 02:21:52,143
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for all of that great information and for coming back and providing some additional slides to some of the questions that were raised last week as well.

1333
02:21:54,384 --> 02:21:55,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is really great.

1334
02:21:55,485 --> 02:21:56,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad we're doing it.

1335
02:21:56,225 --> 02:22:00,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for working so diligently and with the school committee as well to get this project teed up.

1336
02:22:00,568 --> 02:22:04,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really glad that we're getting in before this important deadline and I'd happily motion to approve.

1337
02:22:08,192 --> 02:22:08,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1338
02:22:08,712 --> 02:22:09,653
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Sang.

1339
02:22:11,828 --> 02:22:15,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I was gonna second the motion, but Matt got there before I did.

1340
02:22:17,193 --> 02:22:22,217
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna thank you for coming back to us with the answers to the questions that we had last week.

1341
02:22:22,698 --> 02:22:28,183
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a tight turnaround, so I'm grateful that you were able to get so detailed into the analysis.

1342
02:22:29,164 --> 02:22:37,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, the real kind of trade-off between up-front costs and savings is real, given that we have

1343
02:22:39,128 --> 02:22:42,911
[SPEAKER_17]: At least $85 million in school repairs that we need to do over the next few years.

1344
02:22:43,091 --> 02:22:46,193
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I think the upfront cost element is really important here.

1345
02:22:48,054 --> 02:22:53,898
[SPEAKER_17]: I was at the McGlynn when we put in the wind turbine and when the Andrews got their solar panels.

1346
02:22:54,579 --> 02:22:59,562
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember it being such a coup, something truly exciting for the community.

1347
02:23:00,983 --> 02:23:07,288
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm hoping this will do the same for our community as well, to rally around environmental efforts and

1348
02:23:08,335 --> 02:23:10,396
[SPEAKER_17]: better energy efficiency in our city.

1349
02:23:11,136 --> 02:23:11,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1350
02:23:13,957 --> 02:23:14,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1351
02:23:15,618 --> 02:23:16,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Brenda, I had one question.

1352
02:23:16,878 --> 02:23:18,659
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks like no more questions from the council.

1353
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:32,464
[SPEAKER_26]: So as I'm reading this, the power purchase agreement, which is what we're doing, the PPA over the 20-year term saves a total of about 1.6 million.

1354
02:23:33,285 --> 02:23:36,086
[SPEAKER_26]: And then if we were to buy them,

1355
02:23:38,707 --> 02:23:41,248
[SPEAKER_26]: we would have an upfront cost of that $1.2 million.

1356
02:23:43,368 --> 02:23:48,830
[SPEAKER_26]: And then does the term savings, like do I need to subtract the $1 million from the term savings?

1357
02:23:49,150 --> 02:23:51,370
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's factored into the term savings.

1358
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:52,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1359
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:56,751
[SPEAKER_03]: What's not factored into the term savings is any cost of money if the city were to bond for the project.

1360
02:23:56,771 --> 02:24:01,773
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so like interest costs over the 20-year bond at even the municipal rate.

1361
02:24:01,873 --> 02:24:06,874
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I won't try to do back of the napkin math, but yeah, essentially,

1362
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:20,857
[SPEAKER_26]: The question here is if that bonding cost is more than $800,000, then it's a wash or actually less for us to, we would save less if we bought them, essentially.

1363
02:24:21,237 --> 02:24:21,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that the math?

1364
02:24:22,018 --> 02:24:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the question.

1365
02:24:22,918 --> 02:24:23,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

1366
02:24:25,139 --> 02:24:26,960
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, well, that was my only question.

1367
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:29,682
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyone else have any questions on this?

1368
02:24:32,783 --> 02:24:34,664
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none and,

1369
02:24:36,598 --> 02:24:50,629
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing no comments by members of the public on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming to approve the authorization of the city to enter into a contract term greater than three years for this project.

1370
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:52,590
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1371
02:24:55,132 --> 02:24:55,653

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

02:25:01,597 --> 02:25:02,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lemming.

1378
02:25:02,238 --> 02:25:02,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1379
02:25:03,805 --> 02:25:04,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scott Pelly.

1380
02:25:04,725 --> 02:25:05,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scott Pelly is absent.

1381
02:25:06,086 --> 02:25:06,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Hussain.

1382
02:25:08,207 --> 02:25:08,827
[SPEAKER_20]: President Beers.

1383
02:25:09,287 --> 02:25:09,508

02:26:27,489 --> 02:26:28,650

1405
02:26:30,051 --> 02:26:33,233

02:27:09,413 --> 02:27:15,858

1426
02:27:15,918 --> 02:27:23,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear President Beers and City Councilors, on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

1427
02:27:24,385 --> 02:27:34,810
[SPEAKER_26]: requesting the appropriation of $40,000 from the CPA Open Space Reserve to the City of Medford's Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to fund additional contingency needs for the Riverside Plaza Shade Improvements Project.

1428
02:27:35,310 --> 02:27:37,611
[SPEAKER_26]: This project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

1429
02:27:37,691 --> 02:27:40,072
[SPEAKER_26]: CPC recommendation letter is attached and incorporated.

1430
02:27:41,092 --> 02:27:44,054
[SPEAKER_26]: CPA Manager Teresa Dupont will be in attendance to address the council.

1431
02:27:44,134 --> 02:27:45,294
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your consideration.

1432
02:27:45,374 --> 02:27:47,435
[SPEAKER_26]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lindow-Kern, Mayor.

1433
02:27:48,155 --> 02:27:51,897
[SPEAKER_26]: We have here essentially the same thing, conditions of approval.

1434
02:27:52,397 --> 02:27:53,578
[SPEAKER_26]: The project shall have

1435
02:27:54,546 --> 02:28:05,819
[SPEAKER_26]: public engagement opportunities on final design choices and the project is to result in no net reduction to tree canopy and ensure all displaced trees are replanted in an appropriate location or replaced in kind.

1436
02:28:06,359 --> 02:28:11,886
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll recognize Manager DuPont and we also have Amanda Centralla here from Planning Development and Sustainability.

1437
02:28:12,206 --> 02:28:15,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Didn't see you there, but we'll let you talk too, but I'll go to Teresa first.

1438
02:28:17,125 --> 02:28:19,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, President Behrs and esteemed members of this council.

1439
02:28:20,027 --> 02:28:31,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here before you tonight, as you just mentioned, to ask for your support and approval of a recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee to appropriate $40,000 of CPA funds.

1440
02:28:32,398 --> 02:28:38,162
[SPEAKER_09]: This is additional contingency funding for a project that this body has supported in the past.

1441
02:28:38,302 --> 02:28:42,206
[SPEAKER_09]: In the fiscal 25 CPA funding round, it received $146,000 of funding.

1442
02:28:44,752 --> 02:28:54,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Just as a refresher for everybody, this project would see permanent shade structures on the plaza surface, a bottle filler as well as an ADA accessible gathering platform.

1443
02:28:56,199 --> 02:29:02,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let planner Cinchella, I want to give her the opportunity to speak to any additional specifics, but essentially when this first went out to bid.

1444
02:29:04,178 --> 02:29:08,522
[SPEAKER_09]: The bids received exceeded our initial project estimates.

1445
02:29:08,922 --> 02:29:17,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Planner Central did an excellent job working with our landscape architect consultants to reconfigure the design while still meeting the needs of the plaza.

1446
02:29:18,350 --> 02:29:23,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather than three shade sales, now it is one large one behind the performance area.

1447
02:29:24,374 --> 02:29:30,839
[SPEAKER_09]: To address the additional shade needs of the plaza, we're looking at permanent metal umbrellas structures.

1448
02:29:32,552 --> 02:29:39,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So the big large sales, one single sale would be behind the performance areas, which would be great for our musicians, you know.

1449
02:29:40,174 --> 02:29:46,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Performing on that Plaza in the height of the summer is a great thing, but, you know, the shade is a little bit of a tricky situation.

1450
02:29:48,096 --> 02:29:54,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So, overall, this brought us to an achievable budget, you know, the design revisions, while still meeting the needs of the Plaza.

1451
02:29:56,659 --> 02:30:08,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's been a long meeting, but just really quick, I would just like to share that this recommendation is coming ahead of the remainder of our fiscal 26 applications, which will be discussed at our January 20th committee of the whole meeting.

1452
02:30:09,126 --> 02:30:12,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Encourage the public to attend and learn a little bit more about what the CPC is doing.

1453
02:30:13,068 --> 02:30:22,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But for this specific project, we've asked for an expedited determination as there's another grant program that funding this project, the state park grant.

1454
02:30:22,658 --> 02:30:26,840
[SPEAKER_09]: that requires this project to be completed by the end of fiscal 26, which is June 30th.

1455
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:41,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So in order to secure a vendor and a contract to deliver on that deadline, the CPA funding award needs to become available a little bit quicker to the projects so that we can meet that other grant programs deadlines.

1456
02:30:41,226 --> 02:30:48,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I just shared a lot there, but Planner Centrella and I are here to answer any questions from the council and we ask for your support.

1457
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:50,950
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1458
02:30:51,130 --> 02:30:52,331
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll recognize Planner Centrella.

1459
02:30:53,501 --> 02:30:54,721
[SPEAKER_26]: And then we'll go to questions from the council.

1460
02:30:55,422 --> 02:30:55,902
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks, Teresa.

1461
02:30:56,022 --> 02:30:56,682
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, everyone.

1462
02:30:57,222 --> 02:30:58,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you so much for the time tonight.

1463
02:30:58,803 --> 02:30:59,663
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'll be quick.

1464
02:30:59,763 --> 02:31:02,804
[SPEAKER_27]: Teresa did an amazing job summing up the project.

1465
02:31:02,924 --> 02:31:16,789
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'll just add, you know, this what this project does is take a great public space community amenity that is used frequently and makes it more climate resilient and safer to use during the summer.

1466
02:31:16,909 --> 02:31:20,990
[SPEAKER_27]: So creating shade in areas where people are already gathering.

1467
02:31:21,544 --> 02:31:23,606
[SPEAKER_27]: and creating accessible pathways to shade.

1468
02:31:24,466 --> 02:31:33,993
[SPEAKER_27]: So as opposed to folks having to physically drag seating under existing tree canopy, creating an accessible route to use that space.

1469
02:31:34,934 --> 02:31:46,362
[SPEAKER_27]: In addition, we'll be adding a water bottle filling station, which is something that we're trying to do in more of our public spaces, access to water, and creating

1470
02:31:48,693 --> 02:31:50,634
[SPEAKER_27]: cooling hubs in the summer.

1471
02:31:50,835 --> 02:31:55,838
[SPEAKER_27]: So a lot of good things that I think this project will accomplish and make possible.

1472
02:31:56,719 --> 02:32:01,842
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you have any questions about why this timeline or anything like that, I'm happy to answer them.

1473
02:32:05,285 --> 02:32:06,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Amanda.

1474
02:32:06,586 --> 02:32:08,727
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have any questions from members of the council?

1475
02:32:12,570 --> 02:32:15,652
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1476
02:32:21,072 --> 02:32:25,255
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

1477
02:32:27,637 --> 02:32:28,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further discussion?

1478
02:32:30,999 --> 02:32:34,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, by members of the council or members of the public, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1479
02:32:37,605 --> 02:32:38,365

02:33:37,466 --> 02:33:42,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear President Behrs, I'm writing on the capital stabilization fund appropriation request for the NS contract extension.

1501
02:33:43,007 --> 02:33:47,688
[SPEAKER_26]: As I'm sure the council knows, this extension is a result of negotiations and discussions between the mayor and the council.

1502
02:33:48,188 --> 02:33:49,688
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe this appropriation is straightforward.

1503
02:33:49,728 --> 02:33:54,369
[SPEAKER_26]: However, if any questions arise that require the resolution this evening, please feel free to contact me.

[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Nina.

1506
02:34:00,551 --> 02:34:04,191
[SPEAKER_26]: So that is the message from the administration.

1507
02:34:04,912 --> 02:34:06,932
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there any discussion by members of the council?

1508
02:34:09,306 --> 02:34:10,507
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins.

1509
02:34:13,871 --> 02:34:17,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I will very happily motion to approve.

1510
02:34:18,356 --> 02:34:29,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll further indulge myself by saying that I worked very closely with the consultants and associates for the last two years and I was

1511
02:34:31,877 --> 02:34:41,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really, really glad that the city gets the chance to work with them again for the extension of the zoning proposals that will be covered over the next, in the start of the next term.

1512
02:34:42,906 --> 02:34:52,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I was consistently impressed by their depth of knowledge, detail orientation, project management, and their commitment to helping us craft zoning that would improve our city.

1513
02:34:53,875 --> 02:35:00,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also just like to extend my gratitude again to the other members of this body who, with great patience and diligence,

1514
02:35:02,522 --> 02:35:07,144
[SPEAKER_08]: negotiated the future of the zoning project with the mayor.

1515
02:35:07,364 --> 02:35:17,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I was disappointed that it took such incredible striving and effort on the part of councilors to let our community do what it's been trying to do for five years, which is plan.

1516
02:35:18,491 --> 02:35:21,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm really glad that we got there, even though we had to drag the mayor kicking and screaming.

1517
02:35:22,173 --> 02:35:27,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm really, really glad that we're going to get to work together with Innis Associates again at the start of the next term.

[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a comment from members of the public?

1522
02:35:39,699 --> 02:35:42,621
[SPEAKER_26]: I see no hands on Zoom, but we have someone in person.

1523
02:35:43,261 --> 02:35:44,782
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

1524
02:35:44,842 --> 02:35:45,843
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

1525
02:35:46,783 --> 02:35:47,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

1526
02:35:47,304 --> 02:35:48,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick Joliot, Forty Robinson Road.

1527
02:35:49,465 --> 02:35:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I will speak tonight in opposition to this appropriation request.

1528
02:35:53,391 --> 02:35:58,613
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor told us in July that to date the city has spent over $200,000 on Innis Associates.

1529
02:35:59,133 --> 02:35:59,833
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of money.

1530
02:36:00,513 --> 02:36:01,554
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we have to show for it?

1531
02:36:02,354 --> 02:36:09,296
[SPEAKER_04]: A citywide residential rezoning proposal widely recognized to be significantly flawed and not an adequate representation of public opinion.

1532
02:36:10,216 --> 02:36:15,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for second chances, but when it comes to services like this, we have to put our foot down at some point.

1533
02:36:16,118 --> 02:36:22,020
[SPEAKER_04]: If a contractor made a $200,000 mistake in the construction of your house, would you hire them again to do the same job?

1534
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:30,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes little sense to me, and I would hope we can get some transparency on why the city is reelecting, is electing to rehire Innis.

1535
02:36:30,892 --> 02:36:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And I direct you to many of the criticisms that others have raised on whether this firm is actually competent to handle a project of this scale.

1536
02:36:38,374 --> 02:36:41,875
[SPEAKER_04]: So my understanding is that an RFP was released on resuming rezoning.

1537
02:36:41,955 --> 02:36:43,695
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question is, who responded?

1538
02:36:44,236 --> 02:36:48,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And was any serious consideration taken into perhaps other respondents to that?

1539
02:36:49,655 --> 02:36:57,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or is this just us executing the quid pro quo that was negotiated behind closed doors that the public is largely unaware about?

1540
02:36:57,479 --> 02:37:01,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you all to take a step back and reconsider.

1541
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:02,601
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a big commitment.

1542
02:37:02,621 --> 02:37:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at $85,000 more on top of the $200,000 that was already spent.

1543
02:37:08,103 --> 02:37:08,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this worth it?

1544
02:37:10,184 --> 02:37:13,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Residential rezoning came to a screeching halt because of the work INIS did.

1545
02:37:14,828 --> 02:37:18,549
[SPEAKER_04]: on the project, so it's just a really wise idea going back to them.

1546
02:37:19,150 --> 02:37:19,510
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1547
02:37:21,811 --> 02:37:26,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for the comment, and just I know you're talking about the RFP, happy to answer that.

1548
02:37:28,193 --> 02:37:38,037
[SPEAKER_26]: This is an extension on the existing contract for a defined number of topics, Medford Square, and then an RFP will go out.

1549
02:37:38,577 --> 02:37:41,140
[SPEAKER_26]: for residential and that longer list of topics.

1550
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:46,364
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is just going through next spring to address a couple of outstanding things.

1551
02:37:46,384 --> 02:37:54,612
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Bedford Square, some ordinance cleanup and alignment, and then the RFP will go out for all of the other

1552
02:37:55,993 --> 02:37:57,574
[SPEAKER_26]: districts and residential.

1553
02:37:57,894 --> 02:37:58,914
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's no bids yet.

1554
02:37:59,975 --> 02:38:12,483
[SPEAKER_26]: This is an extension of the existing contract that was signed in 2024 and then there will be RFP bidding process and a bidder will be selected for the rest of the project next spring.

1555
02:38:12,783 --> 02:38:14,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So no RFP has gone out to date.

1556
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:17,381
[SPEAKER_26]: Not on this contract extension.

1557
02:38:17,661 --> 02:38:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1558
02:38:18,342 --> 02:38:19,262
[SPEAKER_26]: There'll be an RFP.

1559
02:38:19,422 --> 02:38:22,664
[SPEAKER_26]: There's basically the contracts getting extended for Medford Square.

1560
02:38:23,185 --> 02:38:25,826
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the Tufts Institutional Zone and the ordinance cleanup.

1561
02:38:26,286 --> 02:38:28,067
[SPEAKER_26]: And then an RFP will be drafted.

1562
02:38:28,167 --> 02:38:29,548
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll review it as a council.

1563
02:38:29,608 --> 02:38:30,228
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll approve it.

1564
02:38:30,328 --> 02:38:34,351
[SPEAKER_26]: And then bids will be solicited in the springtime for the rest of the project through 2028.

1565
02:38:34,411 --> 02:38:34,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1566
02:38:34,631 --> 02:38:37,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that clarification.

1567
02:38:37,292 --> 02:38:37,653
[SPEAKER_26]: You're welcome.

1568
02:38:41,535 --> 02:38:41,855
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1569
02:38:42,835 --> 02:38:43,496
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion.

1570
02:38:45,458 --> 02:38:47,840
[SPEAKER_26]: This is an appropriation, so Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1571
02:38:50,482 --> 02:38:51,243
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan?

1572
02:38:51,263 --> 02:38:51,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1573
02:38:55,627 --> 02:38:56,628
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Collins?

1574
02:38:56,648 --> 02:38:58,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1575
02:38:58,069 --> 02:38:58,770
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Zaro?

1576
02:38:58,790 --> 02:38:58,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1577
02:39:01,152 --> 02:39:01,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lemming?

1578
02:39:01,832 --> 02:39:03,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1579
02:39:03,294 --> 02:39:04,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1580
02:39:04,154 --> 02:39:04,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1581
02:39:04,334 --> 02:39:05,556
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1582
02:39:05,716 --> 02:39:06,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Singh?

1583
02:39:06,376 --> 02:39:07,457
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1584
02:39:07,477 --> 02:39:08,018
[SPEAKER_20]: President Peters?

1585
02:39:08,338 --> 02:39:08,558
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1586
02:39:08,598 --> 02:39:09,939
[SPEAKER_26]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1587
02:39:09,959 --> 02:39:10,500
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

1588
02:39:13,087 --> 02:39:19,552
[SPEAKER_26]: 25195, submitted by Mayor Marianna Longo Kern, MOU, Memorandum of Understanding with Mystic Valley Development Corporation.

1589
02:39:19,632 --> 02:39:36,503
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear President Behrs and Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body authorize a Memorandum of Understanding with the Mystic Valley Development Corporation, sorry, Mystic Valley Development Commission, MVDC, under Mass General Law Chapter 40, Section 4A, for payments to the City of Malden covering fiscal years 26 through 30, ranging from $31,683

1590
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:48,522
[SPEAKER_26]: in fiscal 26 to $47,848 in fiscal 30 in connection with the Rivers Edge project.

1591
02:39:48,602 --> 02:39:54,965
[SPEAKER_26]: As the council knows, this agreement is the product of months of discussion and successful negotiations with the MVDC related to the properties at 100 and 200 Rivers Edge Drive.

1592
02:39:56,526 --> 02:40:03,189
[SPEAKER_26]: which are no longer exempt from taxation by the City of Medford under Mass General Law Chapter 59 for fiscal 26 and subsequent years.

1593
02:40:03,549 --> 02:40:10,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Accordingly, those properties were rolled off the pilot agreement and are being taxed as part of the negotiations in the interest of avoiding litigation between the parties.

1594
02:40:10,593 --> 02:40:13,374
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford agreed to mitigate the financial impact on Malden through these payments.

1595
02:40:13,854 --> 02:40:19,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Chief Assessor Jared Edgian will be present to provide the council with an overview and answer questions.

1596
02:40:19,257 --> 02:40:20,578
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your kind attention in this matter.

1597
02:40:20,618 --> 02:40:23,419
[SPEAKER_26]: Respectfully submitted, Briana Lungokern, Mayor.

1598
02:40:23,999 --> 02:40:25,320
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have our assessor here.

1599
02:40:26,269 --> 02:40:27,991
[SPEAKER_26]: Anything you'd like to add in addition to the memo?

1600
02:40:29,032 --> 02:40:30,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Summed up pretty well there.

1601
02:40:30,713 --> 02:40:41,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Dovetails into that conversation we had on the 28th with the appropriation for the upgrade to the accounting software.

1602
02:40:42,224 --> 02:40:48,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the product of getting that additional monies that is going to go towards that accounting software.

1603
02:40:50,681 --> 02:40:50,961
[SPEAKER_26]: Got it.

1604
02:40:52,481 --> 02:40:57,263
[SPEAKER_26]: And basically, this is, Malden was getting some pilot payments for Rivers Edge.

1605
02:40:58,203 --> 02:40:58,743
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

1606
02:40:58,843 --> 02:41:02,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So it flows through or comes down from, we take out expenses.

1607
02:41:03,004 --> 02:41:09,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So Malden, you can think of the MBC as its own small city, if you will, with essentially two cities right now in it.

1608
02:41:09,846 --> 02:41:12,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And Medford has the majority of the property.

1609
02:41:12,647 --> 02:41:16,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they come off the pilot payment after 15 years, there was some,

1610
02:41:17,802 --> 02:41:20,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaguely written legislation in the original documentation.

1611
02:41:21,324 --> 02:41:25,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Malden did not agree with us that it rolled back or rolled off to Medford.

1612
02:41:25,367 --> 02:41:27,388
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it would stay in in perpetuity.

1613
02:41:28,329 --> 02:41:31,471
[SPEAKER_01]: They had threatened litigation, and we went through months of discussion.

1614
02:41:32,131 --> 02:41:36,554
[SPEAKER_01]: So they never prepared to have less money flow to them, basically.

1615
02:41:37,274 --> 02:41:43,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So through this discussion, we had agreed to a five-year term where it would reduce the impact to their

1616
02:41:45,779 --> 02:42:03,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And going forward, which sets a great precedent, there will be no misinterpretation of the properties coming back to Medford, which we have five currently and two more being built that will be the same exempt to taxable new growth when they exceed their 15 years in the MVDC.

1617
02:42:04,623 --> 02:42:04,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Got it.

1618
02:42:07,644 --> 02:42:09,564
[SPEAKER_26]: Any questions by members of the council on this one?

1619
02:42:12,985 --> 02:42:14,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1620
02:42:16,753 --> 02:42:21,894
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1621
02:42:21,914 --> 02:42:23,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1622
02:42:27,775 --> 02:42:28,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan?

1623
02:42:28,536 --> 02:42:30,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1624
02:42:30,256 --> 02:42:31,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Collins?

1625
02:42:31,256 --> 02:42:31,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1626
02:42:32,416 --> 02:42:33,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lazaro?

1627
02:42:33,097 --> 02:42:33,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1628
02:42:34,237 --> 02:42:34,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lemming?

1629
02:42:34,877 --> 02:42:36,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1630
02:42:36,437 --> 02:42:37,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1631
02:42:37,358 --> 02:42:38,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1632
02:42:38,558 --> 02:42:39,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Singh?

1633
02:42:39,198 --> 02:42:40,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1634
02:42:40,238 --> 02:42:40,718
[SPEAKER_20]: President Pierce?

1635
02:42:41,098 --> 02:42:41,358
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1636
02:42:41,518 --> 02:42:42,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1637
02:42:42,619 --> 02:42:43,439
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes.

1638
02:42:43,519 --> 02:42:43,779
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1652
02:43:57,046 --> 02:43:59,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lingo-Kern, Mayor.

1653
02:43:59,326 --> 02:44:01,847
[SPEAKER_26]: And I believe those are weekly salary numbers.

1654
02:44:02,767 --> 02:44:03,167
[SPEAKER_26]: That's correct.

1655
02:44:03,187 --> 02:44:03,747
[SPEAKER_26]: That I read out.

1656
02:44:04,067 --> 02:44:04,407
[SPEAKER_26]: Wonderful.

1657
02:44:04,507 --> 02:44:05,628
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, we got Tim and Owen.

1658
02:44:07,068 --> 02:44:07,668
[SPEAKER_26]: Let us know what's up.

1659
02:44:07,708 --> 02:44:08,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, go ahead.

1660
02:44:08,208 --> 02:44:09,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it to you for details.

1661
02:44:11,685 --> 02:44:15,911
[SPEAKER_13]: We have had these positions or variations of these positions open for quite some time.

1662
02:44:15,931 --> 02:44:26,524
[SPEAKER_13]: We're having trouble hiring assistant city engineer level engineers, and we are having trouble hiring project manager level engineers, managers really.

1663
02:44:27,205 --> 02:44:40,514
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is an attempt to see if we can attract assistant city engineers and see if we can attract some candidates that have less qualifications for the project manager position.

1664
02:44:40,575 --> 02:44:51,162
[SPEAKER_13]: So we reduced the project manager position and created a new class for it, the 16.5 class, and we took the both assistant city engineer positions

1665
02:44:51,759 --> 02:45:00,525
[SPEAKER_13]: and we moved them into a half-calf, so another half-calf, to bump them up a bit in pay to be more competitive in the marketplace.

1666
02:45:01,145 --> 02:45:06,189
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you know, Owen is here with any details about these positions and what they do.

1667
02:45:06,549 --> 02:45:07,750
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for considering.

1668
02:45:09,351 --> 02:45:09,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1669
02:45:10,331 --> 02:45:11,132
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Lemming.

1670
02:45:13,667 --> 02:45:24,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah this is something that I previously have had a couple of conversations with Todd about just trying to get an idea of the capacity of the city.

1671
02:45:26,374 --> 02:45:29,935
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's something that I've been really thinking about going into this next budget season.

1672
02:45:29,955 --> 02:45:30,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you just.

1673
02:45:31,588 --> 02:45:34,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Give us an idea of some of the numbers.

1674
02:45:34,350 --> 02:45:37,151
[SPEAKER_22]: How long have these positions been vacant?

1675
02:45:37,271 --> 02:45:43,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Are these numbers competitive with surrounding communities so that you think that they will attract?

1676
02:45:43,875 --> 02:45:48,977
[SPEAKER_22]: And how long do we sort of have to wait to see if these numbers actually will attract somebody who will stay here?

1677
02:45:48,997 --> 02:45:54,040
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this was a bit of an issue with the city solicitor.

1678
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:57,242
[SPEAKER_22]: We had to bump it by 20,000 just to attract somebody.

1679
02:45:57,922 --> 02:46:09,705
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are this adjustment should keep us in line with the surrounding municipalities so that these positions will align with the pay rate and other cities.

1680
02:46:11,466 --> 02:46:18,808
[SPEAKER_21]: These have been vacant since April and we're just not having the resumes come in.

1681
02:46:19,168 --> 02:46:28,193
[SPEAKER_21]: So we want to continue the work that we're doing at the level that we're doing and way to do that is to have the staff on board so that we can continue this.

1682
02:46:29,153 --> 02:46:37,237
[SPEAKER_22]: And they've been vacant since April but have have they sort of have you had historically had problems with retention in these positions even before April.

1683
02:46:37,338 --> 02:46:41,100
[SPEAKER_21]: No the last one was here for like three years three and a half years.

1684
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:41,940
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah.

1685
02:46:41,960 --> 02:46:45,482
[SPEAKER_21]: And the one before that 19 years.

1686
02:46:45,502 --> 02:46:45,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1687
02:46:45,622 --> 02:46:45,702
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1688
02:46:48,470 --> 02:47:00,754
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I just want to add on that these particular positions, the assistant city engineer positions as well as the project manager positions, spend the capital money that we use.

1689
02:47:01,234 --> 02:47:05,756
[SPEAKER_13]: So without these positions, we're not, you know, spending that money.

1690
02:47:06,276 --> 02:47:14,339
[SPEAKER_13]: So the way that this office works really is what the projects from last year are sort of, you know, coming to an end.

1691
02:47:14,879 --> 02:47:17,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're trying to ramp up projects for next year.

1692
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Without city engineers in the office to do that, basically Owen and some helpers right now, it makes it very difficult to queue up those projects and spend the money that we need to be spending.

1693
02:47:29,245 --> 02:47:34,267
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I understand that if a position goes unfilled, the money doesn't go to waste.

1694
02:47:34,307 --> 02:47:37,628
[SPEAKER_22]: But I really would like to see the positions filled.

1695
02:47:37,648 --> 02:47:41,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Does this encompass the traffic engineers that have been?

1696
02:47:41,850 --> 02:47:41,890
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1697
02:47:43,112 --> 02:47:49,935
[SPEAKER_22]: OK so how beside besides these how many others are there within engineering.

1698
02:47:50,635 --> 02:47:55,378
[SPEAKER_21]: We have that are vacant for open positions right now for open positions.

1699
02:47:55,418 --> 02:47:59,339
[SPEAKER_22]: And how long have those positions been open to have been since April.

1700
02:47:59,639 --> 02:48:01,040
[SPEAKER_21]: And one will be a new position.

1701
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:03,321
[SPEAKER_21]: So within the past six months.

1702
02:48:03,921 --> 02:48:04,162
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1703
02:48:04,562 --> 02:48:08,924
[SPEAKER_22]: And those that that includes a traffic engineer position that traffic engineer is separate.

1704
02:48:09,104 --> 02:48:11,685
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't involve any of this that we're discussing tonight.

1705
02:48:12,733 --> 02:48:12,833
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1706
02:48:13,093 --> 02:48:13,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1707
02:48:14,114 --> 02:48:15,515
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand we're just discussing these two.

1708
02:48:15,535 --> 02:48:19,537
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just trying to get a more sort of holistic view of some of the vacancy issues within.

1709
02:48:19,978 --> 02:48:20,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1710
02:48:20,438 --> 02:48:23,700
[SPEAKER_21]: We have been unable to fill that position for quite some time.

1711
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,601
[SPEAKER_21]: We're still looking for like the right fit.

1712
02:48:27,182 --> 02:48:30,804
[SPEAKER_21]: And we just had a few interviews this week or last week.

1713
02:48:32,145 --> 02:48:34,927
[SPEAKER_21]: But you know we're still looking for people.

1714
02:48:35,027 --> 02:48:35,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1715
02:48:35,489 --> 02:48:45,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, what I'm getting at is, are there more positions that probably need wage adjustments in order to attract qualified candidates other than the ones that we're just looking at now?

1716
02:48:45,453 --> 02:48:54,937
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I am glad to see that we're adjusting wages on our current positions, but I just want to know, is this like a systemic issue with an engineer?

1717
02:48:55,917 --> 02:48:56,597
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't say that.

1718
02:48:56,817 --> 02:48:59,378
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't I can't speak for the other positions at this time.

1719
02:49:00,038 --> 02:49:08,541
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really more prepared for the ones that were one of these two positions the assistant city engineer which is to open positions and then the project manager position position.

1720
02:49:09,541 --> 02:49:19,665
[SPEAKER_21]: My idea is that or my hope is that we can maintain the level of workload that we're doing this year with moving into next year.

1721
02:49:19,825 --> 02:49:23,906
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I'm trying to queue up April 1st that we can hit the ground running.

1722
02:49:24,166 --> 02:49:29,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, this is something, yeah, I understand if you don't have all the details in front of you right now.

1723
02:49:29,712 --> 02:49:34,438
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that I'm very interested in going into budget season.

1724
02:49:35,579 --> 02:49:42,687
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you, in the next couple months, just be able to, I guess, think about that.

1725
02:49:44,288 --> 02:49:55,093
[SPEAKER_13]: I will assure you that we're constantly looking at this, and the reason why we're here tonight is because these particular positions have just shown very little movement in the market.

1726
02:49:55,673 --> 02:50:01,116
[SPEAKER_13]: So in other words, we're seeing resumes, but no one is qualified for the Assistant City Engineer positions.

1727
02:50:01,456 --> 02:50:02,937
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not getting qualified candidates.

1728
02:50:02,957 --> 02:50:04,177
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been that way since April.

1729
02:50:06,118 --> 02:50:10,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Some come in, but then we interview them and it doesn't work out, you know, for one reason or another.

1730
02:50:11,202 --> 02:50:13,603
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need to be attracting better candidates for that particular role.

1731
02:50:14,204 --> 02:50:17,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's a different problem with the project manager positions.

1732
02:50:17,246 --> 02:50:25,431
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying something different here by reducing the pay and reducing the qualifications to see if we can get folks in the door and train them to where we need to be.

1733
02:50:26,352 --> 02:50:32,836
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, so now we'll effectively have a junior project manager and a senior project manager in the engineering division.

1734
02:50:33,631 --> 02:50:41,244
[SPEAKER_13]: There are other positions that have been open for quite some time in engineering, and you're talking about one of them, but we are seeing candidates, so it's a little bit different.

1735
02:50:41,265 --> 02:50:42,948
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just trying to find the right fit.

1736
02:50:43,068 --> 02:50:44,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's taking a long time for sure.

1737
02:50:44,651 --> 02:50:45,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

1738
02:50:47,458 --> 02:50:50,100
[SPEAKER_13]: There are other issues, it's not just compensation.

1739
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:54,642
[SPEAKER_13]: There are other things, but compensation is one thing to be competitive in the marketplace.

1740
02:50:55,122 --> 02:51:02,526
[SPEAKER_13]: So that one is on sort of my list, thinking about the DPW as a whole, as positions that need to be looked at.

1741
02:51:03,327 --> 02:51:04,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah.

1742
02:51:04,608 --> 02:51:06,749
[SPEAKER_22]: The goal with the DPW is really to have

1743
02:51:07,587 --> 02:51:17,214
[SPEAKER_22]: to attract good people, and not only that, but attract good people who will stay there for a long period of time, and not just see this as a stepping stone to something else, or it just doesn't work out.

1744
02:51:17,274 --> 02:51:30,084
[SPEAKER_22]: So anything that you can think of, either whether it's related to compensation, which I think is always a huge component of it, or if there's something else, we'd be interested in hearing about that, and that's all I got, so thank you.

1745
02:51:30,484 --> 02:51:30,724
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1746
02:51:33,266 --> 02:51:35,068
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further questions for these guys?

1747
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:38,790
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry, I have one.

1748
02:51:40,591 --> 02:51:43,193
[SPEAKER_26]: We created a civil project manager position.

1749
02:51:43,213 --> 02:51:45,914
[SPEAKER_26]: Is this, this is different from that?

1750
02:51:47,075 --> 02:51:47,335
[SPEAKER_26]: This is?

1751
02:51:48,096 --> 02:51:48,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

1752
02:51:48,356 --> 02:52:00,483
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a little bit, it's similar, but it's more of like a junior role versus it has a little less of the criteria that would be associated with the civil version.

1753
02:52:00,823 --> 02:52:01,103
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1754
02:52:02,384 --> 02:52:03,565
[SPEAKER_26]: And is that position filled?

1755
02:52:04,125 --> 02:52:04,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

1756
02:52:04,765 --> 02:52:05,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1757
02:52:05,306 --> 02:52:05,586
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1758
02:52:06,706 --> 02:52:07,467
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1759
02:52:09,683 --> 02:52:12,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that's a long time to be going without two assistant city engineers.

1760
02:52:12,765 --> 02:52:13,485
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah.

1761
02:52:13,946 --> 02:52:19,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, Tim and I both really want to keep the, you know, projects going.

1762
02:52:19,489 --> 02:52:28,755
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of infrastructure work that we want to do, and I'll be back in front of you guys here in a month or so talking about our next year, what we plan to do.

1763
02:52:28,935 --> 02:52:29,716
[SPEAKER_26]: Plans for next year?

1764
02:52:29,776 --> 02:52:30,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1765
02:52:30,436 --> 02:52:31,537
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to reach out to me, we can.

1766
02:52:32,555 --> 02:52:39,099
[SPEAKER_26]: find a time maybe we can get you a dedicated meeting where we don't have 15 things on the agenda.

1767
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:41,301
[SPEAKER_14]: You let me know.

1768
02:52:41,921 --> 02:52:43,662
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm saying, ask questions.

1769
02:52:43,682 --> 02:52:47,244
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we've been here for a bit.

1770
02:52:47,265 --> 02:52:47,345
[SPEAKER_14]: More?

1771
02:52:47,365 --> 02:52:48,105
[SPEAKER_14]: More questions?

1772
02:52:49,826 --> 02:52:50,607
[SPEAKER_26]: They're here now.

1773
02:52:50,627 --> 02:52:53,909
[SPEAKER_26]: We can't send them home without having answered some good questions.

1774
02:52:55,750 --> 02:52:57,591
[SPEAKER_26]: No, but I mean, I think all of this makes sense.

1775
02:52:59,188 --> 02:53:03,414
[SPEAKER_26]: But I do share, personally, I just share, I want you guys to have the staffing you need to get the work done.

1776
02:53:03,454 --> 02:53:08,582
[SPEAKER_26]: It's really hard when four open positions in an office of, what, 12?

1777
02:53:09,002 --> 02:53:09,303
[SPEAKER_26]: No?

1778
02:53:11,186 --> 02:53:11,666
[SPEAKER_26]: Eight?

1779
02:53:11,907 --> 02:53:12,087
[SPEAKER_26]: Eight?

1780
02:53:14,517 --> 02:53:15,878
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe I'm counting Todd's people.

1781
02:53:16,518 --> 02:53:17,318
[SPEAKER_26]: That's including Todd.

1782
02:53:17,598 --> 02:53:19,399
[SPEAKER_26]: Todd's in the engineering division, for sure.

1783
02:53:19,579 --> 02:53:19,980
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, great.

1784
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:21,680
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so you're at half staff.

1785
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:23,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, right now.

1786
02:53:23,481 --> 02:53:25,242
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's very apparent.

1787
02:53:25,522 --> 02:53:26,843
[SPEAKER_26]: So we need to make a half-calf.

1788
02:53:27,043 --> 02:53:28,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and that's what I was talking about.

1789
02:53:28,183 --> 02:53:33,446
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the folks who actually write the contracts that go out to bid that are worth millions of dollars and spend that money.

1790
02:53:33,566 --> 02:53:38,288
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to see a little bit of a lull, but we're trying to prevent a bigger lull.

1791
02:53:38,748 --> 02:53:41,309
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to get the next construction season on schedule.

1792
02:53:41,369 --> 02:53:41,589
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.

1793
02:53:43,182 --> 02:53:45,143
[SPEAKER_26]: That's helpful to understand the timing on it too.

1794
02:53:46,064 --> 02:53:46,664
[SPEAKER_26]: So close.

1795
02:53:47,364 --> 02:53:48,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1796
02:53:49,385 --> 02:53:50,526
[SPEAKER_26]: Well we can get it done tonight.

1797
02:53:51,707 --> 02:53:53,227
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I'll have part.

1798
02:53:53,247 --> 02:53:55,949
[SPEAKER_13]: There's other pieces that this is this done tonight.

1799
02:53:55,969 --> 02:53:57,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we get some more steps.

1800
02:53:58,230 --> 02:53:58,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1801
02:53:58,830 --> 02:53:59,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Well I feel good about it.

1802
02:53:59,991 --> 02:54:01,912
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further questions from members of the council.

1803
02:54:03,333 --> 02:54:03,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none.

1804

[SPEAKER_20]: You're good to go.

1831
02:54:54,295 --> 02:54:55,495
[SPEAKER_26]: Just got to get the mayor to sign it.

1832
02:54:55,635 --> 02:54:55,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1833
02:54:56,036 --> 02:54:56,476
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one.

1834
02:54:57,477 --> 02:54:59,458
[SPEAKER_26]: You could have come up for the picture with Kit.

1835
02:55:01,359 --> 02:55:03,741
Yeah.

1836
02:55:04,982 --> 02:55:05,642
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

1837
02:55:06,643 --> 02:55:07,203
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

1838
02:55:08,484 --> 02:55:08,804
[SPEAKER_26]: You know?

1839
02:55:10,030 --> 02:55:12,051
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, you're coming on a regular meeting night.

1840
02:55:12,451 --> 02:55:13,771
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what we're doing for your plan.

1841
02:55:13,791 --> 02:55:17,232
[SPEAKER_26]: I want 20 resolutions on that agenda.

1842
02:55:25,335 --> 02:55:26,095
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks, you guys.

1843
02:55:27,275 --> 02:55:31,277
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, we have four more things to do.

1844
02:55:34,135 --> 02:55:36,816
[SPEAKER_26]: That's communications from the mayor, so we're back to the regular order of business.

1845
02:55:36,876 --> 02:55:46,780
[SPEAKER_26]: We have 25191 offered by Councillor Lemming, whereas the mayor and city council agreed as written in press release unanimously endorsed at the December 2nd city council meeting.

1846
02:55:47,283 --> 02:55:56,928
[SPEAKER_26]: that we would use the version of the zoning amendment neighborhood residential and urban residential districts as referred to the community development board on March 25th, 2025 as a starting point in future residential rezoning.

1847
02:55:57,489 --> 02:56:00,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the city council withdraw this zoning amendment proposal.

1848
02:56:01,251 --> 02:56:07,074
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that we notify the community development board that they do not need to consider it further until the city council submits a draft in the future.

1849
02:56:07,594 --> 02:56:13,458
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the residential rezoning draft approved by the city council on March 27th be referred back to the planning and permitting committee.

1850
02:56:13,978 --> 02:56:23,247
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the council also withdraw paper 2 5 0 8 6 accessory dwelling units from the community development board for concurrent development within the city council's planning and permitting committee.

1851
02:56:23,287 --> 02:56:24,188
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lemming.

1852
02:56:27,871 --> 02:56:32,956
[SPEAKER_26]: We know it's different.

1853
02:56:33,156 --> 02:56:34,017
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lemming.

1854
02:56:35,718 --> 02:56:35,858
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1855
02:56:36,338 --> 02:56:46,785
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is basically just keeping with the very public quid pro quo that we went over at the meeting two weeks ago.

1856
02:56:46,805 --> 02:56:54,010
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to go to the press release, that was released jointly by the mayor and city council, you can.

1857
02:56:54,470 --> 02:56:59,894
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, we agreed to withdraw the

1858
02:57:01,145 --> 02:57:22,768
[SPEAKER_22]: Version of the residential zoning proposal from the community development board, which they're scheduled to meet on tomorrow So I think it's best to do this now in order to avoid any confusion and just sort of make the messaging very About what we're doing as simple as possible to residents this would

1859
02:57:23,848 --> 02:57:34,951
[SPEAKER_22]: that we still have the version of the residential rezoning proposal that we approved in March as a starting point when we get to that in the rezoning process.

1860
02:57:36,071 --> 02:57:41,012
[SPEAKER_22]: And we can continue to work on it as one proposal in the planning and permitting committee.

1861
02:57:41,052 --> 02:57:46,473
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's, I talked about this with the mayor prior to forming the press release.

1862
02:57:46,513 --> 02:57:52,275
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it is good to have at least a starting point so that residents can have something to look at.

1863
02:57:53,695 --> 02:58:01,678
[SPEAKER_22]: when they're getting an idea of what's in the pipeline for the residential rezoning proposal.

1864
02:58:02,318 --> 02:58:08,300
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think the paper that was originally approved by this body on March 25th is good for that.

1865
02:58:09,941 --> 02:58:14,522
[SPEAKER_22]: And I said that if we just killed the entire thing and just started from scratch,

1866
02:58:16,403 --> 02:58:19,366
[SPEAKER_22]: It could potentially be more confusing than anything.

1867
02:58:20,527 --> 02:58:35,561
[SPEAKER_22]: It's essential when continuing the residential rezoning process that we hold neighborhood meetings, that we make rezoning as clear as possible to the residents.

1868
02:58:36,942 --> 02:58:46,430
[SPEAKER_22]: It is also important to clarify that when we do get back to work on this in the future, that this is a working document.

1869
02:58:46,530 --> 02:58:47,290
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a draft.

1870
02:58:48,291 --> 02:58:52,835
[SPEAKER_22]: And yeah, I look forward to continuing to work on this.

1871
02:58:53,795 --> 02:59:08,359
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that the communications consultant that Council will be working with, Council and PDS will be working with when we continue this will also really help out in the process.

1872
02:59:10,079 --> 02:59:11,120
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's what this is, thank you.

1873
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:19,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to approve and follow all of the motions outlined in the resolution.

1874
02:59:21,320 --> 02:59:23,221
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1875
02:59:23,442 --> 02:59:24,683
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan.

1876
02:59:27,665 --> 02:59:27,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1877
02:59:29,106 --> 02:59:29,566
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, great.

1878
02:59:30,287 --> 02:59:38,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, just to clarify, Councilor Lemming, just to make it crystal clear, we are withdrawing the residential proposal that's currently with the Community Development Board.

1879
02:59:40,494 --> 02:59:45,198
[SPEAKER_26]: The version that the council will consider as a starting point once the

1880
02:59:46,327 --> 03:00:06,778
[SPEAKER_26]: New RFP is out and we're working on, you know, once we have a new contract for zoning consultant would be the council's original proposal, not the community development board, the mayor's appointee's proposal which was from May, which was much, much, which significantly increased from the proposal that this council voted on.

1881
03:00:08,139 --> 03:00:08,419
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1882
03:00:08,619 --> 03:00:09,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yes, councilman.

1883
03:00:10,830 --> 03:00:20,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, doing this effectively zeroes out the work that the Community Development Board did between March and May.

1884
03:00:21,458 --> 03:00:28,603
[SPEAKER_22]: And it means that we would get to work on this and develop it more in the Planning and Permitting Committee in the future.

1885
03:00:29,063 --> 03:00:38,309
[SPEAKER_22]: And then once we got to a stopping point where we could vote on it again, then we would restart the process and refer it again to the Community Development Board anew.

1886
03:00:40,030 --> 03:00:43,951
[SPEAKER_22]: in the future, but this would be per our agreement after the RFP.

1887
03:00:44,951 --> 03:00:45,131
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

1888
03:00:45,512 --> 03:00:45,652
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1889
03:00:45,892 --> 03:00:46,272
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1890
03:00:46,432 --> 03:00:47,252
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1891
03:00:47,272 --> 03:00:53,013
[SPEAKER_22]: And planning also requested that the accessory dwelling unit paper was paired with that.

1892
03:00:53,053 --> 03:00:54,234
[SPEAKER_22]: So I included that too.

1893
03:00:55,114 --> 03:00:55,294
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1894
03:00:55,634 --> 03:00:55,874
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1895
03:00:56,474 --> 03:00:56,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1896
03:00:56,574 --> 03:01:03,296
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, I just wanted to clarify, it's no longer going to be in the Community Development Board.

1897
03:01:04,418 --> 03:01:08,461
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be in the next phase of the zoning project.

1898
03:01:09,842 --> 03:01:13,305
[SPEAKER_26]: Won't even start discussions until at least next spring.

1899
03:01:15,366 --> 03:01:29,657
[SPEAKER_26]: And the starting point for those conversations will be the council's original proposal, not the planning, the Community Development Board's proposal, which was significantly more dense and increased than what the council had proposed.

1900
03:01:31,250 --> 03:01:35,013
[SPEAKER_26]: So just want to be clear about that because there's a bunch of kind of complicated stuff going on here.

1901
03:01:36,294 --> 03:01:40,778
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion of Councilor Lemming to approve, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1902
03:01:41,479 --> 03:01:42,880
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor.

1903
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:43,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1904
03:01:44,201 --> 03:01:44,822
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed.

1905
03:01:45,782 --> 03:01:48,425
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1906
03:01:49,365 --> 03:01:52,228
[SPEAKER_26]: 25192 resolution to withdraw Medford Square, West Medford Square zoning amendment.

1907
03:01:52,748 --> 03:01:55,949
[SPEAKER_26]: and resubmitted separate amendments to Community Development Board for future consideration.

1908
03:01:56,549 --> 03:02:06,312
[SPEAKER_26]: Whereas the Community Development Board expressed interest at a recent meeting to sever the joint Medford Square, West Medford Square papers that are currently under consideration by their bodies but only the council is legally allowed to do so.

1909
03:02:06,852 --> 03:02:21,616
[SPEAKER_26]: Whereas the recent agreement between the council and the mayor called for Medford Square to be considered by the Community Development Board in January and West Medford Square to be only updated pending the ongoing study, be it therefore resolved that the city council withdraw its joint West Medford Square and Medford Square proposal.

1910
03:02:22,176 --> 03:02:24,878
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the proposal be received and placed on file.

1911
03:02:25,298 --> 03:02:30,402
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the proposal be replaced by two separate zoning proposals for Medford Square and West Medford Square.

1912
03:02:30,882 --> 03:02:37,027
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the attached proposal for Medford Square be referred to the Community Development Board for a joint public hearing in January.

1913
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:43,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that the attached proposal for West Medford Square be referred to the City Council Planning and Permitting Committee for further development.

1914
03:02:43,972 --> 03:02:45,573
[SPEAKER_26]: And be it further resolved that we further clarify.

1915
03:02:46,013 --> 03:02:52,055
[SPEAKER_26]: that these are simply the same draft proposals previously under consideration with the only change being that they are legally severed from each other.

1916
03:02:52,295 --> 03:02:53,075
[SPEAKER_26]: Counselor Leving.

1917
03:02:54,916 --> 03:02:55,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1918
03:02:55,236 --> 03:03:00,898
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is a pretty explanatory if you go to the text again if you go to our.

1919
03:03:01,582 --> 03:03:09,646
[SPEAKER_22]: very public deal that we hammered out with the mayor at the last meeting and then released in a joint proposal.

1920
03:03:11,067 --> 03:03:22,392
[SPEAKER_22]: We agreed to consider Medford Square in a joint hearing with the Community Development Board in January which has been tentatively scheduled for January 21st.

1921
03:03:24,293 --> 03:03:34,057
[SPEAKER_22]: so that we could get going on the transom real estate deal, which is one of the, which is something coming down the line that does need Medford Square to be rezoned.

1922
03:03:34,757 --> 03:03:40,039
[SPEAKER_22]: The issue which the Community Development Board discussed at their meeting about this, I think it was in,

1923
03:03:40,948 --> 03:03:54,313
[SPEAKER_22]: June or July or something, but I could have the month wrong there, was that when they were last considering the combined West Medford Square, Medford Square proposal, they did say that they wanted it to be severed, but legally the Community Development Board cannot sever it.

1924
03:03:55,153 --> 03:03:57,834
[SPEAKER_22]: So the mechanism by which I'm handling that

1925
03:03:58,354 --> 03:04:11,696
[SPEAKER_22]: here is to legally withdraw it from the community, withdraw the joint West Medford Square proposal from the Community Development Board and just receive and place on file.

1926
03:04:11,716 --> 03:04:18,758
[SPEAKER_22]: So just get rid of it and then replace it with the two attached proposals, which is literally separate documents.

1927
03:04:18,778 --> 03:04:23,298
[SPEAKER_22]: So they're the same thing as the joint proposal, except they're literally written in two separate documents.

1928
03:04:23,759 --> 03:04:25,519
[SPEAKER_22]: And we would then in this meeting,

1929
03:04:26,199 --> 03:04:34,582
[SPEAKER_22]: approve that and refer it, the Medford Square version, to the community development board so that we can consider it alone in January.

1930
03:04:34,662 --> 03:04:39,364
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, that is exactly the same thing that this council already approved.

1931
03:04:40,565 --> 03:04:54,330
[SPEAKER_22]: And then take the West Medford Square proposal, which we severed from that, and refer it to planning and permitting, which per our agreement with the mayor, we said we would sit on until the SWOT study, the SWOT analysis was finished.

1932
03:04:54,970 --> 03:05:08,922
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a lot of paper moving going on here, but this is all essentially procedural motions to have the proper planning meetings that we need and agreed to have in the future.

1933
03:05:11,464 --> 03:05:12,405
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councillor Lemming.

1934
03:05:12,665 --> 03:05:16,188
[SPEAKER_26]: Any questions by members of the council or discussion?

1935
03:05:19,285 --> 03:05:20,285
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1936
03:05:20,586 --> 03:05:21,246
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to approve.

1937
03:05:21,406 --> 03:05:25,568
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1938
03:05:25,588 --> 03:05:31,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh-oh.

1939
03:05:31,490 --> 03:05:33,331
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it Councilor Callahan?

1940
03:05:33,351 --> 03:05:35,191
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins wants one last second.

1941
03:05:35,211 --> 03:05:38,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we have a third from the Senate?

1942
03:05:38,533 --> 03:05:38,813
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1943
03:05:40,634 --> 03:05:41,534
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further discussion?

1944
03:05:43,275 --> 03:05:45,916
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, all those in favor?

1945
03:05:46,556 --> 03:05:46,656
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1946
03:05:46,956 --> 03:05:47,436
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed?

1947
03:05:47,496 --> 03:05:48,397
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1948
03:05:52,904 --> 03:06:00,510
[SPEAKER_26]: 24036 offered by Vice President Collins, amendment to Chapter 38, Article 2, Overgrowth Ordinance.

1949
03:06:02,211 --> 03:06:04,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins, if you could summarize, please.

1950
03:06:06,334 --> 03:06:07,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be happy to.

1951
03:06:10,277 --> 03:06:12,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we were all hoping to talk more about rats tonight.

1952
03:06:16,552 --> 03:06:17,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry.

1953
03:06:20,863 --> 03:06:21,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, it's getting late.

1954
03:06:25,757 --> 03:06:31,320
[SPEAKER_08]: For most of the term, I've been going back and forth with department heads about an overgrowth ordinance.

1955
03:06:31,720 --> 03:06:32,861
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a new ordinance.

1956
03:06:32,921 --> 03:06:34,582
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be in addition to our code of ordinances.

1957
03:06:35,862 --> 03:06:42,005
[SPEAKER_08]: As most people are aware, throughout the term, starting last term in fact, we've been going through the process of adding to our code.

1958
03:06:42,025 --> 03:06:42,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, the hats are really.

1959
03:06:42,906 --> 03:06:46,888
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, it's fine.

1960
03:06:48,048 --> 03:06:48,349
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

1961
03:06:48,369 --> 03:06:48,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll power through.

1962
03:06:56,535 --> 03:06:58,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad there's a wide shot so people can see what I'm laughing at.

1963
03:07:01,686 --> 03:07:02,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming back to it.

1964
03:07:05,082 --> 03:07:25,663
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been working on a coordinated set of updates to our code of ordinances that are aimed at both targeting kind of sundry violations that impact quality of life for residents in Medford and also enhance our board of health and code inspectors ability to do their routine work of preventing

1965
03:07:26,383 --> 03:07:29,165
[SPEAKER_08]: public health hazards in Medford.

1966
03:07:30,265 --> 03:07:33,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Broadly, we're talking about rodents, but it doesn't just pertain to rodent activity.

1967
03:07:34,387 --> 03:07:40,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So the overgrowth ordinance, we have met, I think, probably four times in committee on this over the past year.

1968
03:07:41,011 --> 03:07:47,914
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been developed in really close coordination with Director O'Connor and also input from the building department, Commissioner McGivern.

1969
03:07:48,334 --> 03:07:53,437
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not going to really go into any detail about it right now, unless people have specific questions, I'm happy to speak to it.

1970
03:07:54,738 --> 03:08:08,771
[SPEAKER_08]: This initially came up because there wasn't a mechanism in our code of ordinances for if overgrowth on private property was growing so tall and so long that it was actually affecting other people and creating these public health hazards.

1971
03:08:09,151 --> 03:08:11,414
[SPEAKER_08]: We needed a way for the city to intervene in those cases.

1972
03:08:13,015 --> 03:08:16,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It has already provided the issue of what if it's,

1973
03:08:19,102 --> 03:08:28,645
[SPEAKER_08]: preventing people from crossing the sidewalk, it's making being a pedestrian hard for people in wheelchairs, people with strollers, that's already provided for under jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works.

1974
03:08:28,785 --> 03:08:46,429
[SPEAKER_08]: But this whole issue of what if somebody's overgrowth on their private property is creating conditions where rodents can thrive or it's creating standing water that's really great breeding ground for mosquitoes, these public health hazards that really extend beyond the bounds of just somebody's private property and start causing hazards for other residents in Medford.

1975
03:08:46,969 --> 03:08:49,893
[SPEAKER_08]: We needed a way to empower the Board of Health to intervene in those cases.

1976
03:08:49,933 --> 03:08:55,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And the point of this ordinance is not to police how long people's grass is.

1977
03:08:56,079 --> 03:08:57,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not to be punitive.

1978
03:08:58,082 --> 03:09:07,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just so that if an actual problem is occurring, that the city then has a mechanism legally to go to the property owner and work with them to fix it.

1979
03:09:08,855 --> 03:09:18,342
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the overgrowth ordinance and I would motion to approve for first reading unless there are any questions or comments from my fellow Councillors.

1980
03:09:18,703 --> 03:09:18,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1981
03:09:21,605 --> 03:09:26,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Lazaro.

1982
03:09:26,369 --> 03:09:30,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councillor Collins for I just wanted to

1983
03:09:31,833 --> 03:09:54,152
[SPEAKER_10]: bring attention to the fact that Councilor Collins has done a ton of work with the Board of Health on both the Overgrowth Ordinance and the Roadmap Control Ordinance and both of them work very cohesively together to put, I can't wear the hat, to put mechanisms in place to empower our

1984
03:09:56,750 --> 03:10:16,423
[SPEAKER_10]: city levers of power to do some different things to control for rodents in the city and also that Councillor Collins mentioned this but it's not it's not a problem until it's a problem so things don't get

1985
03:10:17,719 --> 03:10:22,761
[SPEAKER_10]: enforced until it's clear that something is in violation.

1986
03:10:22,881 --> 03:10:30,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really not a matter of, it's not like an HOA where somebody is being policed unnecessarily.

1987
03:10:30,303 --> 03:10:37,726
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would second the motion on the overgrowth ordinance.

1988
03:10:38,446 --> 03:10:38,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1989
03:10:41,787 --> 03:10:44,968
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you want first reading or go through the whole thing, your call?

1990
03:10:48,105 --> 03:10:48,746
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazaro.

1991
03:10:49,687 --> 03:10:55,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And can we, yeah, waive the three readings and approve.

1992
03:10:56,033 --> 03:11:04,080
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to waive the three readings and approve to be ordained by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1993
03:11:04,721 --> 03:11:05,442
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further discussion?

1994
03:11:06,823 --> 03:11:10,707
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, if there's anyone who would like to talk about it, we'll go to.

1995
03:11:13,218 --> 03:11:15,479
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the overgrowth ordinance.

1996
03:11:15,499 --> 03:11:18,740
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to talk about rodent control next, which may be what you want to speak about.

1997
03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:19,260
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, great.

1998
03:11:19,881 --> 03:11:21,461
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, any comments on the overgrowth?

1999
03:11:24,282 --> 03:11:28,644
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, on the motion to approve, waive the three readings and approve to be ordained.

2000
03:11:29,504 --> 03:11:30,325
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2001
03:11:35,587 --> 03:11:36,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan?

2002
03:11:36,467 --> 03:11:36,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2003
03:11:38,067 --> 03:11:39,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Collins?

2004
03:11:39,208 --> 03:11:39,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2005
03:11:40,488 --> 03:11:41,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lazaro?

2006
03:11:41,409 --> 03:11:41,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2007
03:11:42,540 --> 03:11:43,140
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Levin?

2008
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:43,221
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2009
03:11:44,642 --> 03:11:45,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2010
03:11:45,943 --> 03:11:47,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

2011
03:11:47,284 --> 03:11:47,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Hussain?

2012
03:11:47,964 --> 03:11:48,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2013
03:11:49,285 --> 03:11:50,006
[SPEAKER_20]: President Behrs?

2014
03:11:50,406 --> 03:11:50,646
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2015
03:11:50,726 --> 03:11:52,287
[SPEAKER_26]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

2016
03:11:53,088 --> 03:11:57,711
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes and overgrowth ordinance is ordained.

2017
03:11:57,731 --> 03:12:03,696
[SPEAKER_26]: 24461 offered by Vice President Collins, Amendment to Chapter 6, Article 4, Rodent Control Ordinance.

2018
03:12:03,856 --> 03:12:04,816
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins.

2019
03:12:06,798 --> 03:12:07,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Behrs.

2020
03:12:09,180 --> 03:12:10,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, rats get the last word.

2021
03:12:11,717 --> 03:12:12,559
[SPEAKER_08]: this time for a whole term.

2022
03:12:15,348 --> 03:12:18,569
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been working on, so this is an amendment to an existing ordinance.

2023
03:12:18,689 --> 03:12:23,051
[SPEAKER_08]: The Road and Control Ordinance currently is on the books in our municipal code.

2024
03:12:24,852 --> 03:12:43,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier in the term, I started working with Director O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health, who came to me and said there are some serious gaps in the Road and Control Ordinance that have to deal with, similar to the Overgrowth Ordinance, the jurisdiction that the city has to intervene and help make remedies in cases where conditions on people's private property

2025
03:12:45,540 --> 03:13:12,887
[SPEAKER_08]: is creating rodent harborage conditions that are, again, not just a problem for that individual resident that is maybe being neglectful when it comes to keeping their environment tidy and sanitary, but is, in fact, worsening a rodent situation for the entire neighborhood, because as we all know, and as I certainly observe in South Medford, rats do not respect property dividing lines.

2026
03:13:18,350 --> 03:13:19,391
[SPEAKER_24]: You're telling me.

2027
03:13:19,451 --> 03:13:19,751
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm back.

2028
03:13:38,786 --> 03:13:43,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been working together over the course of, again, I think it's been probably four or five meetings in committee.

2029
03:13:45,452 --> 03:14:04,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome anybody to go back and look at those recordings in the Public Health and Community Safety Committee to make sure that we kind of fill in those gaps in enforcement so that we're identifying potential problem areas of conditions that might exist on private property and giving the Board of Health and their designees and code enforcement officers the ability to intervene in those cases.

2030
03:14:06,069 --> 03:14:09,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, the intent of this is not to be punitive.

2031
03:14:09,391 --> 03:14:12,432
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not to go around looking for problems and finding people.

2032
03:14:12,932 --> 03:14:25,857
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we all know, and as we all talk about very often, and especially with, I know this has really been on minds, on people's minds over the past several weeks, we have an existing rodent problem in Medford.

2033
03:14:25,917 --> 03:14:27,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not specific to Medford, it's region wide.

2034
03:14:28,458 --> 03:14:30,519
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not getting better, it needs to start getting better.

2035
03:14:32,361 --> 03:14:47,879
[SPEAKER_08]: and giving the city the ability to liaise directly with private property owners in those cases where there are issues on private property that are making road and proliferation much worse for the entire community or entire neighborhoods is a really important piece of the puzzle.

2036
03:14:50,102 --> 03:14:55,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I have actually just one small adjustment, a typo that I need to fix in the draft that's before councilors tonight.

2037
03:14:56,569 --> 03:15:01,735
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things we were going back and forth with with department heads and legal counsel was investigating

2038
03:15:03,574 --> 03:15:12,120
[SPEAKER_08]: whether all fees and fines collected pursuant to violations of the ordinance could be deposited into the road and control revolving account.

2039
03:15:13,942 --> 03:15:25,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And we corrected the language of that in section 6-125, but I failed to update the language in the immediately preceding sentence, which is subsection B of section 6-124.

2040
03:15:29,733 --> 03:15:40,859
[SPEAKER_08]: So section 6-125 reads, all eligible fees and receipts collected pursuant to this ordinance or for violations thereof shall go into the designated rodent control account.

2041
03:15:41,659 --> 03:15:51,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And section 6-124B should also read, wait.

2042
03:15:54,966 --> 03:15:57,047
[SPEAKER_08]: It was wrong on my copy, but it's right in this copy.

2043
03:15:59,249 --> 03:16:00,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we don't need to fix it at all.

2044
03:16:01,130 --> 03:16:02,751
[SPEAKER_26]: Not at all?

2045
03:16:07,694 --> 03:16:08,755
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry, section?

2046
03:16:09,415 --> 03:16:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on when the draft was generated and printed, it might have been fixed in OneDrive, and that's why the title isn't there anymore.

2047
03:16:15,438 --> 03:16:18,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Which section is it, sorry?

2048
03:16:18,080 --> 03:16:18,440
[SPEAKER_08]: 6-124B.

2049
03:16:19,541 --> 03:16:21,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That sentence should match section 6-125.

2050
03:16:21,282 --> 03:16:21,322
[SPEAKER_08]: 6-124B?

2051
03:16:21,342 --> 03:16:21,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2052
03:16:30,187 --> 03:16:35,911
[SPEAKER_26]: All eligible fees and receipts collected pursuant to this ordinance or for violations thereof shall go into the designated road and control account.

2053
03:16:35,951 --> 03:16:36,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2054
03:16:36,431 --> 03:16:40,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what happened was the draft I originally sent you, it wasn't fixed, but then I updated it on the cloud.

2055
03:16:41,194 --> 03:16:43,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So probably the version that you downloaded was fixed already.

2056
03:16:44,436 --> 03:16:44,616
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

2057
03:16:44,636 --> 03:16:44,816
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2058
03:16:44,836 --> 03:16:45,977
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a link.

2059
03:16:46,617 --> 03:16:47,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2060
03:16:47,718 --> 03:16:48,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2061
03:16:48,959 --> 03:16:49,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

2062
03:16:50,159 --> 03:16:50,980
[SPEAKER_08]: No amendment needed.

2063
03:16:51,905 --> 03:16:52,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Alhamdulillah.

2064
03:16:52,867 --> 03:17:01,284
[SPEAKER_26]: For both of these, please send a non-redlined, no comments, exact correct text version of this to Rich and myself.

2065
03:17:01,344 --> 03:17:01,605
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

2066
03:17:02,667 --> 03:17:02,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

2067
03:17:06,001 --> 03:17:07,282
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for bearing with me.

2068
03:17:07,843 --> 03:17:15,330
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, I would motion to waive the three readings and ordain.

2069
03:17:16,211 --> 03:17:25,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And inshallah, this will be one more tool in our toolkit for getting a handle on Medford's written problem in the next year and going forward.

2070
03:17:26,302 --> 03:17:26,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2071
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:38,476
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to waive the three readings and approve to be ordained by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazaro, do you want to talk about it?

2072
03:17:39,301 --> 03:17:45,663
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, we'll go to Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Seng, and then we'll go to at least one or more people who want to talk about it.

2073
03:17:46,103 --> 03:17:48,243
[SPEAKER_26]: But we'll go to Councilor Lazaro.

2074
03:17:48,343 --> 03:17:49,364
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you make a great point.

2075
03:17:49,404 --> 03:17:50,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I will make it quick.

2076
03:17:50,344 --> 03:17:50,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2077
03:17:51,224 --> 03:18:01,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, once again, I've said this before, but the real work of city council is helping our city staff

2078
03:18:02,788 --> 03:18:05,630
[SPEAKER_10]: execute the work that they need to do.

2079
03:18:05,990 --> 03:18:16,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Our board of health came to us came to counselor Collins with a concrete ask and she executed it because this is the kind of counselor she is.

2080
03:18:17,075 --> 03:18:22,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is an incredible culmination of her time here.

2081
03:18:22,999 --> 03:18:29,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm so grateful to Collins for all of the work that she's done.

2082
03:18:30,143 --> 03:18:41,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of her hard work, even when it is not glamorous and it is about things like rats and possums and raccoons and their little hands that they have.

2083
03:18:42,013 --> 03:18:48,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really proud of the work that she's done and the way that we've all facilitated this and how we've worked together.

2084
03:18:50,861 --> 03:18:52,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm grateful for all of it.

2085
03:18:54,164 --> 03:18:55,805
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for your work.

2086
03:18:57,195 --> 03:19:00,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm excited to second this motion.

2087
03:19:00,119 --> 03:19:00,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to stop now.

2088
03:19:00,860 --> 03:19:01,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2089
03:19:02,262 --> 03:19:03,064
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Zahra.

2090
03:19:03,084 --> 03:19:03,685
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Sang.

2091
03:19:06,408 --> 03:19:10,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Rats are one of the issues we hear about most from residents.

2092
03:19:12,244 --> 03:19:17,948
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think this really just proves how serious we are as a city council to deal with it.

2093
03:19:18,389 --> 03:19:23,613
[SPEAKER_17]: And how we do have people in city hall who wanna work on this as well.

2094
03:19:23,933 --> 03:19:36,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I hope that the administration will continue to join us in its dedication to tackle rodent control as a real issue in the city.

2095
03:19:38,324 --> 03:19:41,026
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll leave that there, because I know there's lots to be said on that.

2096
03:19:42,508 --> 03:20:00,373
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to, I swear I don't have that much more because Councilor Zaro stole it out of my mouth, but this really is, I think, the epitome of the work that Councilor Collins does for our community, the lasting impact that she'll have.

2097
03:20:02,525 --> 03:20:08,730
[SPEAKER_17]: her drive to get into the nitty gritty details and to talk it out with staff and to address resident concerns.

2098
03:20:09,271 --> 03:20:13,274
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an achievement that the vice president should be super proud of.

2099
03:20:14,255 --> 03:20:17,958
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am beyond elated that we're ending with this tonight.

2100
03:20:21,401 --> 03:20:22,102
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2101
03:20:22,162 --> 03:20:23,883
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

2102
03:20:25,284 --> 03:20:30,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing none, members of the public who wanna talk about road and control, now is the hour.

2103
03:20:33,046 --> 03:20:34,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

2104
03:20:35,113 --> 03:20:37,040
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

2105
03:20:37,241 --> 03:20:37,562
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, Paula.

2106
03:20:41,206 --> 03:20:46,231
[SPEAKER_28]: So this is more on rat control, and I love the ordinances.

2107
03:20:46,771 --> 03:20:55,018
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to talk about rodenticides, and what that is is it's a type of rat control that really is contradictory to controlling the rats.

2108
03:20:56,159 --> 03:21:06,028
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an anticoagulant, so what happens is anything that eats a rodenticide, it affects their clotting, and they bleed internally, and that's how they die.

2109
03:21:06,597 --> 03:21:16,719
[SPEAKER_28]: Normal clotting is between one and three minutes and something that eats the rodenticide, it can be greater than 24, 48 hours.

2110
03:21:17,279 --> 03:21:34,842
[SPEAKER_28]: So one of the biggest problems with this is the natural predators that would eat the rats and mice that would eat the rat poison are then eating the poisoned prey and they themselves are becoming secondary victims.

2111
03:21:38,188 --> 03:21:45,823
[SPEAKER_28]: 85% of the birds of prey are more that are dying and coming into rehab are

2112
03:21:46,635 --> 03:21:48,957
[SPEAKER_28]: being affected by rodenticides.

2113
03:21:49,317 --> 03:21:50,858
[SPEAKER_28]: So now I'll talk about this.

2114
03:21:51,459 --> 03:21:59,785
[SPEAKER_28]: So rats are an issue, as we all know, and soon it's going to be worse with all this new construction, and especially if we go to trash pickup every two weeks.

2115
03:22:00,306 --> 03:22:04,789
[SPEAKER_28]: That being said, many want to get baited traps.

2116
03:22:05,189 --> 03:22:11,594
[SPEAKER_28]: And this is, you folks have heard this before, but hopefully some of the public that doesn't know will be hearing this now.

2117
03:22:13,096 --> 03:22:18,485
[SPEAKER_28]: The poison in the beta traps is really focused on the rats and or mice.

2118
03:22:19,026 --> 03:22:20,629
[SPEAKER_28]: But here's why we shouldn't allow this.

2119
03:22:20,990 --> 03:22:24,936
[SPEAKER_28]: Rodenticides, we shouldn't allow rodenticides at all.

2120
03:22:26,431 --> 03:22:54,182
[SPEAKER_28]: uh... as I said it affects the coagulation and why it's important is the areas who cares about the rats they're getting poisoned and stuff but that's not the issue it's what's being infected by those that eat the rats those aren't just the poison the rats don't die right away when they eat this poison they come out of the traps they become weak they wobble around they become easy prey so that happens and so then the things that

2121
03:22:55,042 --> 03:23:03,509
[SPEAKER_28]: going to eat them, raccoons, coyotes, foxes, eagles, hawks, owls, they also become affected and their numbers go down.

2122
03:23:04,449 --> 03:23:09,273
[SPEAKER_28]: A healthy owl can eat over 1,000 rodents in one month.

2123
03:23:09,994 --> 03:23:15,018
[SPEAKER_28]: If it has babies, that can go up to 3,000 rats, mice, voles a month.

2124
03:23:15,658 --> 03:23:19,321
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a free rat killing station.

2125
03:23:19,869 --> 03:23:28,715
[SPEAKER_28]: We're paying money to have pest people come in and fill these traps with rodenticides, but we're actually

2126
03:23:29,626 --> 03:23:31,347
[SPEAKER_28]: contradicting what we want to do.

2127
03:23:31,927 --> 03:23:33,507
[SPEAKER_28]: So there are other ways to do it.

2128
03:23:33,567 --> 03:23:36,829
[SPEAKER_28]: You can use birth control.

2129
03:23:37,149 --> 03:23:43,271
[SPEAKER_28]: The thing with that is that the birth control and the traps have to be redone every six weeks.

2130
03:23:43,471 --> 03:23:45,652
[SPEAKER_28]: But that's the same as the rodenticides.

2131
03:23:45,912 --> 03:23:47,633
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's a balancing act there.

2132
03:23:48,993 --> 03:23:54,235
[SPEAKER_28]: If you remember the DDT episodes way back that almost killed all the peregrine falcons.

2133
03:23:54,760 --> 03:24:00,643
[SPEAKER_28]: There was only one nesting pair of peregrine falcons in Canada when that was at its peak.

2134
03:24:00,663 --> 03:24:04,025
[SPEAKER_28]: 324 nesting pairs in the whole United States.

2135
03:24:04,565 --> 03:24:08,327
[SPEAKER_28]: This is becoming DDT part two, but it's rodenticides.

2136
03:24:09,628 --> 03:24:19,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Newhouse Rescue in Chelmsford, which is one of the many rehab places, almost all of their mammals that come in there have rodenticide poisoning.

2137
03:24:21,554 --> 03:24:23,375
[SPEAKER_28]: Tufts did a, I'm sorry.

2138
03:24:24,676 --> 03:24:25,758
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, I know I went over.

2139
03:24:28,302 --> 03:24:33,310
[SPEAKER_28]: In 2020, Tufts did a study of 43 red-tailed hawks.

2140
03:24:33,330 --> 03:24:37,857
[SPEAKER_28]: 100% of them had rodenticide poisoning in their system.

2141
03:24:39,430 --> 03:24:42,592
[SPEAKER_28]: 90% had two kinds of rodenticides in their system.

2142
03:24:44,252 --> 03:24:49,314
[SPEAKER_28]: The only way to tell about rodenticides poisoning is take a tissue sample, which is very, very expensive.

2143
03:24:49,654 --> 03:24:51,895
[SPEAKER_28]: This tough study did take tissue samples.

2144
03:24:52,655 --> 03:25:01,739
[SPEAKER_28]: How we're getting these numbers about the rodenticide poisonings are basically if you take a blood sample and it's not clotting, you can assume it's rodenticides.

2145
03:25:04,400 --> 03:25:06,161
[SPEAKER_28]: So what we're doing is we're actually

2146
03:25:07,093 --> 03:25:12,610
[SPEAKER_28]: killing our natural predators that would help us with the rat, mice.

2147
03:25:15,186 --> 03:25:20,348
[SPEAKER_28]: So you see a coyote, you see a fox, and you're like, oh my god, even possums eat mice.

2148
03:25:20,909 --> 03:25:25,111
[SPEAKER_28]: So everything in our natural system is being affected by the rodenticides.

2149
03:25:25,491 --> 03:25:31,033
[SPEAKER_28]: So what I'm asking is if Medford can join some of the other communities.

2150
03:25:31,133 --> 03:25:34,415
[SPEAKER_28]: There is now, I'm sorry, got off track here.

2151
03:25:35,335 --> 03:25:38,316
[SPEAKER_28]: There is now a Senate bill in the Senate of Massachusetts.

2152
03:25:38,416 --> 03:25:39,637
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Bill H.4684.

2153
03:25:42,278 --> 03:25:53,571
[SPEAKER_28]: And it is on the third reading in the Senate, and it's a bill to restrict or prohibit second-generation anticoagulants, which is the rodenticide.

2154
03:25:56,043 --> 03:26:00,825
[SPEAKER_28]: and it's going to send a ban to the following cities which have already brought this in.

2155
03:26:01,465 --> 03:26:11,110
[SPEAKER_28]: Orleans, Newton, Arlington, Newbury, Brookline, Salem, Lexington, Providence Town, Lowell, Belmont, Concord, and Arlington.

2156
03:26:11,430 --> 03:26:13,491
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe Winchester is in that as well.

2157
03:26:13,871 --> 03:26:20,154
[SPEAKER_28]: What I'm asking is if Medford can really consider joining this ban and we can help

2158
03:26:20,674 --> 03:26:26,339
[SPEAKER_28]: We have the fells right here, lots of birds of prey, lots of things that can help us with rodent control.

2159
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:28,201
[SPEAKER_28]: And it won't cost us a cent.

2160
03:26:28,821 --> 03:26:30,603
[SPEAKER_28]: We can help with our budget as well.

2161
03:26:32,265 --> 03:26:36,829
[SPEAKER_28]: This not only is for birds of prey and coyotes, foxes.

2162
03:26:37,229 --> 03:26:41,213
[SPEAKER_28]: If your dog goes and eats this, your dog's going to get it.

2163
03:26:41,353 --> 03:26:42,274
[SPEAKER_28]: Your cat's going to get it.

2164
03:26:43,895 --> 03:26:51,342
[SPEAKER_28]: In 2021, two dogs in Redding, by the time the owner brought it to the vet, they died in 20 minutes because they were bleeding to death.

2165
03:26:51,723 --> 03:27:00,051
[SPEAKER_28]: A dog on the corner of Dudley Street and Salem Street got rodenticide poisoning from the restaurants that abut that area.

2166
03:27:01,191 --> 03:27:06,393
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's very dangerous, not just for the wild animals, but for also our pets.

2167
03:27:08,554 --> 03:27:13,856
[SPEAKER_28]: And we need to be proactive, keep our wildlife here to help us control the wildlife.

2168
03:27:14,296 --> 03:27:23,840
[SPEAKER_28]: And several months ago, there was a gentleman here that spoke about the eagles that used to nest in fresh pond, MK and her mate, ZK.

2169
03:27:26,210 --> 03:27:31,892
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe it was Tufts that did the autopsy on both of those, and they did die of rodenticide poisoning.

2170
03:27:32,612 --> 03:27:36,833
[SPEAKER_28]: He said they didn't, but they 100% did die of rodenticide poisoning.

2171
03:27:37,213 --> 03:27:42,754
[SPEAKER_28]: So that just shows that these eagles that nested there year after year after year and was a huge attraction.

2172
03:27:42,794 --> 03:27:44,295
[SPEAKER_28]: There were photographers everywhere.

2173
03:27:44,815 --> 03:27:45,575
[SPEAKER_28]: We're killing them.

2174
03:27:45,995 --> 03:27:47,416
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's really unnecessary.

2175
03:27:47,436 --> 03:27:53,497
[SPEAKER_28]: The most important thing is for the public to contain their trash.

2176
03:27:54,178 --> 03:27:54,798
[SPEAKER_28]: No food.

2177
03:27:57,270 --> 03:27:57,590
[SPEAKER_28]: Rats.

2178
03:27:58,011 --> 03:27:58,651
[SPEAKER_28]: No food.

2179
03:27:59,712 --> 03:28:00,893
[SPEAKER_28]: Everyone says, oh, the coyotes.

2180
03:28:01,133 --> 03:28:01,793
[SPEAKER_28]: No coyotes.

2181
03:28:02,034 --> 03:28:04,656
[SPEAKER_28]: You have to maintain your trash.

2182
03:28:04,676 --> 03:28:06,237
[SPEAKER_28]: So the trash thing is huge.

2183
03:28:08,138 --> 03:28:08,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Paulette.

2184
03:28:08,518 --> 03:28:09,379
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that's it.

2185
03:28:09,539 --> 03:28:10,300
[SPEAKER_26]: We're way over.

2186
03:28:10,320 --> 03:28:11,300
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2187
03:28:11,761 --> 03:28:15,283
[SPEAKER_28]: So if anyone's interested, there's a book called Hunting the Hunted.

2188
03:28:16,264 --> 03:28:17,845
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's all.

2189
03:28:18,566 --> 03:28:23,690
[SPEAKER_28]: So please consider joining those cities, and we can get this done.

2190
03:28:24,030 --> 03:28:24,310
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2191
03:28:24,330 --> 03:28:24,790
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Paulette.

2192
03:28:24,810 --> 03:28:26,071
[SPEAKER_28]: And I appreciate the extra time.

2193
03:28:26,432 --> 03:28:26,852
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2194
03:28:28,777 --> 03:28:32,098
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, we'll stay at the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

2195
03:28:34,578 --> 03:28:36,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Patrick Clerken, 14 Bennett Place.

2196
03:28:37,299 --> 03:28:42,260
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, congratulations to all of the new Councillors, and Councillor Collins, good luck.

2197
03:28:43,640 --> 03:28:46,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Second is related to the topic at hand.

2198
03:28:46,940 --> 03:28:53,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just talking to a friend last week who does pest control, and he

2199
03:28:55,867 --> 03:29:05,989
[SPEAKER_11]: basically he deals with green crabs, he deals with hogs, he deals with deer in Nantucket and ticks and all that kind of stuff.

2200
03:29:06,249 --> 03:29:18,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was talking with him about urban pests and the best, the most responsible way to dispatch rats and how to be a responsible steward of the environment when we do it.

2201
03:29:19,252 --> 03:29:19,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And

2202
03:29:20,698 --> 03:29:31,372
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the ways that we talked about was using bucket traps, which actually, if you put them near the nesting sites, it allows you to catch large numbers of them.

2203
03:29:31,833 --> 03:29:32,814
[SPEAKER_11]: But you catch them live.

2204
03:29:33,395 --> 03:29:37,400
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have to basically use carbon monoxide.

2205
03:29:38,141 --> 03:29:40,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a humane way to do it.

2206
03:29:40,362 --> 03:29:41,863
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to use rodenticide.

2207
03:29:42,283 --> 03:29:47,965
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to constantly do these single bait traps everywhere that once a rat's in it, possibly dies in it.

2208
03:29:48,706 --> 03:29:50,646
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't really have to deal with chemicals.

2209
03:29:50,686 --> 03:29:53,408
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't really have to deal with anything nasty.

2210
03:29:53,428 --> 03:29:55,769
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to have people with pellet guns.

2211
03:29:55,809 --> 03:29:58,890
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to have electricity involved, anything like that.

2212
03:29:59,350 --> 03:30:04,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just a possibility that I wanted to put out there for potential

2213
03:30:07,317 --> 03:30:11,740
[SPEAKER_11]: more I guess you could say bulk rodent control.

2214
03:30:12,741 --> 03:30:22,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if there's a carbon monoxide source in the city that could be used, but the buckets are relatively inexpensive, the bucket traps, and it works pretty well.

2215
03:30:22,827 --> 03:30:23,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2216
03:30:24,388 --> 03:30:24,768
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2217
03:30:26,469 --> 03:30:28,611
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further comments on this item?

2218
03:30:30,718 --> 03:30:31,698
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

2219
03:30:31,738 --> 03:30:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

2220
03:30:35,480 --> 03:30:46,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually will just sort of echo my neighbor Paulette's comments about the, how terrible road genocide is.

2221
03:30:48,246 --> 03:30:52,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not aware that there was this, that cities were passing a ban on it.

2222
03:30:54,229 --> 03:30:57,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I absolutely am supportive of that, like road genocide is like,

2223
03:30:58,623 --> 03:31:02,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Poison traps in general are just scummy, so we shouldn't have them in our city.

2224
03:31:03,508 --> 03:31:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bad for the environment.

2225
03:31:06,231 --> 03:31:09,113
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first moved to this city, I had rats in my apartment.

2226
03:31:12,308 --> 03:31:26,872
[SPEAKER_06]: my landlord set out poison traps to kill those rats, and you've never experienced hell like five dead rats somewhere in your ceilings and walls during an extremely hot summer.

2227
03:31:27,473 --> 03:31:32,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am definitely in support of banning poison traps.

2228
03:31:32,474 --> 03:31:38,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I also mentioned that there are electric traps now that you can set out and are reusable,

2229
03:31:40,135 --> 03:31:41,536
[SPEAKER_06]: are pretty good at murdering rats.

2230
03:31:41,796 --> 03:31:50,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know, maybe the city could set up a program for residents to purchase them more affordably or something.

2231
03:31:53,886 --> 03:31:54,486
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2232
03:31:54,506 --> 03:31:56,828
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

2233
03:31:56,888 --> 03:31:58,049
[SPEAKER_26]: And you have three minutes.

2234
03:31:59,383 --> 03:32:01,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Simon Alcindor, 44 Tainter Street.

2235
03:32:01,746 --> 03:32:02,827
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had a quick question.

2236
03:32:02,927 --> 03:32:11,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Does the rat control or rodent control ordinance dictate what type of poison or method of rodent control should be used?

2237
03:32:12,461 --> 03:32:13,122
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Cohn.

2238
03:32:15,472 --> 03:32:23,514
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good question, and no, typically in legislation we, this is, it's a good question that comes up frequently in our legislative process.

2239
03:32:23,574 --> 03:32:29,095
[SPEAKER_08]: We try to avoid enshrining things in ordinance that are really better left up to the discretion of department heads.

2240
03:32:29,295 --> 03:32:35,316
[SPEAKER_08]: So the answer to your question is no, that wouldn't live in the ordinance, and specifically when we're talking about methods of voting control.

2241
03:32:37,316 --> 03:32:44,318
[SPEAKER_08]: The Board of Health is a great department to talk to about those specifics, and they would be in charge of promulgating the recommendations or the rules by which people must

2242
03:32:46,199 --> 03:32:48,140
[SPEAKER_08]: perform rodent control on their properties.

2243
03:32:48,880 --> 03:32:49,160
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2244
03:32:49,200 --> 03:32:55,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Because from what I could tell that addresses at least most of the concerns that have been brought up obviously there are a lot of valid concerns with rodenticides.

2245
03:32:55,884 --> 03:32:58,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I share those concerns with my fellow residents.

2246
03:32:59,406 --> 03:33:05,329
[SPEAKER_18]: I just believe that that really does just address most of the concerns that are being brought up here tonight.

2247
03:33:05,529 --> 03:33:05,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2248
03:33:07,050 --> 03:33:07,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2249
03:33:07,470 --> 03:33:09,491
[SPEAKER_26]: And Council Vice President Collins you can correct me.

2250
03:33:12,373 --> 03:33:13,994
[SPEAKER_26]: The city is not using rodenticide.

2251
03:33:15,222 --> 03:33:18,145
[SPEAKER_26]: at least mine understand, my memory of the last time we talked about this.

2252
03:33:18,825 --> 03:33:19,806
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't believe that they are.

2253
03:33:20,167 --> 03:33:21,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2254
03:33:21,568 --> 03:33:22,208
[SPEAKER_26]: We can check in.

2255
03:33:22,228 --> 03:33:26,833
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we've had Yankee Pest Control and Marianne here a few times now.

2256
03:33:27,113 --> 03:33:28,955
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think the city itself is.

2257
03:33:29,095 --> 03:33:29,976
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll double check that.

2258
03:33:31,777 --> 03:33:37,823
[SPEAKER_26]: But this question that Paula brought up is about ban for private use, which is a big piece.

2259
03:33:38,698 --> 03:33:42,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah ban or restrict on private use as well which is a whole other element.

2260
03:33:43,179 --> 03:33:51,481
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm guessing most of the road and control traps in the city are actually not municipally owned or controlled or at least a good chunk of them.

2261
03:33:54,662 --> 03:33:57,283
[SPEAKER_26]: One sentence Paulette you had you had a long time.

2262
03:33:59,701 --> 03:34:03,083
[SPEAKER_28]: You missed me, so Paulette Bardivedian, Central Lab Medford.

2263
03:34:03,303 --> 03:34:15,488
[SPEAKER_28]: Just want to say that some of the companies that do use rodenticides, they're going to tell you this is the best way to do it because they're making money and it's not solving the problem so then they come back and they make more money.

2264
03:34:15,768 --> 03:34:17,009
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's just another issue.

2265
03:34:17,109 --> 03:34:17,409
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2266
03:34:17,829 --> 03:34:18,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2267
03:34:18,289 --> 03:34:20,750
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

2268
03:34:21,350 --> 03:34:27,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing no further discussion or comment on this item, on the motion to waive the three readings and approve to be ordained.

2269
03:34:28,183 --> 03:34:29,244
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2270
03:34:30,944 --> 03:34:31,885
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan.

2271
03:34:33,486 --> 03:34:33,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2272
03:34:33,626 --> 03:34:34,446
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Collins.

2273
03:34:34,466 --> 03:34:34,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2274
03:34:35,847 --> 03:34:36,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Zaro.

2275
03:34:36,787 --> 03:34:36,867
Yes.

2276
03:34:37,828 --> 03:34:38,488
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lemming.

2277
03:34:38,508 --> 03:34:38,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2278
03:34:39,969 --> 03:34:41,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scapelli.

2279
03:34:41,449 --> 03:34:42,130
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2280
03:34:42,370 --> 03:34:43,170
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Singh.

2281
03:34:43,190 --> 03:34:43,250
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2282
03:34:44,231 --> 03:34:44,991
[SPEAKER_20]: President Beers.

2283
03:34:45,271 --> 03:34:45,491
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2284
03:34:45,511 --> 03:34:46,652
[SPEAKER_26]: 16 affirmative, one absent.

2285
03:34:46,692 --> 03:34:50,393
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion passes and the ordinance is ordained.

2286
03:34:51,714 --> 03:34:54,175
[SPEAKER_26]: Please send the final copies here.

2287
03:34:56,036 --> 03:34:57,577
[SPEAKER_26]: Last thing on the agenda, public participation.

2288
03:34:59,587 --> 03:35:02,688
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, public participation.

2289
03:35:03,588 --> 03:35:08,329
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a chance for our members of the public to speak on topics that they'd like to talk about.

2290
03:35:08,369 --> 03:35:09,950
[SPEAKER_26]: We have two folks.

2291
03:35:09,970 --> 03:35:11,290
[SPEAKER_26]: We've got one in person and one on Zoom.

2292
03:35:11,310 --> 03:35:12,210
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll start in person.

2293
03:35:13,530 --> 03:35:15,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

2294
03:35:21,415 --> 03:35:28,959
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of on the topic of rats, something to keep in mind for next year, an unfortunate ending note as we go into the holiday season.

2295
03:35:28,979 --> 03:35:35,562
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, Councilor Collins, you can close your ears so it's not super relevant to you as we go.

2296
03:35:36,182 --> 03:35:45,227
[SPEAKER_06]: But starting in the first couple months of next year, there's a really good reason

2297
03:35:45,781 --> 03:35:56,470
[SPEAKER_06]: to anticipate increased ICE activity in our city for a variety of reasons targeting various vulnerable immigrant groups in our city.

2298
03:35:57,291 --> 03:36:08,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not going to get into those specific reasons here on this floor, although I'm happy to talk to anyone personally about it one-on-one.

2299
03:36:12,568 --> 03:36:39,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a looming threat and I think it's something that as we all head into the holiday seasons, and this really applies to residents just as much as it does the city council, we really need to be thinking about creative ways to protect those members of our city who are most vulnerable and who are going to be targeted almost undoubtedly in the first few months of next year and later.

2300
03:36:42,045 --> 03:36:48,669
[SPEAKER_06]: This also goes without saying that the mayor has not done enough to help with that, and I wish she would.

2301
03:36:48,689 --> 03:36:51,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just repeat that.

2302
03:36:51,871 --> 03:36:56,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I just encourage you all to think about that as you go into the holidays.

2303
03:36:58,765 --> 03:37:10,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much, also enjoy your holidays, enjoy your family, happy Hanukkah, happy New Year's, Christmas, and everything, but keep it in mind.

2304
03:37:10,369 --> 03:37:11,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, guys.

2305
03:37:13,030 --> 03:37:13,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2306
03:37:17,012 --> 03:37:20,173
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go to Zoom and then we'll come back in person.

2307
03:37:22,384 --> 03:37:25,266
[SPEAKER_26]: And that might be it, but we have Mr. Castaneda on Zoom.

2308
03:37:25,867 --> 03:37:28,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, Andy, and you'll have three minutes.

2309
03:37:30,871 --> 03:37:32,993
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor Beers.

2310
03:37:34,254 --> 03:37:39,938
[SPEAKER_32]: I try to come in person, but your doors were locked at 10 minutes before 10 o'clock.

2311
03:37:40,999 --> 03:37:43,261
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyways, is this the last meeting of this year?

2312
03:37:44,662 --> 03:37:46,303
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the final meeting of the year.

2313
03:37:46,323 --> 03:37:46,364
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

2314
03:37:47,945 --> 03:37:50,247
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been meaning to say this for many years,

2315
03:37:51,121 --> 03:37:54,543
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess I want to get it off my mind.

2316
03:37:56,465 --> 03:38:04,190
[SPEAKER_32]: Whereas your political correctness has turned our Christmas upside down and inside out.

2317
03:38:05,051 --> 03:38:10,835
[SPEAKER_32]: So I want to say Happy Holy Days and Merry Christmas if the shoe fits.

2318
03:38:11,655 --> 03:38:12,576
[SPEAKER_32]: God help us all.

2319
03:38:12,676 --> 03:38:13,076
[SPEAKER_32]: Amen.

2320
03:38:13,116 --> 03:38:14,277
[SPEAKER_32]: And to all a good night.

2321
03:38:14,637 --> 03:38:16,739
[SPEAKER_32]: E buono anno nuovo 2026.

2322
03:38:17,519 --> 03:38:18,640
[SPEAKER_32]: May it be a great year.

2323
03:38:19,220 --> 03:38:20,081
[SPEAKER_32]: Good luck to everyone.

2324
03:38:20,940 --> 03:38:21,300
[SPEAKER_32]: Good night.

2325
03:38:23,322 --> 03:38:23,802
[SPEAKER_26]: Good night, Andy.

2326
03:38:23,862 --> 03:38:24,263
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2327
03:38:24,323 --> 03:38:25,664
[SPEAKER_26]: And sorry about the doors.

2328
03:38:25,804 --> 03:38:28,186
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll make sure they're open in the future.

2329
03:38:28,386 --> 03:38:28,846
[SPEAKER_26]: Apologies.

2330
03:38:29,947 --> 03:38:30,608
[SPEAKER_32]: No problem.

2331
03:38:32,689 --> 03:38:33,130
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2332
03:38:34,651 --> 03:38:35,051
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2333
03:38:35,631 --> 03:38:36,672
[SPEAKER_26]: And we'll go back to the podium.

2334
03:38:37,413 --> 03:38:38,894
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

2335
03:38:38,914 --> 03:38:39,995
[SPEAKER_26]: And you'll have three minutes.

2336
03:38:40,836 --> 03:38:45,158
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, Simon Elsador, 44 Tainter Street.

2337
03:38:45,959 --> 03:38:55,944
[SPEAKER_18]: On a much different and wider note, this has probably been mentioned already, but I would really like to express my gratitude for the

2338
03:38:57,505 --> 03:39:04,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Salem Street, the Route 60 Rotary Project, and those who worked on it, because I literally just popped back and forth.

2339
03:39:04,950 --> 03:39:10,894
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I've mentioned it, but I go back and forth between Medford and Suffolk University, and I just popped back, and it was there.

2340
03:39:11,474 --> 03:39:15,016
[SPEAKER_18]: And I cannot express how grateful I am to have that.

2341
03:39:16,465 --> 03:39:26,492
[SPEAKER_18]: just like how much easier it has made it for me to be able to get to and from, I live just the other side of the rotary, over to Medford Square and how much safer that has been.

2342
03:39:27,212 --> 03:39:31,475
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that this is really the type of thing that we need to be doing a lot more going forward.

2343
03:39:31,615 --> 03:39:33,296
[SPEAKER_18]: And happy holidays, everyone.

2344
03:39:34,277 --> 03:39:34,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2345
03:39:35,258 --> 03:39:36,138
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Simon.

2346
03:39:36,719 --> 03:39:41,582
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I want to give a big shout out to everyone who's involved with that, Council Lazzaro included.

2347
03:39:43,678 --> 03:39:53,902
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah it really goes to show what physical safety improvements can do on our streets to keep everyone safer in cars on bikes walking or rolling.

2348
03:39:54,182 --> 03:39:55,282
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that's really important.

2349
03:39:56,663 --> 03:39:57,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Nice note to end on.

2350
03:39:57,503 --> 03:39:58,003
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks Simon.

2351
03:40:00,924 --> 03:40:03,965
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan seconded by Councilor Sang.

2352
03:40:04,766 --> 03:40:05,386
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor.

2353
03:40:06,886 --> 03:40:07,347
[SPEAKER_26]: Opposed.

2354
03:40:08,667 --> 03:40:09,507
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2355
03:40:10,548 --> 03:40:10,968
[SPEAKER_26]: And the meeting.

2356
03:40:15,758 --> 03:40:15,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

2357
03:40:20,869 --> 03:40:22,071
[SPEAKER_26]: Happy holidays, everyone.

2358
03:40:22,192 --> 03:40:22,592
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.
