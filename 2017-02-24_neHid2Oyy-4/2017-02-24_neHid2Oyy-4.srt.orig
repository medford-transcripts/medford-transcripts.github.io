[SPEAKER_07]: Six members, if you could mark Councilor Night here.

[SPEAKER_07]: All seven, please stand and salute the flag.

19
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:57,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20

[SPEAKER_07]: 17-078, petition for common picture license by Mike Pinnick.

00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:15,222
[SPEAKER_07]: 369 Broadway, Everett, for Boston's Best Ice Cream, doing business as Crystal at 49 High Street, Medford, Mass.

22
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, Chairman of the Licensing Committee.

23
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:24,729
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you find the application?

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,391
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can, can we ask the,

25
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,399
[SPEAKER_05]: The petitioner can come forward.

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, how are you?

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, and you?

28
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:37,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So exactly, what will you be serving in this establishment?

29
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Caribbean, Haitian, and Spanish food.

30
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:42,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's not ice cream though.

31
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:43,588
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not ice cream.

32
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I currently actually own an ice cream parlor in Cambridge Galleria.

33
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:50,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we serve an oxtail?

34
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:52,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

35
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, but yeah, I wanted to do some type of different change.

36
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:10,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And because I've been a resident of Merck for over five years, six, seven years, I wanted to extend.

37
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Your hours of operations?

38
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:17,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, it would be 7 to about 9 o'clock.

39
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:17,825
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

40
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's out, I believe it's 11, you have to ask.

41
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:20,707
[SPEAKER_05]: After 11?

42
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,728
[SPEAKER_05]: After 11, you have to ask as you move forward.

43
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:23,049
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

44
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,650
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have to ask for a special permit.

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, everything seems to be in order.

46
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I know with the growing Haitian community, Jamaican community, I think that it's wonderful food.

47
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:37,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a connoisseur of food, so.

48
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:38,699
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

49
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so everything looks like it's in order, Mr. President.

50
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I move to approve and... Thank you, Counselor Scott Pelli.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor DelaRusso.

52
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:52,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

53
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:55,827
[SPEAKER_07]: You had your letter.

54
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, sir.

55
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Counselor Knight.

56
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank Mr. Pinnock for coming here this evening.

57
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:08,736
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be maybe a second foray into operating a business here in the community of Medford.

58
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:13,319
[SPEAKER_02]: He ran a very successful business down in South Medford for a number of years and was displaced by a fire, Mr. President.

59
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,380
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,485
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a great reputation as a business owner in the community, and it's with my wholehearted support that I second Counselor Scott Pelley's motion for approval.

61
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:22,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

62
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, and welcome to

63
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,974
[SPEAKER_07]: at Medford Square in our business community.

64
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:29,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

65
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:30,435
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

66
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:31,496
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

67
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

68
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:33,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

69
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:42,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes, congratulations.

70
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

71
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:53,490
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-080, petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Mass., to address the city council about requirements for the fire department.

72
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

73
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

74
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:57,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

75
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,883
[SPEAKER_00]: In all fairness, this problem isn't the fault of the current mayor, but it is her bullet to bite, and the city's as well.

76
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:10,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that she is taking this issue as seriously as it needs to be.

77
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of building maintenance caused all of our facilities to collapse.

78
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:18,049
[SPEAKER_00]: As you recall, we got the new schools for free, and that spoiled us.

79
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:23,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Credit goes to this city council for bringing light to the DPW.

80
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,192
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rebuilt.

81
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:28,178
[SPEAKER_00]: for about $14 million.

82
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:37,982
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this council started pushing for a new police department, which was assumed to go hand-in-hand with the fire department or headquarters.

83
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:47,587
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, a mayor can do nothing without the express consent of the people, even when that consent comes in the form of silence.

84
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:55,230
[SPEAKER_00]: We allow our government to do what it wants through our voice of complaint or through our mission of responsibility.

85
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:03,385
[SPEAKER_00]: The people themselves have started demanding a new station since becoming aware of the unacceptable conditions of the current facility.

86
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:10,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to thank the citizens of Medford for, for they will be footing the bill for this expensive.

87
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that, uh, expense and then I know life in Medford will improve as a result.

88
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:16,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

89
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a police force, civil order would break down into chaos.

90
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,836
[SPEAKER_00]: As I have stated before, police are the second priority.

91
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:26,256
[SPEAKER_00]: only to that of the governing body.

92
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And the DPW is third.

93
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:39,660
[SPEAKER_00]: For without clear road access between private and public property lines, a complete halt to all community commerce would cease.

94
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,122
[SPEAKER_00]: All community activity as well.

95
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:46,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a police, that's it.

96
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:53,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while the history of the fire department generally started out as an all-volunteer force, they have grown.

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,961
[SPEAKER_00]: not only in scope, but in professionalism.

98
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:02,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I will attempt here to let them speak for themselves through the Cincinnati force, and I shortened it.

99
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergency response.

100
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:13,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergency response calls can come at any time of the day or night and must be responded to immediately.

101
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:18,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep may be frequently interrupted.

102
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:20,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergency calls can cover many things.

103
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:37,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Brush fires, structural fires, automobile accidents, life-threatening medical emergencies, non-life-threatening medical emergencies, false alarms, and other hazardous situations all must be responded to with the same speed and professionalism.

104
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:51,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters must immediately evaluate each emergency situation upon arrival.

105
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:53,565
[SPEAKER_00]: including properties of the fire.

106
00:06:56,367 --> 00:07:05,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Probability of the fire spreading, needs of victims, medical conditions, effects of weather conditions, et cetera, in order to effectively deal with the emergency.

107
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:06,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire scenes.

108
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:09,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighting is a dangerous occupation.

109
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters must enter burning structures.

110
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:18,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Once inside the structure, firefighters must search for victims, the source of the fire and ways to extinguish the fire.

111
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:21,603
[SPEAKER_00]: In this process, firefighters are exposed to extreme heat,

112
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:23,825
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, fumes, and structural damages.

113
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighting is very physically demanding.

114
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:38,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters carry 80 to 100 pounds of equipment, such as hoses, axes, ladders, chainsaws, and extinguishers, into and around the fire scene to rescue victims and extinguish the fire.

115
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,852
[SPEAKER_00]: This may include climbing many flights of stairs.

116
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:48,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters make forced entries into ground structures by

117
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:54,714
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting locks, breaking doors, windows, or roofs as needed to gain access to or ventilated structures.

118
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:03,936
[SPEAKER_00]: This may involve using hand tools such as axes, sledgehammers, battering rams, and power tools.

119
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:11,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters use ladders and work at heights to rescue victims and fight fires.

120
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:14,399
[SPEAKER_00]: They must raise, lower, rotate, and exit

121
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,358
[SPEAKER_00]: and extend these ladders.

122
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladders are at times used for purposes other than climbing, such as bridges, battering rams, and carrying victims.

123
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:29,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters occasionally are overcome with smoke and are burned while putting out fires.

124
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergency medical treatment.

125
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters now perform the tasks previously done by paramedics.

126
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:43,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Ordinarily, firefighters will be canvassed for volunteers to perform paramedic duties.

127
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,480
[SPEAKER_00]: However, firefighters may also be assigned to these duties.

128
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,901
[SPEAKER_00]: All firefighters are required to

129
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:54,858
[SPEAKER_00]: to qualify as emergency medical technicians as a condition of probation.

130
00:08:55,578 --> 00:09:04,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters must assess a victim's general condition by checking pulse, respiration, breathing, and bleeding, and consciousness, et cetera.

131
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:12,774
[SPEAKER_00]: This will require physical contact with the victims, who will often be bleeding from open wounds and or have broken

132
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:21,911
[SPEAKER_00]: bones, and other severe injuries.

133
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:28,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters must use first aid and emergency medical techniques to treat victims to the best of their ability.

134
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:35,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters may also come into contact with victims who have died before they could be rescued, sometimes two.

135
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:38,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Victims will die despite the best efforts of firefighters.

136
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:48,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighter paramedics and EMTs must obtain specific information from or about the victim, load the victim into the ambulance, stabilize the victim,

137
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,734
[SPEAKER_00]: to the best of their ability and care for victims on the way to the hospital.

138
00:09:52,234 --> 00:10:02,463
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, firefighter paramedics must often obtain more extensive information, draw blood samples, and discuss the case details with emergency room physicians.

139
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:03,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Rescue operations.

140
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:14,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters use systematic search and search procedures to try to find trapped victims without getting lost or trapped themselves.

141
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:24,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters free trapped victims from a variety of situations, including car crashes, cave-ins, structure collapses, flood channels, chemical spills, and all kinds of unusual occurrences.

142
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters may be required to use special tools to accomplish a rescue.

143
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:37,676
[SPEAKER_00]: After locating and freeing the victim, firefighters must determine the safest path of evacuation.

144
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:43,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters may be required to lift and or carry the victim with or without assistance in dangerous situations.

145
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:45,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Other duties.

146
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:53,730
[SPEAKER_00]: While not out on call, firefighters must constantly work at keeping the station and equipment in excellent condition.

147
00:10:54,773 --> 00:11:01,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of the firefighter's time is spent cleaning and scrubbing living quarters, including floors and restrooms, the fire station and the equipment.

148
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:05,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters often come into contact with hazardous and infectious materials.

149
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:10,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters conduct inspections for fire code violations.

150
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:16,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters may have to educate the general public in fire safety and fire prevention techniques.

151
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,399
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost done.

152
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:19,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your patience.

153
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal considerations.

154
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:29,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters work 24 consecutive hours of shifts, living at the station for the entire period.

155
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:37,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighter shifts are organized on the following schedule, 24 hours on, 48 hours off duty.

156
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,153
[SPEAKER_00]: While on duty, firefighters live and sleep at the station.

157
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefighters, male and female, sleep in dormitory-style quarters.

158
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:55,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Most stations do not have any physical barriers separating male and female facilities, including bath, bathing, and toilet areas, and rely on an occupied, not occupied system.

159
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:06,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the police department, who are an absolute requirement to ensure domestic tranquility or civil order, a fire department is not necessary.

160
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:15,006
[SPEAKER_00]: For as long as we are willing to lose lives and property, and that's the key, we don't even have to have one, as long as you're willing to accept

161
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,908
[SPEAKER_00]: that people will die in accidents and in fires.

162
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:22,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that the city council doesn't agree with that, but it's the truth.

163
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Many towns in the United States use nothing more than a voluntary fire department.

164
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:36,172
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we are going to have a professional fire department, then we need to build the two headquarters together.

165
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:36,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

166
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Logistically, both are first responders.

167
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:44,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergency calls sometimes require both agencies in synchronicity.

168
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:49,046
[SPEAKER_00]: both work around the clock, whether it is a car wreck or a gas leak.

169
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:52,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Both may be required to be on site at the same time.

170
00:12:53,269 --> 00:13:00,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we don't build the headquarters together, certain realities will still have to be faced on behalf of the fire department.

171
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,775
[SPEAKER_00]: One, a new fire headquarters.

172
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:10,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, their current headquarters is the only place where they can install and use special washers for turnout gear.

173
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, new training facility tower

174
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Also of note, Medford's Tower is used by other surrounding cities as well.

175
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,346
[SPEAKER_00]: They will lose the current storage for all their apparatus.

176
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:33,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And five, if they stay at the current location, a new heating system will have to be purchased as theirs is was in the old police basement.

177
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:40,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mayor has shown good faith by starting the real process of finally building out the long overdue police headquarters.

178
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:48,331
[SPEAKER_00]: she now has to step up again, just a little more, and add the fire headquarters with it or next to it.

179
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:58,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't even get into the whole, the new role, new role of the, new role of the fire departments.

180
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,641
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, thank you very much for listening and considering my thoughts.

181
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:02,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

182
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:02,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Martin.

183
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:08,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Papers in the hands of the clerk, offered by Counselor Box.

184
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:12,575
[SPEAKER_07]: be it resolved that parking on Elm Street be discussed.

185
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:14,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Marks.

186
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:18,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

187
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:29,982
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone that's been around this city for a period of time will know that the issue of parking on Elm Street has been a bone of contention with neighbors for a lot of years.

188
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken recently with

189
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,901
[SPEAKER_03]: several neighbors that live on Elm Street and have been on Elm Street for over 35 years.

190
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:54,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And they too would agree, for the past 35 years, they have been, as neighbors on, residents on Elm Street, have been able to park their vehicle two wheels on the sidewalk and two wheels on the street.

191
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has been an accepted practice for

192
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:01,075
[SPEAKER_03]: probably close to at least the last 10 years at least.

193
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:05,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And prior to that, it was an accepted practice, Mr. President.

194
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:27,746
[SPEAKER_03]: When the two wheels are parked on the sidewalk, there was a line drawn, and if any counselor wants to go and check it out, a white line drawn that showed where it allowed at least four feet in opening that would allow strollers, wheelchair, or any other accessibility issue to be able to pass by.

195
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:32,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's assuming the car parked with the two wheels on the white line.

196
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:47,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, July 11th to be specific, DCR sent out a letter, July 11th, 2016, to advise residents of Elm Street that they would no longer be able to park half on the sidewalk and half on the street.

197
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:53,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And they referenced two different code of mass regulations, 5.02 and dash two,

198
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:25,275
[SPEAKER_03]: and 5.02-28, which more or less says you can't park in a crosswalk or a sidewalk, and no stopping or standing a vehicle, whether occupied or not occupied, and the latter of the two just says that you can't park on parkland, and no person shall stop or stand on parkland, and that even if there's no sign, that you can still enforce it.

199
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

200
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:30,369
[SPEAKER_03]: The residents that received this notice were quite upset.

201
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:35,492
[SPEAKER_03]: They immediately got on the line, called their local state rep, Representative Donato.

202
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:46,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there was an on-site meeting with DCR, Rep Donato, Mayor Burke, and Chief Sacco, and they walked from Equavia to Equavia.

203
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes out in a horseshoe, because most of the impact is those 10 homes between Equavia and Equavia.

204
00:16:55,781 --> 00:17:07,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And they felt, and this is DCR at the time, that there were no other circumstances other than to remove the parking because there was an issue with disability and people getting down the road.

205
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you only go a little further up the street on the side of where Wright's Pond is, there's no sidewalk at all.

206
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:25,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess if you're walking down that area, you have to either walk in the street or cross over to continue your efforts to get to the top or the bottom of Elm Street.

207
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:36,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did, Mr. President, was I reached out to a number of the residents and they asked if there was any traffic calming approaches that we can take in the area.

208
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:43,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I think it might have been Councilor Falco at the time, offered a suggestion about putting a crosswalk.

209
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:44,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was across from Wrights Pond.

210
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Councilor Del Russo?

211
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:50,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a crosswalk across from Wrights Pond.

212
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:54,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that got denied at the time because the curvature of the road

213
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:58,444
[SPEAKER_03]: made it very difficult for people to cross there.

214
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:06,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, there was an electronic speed sign that was installed on Elm Street to help slow down the traffic, Mr. President.

215
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:14,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be quite frank with you, I think people just look at the sign to see how fast they're going and not slow down at all.

216
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:24,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And my suggestion tonight would be to ask DCR once again, because it's a state road, and also our traffic commission,

217
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:33,653
[SPEAKER_03]: to get together, Mr. President, because many people that do live on Elm Street and that particular portion of Elm Street may have a small driveway.

218
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:38,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at their driveways, they're pulling out on a very dangerous curve, first of all.

219
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:46,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, because of how their homes are situated, the driveways may be five and a half to six feet wide.

220
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:54,528
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you pull into the driveway, you can't open your door to get out because there's retaining walls, because the homes are built up in that particular area.

221
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're being told that they can park on Equavia and some of the other surrounding streets.

222
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:19,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in a winter like we just had, when there's black ice and so forth, to ask a 75-year-old woman to walk down the hill to go get her car, where she could have parking right in front of her home, that's been working for the past 30 years, to me is unacceptable, Mr. President.

223
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:21,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there should be a way around it.

224
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,077
[SPEAKER_03]: When Mayor McGlynn was in office,

225
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:37,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was back some probably 16 or 18 years ago, he created an agreement with then Commissioner Belfour that allowed residents to park two wheels on the sidewalk and two wheels on the street.

226
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:44,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, Mr. President, by allowing people to park, it had a calming effect on other vehicular traffic.

227
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:49,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And residents are noticing now, because there are no cars parked on the side,

228
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: that cars are really flying up and down Elm Street because they're unimpeded going up and down.

229
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:17,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that we send a message to DCR and also to our traffic commission to meet again, look at the problem that's facing these 10 homes in particular, because that's what it is, and ask that some solution be arrived at to help accommodate

230
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,435
[SPEAKER_03]: These residents are paying taxes in this.

231
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:23,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They may live on a state road, but they're paying taxes in this community.

232
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:29,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe, Mr. President, that they should have the right to park in front of their home on that street.

233
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:38,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And with us that we send a message to the Traffic Commission and DCR, I just want to thank

234
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:40,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Representative Donato.

235
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think we should send a message to him also?

236
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:44,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know he's been out there.

237
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,506
[SPEAKER_03]: He personally went up to Holmes.

238
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:59,812
[SPEAKER_03]: He personally made sure that when they did come out with the agreement that allowed them to park on the sidewalks, because he was instrumental in that, that the residents adhered to parking on the white line, which allowed access on the sidewalk.

239
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And he actually went up to Holmes where the cars were parked a little further off and knocked the door.

240
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So he has done a lot of work in allowing residents the opportunity to park there, Mr. President.

241
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:22,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if we looked at, you know, maybe the winter months, maybe from November to February, we allow residents to park on that area.

242
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have to walk in the nicer months to one of the surrounding streets and park.

243
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's got to be a compromise.

244
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't compromise on this, Mr. President, on behalf of the residents of Elm Street.

245
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:35,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

246
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:36,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

247
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this topic up.

248
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:59,788
[SPEAKER_02]: As I think back to my time working in Senator Shannon's office, which ended back in 2005, this very same issue was something that would pop up now and again, but not quite often, because the state delegation did have tremendous luck in negotiating on behalf of the residents to ensure that parking was still allowed in that area, Mr. President.

249
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Mox hit the nail on the head.

250
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:04,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is really a simple issue.

251
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the practice continue as it does.

252
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made some accommodations, some negotiation to determine that this is what can be done to help the residents in the neighborhood.

253
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,171
[SPEAKER_02]: They've grown accustomed to it, and I don't think it's hurting anybody, Mr. President.

254
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I'd like to thank Councilor Mox for bringing this issue up.

255
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:25,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly brings back some great memories of 15 years ago working in the Statehouse and having the same topic come up.

256
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:26,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was addressed, Mr. President.

257
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It was addressed successfully.

258
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:34,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooler heads will prevail at the end of the day, and this is something that can be worked out, and I thank him for bringing this resolution forward, and I wholeheartedly support it.

259
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:35,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Move for a second.

260
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:36,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

261
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:55,461
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, that the Traffic Commission, DCR, and the city meet to resolve some type of resolution to the parking problem there, and if we could all CC Representative Donato on the issue, and any help that he could be with this also.

262
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And our state senator.

263
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And our state senator, Senator Jim.

264
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:14,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, if we can offer the compromise, Mr. President, maybe during the winter months to allow parking there, because that seems to be the issue that I've heard from residents, that they're concerned about walking down the hill in icy weather, and I can't blame them.

265
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

266
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not far, but it's enough to be of concern.

267
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: That we at least allow parking during the winter months.

268
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:25,926
[SPEAKER_07]: So the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

269
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,786
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

270
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:27,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

271
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:27,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed?

272
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:31,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Langel-Kran.

273
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:41,312
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could just also add at the end, as long as they park so that a wheelchair or... To meet the handicap accessible requirements.

274
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:41,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, correct.

275
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:49,916
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as, I think that's always been how it is, but if we just add that language to the end so we make sure all our... Thank you, Councilor Langel-Kran.

276
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,678
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

277
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

278
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:54,978
Aye.

279
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:56,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

280
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered.

281
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:12,919
[SPEAKER_07]: by President Carabiello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council commend and congratulate Cheryl Delfano on her recent selection as Citizen of the Year by the Memphis Chamber of Commerce.

282
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

283
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:25,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheryl was selected this week for her great work that she's done in this community with people, with children that have had problems and again,

284
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:33,171
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know Cheryl, I've known Cheryl for many, many years, and her and her family, they're good people, and she's done a lot of work to help a lot of families.

285
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:36,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank her for her work and congratulate her.

286
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:38,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor DelaRusso.

287
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:43,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known Cheryl and Bobby for a long time, too, and I love Cheryl.

288
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:44,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

289
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:45,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

290
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:47,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Longo-Kern.

291
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:50,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I just move approval of your paper.

292
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:53,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Cheryl myself as well, and what she...

293
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:54,985
[SPEAKER_01]: It surprises me.

294
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:57,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy to hear her name tonight.

295
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:03,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I was unaware that she was selected as Citizen of the Year, but I'm very happy to hear that.

296
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:08,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually Citizens of the Year for different reasons.

297
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:19,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she does for this community and those with substance abuse and parents of children with substance abuse and the anonymous classes she runs is amazing.

298
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:22,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody, good dignity, good people, they deserve the award.

299
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:22,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Counselor Knight.

300
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:24,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

301
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:31,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to just piggyback a little bit on what Counselor Lungo-Curran says, because I think it's very important that we point out why Cheryl was selected to be Citizen of the Year.

302
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:37,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no secret that there's an opiate epidemic in Massachusetts and that Medford is not immune to it.

303
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:38,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

304
00:25:38,776 --> 00:25:50,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Delfano has really dedicated the majority of the last year and more helping those families in need, whether it be providing services to get into rehabilitation clinics for their children,

305
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:58,652
[SPEAKER_02]: or to provide family counseling services to let people know where they can get help to learn how to cope with this issue that affects families across the country, across the community, across the state.

306
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:01,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I really commend her work.

307
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:04,395
[SPEAKER_02]: She's taking on a very difficult undertaking.

308
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:15,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that gets very emotional for families, and this type of guidance is very, very, very necessary in order for families to be able to cope and overcome some of the issues that come along with opiate addiction.

309
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:19,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the opportunity of attending one of the community police meetings, and I was

310
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:39,843
[SPEAKER_02]: very surprised to hear that I believe the figures were 107 times in 2016 that Narcan was administered for what would be suspected as opiate overdoses, Mr. President, with a mortality of 19 individuals passing away in our community in 2016 for what is suspected to be opiate-related deaths.

311
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:45,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, that's more than 10 percent of the individuals that are receiving a dose of Narcan.

312
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,311
[SPEAKER_02]: are eventually passing away from this disease.

313
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:53,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need more people in our community like Cheryl, and I thank her for her work and congratulate her.

314
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:53,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

315
00:26:54,274 --> 00:27:02,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Clark, if we could arrange for a citation for her that could be handed out on the night of her receiving the honor, we'll be appreciated.

316
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:04,402
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

317
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:04,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

318
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:05,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

319
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:08,105
[SPEAKER_07]: The Ricketts.

320
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:11,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

321
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:17,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, we adopted a committee report for the zoning and ordinance subcommittee, Mr. President.

322
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,050
[SPEAKER_02]: They called for two meetings.

323
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:25,616
[SPEAKER_02]: They called for a meeting on 217 and a meeting on, I'm sorry, a meeting on 213 and a meeting on 220.

324
00:27:25,997 --> 00:27:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The 213 meeting was canceled due to snow and the 227 meeting, Mr. President, has been canceled due to the fact that we are going to be having our committee of the whole meeting relative to the funding proposal for the police station.

325
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:40,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted individuals in the community to be aware that those two meetings are canceled.

326
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

327
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:53,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow evening, there will be a meeting of the Council of the whole in regards to the bond issue.

328
00:27:54,866 --> 00:28:09,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'll also be a meeting on Monday, the 27th, which the mayor and her staff will be in attendance and also regards to the bond issue regarding the police station.

329
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:10,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

330
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:16,998
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of the meeting were passed to Counselor DelaRusso.

331
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor DelaRusso, how have you found those records?

332
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:29,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, due to my ill state, I'm unable to read them in great detail, so I ask that they be referred to next week, that they be tabled.

333
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:37,717
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion that the records be tabled, as Counselor DelaRusso is not feeling well this evening until next week, all those in favor?

334
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:40,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Scott Pele to adjourn.

335
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

336
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:44,300
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor, aye.

337
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:46,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.
