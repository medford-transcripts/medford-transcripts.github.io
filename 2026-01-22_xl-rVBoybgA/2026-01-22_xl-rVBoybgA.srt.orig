1
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,158
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you want to play the real way where we don't show each other?

2
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Check mic one, two, there we go.

3
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:04,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's still check mic one, two, check mic, check mic.

4
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Mic one, two, there it is.

5
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bring it down a little bit in the booth.

6

[SPEAKER_05]: And Doug Carr, present.

36
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:03,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

37
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I called Doug Dave once when we were doing a historic reenactment, and I've never let myself forget about it, so.

38
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:12,884
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, if we could all please rise to salute the flag.

39
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:30,929
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, motions, orders, and resolutions.

40
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:39,404
[SPEAKER_07]: 26-022 offered by definitely not Kit Collins, Councilor Matt Leming, the resolution to adopt our joint session rules, and I'll recognize Councilor Leming.

41
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

42
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:54,642
[SPEAKER_08]: These are just some joint session rules that I wrote up and discussed in a working group meeting.

43
00:10:54,742 --> 00:11:04,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It's based very closely on the joint session rules that the Medford City Council and School Committee hold once a year.

44
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:14,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to do additional research on other bases for these, so these joint meetings have been done by other municipalities in the past.

45
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:23,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Salem broadcasts all of their joint sessions with their planning board, as well as, I believe, Peabody.

46
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:33,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And one other city that I'm not recalling have broadcast their own versions of this that I found on YouTube.

47
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe the rules of the...

48
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:45,755
[SPEAKER_08]: joint session that are written here reflect basically what I saw when I viewed those meetings.

49
00:11:46,015 --> 00:12:07,180
[SPEAKER_08]: So the long and short of it is that the bodies that are present vote city council and then school committee and if both bodies vote in the affirmative on any particular motion, then the motion passes.

50
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:20,554
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do need to approve these just so that we have some agreement on what this joint session will look like moving forward.

51
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:25,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

52
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a motion to approve?

53
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:35,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a motion for the City Council to approve, and we'll also have to see a motion from the CDB after.

54
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:42,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, yes, on the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Millane to approve.

55
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:47,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any further discussion by members of the Council on the joint session rules?

56
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:55,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, I will turn it over to Chair Carr and then we'll take a vote after the City Board has deliberated.

57
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're gonna be adopting the same rules, correct?

58
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:08,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

59
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:15,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I need a motion to adopt the rules that you all received in your packets to align with the city council.

60
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:20,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adopt.

61
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:20,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

62
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, I'll call the roll.

63
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:22,648
[SPEAKER_05]: John Anderson?

64
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

65
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:25,109
[SPEAKER_05]: John Began?

66
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

67
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:26,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Dina Calgaro?

68
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

69
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

70
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

71
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:30,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paige Valdini?

72
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:30,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

73
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:32,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, yes.

74
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:33,572
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes six to nothing.

75
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we haven't adopted them yet, I've already broken the rules once.

76
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,611
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have voted before you guys did.

77
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:49,355
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll have that for us on the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Malayne to adopt the joint session rules.

78
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

79
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:53,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kalyan.

80
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:54,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

81
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lazaro.

82
00:13:59,061 --> 00:13:59,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

83
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:01,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemming.

84
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

85
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:03,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Malayne.

86
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:04,604
Yes.

87
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:05,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:06,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

89
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:08,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Singh.

90
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:08,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

91
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:10,206
[SPEAKER_09]: President Peters.

92
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:11,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

93
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:12,528
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 affirmative, none of the negative.

94
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:16,110
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes and the joint session rules are approved.

95
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all.

96
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

97
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Now for the fun stuff.

98
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:28,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Our motions, orders, or actually our hearings.

99
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:42,712
[SPEAKER_07]: We have hearings, paper 26023 offered by Councilor Lemming, public hearing proposed amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Medford Square.

100
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:58,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Generally how we do public hearings on the council and it's, you know, I think maybe a little bit different on the Community Development Board is we generally hear a presentation

101
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: from the proponent or in this case likely from Innis Associates.

102
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: We have discussion and then we open the public hearing to hear from members of the public.

103
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:18,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys do it a little differently so I'm going to turn it over to Doug to do what you do for public hearings for the Community Development Board.

104
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chair Behrs.

105
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:45,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Our process on the CD board, and I'm gonna need some, first of all, I just wanna acknowledge that we have members of the planning staff here for, who are present, who can answer questions for the council or for the community development board.

106
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:58,747
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me go to the text which is our normal boilerplate for opening a public hearing in for the city board if you just give me one second.

107
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:47,352
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

108
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:53,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any way that I can grab it, or do you want to read it from here?

109
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:53,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

110
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:54,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this it?

111
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:54,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

112
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:55,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

113
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this on?

114
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:57,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

115
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,179
The whole thing?

116
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:10,081
[SPEAKER_05]: At least you said we don't have to, but I think at least let's stop here.

117
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the Medford Community Development Board

118
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,430
[SPEAKER_17]: from here to there.

119
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

120
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:15,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Aisha.

121
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:24,937
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford Community Development Board, the CDB, and the Medford City Council shall conduct a joint public hearing on January 21st, 2020 after 6.30 p.m.

122
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:40,468
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom via remote videoconferencing relative to the following proposed amendment to the City of Medford zoning ordinance and zoning map.

123
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:54,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, amend section 94-2.1, division into districts in section 94-9.0, special district regulations to add to the Memphis Square District, the MSD.

124
00:17:55,973 --> 00:18:09,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, amend section 94-3.2, table of use regulations, table A, by incorporating the MSD zoning district into the existing table and to designate the uses permitted therein.

125
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:24,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three, amend section 94-4.1 table of dimensional requirements, which is table B, by incorporating the MST zoning district into the existing table and to state the dimensional requirements therein.

126
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:31,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, amend section 94-12 definitions to amend and add various definitions.

127
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And number five, amending the zoning map to change the zoning district designations of various properties to the MSD zoning district as shown in the map entitled Medford Square Zoning prepared by Innis Associates and dated March 2025.

128
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:46,732
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

129
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

130
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:49,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

131
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Carr.

132
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:55,097
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

133
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:57,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we are here.

134
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:05,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to welcome everyone back to our first zoning meeting of 2026 of this new council term.

135
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome our CD board members as well.

136
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:15,585
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think just some grounding that is important is how we arrived here.

137
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:25,492
[SPEAKER_07]: A little over four years ago, this city began work on its first citywide comprehensive plan.

138
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:36,300
[SPEAKER_07]: And that planning process lasted for over a year and resulted in January 2023 with the publication of the citywide comprehensive plan.

139
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:50,868
[SPEAKER_07]: That comprehensive plan, and I'll go a little bit more into this later, but one piece of implementing that plan, which is a 30-year vision for what we want our community to look like, involved making amendments to the city zoning ordinance.

140
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:59,914
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2024, the council was able to get funding to begin a zoning updates project.

141
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:15,703
[SPEAKER_07]: We issued an RFP at the end of 2023 actually, made a selection of a consultant team which consisted of Innis Associates at the time as well as some partners including the Bobrowski

142
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:38,749
[SPEAKER_07]: and Jonathan Silverstein representing them, and they had worked with us on the recodification of our zoning ordinance from 2020 to 2022, which basically took the 50-year-old zoning and put it into a better format from which we could start to have conversations about what we want the city's zoning to look like.

143
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:43,370
[SPEAKER_07]: This is year three of that zoning updates project.

144
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:58,676
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2024 and 2025, the city council and the community development board and our planning staff and our planning consultant team held hundreds of hours of discussions, public meetings, community forums and receive feedback and engagement.

145
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:06,959
[SPEAKER_07]: In the first months of that process in 2024, we developed a citywide framework for rezoning.

146
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially, that citywide framework included 10, about 10 proposed zoning amendments.

147
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:33,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Through 2024 and 2025, that resulted in the passage of three zoning amendments, the Mystic Avenue Corridor District, Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District, and the Green Score Zoning Ordinance, as well as the development of several other of those 10 areas, including the one that is on the agenda tonight for Medford Square.

148
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:41,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Last spring and summer, I think as everybody well knows, it was the talk of the town and in some ways continues to be.

149
00:21:42,543 --> 00:22:00,127
[SPEAKER_07]: There became a serious disagreement, I would say, between the city council and the mayor with our CD board and others kind of caught in the middle around the scope of the proposed residential zoning, as well as the CDB's proposed amendments to the council's proposed residential zoning.

150
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:05,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really derailed the process of our zoning updates project.

151
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:18,142
[SPEAKER_07]: In July, that project was paused by the mayor, and it was only in December that the mayor and the council reached an agreement to get that process back on track.

152
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:23,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk a little bit about that very quickly before we get into the process.

153
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,206
[SPEAKER_07]: the rest of the discussion for tonight.

154
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:38,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So December 3rd, after the city council meeting on December 2nd, the city made a statement, put out a release around the mayor and the city council agreeing on a plan to restart the city's zoning updates project.

155
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:50,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It states here, the city will sign an extension and provide additional resources to advance key zoning priorities in Medford Square, Tufts and Boston Avenue between now, this is December and May, 2026.

156
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:59,619
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the City will solicit new proposals starting in February and March for work on zoning updates between May 2026 and June 2028.

157
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:10,925
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mayor, in collaboration with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, will appropriate funding to sign a contract extension with Innis Associates, you changed your name, Innis Land Strategies Group,

158
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:12,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

159
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:17,571
[SPEAKER_07]: To perform work in the following areas from December 2025 to May 2026.

160
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:21,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I'm calling phase one.

161
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:25,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Phase one of year three of part two of this grand adventure.

162
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,584
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just think it's important to kind of focus that this agreement has two phases.

163
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:45,834
[SPEAKER_07]: December 2025 to May 2026, where we are now, we've extended our contract with INIS, our planning consultant team, to work on essentially two major areas with two supplements.

164
00:23:45,894 --> 00:24:00,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So the full Medford Square zoning update, as it says here, and the Tufts Institutional Zone and Boston Avenue, as well as cleanup areas of zoning in accordance with needs of the building commissioner and our planning department, and communications and community engagement support.

165
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's phase one, that's where we are now.

166
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:13,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so folks know, since this has been such a big conversation, it also says that we would hold a joint public hearing in January.

167
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:21,251
[SPEAKER_07]: You are here to discuss the rezoning proposal for Medford Square and West Medford Square that's currently sitting in the Community Development Board.

168
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,972
[SPEAKER_07]: In December, we split those two proposals.

169
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're just here tonight talking about Medford Square

170
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:32,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Following this, a request for proposal, so that's phase one.

171
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:43,306
[SPEAKER_07]: But after that, phase two, a request for proposals for a new contract will be released to bidders in February or March, and a proposal will be selected in April to begin work in May through June 2028.

172
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:51,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And that includes basically the bulk of what was left from the zoning framework from the first two years of this project.

173
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:59,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't go into everything, but that includes the West Medford Square piece that was split off, Wellington and Mystic Valley Parkway, Main Street and Broadway,

174
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:15,935
[SPEAKER_07]: parking, the residential, and some other items like our affordable housing overlay, updates to inclusionary zoning, transportation demand management, and it very specifically states parking will take place at the same time as residential zoning.

175
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:25,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And then other agreements that that RFP and additional funds will include really where the process fell apart.

176
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:43,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So more funds for public relations and community engagement, including a professionally designed standalone zoning website, support for neighborhood meetings, and better outreach into the community ahead of those zoning meetings via all of the tools available to us, mailers, text messages, robocalls, and social media.

177
00:25:46,806 --> 00:26:00,744
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot, but what we're doing here in phase one is we're talking about Medford Square, Tufts Institutional Zone and Boston Avenue, some cleanup issues, and Ennis will be supporting our team on the communications and community engagement, which will include

178
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:11,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I think four neighborhood meetings, and right now the thinking is two on each of the two main proposals, so Medford Square and the Tufts Institutional in Boston Avenue.

179
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:20,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll come back, I think really with the resources we need, something we've been talking about and something I talked about last summer.

180
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:43,485
[SPEAKER_07]: after the project had, well, around when the project got put on hold, was we have been given a huge charge with this project, which is to update our city zoning for the first time in decades, to align our city zoning with its first comprehensive plan in memory, certainly in the last 50 years.

181
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:43,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And,

182
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,713
[SPEAKER_07]: That is essential.

183
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:48,513
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to do it.

184
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Our city needs it.

185
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,595
[SPEAKER_07]: People have been demanding it.

186
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:57,580
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had so many plans that have been put on a shelf and never activated for places like Medford Square and for our whole community.

187
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:05,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the one thing that maybe everyone agrees on, even if they don't necessarily agree on the destination, is the potential that our community has.

188
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:10,750
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that, I think we,

189
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:19,683
[SPEAKER_07]: We took that charge very seriously and we tried to do a very big job without getting the resources that we needed to do everything that we wanted to do.

190
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:31,658
[SPEAKER_07]: The RFP we put out in 2023 had pretty significant limits due to the limited funding that was appropriated by the mayor's administration to the project.

191
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:47,962
[SPEAKER_07]: We took the best proposal, we got a great team, but we did not have the level of resources and support to communicate effectively and hear from our residents about how they want to see our comprehensive plan put into action through zoning.

192
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:56,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, certainly myself and I think the council and its discussions really has reflected on that over the last six months.

193
00:27:57,227 --> 00:28:01,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was part of what informed this agreement with the mayor.

194
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:14,250
[SPEAKER_07]: We were insistent that the level of resources that's needed to effectively accomplish this job needed to be appropriated and provided by the mayor in order for us to move forward.

195
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:20,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the agreement that we reached in December reflects that, and I'm excited to work with everyone here to do that.

196
00:28:23,477 --> 00:28:37,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So just really quickly before I go into a little bit more of how the meeting's going to go, I just want to really ground us very quickly in some of the key values that we're talking about from our comprehensive plan.

197
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:40,848
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one is open and engaged communication.

198
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we were open and engaged, but I don't think we had enough resources to do enough communication.

199
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:53,577
[SPEAKER_07]: welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, vibrant places, access for all, climate resilience.

200
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:56,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are some big areas.

201
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:06,395
[SPEAKER_07]: frameworks for us to talk about our city's plan, but a lot of that boils down to a few things.

202
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:17,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Growth, how do we enable growth in our city so that we can build more vibrant squares, so that we can grow in all of the places that we know growth is possible.

203
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:25,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Housing, how can we invite more neighbors to welcome more neighbors to live in our community alongside us?

204
00:29:26,387 --> 00:29:38,474
[SPEAKER_07]: How can we do both of those things in a way that helps transform our squares into even more thriving places that people want to go to with even more wonderful businesses that people want to be part of?

205
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:49,219
[SPEAKER_07]: and make those places walkable so that people feel safe and excited to spend their days and evenings in the beautiful commercial areas that we have in our city.

206
00:29:50,559 --> 00:30:02,367
[SPEAKER_07]: historic preservation, how do we do all of that and make sure that our city's amazing history over the last 400 years stays as a key part of our story.

207
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:05,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, two other things.

208
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:09,452
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we expand our green space, our open space?

209
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,474
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we make that more accessible?

210
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:13,315
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we activate our beautiful river?

211
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:25,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the last thing is just like a clear and consistent process, both so that we have accountability for our community's needs, and that when people wanna build things here, they know how things are going to work.

212
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:39,315
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that it's very clear when someone wants to build something here, how that's gonna go, and make sure that the things that people are building here are aligned with the vision and values of our community.

213
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:47,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I think something that we talked about a lot over the last two years was what is zoning and what zoning isn't.

214
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:52,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Zoning is about executing our comprehensive plan.

215
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:58,234
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about putting into law what we want to see our city look like in 25, 30, 50 years.

216
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is, quite frankly, it's about telling people what they can and cannot do with their private property.

217
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:05,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that is...

218
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,744
[SPEAKER_07]: a sticky wicket in a lot of directions.

219
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:20,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know there's a lot of people in this community who never expected a Democratic Socialist like me to be so supportive of letting people do more with their private property.

220
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,161
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is...

221
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:26,217
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's a really tough thing.

222
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:36,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Where does the private and the public conflict when our public needs and what people want to do with their private land, when those needs and values are not aligned?

223
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:43,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Zoning is essentially the agreement that we all come to about what people can and can't do.

224
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I think the other thing is zoning is not a cure-all.

225
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:53,265
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not solve all of our community's problems with the best zoning ordinance.

226
00:31:53,386 --> 00:32:10,778
[SPEAKER_07]: We could craft the best zoning ordinance in the history of zoning ordinances, and it won't address how big our fire department needs to be, you know, how we manage traffic, how we help people get from place to place, and how we, you know, it's also not a cure-all for the housing crisis, right?

227
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:15,282
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't solve all of those problems, but all of those problems interface with it.

228
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:23,908
[SPEAKER_07]: But that all stems from what is our vision for our city for the next, what do we want Medford to look like in 30 years?

229
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:26,049
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we want the next generation of people to live here?

230
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:27,951
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of community do we want them to live in?

231
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:40,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can create zoning that represents that vision, then from that we will find answers to those other questions that need answers, that zoning will never be the answer for.

232
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:44,383
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, I do wanna just talk a little bit about

233
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,174
[SPEAKER_07]: how things are gonna go tonight.

234
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:59,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just kind of did a quick introduction, talked about the process agreed to by the mayor and the council in December around this next part of our zoning updates project.

235
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:14,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, we will hear from our Innis Land Strategies Group folks who will talk a little bit about the process to this point and the scope of their role during this first phase, talking about Medford Square and our Tufts Institutional Zone in Boston Ave.

236
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:25,474
[SPEAKER_07]: We will pause at that point for questions from the Council and Community Development Board about the scope of this phase of work and how Innis Land Strategies Group will be part of it.

237
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:32,758
[SPEAKER_07]: At that point, we will hear a presentation from Innis on the Medford Square zoning before us tonight.

238
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,902
[SPEAKER_07]: The CD board chair, Doug Carr, has some remarks and introductory that he'll make after that presentation.

239
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:48,529
[SPEAKER_07]: then we will have City Council and Community Development Board talking about the specific presentation in the Medford Square proposal, and then we will have our public comment.

240
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:59,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are a lot of things, and it sounds like it'll take a long time, but I'm hoping we can move through that with diligence and get all the information we need on the table.

241
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:06,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that, I'm happy to invite Emily and her team up to

242
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:15,177
[SPEAKER_07]: present on what this phase of the project looks like where we are once again working with them and very lucky to be working with them once again.

243
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:27,124
[SPEAKER_03]: President, I'm just going to plug in first and then share my screen.

244
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:35,109
[SPEAKER_07]: In 18 months, we're going to make this all easier because we have to expand this whole chamber for four more counselors who really want to talk.

245
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:45,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Just making sure it's coming up.

246
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:48,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

247
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:48,919
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

248
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you all hear me?

249
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

250
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

251
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:58,110
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, Emily Keyes Ennis, president of the Ennis Land Strategies Group.

252
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:01,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned it off.

253
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always fun.

254
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:05,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

255
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:07,499
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

256
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:11,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, for the record, Emily Keyes, NS President of NS Land Strategies Group.

257
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:19,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I am delighted to be here again, along with my team, Paola Ramos-Martinez, our Chief Resilience Officer, is with me tonight.

258
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, of course, have the same team and a few more since we last met.

259
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:28,866
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things have changed, and you mentioned one already, Mr. President.

260
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:32,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We have changed our name to NS Land Strategies Group.

261
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:42,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to go through first what our role is going to be, and let me just go to the next page here.

262
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:44,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about the project scope.

263
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:57,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I will then stop, as you suggested, and take questions from the counselors and the members of the Community Development Board on what that scope is, and then we'll talk a little bit about the background to Medford Square.

264
00:35:57,765 --> 00:36:04,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you said earlier, we have two phases, January to March, March really to May rather than June.

265
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:07,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase one is Medford Square.

266
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a few cleanup items that were requested by city staff on some of the earlier portions of the zoning that passed last year.

267
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:22,986
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have two community meetings and we are delighted to have those as well as four meetings with city officials.

268
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So some combination of city council

269
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:31,293
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly back to planning and permitting committee and certainly community development board meetings.

270
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:36,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the same again for the Tufts institutional zoning and Boston Avenue.

271
00:36:36,837 --> 00:36:41,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily, if I could just note, these do not reflect the phase one and phase two I was talking about.

272
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,003
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sub-phase one and sub-phase two of phase one.

273
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:50,386
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not coordinate our phasing before this meeting.

274
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:54,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase A and Phase B maybe.

275
00:36:55,188 --> 00:36:59,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly one of the meetings that we talked about, so we got our contract last week.

276
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We had our first kickoff meeting last week.

277
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:13,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things we talked about at that kickoff meeting is we would really love to meet with all of the community development board, but certainly the new members just to go a little bit

278
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:23,985
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot more in-depth than we can go tonight on what went on last year in terms of what implications that has for where we are now.

279
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:30,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the thing that I really want to stress tonight is

280
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:40,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next steps which begin tonight is our role tonight is to listen.

281
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:42,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It is to listen to the city council members.

282
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:50,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It is to listen to the community development board members and most especially most importantly it is to listen to the community.

283
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:52,355
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who are behind me in person now.

284
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,717
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who are online.

285
00:37:54,257 --> 00:38:02,321
[SPEAKER_03]: We know a lot has changed since we last talked with you all, and we want to make sure that we hear as much as we can tonight.

286
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:07,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It is certainly not the only opportunity, but it is the first opportunity.

287
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:18,950
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, as we did last time, we will be part of a city working group to deal with logistics, and one of those logistics is going to be to schedule the community meetings.

288
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:34,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Discuss the format of the content of the materials for those and then confirm an overall meeting schedule with the Community Development Board and City Council to take us first through Medford Square and then through the Tufts Institutional and Boston Avenue zoning.

289
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:41,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the key next steps that were going to happen because that will determine the pace and pattern of that.

290
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Our role as consultants is to listen, is to offer information.

291
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:51,068
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be going through some of the information we've offered in the past tonight.

292
00:38:51,909 --> 00:39:07,783
[SPEAKER_03]: As members of the public bring forward questions, as members of the city officials bring forward questions, to do the research and answer those, to provide the implications of choices and possible decisions to say if you choose to do this,

293
00:39:08,323 --> 00:39:09,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the pros and cons.

294
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:17,909
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, that decision making is up to the people of the city who are involved in the process.

295
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:20,230
[SPEAKER_03]: We are information providers.

296
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,653
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the people who, as I said, give the pros and cons and the implications.

297
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:31,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But you all ultimately are decision makers and your recommendations to the city council.

298
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:34,538
[SPEAKER_03]: and city council in terms of their votes.

299
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:38,198
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what we will give you is the public input that we hear.

300
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:40,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're delighted to be here.

301
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, quick overview of the schedule.

302
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to answer any questions as to process before we move on to Medford Square itself.

303
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:54,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, all right.

304
00:39:55,424 --> 00:40:05,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have questions from members of the council for Innis right at this point on the scope of phase one, part A and part B?

305
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:09,649
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, seeing none.

306
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:11,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Councilor Lemming.

307
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, it wasn't a question, it was more of a comment just to clarify one thing on the slides.

308
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:24,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just so that we have transparency.

309
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:34,700
[SPEAKER_08]: When they say the city's working group, right there, just so that folks in the public are aware of that, that's an internal group consisting of

310
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:48,231
[SPEAKER_08]: In his land group, members of the Office of Planning Development and Sustainability, as well as a sub quorum of both the Community Development Board and the City Council.

311
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:58,939
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as the mayor and the building commissioner, director of communications, some other executive staff.

312
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:10,428
[SPEAKER_08]: The purpose of that is to plan the content of these meetings and just have some background for discussion.

313
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:17,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I am making sure that the other members of the council and community development board

314
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:24,535
[SPEAKER_08]: aware of what's discussed in those meetings, although we do have open meeting law to consider.

315
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:32,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I'm gonna be planning on taking notes and having the respective clerks send out the discussions that take place in those.

316
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just so the public is aware of what that means.

317
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:37,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

318
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

319
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any more questions from members of the City Council at this time for Emily Ennis?

320
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:54,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none in the chamber and no hands on Zoom, I will turn it over to Chair Carr.

321
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:58,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I would ask the same from the Community Development Board.

322
00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:02,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone have any specific questions about the scope of work going forward?

323
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:05,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

324
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:08,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You can request on the thing and then we can see which mic you have.

325
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:13,004
[SPEAKER_07]: If you push the little person, yep, and then we can enable you here.

326
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:14,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Ari Fishman.

327
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:16,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

328
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,242
[SPEAKER_02]: My first time sitting here.

329
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a question about process more broadly rather than the specifics but going off of our experience last year.

330
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:36,216
[SPEAKER_02]: May I request and we had discussed this during the last kind of big process meeting when we talked about timing.

331
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:40,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a good principle that can concretely

332
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:49,636
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate these desires for community feedback is that every decision should have at least two rounds of iteration for public comment.

333
00:42:50,456 --> 00:42:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the frustrations or difficulties was trying to get through things kind of in a very short period of time.

334
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:04,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything we should get an opportunity to see, get public feedback, incorporate that feedback, go to the public again.

335
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:10,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's not necessarily the type of process we're talking about right now, but I'd love to

336
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:12,165
[SPEAKER_02]: commit to that.

337
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things to add to that.

338
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:31,271
[SPEAKER_03]: One, excuse me, couldn't agree more in terms of figuring out a way of getting information to the public, getting their feedback, and then bringing it back again.

339
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:38,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that goes into the overall work schedule that we're talking about and also the fact of how do we time those community meetings.

340
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:47,240
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that I think we all saw happen last year was the kind of piling on of topics simultaneously.

341
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:57,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the advantages of phase A and phase B is that phase A, Medford Square, needs to be complete before phase B comes forward.

342
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean that we're not working on the research and the information and all of that in the background, getting that ready to come forward.

343
00:44:05,652 --> 00:44:08,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does mean that the city board

344
00:44:08,174 --> 00:44:13,296
[SPEAKER_03]: that the city council should not have two topics in front of them simultaneously.

345
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think that will help not only all of you in this room, but everybody trying to comment and not having to get confused about which zoning they're commenting on.

346
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:34,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from the community development board members?

347
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:44,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, seeing none, I would like to just reiterate that there's been a lot of turnover on the community development board over the last 12 months.

348
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:52,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I'm pretty new to this process, so we would ask for patience as we delve into these issues.

349
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:58,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And as an educational component here, that's really important, not just for the public, but for this board as well.

350
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:16,032
[SPEAKER_05]: to really understand for those of us who weren't in the weeds and in the battles for last year to try to come to a more clean process and one that is clear, constructive, and I think at the end produces a great result.

351
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:17,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm all set.

352
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:17,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

353
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:21,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Carp.

354
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:32,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari, to your point, that is really something we're trying to avoid this time, is the pile-up.

355
00:45:32,494 --> 00:45:37,755
[SPEAKER_07]: $200,000 in 18 months was not enough money and time to do this project.

356
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:40,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have more money and more time to do it now.

357
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:46,483
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I think that's it for this phase.

358
00:45:46,623 --> 00:46:05,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can go next to the next slide, I think, and we can start talking about this Medford Square proposal, the background, and maybe some of the initial adjustments to where we were when we had this before our boards eight months ago.

359
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

360
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:11,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're about to see a lot of slides.

361
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:16,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not going to go into depth into all the slides tonight.

362
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:21,727
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to do is call out the buckets of information we worked with last time.

363
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:39,205
[SPEAKER_03]: The primary bucket throughout the process was community comments, but let's start a little bit with where President Baird's left off, which was specific to Medford Square, there are three plans that we need to think about.

364
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:45,546
[SPEAKER_03]: the 2023 Comprehensive Plan, the 2022 Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

365
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:50,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those have specific requirements for Medford Square and also for the city as a whole.

366
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:55,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And then way back in 2005, there was a Medford Square Plan.

367
00:46:57,469 --> 00:47:03,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those recommendations have never been addressed and had quite a few zoning recommendations that didn't happen.

368
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:07,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we heard, it was instructive going back through the Comprehensive Plan,

369
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeing a quote being called out, if you're familiar with the format, you see little quotes and a quote called out saying, we need to implement the 2005 plan.

370
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:24,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to say, you know, give a little bit of history into the planning part that went into it.

371
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:28,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So Medford Square was obviously identified as a square in the plan.

372
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:31,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about corridors, centers, squares, gateways.

373
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: but also a civic and institutional anchor, primarily a civic.

374
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:46,288
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got City Hall, you have the library, you have the senior center, a couple of other city-owned properties as well as city active properties.

375
00:47:46,868 --> 00:47:56,674
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a transformational focus area and that meant that it was an area where things might change to meet some of the other goals of the comprehensive plan.

376
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:06,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've done here, and I'm sorry because I keep hitting the down arrow, but apparently that's not the down arrow anymore, thanks to the wisdom of Adobe PDFs.

377
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:13,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go into every single zoning strategy for Medford Square, but there were quite a few.

378
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:21,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And they targeted the overall goal categories that the President Behrs mentioned earlier.

379
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:39,478
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, zoning strategies for that, creating new opportunities for amenities in Medford's business districts, making development regulations consistent with the plan's vision for land use, creating commercial centers that meet residents' shopping needs,

380
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:52,063
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are also non-zoning strategies that affect Medford Square, and it's really important to remember, I think Councilor Behrs talked about it earlier, but zoning doesn't solve everything.

381
00:48:52,123 --> 00:49:04,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoning gives permissions for activities, it gives restrictions on activities, those activities being land uses, which could be commercial, residential, a mixture of both, industrial.

382
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:17,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives those permissions for what can happen, how much can happen, where the restrictions are on those in terms of dimensional standards or development standards, but it doesn't solve everything.

383
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:30,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two very tricky things that zoning can't perfectly solve that have been conversations in this community during this process, both of the comprehensive plan and last year's zoning process.

384
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,831
[SPEAKER_03]: One is affordable housing.

385
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:35,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoning can be an imperfect tool for affordable housing.

386
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other is historic preservation.

387
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I would add natural preservation, but because we've been mostly working with already developed areas, there has been less of a conversation up to this point.

388
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But historic preservation, historic rehabilitation, zoning can play a role, but it's not the only role.

389
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:59,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that when we look at some of the non-zoning strategies for Medford Square.

390
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: again, and welcoming and supportive neighborhood that calls out some of those non-zoning strategies for historic preservation.

391
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:20,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Placemaking is another thing, for example, that you would see in the comprehensive plan, creating cultural districts, for example, that zoning can help with, but not fully address.

392
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:22,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Again with the Adobe.

393
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:39,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other thing that we see is as we get into vibrant places, there are some non-zoning strategies in vibrant places that deal with arts, culture, programming of Medford's River.

394
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:44,720
[SPEAKER_03]: that affect Medford Square but don't necessarily affect the zoning.

395
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:58,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that we need to keep in mind as we're thinking about the zoning for Medford Square, what can and should zoning do in terms of permissions and restrictions and what other policies and strategies will be required.

396
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:03,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Access for all right size parking across all commercial centers.

397
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:11,878
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a vision for a public garage and future development and sustainability features to those to a public garage.

398
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:19,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a strategy that can help with economic development and housing square but is not a zoning strategy.

399
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So again thinking about how these things work together.

400
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:28,522
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also the additional zoning priorities and I already mentioned this that

401
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:40,830
[SPEAKER_03]: that the plan strongly recommended in its implementation section focusing on areas that have been studied already and Medford Square was a specific example and goes back to that 2005 plan.

402
00:51:41,651 --> 00:51:57,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the Climate Action Adaptation Plan in 2022 had use and development standards that would be appropriate for Medford Square, zoning standards, new buildings and redevelopments that would make Medford more affordable, resilient, and low carbon.

403
00:51:57,602 --> 00:52:06,770
[SPEAKER_03]: and a couple of other things that really fit more into development standards rather than use some dimensional standards, and that's something we'll be continuing to talk about.

404
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:17,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, going back all the way in history to 2005, that Medford Square Master Plan did have selected zoning recommendations.

405
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I've pulled out building height and massing, but it also had recommendations for parking and development standards.

406
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:29,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just showing this as an example of some of the things that were in there.

407
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:37,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It had some setback requirements as well as building in height and that's something else that we have and will continue to look at.

408
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the planning context.

409
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,883
[SPEAKER_03]: We also had the what is the existing zoning.

410
00:52:43,383 --> 00:52:51,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is primarily either commercial one or apartment two with a little smidge of general residential in the boundary that you see now.

411
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:54,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll explain a little bit more about this boundary later.

412
00:52:56,366 --> 00:53:03,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked out one dimensional standard because it's a dimensional standard that a lot of people focused on in the conversations and that is height.

413
00:53:04,188 --> 00:53:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So your existing zoning in these areas, the dimensional standards are actually by use rather than by district.

414
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:17,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things that we've been working on talking about changing.

415
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,634
[SPEAKER_03]: We certainly have in some of the others.

416
00:53:19,054 --> 00:53:24,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because when you have dimensional standards by use, you get a very inconsistent area.

417
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:33,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in this case, commercial one, which is the pink up there, residential buildings are six stories by right, so multifamily.

418
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:36,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Commercial buildings are four stories by right.

419
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:39,565
[SPEAKER_03]: A hotel is 15 stories by right.

420
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:43,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other permitted structures are four stories by right.

421
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is your existing zoning.

422
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:48,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Apartment two, similar in some ways.

423
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Residential buildings are six stories by right.

424
00:53:51,069 --> 00:54:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Commercial users are not allowed in apartment two, although we know in many cities what's allowed by zoning isn't necessarily what's on the ground.

425
00:54:00,513 --> 00:54:01,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford is one of them.

426
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:05,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And other permitted structures is 15 stories by right.

427
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:14,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And so understanding that this is in your current zoning and this may not be the result that you want has been part of those discussions.

428
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We also.

429
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise I'll get the hang of this.

430
00:54:19,742 --> 00:54:26,528
[SPEAKER_03]: We also looked, and so that's just a summary of the heights here.

431
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:32,514
[SPEAKER_03]: We also looked at what was going on in terms of other dimensions, not just height.

432
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to quickly flip through these maps.

433
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:40,401
[SPEAKER_03]: We had presented the citywide maps to the city council in a workshop back in June 2024.

434
00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:46,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had redone these maps later in the process just to be for Medford Square.

435
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:54,894
[SPEAKER_03]: We had also done a non-conforming analysis, but those were online maps rather than static maps, so I don't have them in this presentation today.

436
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:59,219
[SPEAKER_03]: That map is currently offline as we reconfigure this process.

437
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:03,202
[SPEAKER_03]: We anticipate it will go back online again during the process.

438
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:14,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So we looked at the study area, we looked at the existing land uses, which don't always match up to what zoning says they should be, because you have what are called non-conforming uses.

439
00:55:14,668 --> 00:55:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at the variety of lot sizes here, and one of the things that we look at is, as with height, is the lot size, does it match the zoning, or like many, many communities in New England,

440
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:32,777
[SPEAKER_03]: The lot sizes are non-conforming, and that's what would be on that map, on the online map.

441
00:55:33,217 --> 00:55:38,521
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at frontage, which is the amount of land at the principal street.

442
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:43,444
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at front setback, which is how far the building is set back from the street.

443
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Building height, and we'll look at that again as a comparison.

444
00:55:46,906 --> 00:55:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Building coverage, which is how much of the lot, the footprint of the building covers.

445
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:56,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And impervious surface, which is how much of the lot, including building,

446
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:02,619
[SPEAKER_03]: parking, driveways, patios that water cannot infiltrate into.

447
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:08,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's particularly important when you're looking at an area near a river and possibly in flood zones.

448
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:11,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We did also look at flood zones, but I don't have that here.

449
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:17,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, as I give you this massive flip through, I gotta have that.

450
00:56:18,335 --> 00:56:19,977
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at the historic assets.

451
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:24,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we had the wider MACRIS inventory for the entire city.

452
00:56:24,642 --> 00:56:32,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We've clipped that down to the Medford Square area, and so you can see, as we'll give this to the city obviously to post on the zoning website,

453
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can see that most of Medford Square, that blue, has been inventoried.

454
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:44,479
[SPEAKER_03]: The buildings in purple are on the National Register of Historic Places.

455
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:51,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, just being on the National Register does not provide protection for historic buildings.

456
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a little bit of the local historic district, which is that pink, clipped into our area.

457
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a look at that building today.

458
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:06,595
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one building that has a preservation restriction on it.

459
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:10,698
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a deed restriction, and we're in the process of pulling the deed to look at that.

460
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another building that has a preservation restriction on it and indicated with that star.

461
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding the history of the building.

462
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:20,144
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Grace Church, right?

463
00:57:20,164 --> 00:57:23,327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Grace Church is the one that has the preservation restriction.

464
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:29,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding what else is on the ground in terms of uses in history is really important.

465
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:30,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I remembered that time.

466
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:36,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just further studies that we can do and talk about.

467
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:39,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I picked height because it's a good one to look at.

468
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:45,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an aerial view of the area with some of the city buildings called out in white.

469
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:53,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the existing, on the top right-hand side, the existing building height of the buildings in the district now as we're looking at them.

470
00:57:54,304 --> 00:58:00,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go from a couple of one story buildings all the way up to a building that's in the 9 to 14 story range.

471
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:02,908
[SPEAKER_03]: We group them to make it easier to see.

472
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Down on the bottom left you see the existing zoning, the allowed height that I called out earlier, but makes it kind of easier to see them side by side.

473
00:58:12,013 --> 00:58:15,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the zoning that we ended up at the end of last year,

474
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:25,760
[SPEAKER_03]: with the allowed height in that proposed after it had gone through several versions of planning and permitting, CD board, and public input.

475
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,041
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the starting point.

476
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily, could you just, it's a little bit hard to read, on the proposed, could you just talk a little bit about what those heights are?

477
00:58:37,607 --> 00:58:42,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, or I could go onto the map, which I was going to go onto the large scale map for that very reason.

478
00:58:42,972 --> 00:58:48,237
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an advantage of being able to see them side by side, but I know you have to get your magnifying glasses out.

479
00:58:49,538 --> 00:58:51,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also read it out here.

480
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was the map as of.

481
00:58:55,344 --> 00:58:56,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Just how it's showing up for us, it's a little small.

482
00:58:56,985 --> 00:58:58,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you maybe zoom in a little bit?

483
00:58:59,107 --> 00:59:01,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if it will behave itself.

484
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:03,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, excellent.

485
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's pull this over.

486
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:07,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, great.

487
00:59:08,221 --> 00:59:11,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I can zoom in even more once I do the overview.

488
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:14,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

489
00:59:14,567 --> 00:59:16,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

490
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:20,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where we ended up, I believe the end of April last year.

491
00:59:20,313 --> 00:59:21,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it doesn't want to let me slide down.

492
00:59:22,795 --> 00:59:26,076
[SPEAKER_03]: The end of April last year, these were the boundaries.

493
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:34,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the background, that was the then proposed urban residential and neighborhood residential districts.

494
00:59:35,177 --> 00:59:38,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see in the map, we have taken those out because those are no longer on the table.

495
00:59:39,038 --> 00:59:47,179
[SPEAKER_03]: We also are going to recommend a boundary modification immediately because those neighborhood districts are no longer on the table.

496
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:51,500
[SPEAKER_03]: We are just talking about Medford Square mixed use districts.

497
00:59:52,260 --> 01:00:08,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So mixed-use one, which is this light blue, you can see it to the south of High Street along the river there, that is proposed as four stories by right, and one using the incentive zoning.

498
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:20,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Casting the mind back for those people who were involved last year, the incentive zoning meant that you had to provide a public benefit at a certain level in order to receive that bonus height.

499
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:26,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could have five stories there if somebody met those requirements for the public benefit.

500
01:00:27,745 --> 01:00:36,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixed-use 2A, so part of the conversation last year was splitting up the mixed-use 2 into a 2A and a 2B.

501
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:41,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That allowed us to be a little bit more targeted in the conversations around height.

502
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:52,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And the proposed at this time, the information that came together was a five stories by right for 2A with two incentive zoning.

503
01:00:52,657 --> 01:01:00,559
[SPEAKER_03]: and the seven stories by right for mixed-use 2B with a two-story incentive zoning.

504
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:06,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 2A is a darker blue and the 2B is a lighter purple.

505
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:10,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Then over here as you get close to 93,

506
01:01:13,243 --> 01:01:14,124
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't want to do that.

507
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:18,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The slider is right next to the down arrow and it just does not like that at all.

508
01:01:20,572 --> 01:01:29,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So that bright purple is the mixed use three and that gets us up to eight stories by right with a four story incentive zone.

509
01:01:30,345 --> 01:01:34,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is where we left off in terms of last year.

510
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:38,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I do just want to show that and I'm going to zoom back in again.

511
01:01:39,148 --> 01:01:41,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I do just want to show that we have recommended.

512
01:01:42,009 --> 01:01:48,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a piece up here bounded by Toro Rove and Governors Avenue that was in the proposal.

513
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:53,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It was zoned as one of the residential districts that are no longer part of this discussion.

514
01:01:54,177 --> 01:02:06,870
[SPEAKER_03]: We've removed that from the boundary and then there is a piece over near Ashland Street between Forrest and Ashland that we have also removed from this boundary because it was part of that residential zone discussion.

515
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,375
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see the colors here except for the Mystic Avenue.

516
01:02:11,855 --> 01:02:14,457
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning which of course was passed last year.

517
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:23,265
[SPEAKER_03]: The colors for the residential zones have all reverted back to their current colors just so there's no confusion about what we're talking about.

518
01:02:23,846 --> 01:02:38,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously this recommendation has to go in terms of the boundary change has to go through a city board recommendation to city council but just to let you know that that is an immediate outcome of this change in scope.

519
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:50,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that, I just want to reiterate, obviously, we're here to listen to comments and questions, first from yourselves, and then I'm going to walk back over there, and we'd love to listen to what the public has to say.

520
01:02:51,404 --> 01:03:06,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Mr. President, in accordance with how the two of you are running this meeting, our next steps are working with the working group for logistics, schedule the meetings with the community, schedule the meetings with the Community Development Board and the City Council.

521
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:08,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you very much.

522
01:03:08,843 --> 01:03:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Emily.

523
01:03:10,644 --> 01:03:13,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Really quickly, could you leave the, maybe the proposal slide up?

524
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:15,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

525
01:03:16,327 --> 01:03:18,269
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's all right with you when you make your remarks.

526
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:20,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

527
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,092
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, the recommended or the one for your agenda?

528
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:30,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I think light pole, it seems people are fine with this being, you know, an amendment from the original one.

529
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could do a light zoom.

530
01:03:32,297 --> 01:03:32,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

531
01:03:32,697 --> 01:03:33,598
[SPEAKER_07]: If possible.

532
01:03:33,618 --> 01:03:37,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I will see what I can do to zoom into the space itself.

533
01:03:37,705 --> 01:03:46,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And after we hear from Doug, I do want to talk a little bit and maybe ask a question about what you brought up around this.

534
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:48,394
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.

535
01:03:49,395 --> 01:03:52,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe with the legend in it, I know that kind of takes it back a little bit.

536
01:03:52,397 --> 01:03:54,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know if that will.

537
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:55,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I will cut off.

538
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on.

539
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:56,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.

540
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:57,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's OK.

541
01:03:57,602 --> 01:03:58,663
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the bulk of the square.

542
01:03:59,563 --> 01:03:59,623
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

543
01:03:59,683 --> 01:04:00,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that OK?

544
01:04:00,344 --> 01:04:01,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Good enough?

545
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:01,465
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

546
01:04:01,485 --> 01:04:01,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

547
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:02,426
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

548
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:03,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair Carr.

549
01:04:04,848 --> 01:04:05,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

550
01:04:05,765 --> 01:04:07,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Emily, appreciate it.

551
01:04:07,346 --> 01:04:13,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think that every one of those suggested changes of the boundaries is an improvement.

552
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:15,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really appreciate that.

553
01:04:16,594 --> 01:04:19,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to pack up and just give people a little bit of background.

554
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:21,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm new to this board.

555
01:04:22,878 --> 01:04:25,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone probably knows me, even though I've been in Medford a long time.

556
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:31,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I am currently serving on the Medford Historic Commission for the last 15 years.

557
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:37,440
[SPEAKER_05]: the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust for the last 30, and the Community Preservation Committee for the last nine.

558
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,182
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have long, deep roots in the city, certainly regarding its architecture and history.

559
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:56,268
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also an architect, and I work for Cube 3, a company that's designed to build six large apartment buildings in Medford for the last 20 years, which has added about 1,600 apartments over that time and over 230 affordable units.

560
01:04:57,068 --> 01:04:58,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am pro-development.

561
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:01,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I love history, but I really believe that we need to build

562
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: and Memphis Square is a prime candidate for it.

563
01:05:06,851 --> 01:05:10,693
[SPEAKER_05]: As was alluded to earlier, there have been many plans for Memphis Square.

564
01:05:11,773 --> 01:05:28,999
[SPEAKER_05]: My colleague on the city board, John Anderson, and I served on the Memphis Square Revitalization Committee under Mayor McGlynn 20 years ago, an effort that went absolutely nowhere because we did not have a real planning department at the time, which we now do, and we also have a much better vision.

565
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:31,760
[SPEAKER_05]: The comprehensive plan is an excellent vision

566
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:36,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the city council is completely different than it was at that time as well.

567
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:39,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're heading in the right direction.

568
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the vision that we need.

569
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:47,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And I support the redevelopment of Memphis Square and the zoning.

570
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:52,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a once in a lifetime opportunity to set up Memphis Square for the next 30 years.

571
01:05:52,335 --> 01:06:00,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But as the comprehensive plan talked about, it's really looking to move forward very quickly in the next 10 years to get a lot of activity and a lot of changes made.

572
01:06:02,298 --> 01:06:05,599
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to do it right, and parts of this proposal I think are excellent.

573
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:13,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly the eastern half of Medford Square, the light purple on the far right along Route 93, I completely agree with a lot of that.

574
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:27,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what's proposed there will greatly improve not only Salem Street and Riverside Ave, but unlock the potential of the sea of parking lots behind this building that go all the way down to the Domestic River.

575
01:06:28,255 --> 01:06:30,517
[SPEAKER_05]: which need to be redeveloped and are going to be redeveloped.

576
01:06:30,597 --> 01:06:33,658
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a huge success for the city, and I want to support that.

577
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have some reservations about the boundaries beyond what was proposed.

578
01:06:38,301 --> 01:06:44,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is an improvement because we've taken a lot of sensitive residential areas off the table.

579
01:06:45,146 --> 01:06:46,006
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that is great.

580
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:53,471
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are still, I think, some odd things, some things that are in the boundary and some things that are not in the boundary that I feel should be.

581
01:06:54,313 --> 01:07:00,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the UU Church is not in this boundary and neither is the Memphis Public Library in this boundary.

582
01:07:01,457 --> 01:07:06,220
[SPEAKER_05]: But the buildings, you know, basically along Winthrop Street are kind of lumped in with Memphis Square.

583
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:09,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I think reasonable people can disagree about that.

584
01:07:09,822 --> 01:07:19,368
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's where we need to look at this boundary together and look at every single property that's in it and out of it and make an assessment of that over the next couple of meetings.

585
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:22,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that

586
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:38,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We really need to, even though zoning is not the only tool, it is a tool that can help prevent historic buildings and buildings that are significant but not on the National Register of Historic Places from being risked to be demolished.

587
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:43,192
[SPEAKER_05]: There are buildings, as was noted earlier, that go back three centuries in Medford Square.

588
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:59,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to find a way, a zoning way, in addition to potentially a historic district, in addition to other tools to protect these buildings and make sure that we don't lose something that's critical to the values of the square, to the history of the square.

589
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been talking about

590
01:08:02,597 --> 01:08:19,546
[SPEAKER_05]: There's talk about a historic district, but there's also talk about single building historic districts that would make it a lot easier to pick off these buildings one by one and make sure that they're protected, but also allow them to be expanded and reused over time.

591
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:30,632
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of a institutional zoning area in Medford Square that would cover all churches and religious buildings and all Medford-owned properties,

592
01:08:31,502 --> 01:08:40,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as a great tool that will allow them to be reused and adapted over time, but provide additional protections beyond this map.

593
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:46,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's some great opportunities there to protect the character defining buildings in Memphis Square as much as possible.

594
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:50,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really appreciate the opportunity to meet it together as a group.

595
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:57,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking forward to the dialogue with the city board and the city council going forward over the next weeks and months.

596
01:08:57,754 --> 01:08:59,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And we promise to act as quickly as we can.

597
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my initial comments.

598
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:05,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want me to call on the CD board now one by one?

599
01:09:06,204 --> 01:09:06,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Council first?

600
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:07,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

601
01:09:07,445 --> 01:09:08,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Councilman.

602
01:09:09,506 --> 01:09:10,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Carr.

603
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:27,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if there are comments and questions by members of the Council at this time on the proposal, the presentation by Innis Associates, and then I'll turn it back over to Chair Carr to get questions or comments from the CD board.

604
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:32,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Councillor Lemming.

605
01:09:35,594 --> 01:09:35,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

606
01:09:36,534 --> 01:09:38,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chair.

607
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:41,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Carr's comments are very well taken.

608
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:49,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that I've been looking into and

609
01:09:51,169 --> 01:10:20,349
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to investigate the possibility of poking the Historic District Commission to add either some historic districts around Medford Square or even to individual buildings, since that is a process that we've seen in the past for protecting some of Medford's historic buildings.

610
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,711
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a lengthy process.

611
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:29,294
[SPEAKER_08]: They recently got done with establishing the South Street Historic District.

612
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:38,779
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm planning on reaching out to them to check in on some of their future plans to add in to some of these

613
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:51,417
[SPEAKER_08]: areas, some of the buildings that may not be quite as protected, perhaps adding a district for them.

614
01:10:51,977 --> 01:11:07,803
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of the historic buildings are owned, are on land that's owned by the city, so it would need to be, they would need to be sold off by the city, which would require a vote

615
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:11,025
[SPEAKER_08]: the City Council to do so.

616
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:14,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is some different forms of protection for those.

617
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:24,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But in terms of I would be interested in knowing if there are any particular historic buildings that are on private property could be could be potentially acquired by

618
01:11:26,864 --> 01:11:35,034
[SPEAKER_08]: by developers, so that is something that we could talk about in the future.

619
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:42,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you've done any research on that or have any input on specifics.

620
01:11:44,026 --> 01:11:51,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Through you, Mr. President, there are a couple of different ways of thinking about this.

621
01:11:51,089 --> 01:12:01,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, considering the dimensional standards of the buildings as they are now and how those relate to the existing zoning, would they be better protected?

622
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:09,018
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if the current mixed use 2B or 2A

623
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:12,581
[SPEAKER_03]: is too much for some of those historic buildings.

624
01:12:12,641 --> 01:12:13,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it goes down to 1B.

625
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:26,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It is important to understand the heightened dimensional restrictions in the current zoning may actually be too flexible if you're worried about historic preservation.

626
01:12:26,236 --> 01:12:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So the rezoning may be an opportunity to look at that.

627
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's some form of the institutional

628
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:34,244
[SPEAKER_03]: as Chair Carr has suggested.

629
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:42,150
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also both the development standards and also the incentive zoning as possibilities.

630
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:47,914
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I worked in a community where they had some amazing historic buildings.

631
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:49,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It was down in Connecticut.

632
01:12:49,835 --> 01:13:06,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of their strategies was to reduce or waive certain requirements if the historic building was preserved, so that a developer could come and do something bigger, but as part of that they had to preserve a historic building.

633
01:13:06,714 --> 01:13:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So in part of the conversations, some of those options may be ones that the community wants to discuss.

634
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:23,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd be certainly happy to do some of the research, both on projects that we've worked on and tools that other communities have used, and present those for consideration.

635
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:25,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

636
01:13:25,452 --> 01:13:26,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

637
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:36,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It is definitely an important part of this process to ensure that our history is protected.

638
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:39,583
[SPEAKER_08]: That can spur economic development.

639
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:53,454
[SPEAKER_08]: People tend to like areas that have a number of historic buildings, so these things aren't, you know, economic development, more building is not contradictory there.

640
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:15,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing that I care about the most is being able to personally is being able to build more housing within the area and come up with incentives to add more affordable housing, which I think would be a pretty big component of revitalizing the square as well.

641
01:14:16,492 --> 01:14:21,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the same, I'm sure that others have their own considerations,

642
01:14:22,614 --> 01:14:30,141
[SPEAKER_08]: pet things that they'd like to see in the zoning and so I will stop talking and look forward to hearing from everybody else.

643
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:35,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have council members with more questions at this time?

644
01:14:35,566 --> 01:14:40,030
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could raise your hands on Zoom for those who are on Zoom.

645
01:14:44,538 --> 01:14:47,621
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll just be kind of brief and I appreciate you having this up.

646
01:14:47,681 --> 01:15:02,337
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we talked about pretty extensively around the Mystic Avenue Corridor District is that the north end of Mystic Avenue, the mixed use 1A or 1B that's right here, kind of this light blue just south of the overpass.

647
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:08,662
[SPEAKER_07]: was not always a post-industrial, auto-repair-centric wasteland.

648
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:15,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually a really vibrant and connected part of Medford Square before Route 16 was built.

649
01:15:15,848 --> 01:15:25,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that was what, you know, it's not in the boundaries of the Medford Square District today, but it is kind of

650
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:28,868
[SPEAKER_07]: historic Medford Square, really any way you cut it.

651
01:15:30,168 --> 01:15:46,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we were talking about that extensively in fall of 2024, you know, I really felt that one of the important things to try to do with this zoning was figure out what could the zoning look like there on the north end of Mystic Ave to try to reconnect.

652
01:15:48,760 --> 01:16:05,531
[SPEAKER_07]: That part of Medford Square that was cut off by the highway overpass and I think between both the zoning and the vision there and the mass dot plan that's coming in to fix the nightmare intersections that are there right now.

653
01:16:06,252 --> 01:16:08,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we really have an opportunity to do that.

654
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:17,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do want to say that part of that was, you know, that was the first pass at creating some of the zone frameworks that then informed this Medford Square plan.

655
01:16:18,397 --> 01:16:21,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can kind of see that here with the north end of Mystic Ave.

656
01:16:21,759 --> 01:16:27,402
[SPEAKER_07]: No one can see me, but that, you know, the zone right on the other side of Karatek Bridge from that.

657
01:16:27,862 --> 01:16:33,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And John, I want to get that video at some point of seven-year-old me doing my Karatek Bridge project from the Hervey School.

658
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:52,197
[SPEAKER_07]: that we start in that lower mixed use end, right in the square, even some of those buildings that aren't necessarily on the National Register, or maybe even those that don't necessarily need that single building historic district, still maintaining that connectiveness.

659
01:16:52,757 --> 01:16:54,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the core historic square,

660
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,621
[SPEAKER_07]: staying at relatively low.

661
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:14,997
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that's been amazing to me in this process and others is there have been buildings that are now two or three stories, I can't remember if it's the old Opera House or something, right on the river side of High Street on the left, used to be a four-story building, right?

662
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:15,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was cut down.

663
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:45,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to keep that in the historic core a little bit more, and then as we move out, and that's one of the reasons for me, you know, as we talked about the reasonableness, when you have the seven, eight, nine story condo buildings on the far west side of the square, or the empty parking lots in some of the buildings, you know, currently condemned, former Ebisuya and CVS building and all the apartments in there, that's where you can expand out a little bit more into those heights.

664
01:17:47,052 --> 01:17:54,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I really think given all of the projects that are going on we have such an opportunity here and I appreciated Emily you going through.

665
01:17:54,885 --> 01:18:01,555
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I don't think there was ever and I'm not saying you're saying there was but only there was ever an intent to say let's.

666
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:05,805
[SPEAKER_07]: rezone Grace Church so they can build a nine-story apartment building on it, right?

667
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:11,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was just that the, what are the answers around historic preservation that are within zoning and outside of zoning?

668
01:18:11,347 --> 01:18:25,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can make recommendations around single building or pocket historic districts to protect things like the Isaac Hall House and the building on the, behind the members plus credit union on Bradley Road.

669
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:39,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a really important thing for us to do so that we have those places that serve as engines, both historical memory engines for development and for the growth that will come up around it.

670
01:18:39,782 --> 01:18:51,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at the 150 years of the Library on High Street celebration last year, and they had these old postcards of High Street in maybe 1920 or 1910.

671
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:55,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I mean, it's gorgeous, but one of the things that really struck me

672
01:18:56,745 --> 01:19:09,413
[SPEAKER_07]: is that maybe the signs were different, and there were more grocers and fewer banks, but other than that, you look up High Street towards Winthrop Circle, and it looks basically the same now as it did 100 years ago.

673
01:19:10,053 --> 01:19:22,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in some ways, there's beauty in that, and in some ways, we need to think about how, as a community, we can encourage the kind of growth that we wanna see, because I don't think that the folks, the Thatcher-Magoons and the Samuel Lawrences

674
01:19:23,281 --> 01:19:30,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Benjamin Haynes of the time would say, we expected that High Street would look the same in 2025 as it did in 1925, right?

675
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:48,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do we take these opportunities, really grab onto them, and actually in some ways, like with that connection with the square south of the river, bring back some of the more walkable, thriving residential neighborhoods that used to be

676
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:59,109
[SPEAKER_07]: that river to where it used to be before the car and the highway and the route 16 overpass really kind of cut right through the heart of our city.

677
01:19:59,309 --> 01:20:08,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So just my you know I really think I really appreciate this conversation about how growth and change and history can go hand in hand.

678
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:15,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And in some ways I think we're really celebrating our history by trying to bring back some of the things that we've lost over the last 50 years.

679
01:20:18,488 --> 01:20:20,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we have any other questions or comments from the council.

680
01:20:20,873 --> 01:20:22,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not seeing any hands.

681
01:20:23,077 --> 01:20:23,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Liz does.

682
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:26,965
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll go to Liz, and then we'll turn it over to you guys.

683
01:20:29,098 --> 01:20:29,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

684
01:20:30,278 --> 01:20:45,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say, you know, as someone who wasn't a part of a lot of the conversations previously on the council but attended some of the zoning meetings, I really appreciate how you framed this to kind of see how we got to this point.

685
01:20:45,747 --> 01:20:51,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly think these maps are a lot easier to digest and really are able to

686
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:57,355
[SPEAKER_12]: showcase to people exactly what we're talking about here and how we got to this point that we are.

687
01:20:57,996 --> 01:21:11,809
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really just wanted to commend the work that you've done to get to this point because I think it's really helpful and hopefully everyone online and everyone that's able to view it too gets a better sense of how this really can impact and change and really make some

688
01:21:12,443 --> 01:21:15,406
[SPEAKER_12]: wonderful progress within Medford.

689
01:21:16,086 --> 01:21:27,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And being able to get this more visible to people as we go through the process and making sure they can see these types of maps and get a better understanding of it, I think will be really helpful as well.

690
01:21:27,997 --> 01:21:32,842
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just really wanted to thank you for kind of level setting us on this and putting us to this point as well.

691
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Emily.

692
01:21:38,303 --> 01:21:39,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to say thank you for that.

693
01:21:40,265 --> 01:21:54,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And also to respond to the other comments, we are very excited by the opportunity, you know, the City Council and the Community Development Board members are willing, and it sounds like they are, to take this as a starting point and then use

694
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,562
[SPEAKER_03]: meetings with you all, the community meetings, to really do a deeper dive.

695
01:21:59,142 --> 01:22:08,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We also frequently love using postcards in our work, so maybe we'll do a quick trip to Digital Commonwealth, but if anybody has access to those, that'd be great.

696
01:22:09,067 --> 01:22:14,410
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're really looking forward to delving into these issues, so thank you all for bringing them up, and thank you again for your comments.

697
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

698
01:22:16,361 --> 01:22:21,465
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I think get in touch with Sam Sednick up at the library, the local history room.

699
01:22:22,346 --> 01:22:23,107
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got stuff.

700
01:22:23,447 --> 01:22:24,568
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a lot of stuff.

701
01:22:24,588 --> 01:22:26,390
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got every plan that we haven't implemented.

702
01:22:33,598 --> 01:22:37,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure that all the counselors have commented?

703
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:38,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

704
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:39,122
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

705
01:22:39,243 --> 01:22:46,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to open it up to the Community Development Board for people, any initial questions, comments to Emily and this group.

706
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would like to speak first here?

707
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Dina.

708
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:56,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Dina, why don't you go ahead, Dina.

709
01:22:56,737 --> 01:22:57,378
[SPEAKER_07]: One second, Dina.

710
01:22:57,398 --> 01:22:58,779
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to unmute you.

711
01:22:59,139 --> 01:23:00,961
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to run the system up here.

712
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:02,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, great.

713
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:02,690
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

714
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:12,374
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate the redesign of the recommendation to remove those other areas of residential from it, because I was going to comment on that.

715
01:23:13,014 --> 01:23:17,816
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things I don't see, and I don't know if it's part of the proposal, but I'm going to talk about parking.

716
01:23:18,316 --> 01:23:18,636
[SPEAKER_24]: I am.

717
01:23:19,436 --> 01:23:20,897
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was interesting.

718
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:27,999
[SPEAKER_24]: My father, who's 86 years old, one of the places that he loves, he loves the senior center.

719
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:29,800
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a very vibrant place.

720
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:35,886
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think you mentioned it as an anchor, one of the anchors that we have here in the city.

721
01:23:36,847 --> 01:23:38,409
[SPEAKER_24]: And I showed him the map.

722
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:39,690
[SPEAKER_24]: It's public information.

723
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,293
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said, Dad, where is that senior center?

724
01:23:42,313 --> 01:23:43,334
[SPEAKER_24]: And he pointed it out.

725
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:44,515
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said,

726
01:23:45,836 --> 01:23:47,737
[SPEAKER_24]: And he says, is there going to be a building there?

727
01:23:47,777 --> 01:23:49,838
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said, well, it is zoned for that.

728
01:23:50,778 --> 01:23:53,059
[SPEAKER_24]: And he said, where am I going to park?

729
01:23:53,859 --> 01:23:55,580
[SPEAKER_24]: So what I did is a little research.

730
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,182
[SPEAKER_24]: And I called Pam Kelly, who's the senior advisor at the senior center.

731
01:24:01,042 --> 01:24:02,683
[SPEAKER_24]: And it is quite a vibrant place.

732
01:24:03,643 --> 01:24:05,924
[SPEAKER_24]: On a typical Tuesday and a Thursday, there were over 250 people.

733
01:24:07,845 --> 01:24:08,485
[SPEAKER_24]: that go there.

734
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:16,009
[SPEAKER_24]: They have core balance classes, they have lunches, they have blood pressure checks.

735
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:17,850
[SPEAKER_24]: My father loves it.

736
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:19,111
[SPEAKER_24]: My mother loved it.

737
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:21,072
[SPEAKER_24]: My mother passed away this year, but she loved it too.

738
01:24:21,132 --> 01:24:23,153
[SPEAKER_24]: She went and attended the shine programs there.

739
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:28,910
[SPEAKER_24]: And right now, I asked her, I said, well, how many are Method residents?

740
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,071
[SPEAKER_24]: And do you know what?

741
01:24:30,471 --> 01:24:34,433
[SPEAKER_24]: They track them when they come in, if you're a Method resident or not.

742
01:24:34,453 --> 01:24:38,515
[SPEAKER_24]: Eighty percent of our seniors use that site.

743
01:24:39,316 --> 01:24:47,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, in other cities and towns, they converted old schools in the senior center, but that ship has sailed, right?

744
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,521
[SPEAKER_24]: So now we have this vibrant place.

745
01:24:51,025 --> 01:25:01,088
[SPEAKER_24]: So we need to discuss parking for the seniors, because right now there's only five spaces in the front, and there's only about 18 spaces around the fence.

746
01:25:02,308 --> 01:25:11,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Now seniors can purchase a $25 ticket to park in the middle, but they still have to walk across the street to go to this wonderful place, the treasure that we have in Medford.

747
01:25:12,211 --> 01:25:16,993
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to talk about parking and the provisions that are needed, not only for that section,

748
01:25:17,953 --> 01:25:22,557
[SPEAKER_24]: but for some of the mixed use as well because it includes residential units as well.

749
01:25:22,597 --> 01:25:23,978
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think we need to touch parking.

750
01:25:24,839 --> 01:25:31,404
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing I want to discuss is the setback allowances from each of those very high areas into the residential.

751
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:41,372
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to make sure that there's proper shading studies done to not interfere with somebody who has a nice porch, right, on the back.

752
01:25:42,413 --> 01:25:44,295
[SPEAKER_24]: And so, yes, certainly parking.

753
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:45,936
[SPEAKER_24]: And the other thing I wanted to mention

754
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,063
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember when they put that ring road in.

755
01:25:50,163 --> 01:25:58,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we should discuss changing in the parking direction, too, of the city to bring back some of the vibrant life that was once there.

756
01:25:59,092 --> 01:26:01,354
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember going to Memphis Square when I was a little girl.

757
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:05,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Woolworths, Grant's, Gilchrist, movie theater.

758
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:07,100
[SPEAKER_24]: It was a beautiful place.

759
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,301
[SPEAKER_24]: We used to laugh at some of them.

760
01:26:09,387 --> 01:26:12,368
[SPEAKER_24]: because we had such a beautiful square to go to.

761
01:26:13,108 --> 01:26:16,629
[SPEAKER_24]: And once that ring road went in, the businesses left.

762
01:26:16,989 --> 01:26:18,330
[SPEAKER_24]: So how do we get businesses back?

763
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:20,750
[SPEAKER_24]: How do we change the traffic parking?

764
01:26:21,371 --> 01:26:25,512
[SPEAKER_24]: And how do we make sure and maintain the vibrant spot for our senior citizens?

765
01:26:26,332 --> 01:26:26,652
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

766
01:26:26,672 --> 01:26:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any comments?

767
01:26:35,355 --> 01:26:35,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you do.

768
01:26:53,224 --> 01:26:59,207
[SPEAKER_22]: I wonder if the idea of more historic districts certainly has promise.

769
01:27:00,088 --> 01:27:02,590
[SPEAKER_22]: I wonder if there are other things we could look at too as well.

770
01:27:04,271 --> 01:27:11,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Going back to the thing Doug mentioned, we proposed a design review process some 20 years ago.

771
01:27:12,182 --> 01:27:13,183
[SPEAKER_22]: which got nowhere.

772
01:27:14,383 --> 01:27:26,450
[SPEAKER_22]: We did a big presentation to the city council and afterwards, one of the leading citizens of the community approached me and I thought, this is great, maybe he's gonna support this.

773
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:28,111
[SPEAKER_22]: And he had only one question for me.

774
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:31,553
[SPEAKER_22]: He said, John, how long have you lived in Medford?

775
01:27:35,575 --> 01:27:40,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so design review would be one possibility.

776
01:27:41,672 --> 01:27:56,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Another thing would be to use the existing site plan review process and apply that to historic... Well, it pretty much applies to just about anything you would be doing in the square right now, wouldn't it?

777
01:27:56,886 --> 01:28:04,773
[SPEAKER_22]: We would just have to make sure that site plan review explicitly covered historic preservation.

778
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:06,755
[SPEAKER_22]: It currently covers...

779
01:28:09,563 --> 01:28:20,068
[SPEAKER_22]: It's sort of vague terminology that it has to blend with the community, blend with the neighborhood, but that could be made a little more explicit.

780
01:28:20,109 --> 01:28:23,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are two possibilities that I think we should take a look at.

781
01:28:26,192 --> 01:28:28,233
[SPEAKER_22]: I also want to comment on parking.

782
01:28:31,214 --> 01:28:36,317
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of the parking requirements depend on what kind of businesses you're going to have there.

783
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:55,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that anyone is proposing a big box store, but a big box store has vastly different parking requirements than small, an equally number of square feet devoted to small shops, coffee houses, that sort of thing.

784
01:28:57,486 --> 01:29:05,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any way that we should, should we be thinking about in the zoning, specifying what kinds of businesses

785
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:13,080
[SPEAKER_22]: we want to allow in these sites.

786
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:17,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Specifying businesses, design review, site plan review.

787
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:25,127
[SPEAKER_03]: To both the chairs it would be easier to answer these in clumps otherwise I'm going to forget what they said.

788
01:29:25,147 --> 01:29:26,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay great.

789
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:26,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

790
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to work my way backwards if you don't mind.

791
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a table of uses in your current zoning and you can see the parking recommendation next to the specific uses.

792
01:29:40,076 --> 01:29:45,123
[SPEAKER_03]: In the proposed zoning for this, there's also a list of uses.

793
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:55,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I focused on the pictures rather than get into the text tonight because we're restarting this process, but there is a current draft that has uses.

794
01:29:55,817 --> 01:30:04,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be excited to hear as part of this process if those are still the right uses, if there are some that should be removed, some that are missing.

795
01:30:04,682 --> 01:30:05,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really important.

796
01:30:06,503 --> 01:30:11,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not touch the parking standards as part of any of this process.

797
01:30:11,586 --> 01:30:18,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So the parking standards that you see in the table of uses apply to those uses throughout the city.

798
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are ways of thinking about a mixed-use building and how to address parking for a mixed-use building.

799
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:31,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I am 100% positive that that topic is going to come up several times through this process.

800
01:30:31,998 --> 01:30:36,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to acknowledge that we've heard you tonight and it is part of a larger discussion.

801
01:30:38,363 --> 01:30:40,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Design review, it becomes an interesting point.

802
01:30:40,744 --> 01:30:44,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, most of these would be subject to site plan review.

803
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:48,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them, in fact, might also be subject to a special permit.

804
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So, again, very quickly, when we think of the levels of approval, there is by right that requires only a building permit.

805
01:30:56,432 --> 01:31:00,633
[SPEAKER_03]: There is site plan review that is building permit plus the site plan review.

806
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:03,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Site plan review is case law.

807
01:31:03,814 --> 01:31:10,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not currently enabled by state legislation, but case law is determined that site plan review is allowed for a certain

808
01:31:11,436 --> 01:31:22,698
[SPEAKER_03]: specific criteria, and what we usually do is in the development standards, we build them on the site plan review case law, so that site plan review can be done according to that.

809
01:31:24,139 --> 01:31:29,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Some design components can come into that site plan review process, and we're certainly happy to talk about those.

810
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And then special permit, of course, is the highest level.

811
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It requires a public hearing.

812
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:35,681
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be some sort of

813
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of higher standard or higher public benefit coming out of a special permit just to sort of hit the high levels of those.

814
01:31:42,843 --> 01:31:45,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're certainly happy to look into those.

815
01:31:46,344 --> 01:31:50,225
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the senior center I love the entry to the senior center.

816
01:31:50,245 --> 01:31:52,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a peaceful way to get in.

817
01:31:52,865 --> 01:31:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You may the people in this room may know that the parking lots across from the senior center are city owned parking lots.

818
01:31:59,787 --> 01:32:01,848
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole process around that that is

819
01:32:02,748 --> 01:32:15,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be touched by the zoning in terms of zoning for something, but because those city parking lots are city owned, it means that the city has an additional level of control over what could happen to them.

820
01:32:15,753 --> 01:32:20,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, parking for the senior center could be part of that discussion.

821
01:32:21,155 --> 01:32:27,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put on a different hat for a second and say that we, our firm, did assist the city in preparing the RFP for those.

822
01:32:28,558 --> 01:32:32,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year I believe all that information is probably on the city website.

823
01:32:32,502 --> 01:32:35,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But that particular process falls outside the zoning.

824
01:32:36,066 --> 01:32:45,415
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that unfortunately falls outside just to add that the senior center parking is being discussed as part of the transom bid for the city lots.

825
01:32:47,910 --> 01:33:02,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't wanna give a number, but parking is a big piece of that conversation and how to make sure that when parking is constructed, the senior center has access to that parking and seniors will be able to get from that parking to the senior center is a core piece of that.

826
01:33:03,259 --> 01:33:04,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And Alicia could talk more about that.

827
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:13,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of that, as Emily said, is outside of the zoning, other than making sure that the zoning lets those buildings, buildings of that size be built there.

828
01:33:14,753 --> 01:33:15,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

829
01:33:15,793 --> 01:33:17,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping that you would take that one on.

830
01:33:18,655 --> 01:33:20,656
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is, unfortunately, traffic patterns.

831
01:33:20,736 --> 01:33:25,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely hear you on the traffic patterns, but this process can't address those.

832
01:33:26,478 --> 01:33:37,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, what we do in a process like this is when we hear things, whether from yourselves or the public, that don't have anything to do with the current scope, we do note them.

833
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:42,305
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't let that information be lost so that we can pass that on and say, okay,

834
01:33:43,565 --> 01:33:49,070
[SPEAKER_03]: the community meetings or at the community development board hearing, we heard these things.

835
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:51,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't address them under our current scope.

836
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:56,396
[SPEAKER_03]: But you all should know that these things would be brought up, and I would put that in that category.

837
01:33:56,456 --> 01:34:02,661
[SPEAKER_03]: That that's something that is not part of what we do, but it is nevertheless important information and an important concern.

838
01:34:04,082 --> 01:34:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I touched on everything in those two blocks.

839
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the setbacks, oh yes, thank you.

840
01:34:14,532 --> 01:34:33,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't show it today because I already had a lot of slides, but we did actually do what are called section cuts to the buildings, so we're looking at the buildings in elevation, and we did shadow studies in selected parts, and in fact, if it allows me to do this.

841
01:34:33,566 --> 01:34:35,027
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see these red lines.

842
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:41,730
[SPEAKER_03]: You might not be able to see them so I'll just go over with my mouse on some of the red lines for the proposed zoning from last year.

843
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:47,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the site and section cuts that we showed so we could do shadow studies.

844
01:34:47,773 --> 01:34:52,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I am certain that we will be bringing those back again for discussion during this process.

845
01:34:56,804 --> 01:34:57,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

846
01:34:57,924 --> 01:35:02,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys are going to meet and run the CD work through all the, there's so many materials.

847
01:35:02,926 --> 01:35:03,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

848
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we are looking forward to that.

849
01:35:05,488 --> 01:35:07,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering what those dash lines were for a little bit.

850
01:35:07,428 --> 01:35:21,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, those are the, yeah.

851
01:35:21,234 --> 01:35:22,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Paige Boldini, do you have some questions?

852
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:24,035
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we doing?

853
01:35:25,441 --> 01:35:27,422
[SPEAKER_07]: and then enable, yeah.

854
01:35:28,342 --> 01:35:28,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Paige.

855
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:30,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

856
01:35:30,443 --> 01:35:34,444
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so exciting to see everything that you've done, and especially starting this up.

857
01:35:34,584 --> 01:35:38,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you to the city councilors, to the board, and everybody who's here and watching.

858
01:35:39,086 --> 01:35:43,487
[SPEAKER_16]: A few things that my colleagues have already talked about, but I think it would be interesting to know.

859
01:35:44,147 --> 01:35:51,350
[SPEAKER_16]: May I just ask, just for protocol, the discussions that were had with that subgroup, is that something that we can discuss?

860
01:35:52,516 --> 01:35:56,139
[SPEAKER_16]: because I think some of it's important is that I don't know the protocol.

861
01:35:58,982 --> 01:36:00,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, which subgroup?

862
01:36:00,743 --> 01:36:04,407
[SPEAKER_16]: The one that was discussing amongst the city councilors.

863
01:36:05,147 --> 01:36:07,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the planning group, yeah.

864
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:10,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, definitely it's going to be talked about.

865
01:36:10,112 --> 01:36:10,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

866
01:36:10,912 --> 01:36:11,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

867
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:13,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, perfect.

868
01:36:14,221 --> 01:36:28,999
[SPEAKER_16]: So one thing that I think and my fellow board member Began had mentioned is this is incredible and it's awesome how we have already the zones, but is it possible to create districts within each area in the square?

869
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:32,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that it's already created because even look

870
01:36:33,524 --> 01:36:51,495
[SPEAKER_16]: even looking at the RFP that Transom has and learning about when we saw that map change in the amendments for all of the parcels around City Hall, I think it'd be really helpful looking at the historic opportunity too, if we could create even those districts, that would be helpful.

871
01:36:51,676 --> 01:36:57,719
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I think that could also help out when we discuss parking, I think into also,

872
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:03,483
[SPEAKER_16]: agree with the Councilor Lemming, I think affordable housing is very important.

873
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:07,526
[SPEAKER_16]: And the opportunity to have people living in Medford Square is very important.

874
01:37:08,487 --> 01:37:16,573
[SPEAKER_16]: But as a business owner and a member of the Chamber of Commerce, I just wanna make sure that we also respect the businesses that have set their roots down.

875
01:37:16,973 --> 01:37:22,378
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wanna make sure if we do have housing above as we want and we're gonna incentivize it, which is great.

876
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:25,440
[SPEAKER_16]: We're also mindful of what that looks like for the commercial base.

877
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:31,823
[SPEAKER_16]: We saw this on Salem Street most recently with the new zoning, that it was a full commercial lot.

878
01:37:33,163 --> 01:37:41,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Granted, it's different zoning, but the commercial space went from three units to 575 square feet with units above for housing.

879
01:37:43,568 --> 01:37:50,149
[SPEAKER_16]: And with the incentivized housing for affordability, which is great, it did then not allow any commercial parking.

880
01:37:50,809 --> 01:37:58,271
[SPEAKER_16]: So and then looking at Salem Street and looking at how different the density there is, I think it's important to just be mindful of that.

881
01:37:58,711 --> 01:38:00,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess that's a lot of questions.

882
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:06,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And then one last thing, I do appreciate, Councilor Lumming, what you said about the almost historic tourism thought.

883
01:38:07,252 --> 01:38:09,733
[SPEAKER_16]: I think any way that we can bring people into Medford,

884
01:38:10,433 --> 01:38:15,917
[SPEAKER_16]: The 250th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Lexington infused some of those communities.

885
01:38:16,398 --> 01:38:28,967
[SPEAKER_16]: So to think if we could create a historic district overlay or something that we can then use that to bring other people into Medford to live and to spend money and to patronize our businesses would be really great.

886
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:30,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

887
01:38:42,062 --> 01:38:43,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

888
01:38:44,343 --> 01:38:50,985
[SPEAKER_03]: All great thoughts, really looking forward to the meeting where we kind of get into this in depth.

889
01:38:51,565 --> 01:38:59,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And the working group is primarily to set up these meetings and understand what content is going to which board when, so we make sure that's coordinated.

890
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:05,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe Councilor Lemming said he was going to record them so that they would be fully available.

891
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:07,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard that correctly.

892
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:15,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, in terms, so the way this is set up, you already have obviously some sub-districts going in there.

893
01:39:15,614 --> 01:39:24,618
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason during the process, again, your role will be to give recommendations back to the city council so those can change.

894
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:31,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's part of what we're learning tonight is that there's a flexibility around that and we're certainly excited about those discussions.

895
01:39:33,922 --> 01:39:38,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Historic districts, like the local historic district, are different from zoning.

896
01:39:39,445 --> 01:39:53,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So doing a historic district which involves a whole series of steps in terms of inventorying and making sure that you've got the right qualifications is not something we do and not something we're scoped to do.

897
01:39:53,531 --> 01:39:58,613
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think in the zoning portions I mentioned earlier that there are ways that we can look at

898
01:39:59,473 --> 01:40:07,216
[SPEAKER_03]: how the zoning can help preserve or support the rehabilitation of or the reuse of the buildings.

899
01:40:07,256 --> 01:40:08,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to do that.

900
01:40:08,876 --> 01:40:14,518
[SPEAKER_03]: During this process, you may actually gain as a community the information you need to look at local historic districts.

901
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:22,485
[SPEAKER_03]: local historic districts have a little bit more teeth than National Register historic districts.

902
01:40:22,585 --> 01:40:24,006
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a valuable conversation.

903
01:40:24,406 --> 01:40:26,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that was mentioned in the comp plan.

904
01:40:27,029 --> 01:40:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of businesses, it's interesting because Medford Square doesn't currently allow mixed-use zoning.

905
01:40:33,835 --> 01:40:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we're finding as a best practice is this idea of putting housing above

906
01:40:39,761 --> 01:40:44,645
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial to provide, you know, instant customers, right, to the commercial below.

907
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:46,947
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you say, there has to be a balance.

908
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:50,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, again, that's not how we do that balance.

909
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:58,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether or not what you see here is the right balance or we need to mix it up, I think that's part of the continuing conversations that we're going to have with us.

910
01:40:58,436 --> 01:40:59,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited for it.

911
01:40:59,497 --> 01:41:05,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really glad you brought that up as something that we need to make sure during the conversations we're continuing to pay attention to.

912
01:41:05,602 --> 01:41:06,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

913
01:41:26,442 --> 01:41:26,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

914
01:41:27,844 --> 01:41:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.

915
01:41:30,747 --> 01:41:32,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to in this.

916
01:41:33,009 --> 01:41:39,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I was about to say innocent associates in this land strategy is the new for all your hard work on this.

917
01:41:40,557 --> 01:41:40,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And.

918
01:41:41,858 --> 01:41:42,999
[SPEAKER_02]: your continuing work.

919
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:52,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited to pursue this methodically, and I think we do need to go slower, but I also do want to imbue it with a sense of urgency.

920
01:41:52,047 --> 01:42:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things that Emily pointed out that always weighs heavily on my mind through the several years I've been on this committee is this current zoning is wildly misaligned, both with what we are doing and what we want to be doing, and it allows for situations where the city

921
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:14,770
[SPEAKER_02]: has committed legally to allowing things that perhaps we would not intentionally allow.

922
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:24,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And one example is I think there was a lot of public frustration with, say, a 15-story dorm that is entirely legally allowed under current zoning.

923
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:30,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think we have a sense of urgency as we approach this methodically, systematically, and intentionally.

924
01:42:30,991 --> 01:42:33,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited to do this with this group.

925
01:42:34,295 --> 01:42:38,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious about what the shared vision is for the goals of this meeting.

926
01:42:38,339 --> 01:42:48,369
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of going between these very high level goals, which is what I was imagining, down to the, you know, parameters for individual buildings.

927
01:42:48,849 --> 01:43:01,736
[SPEAKER_02]: which in my mind is something that we should be pursuing later in this process, but I kind of would love to know what our goal is for while we have all these minds in one room able to speak to each other and hear the same information.

928
01:43:01,756 --> 01:43:07,359
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, I have kind of a couple of thoughts to add to that.

929
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:11,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm approaching this with a vision of an activated

930
01:43:13,523 --> 01:43:36,183
[SPEAKER_02]: walkable, vibrant Medford Square, a place that balances the historic nature and our future and evolving needs that has mixed use, that has climate resiliency and both honors the river and is ready for when climate causes changes, that has trees that

931
01:43:37,743 --> 01:43:46,666
[SPEAKER_02]: lower the temperature as well as providing beauty, and creates a sense of community, everything from the senior center to the library to the walks I'm taking with my infant.

932
01:43:48,847 --> 01:43:51,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to come through the many parts of this.

933
01:43:51,448 --> 01:43:58,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not just looking at the heights, we're looking at those table of use regulations, the dimensional requirements, all these aspects.

934
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:02,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my mind, that's not what we're doing today, but I'm really excited to do it later.

935
01:44:04,565 --> 01:44:11,550
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I don't fully understand where we are right now is obviously parking is a major issue.

936
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:15,092
[SPEAKER_02]: We currently have a parking garage that we're not able to use.

937
01:44:15,132 --> 01:44:16,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's private property.

938
01:44:16,052 --> 01:44:17,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It belongs to Atrius.

939
01:44:17,153 --> 01:44:22,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that Alicia has mentioned discussions, and I'm curious where those are.

940
01:44:22,516 --> 01:44:25,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And the transom proposal has also mentioned a parking garage.

941
01:44:25,578 --> 01:44:29,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a second parking garage, or is this combining them?

942
01:44:29,821 --> 01:44:32,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a question I have that I think really can change

943
01:44:33,342 --> 01:44:34,582
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're imagining here.

944
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:37,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the current traffic patterns.

945
01:44:37,643 --> 01:44:40,564
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing we can do about that, but I'll put that on record.

946
01:44:40,584 --> 01:44:47,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting so many people cutting through and that really limits how walkable and vibrant it can be.

947
01:44:49,812 --> 01:44:53,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am really excited to have more people live in Medford Square.

948
01:44:53,654 --> 01:44:54,534
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my neighborhood.

949
01:44:54,554 --> 01:44:56,015
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I live with my family.

950
01:44:56,575 --> 01:45:05,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited to have more housing above these commercial properties to have them more in the neighborhood and help our neighbors stay here and to welcome new ones as well.

951
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:07,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

952
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:08,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

953
01:45:09,282 --> 01:45:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: That was such a good ending, and I realized I forgot one of my notes, which is I know there's been occasional whispers about a possible T extension, and I don't know what we can do with that.

954
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:32,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we can't incorporate that into our zoning, but as we're visioning this, I think methods of transportation do drive a lot of this urban planning, and I just,

955
01:45:32,725 --> 01:45:40,330
[SPEAKER_02]: have that in the back of my mind and if anyone knows more about it than I do, I would love to hear how that may or may not impact anything.

956
01:45:49,861 --> 01:46:01,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, Chair Carr, I think actually most of those questions are maybe directed towards the group, although I registered the parking and I mentioned to say, I forgot to say I also registered the affordable housing.

957
01:46:01,606 --> 01:46:08,489
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have that in the incentive zoning, but there may be reasons to relook at that and see does that need to be changed.

958
01:46:08,669 --> 01:46:10,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I'm going to turn it back to you.

959
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:16,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I think really quickly on the T, the thing that seems near term is high frequency bus transit.

960
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:29,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I have many times drawn a map of where you pull the green line off or where you bring the Medford branch back through down by Magoon.

961
01:46:29,815 --> 01:46:41,841
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I think really and something that the transom project and also the both proposals, we did get a proposal, another proposal, both talked about bus hub being part of that project.

962
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like this is a really good example of,

963
01:46:47,593 --> 01:46:55,256
[SPEAKER_07]: to me, and I think Emily's been really trying to talk about this as well, what is zoning and what isn't, and what can zoning do and what doesn't zoning do?

964
01:46:55,316 --> 01:47:03,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And zoning parking requirements for specific projects, on site parking requirements for a specific project, doesn't fix parking in the square.

965
01:47:04,379 --> 01:47:12,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of our favorite buildings and businesses have no on site parking because we treat parking differently.

966
01:47:12,481 --> 01:47:12,862
[SPEAKER_07]: We have

967
01:47:14,857 --> 01:47:16,479
[SPEAKER_07]: parking hubs, parking garages.

968
01:47:16,819 --> 01:47:19,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally am... And I understand why it's happening.

969
01:47:20,062 --> 01:47:21,824
[SPEAKER_07]: We have that Atrius garage, right?

970
01:47:22,084 --> 01:47:23,245
[SPEAKER_07]: But nobody can use it.

971
01:47:24,066 --> 01:47:29,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is because Atrius doesn't wanna play ball, let's build a second parking garage.

972
01:47:29,451 --> 01:47:32,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think those are just really tough situations.

973
01:47:34,067 --> 01:47:54,211
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really think that, just on that parking question, we know that Medford Square, the parking is distributed inefficiently, but also I think, and I'm pretty sure we did some numerical research on this, most of the time, parking is underutilized.

974
01:47:54,391 --> 01:48:00,332
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of empty parking spaces in the square, and it's like parking isn't in the right places for what people wanna do.

975
01:48:00,872 --> 01:48:03,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could figure out a way to redevelop

976
01:48:03,913 --> 01:48:14,516
[SPEAKER_07]: while maintaining the things we love about it, the parking lot behind Isaac Hall House and Colleen's and what was a lovely restaurant that is now a bank.

977
01:48:16,017 --> 01:48:21,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And then figure out a shared parking arrangement where at night it's residential, but in the day it's for the businesses.

978
01:48:21,899 --> 01:48:25,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And that all is... There's ways that, to me,

979
01:48:26,844 --> 01:48:37,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Setting up an ambitious zoning for the square at large as a way to invite people in who want to think big about projects and are willing to engage in the conversations like the ones.

980
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:47,055
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can't write the zoning to make that happen because we can't write zoning that will make parking better in Medford Square.

981
01:48:47,455 --> 01:48:55,099
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like I think we put the cart before the horse a little bit on those parking questions.

982
01:48:57,233 --> 01:49:00,255
[SPEAKER_07]: On the T, the bus thing is the main one.

983
01:49:00,696 --> 01:49:04,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if, Doug, there were other pieces of what Ari was talking about that you wanted to go at.

984
01:49:04,498 --> 01:49:09,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was, if I may interrupt, I think it was also the shared goals among the two groups.

985
01:49:09,882 --> 01:49:11,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, we agree on that.

986
01:49:11,223 --> 01:49:12,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So where you're ending up.

987
01:49:12,484 --> 01:49:13,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we here?

988
01:49:15,987 --> 01:49:16,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

989
01:49:18,109 --> 01:49:22,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think for the council, I don't want to speak for the whole council.

990
01:49:22,372 --> 01:49:25,074
[SPEAKER_07]: If other councillors want to jump in, actually, I may be seeking Councillor Lemming.

991
01:49:27,348 --> 01:49:38,796
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we left the zoning project in the spring and summer understanding that residential went south real fast, and that we need a lot more time on that.

992
01:49:39,177 --> 01:49:43,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there was a general feeling that this proposal was pretty well on its way.

993
01:49:44,741 --> 01:49:52,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And personally, just as one counselor, the timeline that was outlined of, you know, we were having this setup meeting, we're getting a lot of feedback.

994
01:49:53,027 --> 01:49:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to what you said, Ari, right, like,

995
01:49:56,222 --> 01:50:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: come back with an amended proposal, take more feedback, and then come back with a last thing.

996
01:50:01,323 --> 01:50:12,486
[SPEAKER_07]: That a meeting, a joint meeting like this in February, a joint meeting in March, and I'll come to you, Alicia, was to try to move through the Medford Square stuff was really, that was where I was at.

997
01:50:12,566 --> 01:50:16,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Lemming really quick, because he's the chair planning and permitting, then I'll go to Director Hunt.

998
01:50:16,727 --> 01:50:17,447
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Matt, yeah.

999
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:32,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so one point that I did wanna make is that the transom proposal would contain additional parking very near the senior center.

1000
01:50:32,638 --> 01:50:37,621
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that those lots do need to be rezoned before that can start.

1001
01:50:39,002 --> 01:50:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: If this proposal does go on or proves to take a lot of time, then we could have discussions about

1002
01:50:49,549 --> 01:50:52,993
[SPEAKER_08]: separating that to allow the transom deal to move forward.

1003
01:50:53,033 --> 01:51:00,301
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll be sorting that out and we'll be having a discussion about that in the working group meetings.

1004
01:51:00,362 --> 01:51:04,046
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be that it's not worth it, we just want to have the whole package.

1005
01:51:05,027 --> 01:51:08,691
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of severing different parts of this, so

1006
01:51:10,441 --> 01:51:24,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe under Mass General Law, and again, this is something that we could discuss more internally with the city's legal council, this does have to be passed as one package.

1007
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:33,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Now previously in a meeting last year, this was joined with Medford Square and West Medford Square were joined in one proposal.

1008
01:51:35,099 --> 01:51:49,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And procedurally what happened was in a December meeting, city council withdrew that proposal from the CDB, got rid of it, and then submitted two new proposals, including this one, which were effectively the same thing, to the, to the CD board.

1009
01:51:49,367 --> 01:52:00,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, the content of this is all the same as what was, as what was put forward last year, but procedurally it's a it is a it's a, it's a new proposal.

1010
01:52:02,975 --> 01:52:14,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I also completely agree with CDB member Fishman's call for some urgency on this.

1011
01:52:15,921 --> 01:52:24,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time there's a store or a business that opens up in Medford Square that people don't like,

1012
01:52:27,839 --> 01:52:37,583
[SPEAKER_08]: most recent example of that, people want the city to step in and they say, what are you going to do about it?

1013
01:52:38,303 --> 01:52:39,143
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on here?

1014
01:52:39,844 --> 01:52:41,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you prevent that from happening?

1015
01:52:41,144 --> 01:52:41,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is no.

1016
01:52:42,245 --> 01:52:47,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We could have prevented it from happening with more adequate planning, but I think the fact that on the CD board we have

1017
01:52:48,768 --> 01:53:02,399
[SPEAKER_08]: members talking about how they were on Medford Square planning committees 20 years ago does say something about the fact that there is a lot of backdrop to this process and a lot of

1018
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,961
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of previous plans that really just haven't been implemented.

1019
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:22,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So the plans that we are making right now are all based on a very extensive history, other failed efforts to revitalize and make the square the place where we all want to be.

1020
01:53:23,423 --> 01:53:30,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I do agree that more of these joint sessions will be helpful, ones where we get more into specifics.

1021
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:39,583
[SPEAKER_08]: community meetings which will be scheduled within the working group as well.

1022
01:53:39,603 --> 01:53:41,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Those will be announced later.

1023
01:53:41,685 --> 01:53:48,030
[SPEAKER_08]: But this particular proposal can't be dragging on for months and months and months.

1024
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:51,753
[SPEAKER_08]: So it can't be December and we're still talking about it.

1025
01:53:52,254 --> 01:53:57,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So I very much appreciate the comments that I heard tonight.

1026
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,701
[SPEAKER_08]: very well received.

1027
01:54:01,542 --> 01:54:09,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to continuing this process and I also look forward to the moment that I stop talking and hear from the public.

1028
01:54:09,749 --> 01:54:10,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you so much.

1029
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:12,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1030
01:54:12,132 --> 01:54:12,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Director Hunt.

1031
01:54:14,314 --> 01:54:15,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1032
01:54:15,535 --> 01:54:19,058
[SPEAKER_17]: I kind of actually wanted to a little bit bring this back to the process.

1033
01:54:19,078 --> 01:54:21,200
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if my sound sounds a little weird to me.

1034
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:22,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it okay?

1035
01:54:24,078 --> 01:54:27,380
[SPEAKER_17]: bring it back to the process and make some examples for recommendations.

1036
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:34,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So for example, we heard here about the desire for more parking, parking lots, parking garage in the square.

1037
01:54:35,204 --> 01:54:46,070
[SPEAKER_17]: In the use table as proposed for Medford Square right now, parking garage as an accessory to- Can you adjust the audio level on that manual?

1038
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:48,672
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I was worried about.

1039
01:54:49,492 --> 01:54:50,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not you.

1040
01:54:50,673 --> 01:54:51,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you change the volume on there?

1041
01:54:51,974 --> 01:54:52,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe.

1042
01:54:53,575 --> 01:55:00,478
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right under the speaker too, it's like a really bad location for a microphone.

1043
01:55:00,818 --> 01:55:01,958
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great, yeah.

1044
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:06,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Asked for.

1045
01:55:08,018 --> 01:55:08,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paige.

1046
01:55:09,059 --> 01:55:10,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry about the noise.

1047
01:55:11,041 --> 01:55:24,616
[SPEAKER_17]: So to give you the example of how we're going to bring this back concretely, in the zoning before you, in the use table, number five is parking area or garage accessory to principal use within 500 feet of a conforming principal use.

1048
01:55:25,337 --> 01:55:28,120
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's a no in all four zones.

1049
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I've just heard all of you say or the CD board say they'd like to have that.

1050
01:55:33,385 --> 01:55:39,390
[SPEAKER_17]: So the process is that the CD board would make the recommendation that they would like to see that change to a yes.

1051
01:55:39,951 --> 01:55:41,912
[SPEAKER_17]: They make that recommendation to the city council.

1052
01:55:42,353 --> 01:55:50,801
[SPEAKER_17]: City council may or may not accept that recommendation as they adopt the zoning, the broadness that in general the zoning will get adopted.

1053
01:55:51,841 --> 01:56:05,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Our hope by having these joint meetings is that instead of the city council just seeing a bullet saying change this from an N to a Y, they've now heard the thoughts in the discussion and then they're more likely to say, oh, we understand that.

1054
01:56:05,946 --> 01:56:14,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Or in the course of an evening like this, you might say to them, let's dig into that a little bit more because I don't think so, I disagree, so let's understand it a little bit better.

1055
01:56:14,869 --> 01:56:20,951
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll just flag for you that that five and six the municipal parking area is also listed as a no in most of it.

1056
01:56:22,031 --> 01:56:30,754
[SPEAKER_17]: But what's not here at all as an item is a privately owned parking area or garage that is not accessory to a principal use.

1057
01:56:30,834 --> 01:56:32,395
[SPEAKER_17]: So as its own principal use.

1058
01:56:32,835 --> 01:56:37,757
[SPEAKER_17]: So another recommendation the board it sounds like wants to make is to add that as another use.

1059
01:56:38,437 --> 01:56:40,077
[SPEAKER_17]: and then put that in as a type.

1060
01:56:40,578 --> 01:56:45,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll just, because you mentioned banks, I noticed that banks are a yes all the way across.

1061
01:56:45,859 --> 01:57:03,283
[SPEAKER_17]: You might want to put them in as a special permit because, for example, you don't actually want no banks in the end because some have left and no others are able to move in, but you may want to actually say we want banks by special permit so it's a higher level of review when you do that.

1062
01:57:03,663 --> 01:57:18,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would actually encourage all the members of the boards and the public to read through the full use table and then come up with recommendations so that, assuming that you don't close the public hearing tonight, you might actually just send a list.

1063
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:22,484
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would offer that if you have very specific edits like that,

1064
01:57:23,145 --> 01:57:24,766
[SPEAKER_17]: You send them all to me and Danielle.

1065
01:57:25,207 --> 01:57:39,319
[SPEAKER_17]: We can compile them with Emily and then we can say here are all the ones we've heard back so that you don't each all have to individually say it in a meeting but we can say here's what we've heard from the board so you can all review it at once.

1066
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:47,066
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we have that early enough we could put it back out to the public so at the next meeting they could also reflect on those those thoughts as well.

1067
01:57:47,807 --> 01:57:48,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1068
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:50,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1069
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:51,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Alicia.

1070
01:57:51,310 --> 01:58:06,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think, to Ari, to your question of what are we, where are we going from here, I think there is, generally, like, how are we going to get to a consensus point around the length of this process?

1071
01:58:06,836 --> 01:58:13,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have the agreement between the mayor and the council, right, which says, essentially, this phase is going through May.

1072
01:58:14,298 --> 01:58:19,239
[SPEAKER_07]: and we want to get Medford Square and the Tufts Institutional and Boston Avenue zones done by May.

1073
01:58:19,399 --> 01:58:21,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where the mayor and the council landed.

1074
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:36,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So within that, how can we facilitate some of the priorities like having two iterations on each proposal where we can get some feedback in on them and then have a second iteration and then that can move to a final vote.

1075
01:58:36,383 --> 01:58:39,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I think fitting those kinds of priorities

1076
01:58:39,804 --> 01:58:52,023
[SPEAKER_07]: feedback and engagement making sure there's the community meetings like one in February one in March around Medford Square within that overall framework is important and and I think right like for me something

1077
01:58:53,437 --> 01:58:56,419
[SPEAKER_07]: and you were here, Ari, and maybe some of us weren't.

1078
01:58:56,859 --> 01:59:09,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if we start chopping and splitting and cutting and layering, we're talking about the eastern third of Medford Square and the western third, but the middle third's in two weeks, and that's how we get into process nightmare land.

1079
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:12,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, for me,

1080
01:59:13,111 --> 01:59:15,533
[SPEAKER_07]: how, like for the transom project, for example, right?

1081
01:59:15,573 --> 01:59:19,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it is part of anchoring this area of our city.

1082
01:59:19,996 --> 01:59:21,977
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we talk about this area of our city?

1083
01:59:22,157 --> 01:59:31,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can talk about the pieces within it, but I think when we start going down the road of chopping and splitting things up, we're gonna end up in a situation where

1084
01:59:32,317 --> 01:59:34,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really easy for people to get confused about what we're talking about.

1085
01:59:35,518 --> 01:59:42,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And also just we have a pretty concrete timeline on this phase of the project based on the contract extension and the funds that are available.

1086
01:59:43,002 --> 01:59:49,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think getting the information out there tonight, at some point we want to hear from the public, which I think is important.

1087
01:59:50,305 --> 01:59:55,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll come back here I think in five or six weeks and you guys will have had some intervening meetings.

1088
01:59:55,987 --> 01:59:56,908
[SPEAKER_07]: We may have had one.

1089
01:59:57,428 --> 02:00:04,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be able to come back together, and ideas like what have been put forward can be incorporated into that round.

1090
02:00:04,392 --> 02:00:04,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug, go ahead.

1091
02:00:05,192 --> 02:00:06,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a quick comment.

1092
02:00:06,212 --> 02:00:15,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what would also help the process, and I think, Emily, you did this tonight, is you brought back a new map that had already pre-addressed some issues, because you knew they were out there.

1093
02:00:16,678 --> 02:00:20,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspect that the way forward here is to have a new map at each meeting, essentially.

1094
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,222
[SPEAKER_05]: for the combined meeting because you're going to hear that feedback and give it.

1095
02:00:24,602 --> 02:00:30,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you see consensus, the maps should evolve with the comments and if there's true consensus here.

1096
02:00:30,626 --> 02:00:34,769
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to recognize Sean Bacon next.

1097
02:00:34,789 --> 02:00:35,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1098
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:36,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to come back.

1099
02:00:36,931 --> 02:00:38,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have some councilors after.

1100
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:38,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Sean.

1101
02:00:39,272 --> 02:00:39,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1102
02:00:40,153 --> 02:00:40,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Emily.

1103
02:00:42,194 --> 02:00:49,259
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to step back for a second and just ask you about the current zoning

1104
02:00:50,153 --> 02:00:51,234
[SPEAKER_14]: regulations in Medford.

1105
02:00:51,314 --> 02:00:54,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of the square is C1, I believe, a vast majority of it.

1106
02:00:56,456 --> 02:01:01,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know under C1 that you could actually build residential up to six stories.

1107
02:01:02,138 --> 02:01:09,821
[SPEAKER_14]: So, which is very much in keeping, I think, expanding residential in the square is much in keeping with the goals of the current plan.

1108
02:01:10,582 --> 02:01:13,623
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that there's no six-story apartment buildings in Medford Square.

1109
02:01:13,843 --> 02:01:18,065
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's because of the dimensional requirements essentially that are currently in place.

1110
02:01:18,751 --> 02:01:31,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So would you agree with me that one of the primary focuses in needing this new zoning is because the dimensional requirements as they currently are make it almost virtually impossible to make any

1111
02:01:32,831 --> 02:01:45,054
[SPEAKER_14]: changes to the buildings in Medford Square, especially in kind of the heart of Medford Square from Salem Street, maybe at City Hall, Salem Street, running through CVS, where the buildings are, they're touching one another.

1112
02:01:45,474 --> 02:01:47,135
[SPEAKER_14]: They take up 100% of their lot.

1113
02:01:47,715 --> 02:01:48,715
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no setbacks.

1114
02:01:50,475 --> 02:01:53,416
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking at the dimensional table that is proposed.

1115
02:01:53,456 --> 02:02:00,878
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we might even have to go more aggressive to actually, if we're talking about buy right, if we're talking about giving owners and builders

1116
02:02:02,069 --> 02:02:13,555
[SPEAKER_14]: a buy right avenue to do something and not have to go to the ZBA for the, you know, they hit three of the requirements but, you know, we have 80% building coverage.

1117
02:02:14,836 --> 02:02:19,358
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the buildings I just mentioned on that avenue, they're 100%, if they're not 100% they're 95% building coverage.

1118
02:02:19,538 --> 02:02:20,238
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're not doing anything

1119
02:02:25,525 --> 02:02:31,068
[SPEAKER_14]: with this table unless they're tearing down their building and building something new maybe to come within zoning.

1120
02:02:31,128 --> 02:02:33,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we might have to get more aggressive.

1121
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:52,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the parking, I don't know if you'd agree with me, Emily, but if we pass a Medford district zoning with the current parking limitations or minimums, one and a half spots per residential, aren't we essentially telling people

1122
02:02:53,265 --> 02:03:00,490
[SPEAKER_14]: building developers, you've got to wait until we get to parking because you have, we know you have no parking in Medford Square, right?

1123
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:16,840
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're going to have to, you can file your permit, get denied on parking and go to ZBA or Community Development Board and hope you get your waiver or permit because you're essentially going to have to ask for a complete waiver of parking, right?

1124
02:03:17,941 --> 02:03:21,543
[SPEAKER_14]: And is that what we're trying, don't we need to address that

1125
02:03:22,283 --> 02:03:23,979
[SPEAKER_14]: when we're doing a district rezoning.

1126
02:03:28,197 --> 02:03:29,457
[SPEAKER_03]: All excellent questions.

1127
02:03:30,318 --> 02:03:36,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I chose height for today's example because I was hoping that we wouldn't get too much into the weeds before we had our conversation together.

1128
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:52,143
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other dimensional standards are equally important and I think again Medford Square is an example of a classic New England city where many, many, many of these buildings were built before zoning was put into place.

1129
02:03:52,923 --> 02:04:05,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is true in almost every community that we've worked with that with one rare exception, the buildings that are on the ground, the buildings that are actually built, could not be built today under the zoning.

1130
02:04:06,431 --> 02:04:09,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, this got so far into the process.

1131
02:04:10,233 --> 02:04:13,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're pulling on some of the things that we were also thinking about.

1132
02:04:14,236 --> 02:04:16,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Delighted to talk further about them.

1133
02:04:16,577 --> 02:04:27,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the parking becomes a real balancing act to consider, because when you start to think about the use of land, and we start to think about what that footprint is, right?

1134
02:04:27,645 --> 02:04:40,274
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a parcel, and you're putting things on the parcel, and the things that you're putting on the parcel are the ground floor of a structure, and that structure can be commercial, residential, a mix of both.

1135
02:04:40,334 --> 02:04:42,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That structure can be a parking garage,

1136
02:04:43,336 --> 02:04:47,021
[SPEAKER_03]: but you're using up that space, right?

1137
02:04:47,061 --> 02:04:53,609
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only a finite amount of ground floor space to use, then you can go up.

1138
02:04:53,709 --> 02:04:55,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are you going to go up?

1139
02:04:55,391 --> 02:04:59,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to tuck the parking on the lower levels because you've got a topographical change?

1140
02:05:00,897 --> 02:05:14,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is true in part of Medford Square, that there's a point at which the topography drops off, and we could understand how to park underneath, and then at street level, you get to see the commercial activity and the housing above.

1141
02:05:14,283 --> 02:05:15,524
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a strategy.

1142
02:05:16,264 --> 02:05:17,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that not going to work?

1143
02:05:17,445 --> 02:05:21,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a part that's flat, and so you have to maybe tuck the parking in the back.

1144
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:27,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's two levels of parking you can't see from the street, because it's lined with commercial and residential.

1145
02:05:27,989 --> 02:05:28,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an option?

1146
02:05:29,290 --> 02:05:29,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1147
02:05:29,891 --> 02:05:32,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these parcels are really shallow.

1148
02:05:32,593 --> 02:05:33,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are they going to do?

1149
02:05:33,754 --> 02:05:39,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, some of our height thoughts were due to the fact that we knew they weren't going to be parking on site.

1150
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:43,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could tell them that they can go up to 15 stories.

1151
02:05:43,823 --> 02:05:46,786
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a practical matter, they can't because they can't park it.

1152
02:05:47,186 --> 02:05:50,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think all of these are going to be conversations.

1153
02:05:51,069 --> 02:05:56,054
[SPEAKER_03]: The balance of how we deal with this are going to be conversations with both of these boards.

1154
02:05:56,454 --> 02:05:58,995
[SPEAKER_03]: and with the public over the next couple of months.

1155
02:05:59,115 --> 02:06:11,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you're really hitting on a lot, collectively, you're hitting on a lot of the issues that were, so starting to be part of the conversation when we finished that first round with Medford Square, so.

1156
02:06:17,764 --> 02:06:18,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean, are you all set?

1157
02:06:18,584 --> 02:06:23,046
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all set, thank you.

1158
02:06:23,467 --> 02:06:23,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Planner Evans.

1159
02:06:26,615 --> 02:06:27,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to come up here.

1160
02:06:28,138 --> 02:06:31,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's just going to pick up all the speaker noise with the microphone in that position.

1161
02:06:32,325 --> 02:06:33,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to be feedback, Kevin.

1162
02:06:40,882 --> 02:06:42,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Daniel Evans, senior planner.

1163
02:06:42,444 --> 02:06:51,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to add to that that I think one of the ways that zoning could help is to make it easier to park off site.

1164
02:06:51,976 --> 02:06:55,981
[SPEAKER_04]: There are provisions for shared parking, but they're really onerous.

1165
02:06:56,782 --> 02:06:57,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think

1166
02:06:57,983 --> 02:07:03,467
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having our sidebar conversation about allowing parking garages to be built.

1167
02:07:04,028 --> 02:07:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there should be some design standards that they're wrapped with some active uses, but otherwise I don't see why we wouldn't want to allow privately owned

1168
02:07:14,435 --> 02:07:24,684
[SPEAKER_04]: parking garages, they could probably build it a lot cheaper than we would, and they could lease out, you know, entire floors to apartment buildings or, you know, other various uses.

1169
02:07:24,704 --> 02:07:27,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have long-term agreements, so there's some form of permanence.

1170
02:07:28,588 --> 02:07:30,369
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe there could be some cost sharing.

1171
02:07:30,429 --> 02:07:30,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1172
02:07:31,686 --> 02:07:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea that all of the parking needs to be on the actual property is how we're never going to get any top of the shop housing that we desperately need in the square.

1173
02:07:42,798 --> 02:07:48,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know how we approve a rezoned metric square without addressing that.

1174
02:07:51,075 --> 02:07:58,679
[SPEAKER_04]: just the concept of parking on site is really what's creating the obstacles.

1175
02:07:58,739 --> 02:08:09,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had people, property owners ask about adding housing on top of their buildings, but yeah, they're like 100% law coverage, maybe an alley in the back.

1176
02:08:09,546 --> 02:08:11,447
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just, it's a non-starter pretty much.

1177
02:08:12,267 --> 02:08:14,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So how can we make it easier for them to do that?

1178
02:08:16,143 --> 02:08:16,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1179
02:08:16,363 --> 02:08:30,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I think, again, we're on, like, the chicken-egg-cart-horse question, which is, like, one of the ways that we get someone to come in and propose, and I agree, like, the off-site and shared parking, that needs to be a piece of it.

1180
02:08:31,549 --> 02:08:34,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Parking minimums, period, need to be a piece of it, right?

1181
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:40,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are we building walkable housing that is not auto-oriented, and you say,

1182
02:08:42,068 --> 02:08:47,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you build this with a zero minimum, you can't get an on-street permit.

1183
02:08:47,913 --> 02:08:56,762
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't, you know, like this is not for people who want to park a car on site or do they want to rent one, but like I also worry that

1184
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:10,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when you say this is the kind of square we want to see, we want a walkable square with buildings of this size, with mixed uses, like one of the reasons we don't have the residential, like Member Beegan is saying, is yes, it says residential or commercial, but there's not a mixed use in the C2.

1185
02:09:10,963 --> 02:09:17,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't have a 5 over 1 under first 6 story residential because there's no mixed use in the current district.

1186
02:09:17,784 --> 02:09:23,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, and I appreciate you bringing up the dimensional question too, right?

1187
02:09:26,879 --> 02:09:33,585
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's like aggressive, not aggressive, like we get into all of these words about like, that become value judgments on it.

1188
02:09:33,645 --> 02:09:43,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it actually sounds like we all agree on the basic principles here, which is we want existing historic buildings or older buildings to be able to expand and build up.

1189
02:09:43,853 --> 02:09:48,818
[SPEAKER_07]: We understand that onsite parking in lots of the parts of the square we love the most is never gonna be an option.

1190
02:09:49,458 --> 02:09:53,559
[SPEAKER_07]: We understand that the building coverages are way more than what our zoning is right now.

1191
02:09:54,359 --> 02:10:13,564
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we want to get to the square that we would like, we need to figure out a way to allow people to build things either with the understanding that people aren't going to be able to park on the site, figure out a way where there is a parking element so that, you know, people who need parking can get it.

1192
02:10:13,624 --> 02:10:17,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think, you know, we get a little over-prescriptive with it, right?

1193
02:10:20,050 --> 02:10:40,920
[SPEAKER_07]: At a certain point, and again, people don't expect this kind of conversation from someone with my politics, but if someone wants to come in here and invest $250 million in doing a block or a section of the square, I think they probably understand pretty well the parking requirements that they're going to need, and if we give them the flexibility to

1194
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:54,693
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, figure out what an offsite shared parking arrangement might look like, I think that's a much better option than saying, well, you just have to put 100 parking spaces in this thing, even if the thing that they're building might not need 100 parking spaces.

1195
02:10:54,873 --> 02:10:58,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's kind of the trap that we're in right now.

1196
02:10:58,456 --> 02:11:05,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, and this is like, I hear what you're saying, Danielle, like, if we rezone it without this, are we really saying to people, you can build anything?

1197
02:11:06,203 --> 02:11:18,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not but if we also if we don't rezone it and we and we I think rezoning it even if we're talking about heights and building types and mixed uses and and incentives.

1198
02:11:21,208 --> 02:11:28,611
[SPEAKER_07]: we're signaling to someone that if you want to come here and have this bigger conversation about redeveloping something, we are open to it.

1199
02:11:28,771 --> 02:11:31,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that's where the cart horse piece comes for me.

1200
02:11:32,953 --> 02:11:34,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want us to wait to have the perfect thing.

1201
02:11:34,734 --> 02:11:42,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I think solving the squares parking with all of the challenges of the private actors involved, like that could be years away.

1202
02:11:42,698 --> 02:11:44,819
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually by saying here's the square we want to build,

1203
02:11:45,694 --> 02:11:56,303
[SPEAKER_07]: it might invite someone in who can help us solve those challenges, who might be able to say, let's bring Atrius, let's bring, maybe they can get to Hamilton and Atrius in a way that we couldn't on transom.

1204
02:11:56,403 --> 02:12:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have a third of the square that we can talk about moving streets, right?

1205
02:12:00,587 --> 02:12:02,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we can talk about reorienting streets.

1206
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:06,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we can talk about doing the things that zoning can't do alone.

1207
02:12:08,253 --> 02:12:13,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a piece of how I view zoning, is that it's an invitation and a signal to kind of,

1208
02:12:14,455 --> 02:12:17,779
[SPEAKER_07]: invite people who want to do big things to come and talk to us about it.

1209
02:12:20,482 --> 02:12:22,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt, is that you?

1210
02:12:24,335 --> 02:12:30,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other thing I'd like to add about, there are a few different camps here.

1211
02:12:30,978 --> 02:12:41,402
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one camp that I feel like in the rezoning process that wants to get everything perfectly right, get the exact correct final product before we can pass it.

1212
02:12:41,422 --> 02:12:47,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's sort of another line of thinking, which is we do need to move this process along.

1213
02:12:50,306 --> 02:12:53,851
[SPEAKER_08]: just to put my cards on the table, I'm in the second group.

1214
02:12:55,233 --> 02:13:06,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford has, I think Medford has, I understand, not everybody's in the second group, so I get it, but no, so Medford has a,

1215
02:13:07,962 --> 02:13:17,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford has had a culture of thinking that our zoning is something that's set in stone and can never, never really be changed.

1216
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:20,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why it hasn't, it hadn't been changed for so long.

1217
02:13:20,612 --> 02:13:24,755
[SPEAKER_08]: But other communities, they make changes to their zoning all the time.

1218
02:13:24,795 --> 02:13:27,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that happens very frequently.

1219
02:13:27,077 --> 02:13:30,820
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of their regular, their regular council meetings.

1220
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:32,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Smaller adjustments are,

1221
02:13:33,842 --> 02:13:36,144
[SPEAKER_08]: a thing that very commonly happens.

1222
02:13:36,204 --> 02:13:47,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And in Medford, the fact that we haven't really changed zoning for so long means that right now it's very out of date and necessitates this sort of overhaul.

1223
02:13:49,695 --> 02:14:02,223
[SPEAKER_08]: which is an extended way of saying that even if we don't get the perfect product, we can still go back to it and make smaller edits later, and those smaller edits won't be such a huge lift later on down the line.

1224
02:14:02,663 --> 02:14:04,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a point that I wanted to make.

1225
02:14:09,548 --> 02:14:10,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1226
02:14:10,828 --> 02:14:11,149
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1227
02:14:11,949 --> 02:14:14,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we cool to open the public hearing at this point?

1228
02:14:16,192 --> 02:14:16,492
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1229
02:14:17,893 --> 02:14:18,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

1230
02:14:20,364 --> 02:14:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we haven't answered Member Goffman's apt questions as in detail as maybe we would have wanted to, but we have some meetings in the next couple of months.

1231
02:14:31,791 --> 02:14:36,094
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to get to a yes on something that works, or at least the first pass at it.

1232
02:14:37,615 --> 02:14:40,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think something that Doug just whispered to me is important too, right?

1233
02:14:40,576 --> 02:14:44,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, and I think it's what Matt was saying, you know,

1234
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,261
[SPEAKER_07]: We take a pass at it.

1235
02:14:47,581 --> 02:14:48,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We put something out there.

1236
02:14:48,762 --> 02:14:49,963
[SPEAKER_07]: We see what the feedback is.

1237
02:14:50,203 --> 02:15:06,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's, you know, if we have 90% law coverage and they come back and say, people come back and say, well, we can't do anything without 100, then if we can build an active and collaborative process, those are conversations and iterations we can have every few months or once a year, you know, to amend the foundation of what we put out there.

1238
02:15:06,712 --> 02:15:08,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciated that.

1239
02:15:08,253 --> 02:15:10,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to echo that sentiment.

1240
02:15:10,754 --> 02:15:14,557
[SPEAKER_05]: The CD board has already been thinking about things that we want to recommend.

1241
02:15:15,677 --> 02:15:18,118
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've seen our issues with zoning.

1242
02:15:18,138 --> 02:15:22,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, John mentioned design review, I think design guidelines separate from that.

1243
02:15:22,959 --> 02:15:24,679
[SPEAKER_05]: There's obviously a ton of things.

1244
02:15:24,879 --> 02:15:37,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The zoning in this city needs to be a living document that evolves and it's going to be a little bit of one step forward and you kind of test things and we're going to always learn lessons from every project that is proposed.

1245
02:15:38,625 --> 02:15:45,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in the last three months, two months, the city board has approved 500 apartments and two projects within a 10-minute walk of Wellington.

1246
02:15:45,872 --> 02:15:47,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a huge win for the city.

1247
02:15:47,714 --> 02:15:50,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But we grappled with some of these issues as well about, well, how much parking do we want?

1248
02:15:50,817 --> 02:15:59,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really close to the T. You know, we weren't comfortable with having no parking, but we didn't want 1.5 either because we knew it was reasonable.

1249
02:15:59,064 --> 02:16:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think flexibility is a critical part of this.

1250
02:16:03,048 --> 02:16:03,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Doug.

1251
02:16:04,249 --> 02:16:04,630
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1252
02:16:04,910 --> 02:16:06,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to public comment.

1253
02:16:06,551 --> 02:16:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: We will take commenters alternating in person and on Zoom.

1254
02:16:11,796 --> 02:16:14,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Every person will have three minutes to make their comment.

1255
02:16:14,479 --> 02:16:21,926
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be, and I'm just realizing now I probably can't use the timer tool because of how I logged into Zoom, so.

1256
02:16:24,268 --> 02:16:25,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can.

1257
02:16:25,429 --> 02:16:26,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm logged in the same way.

1258
02:16:26,230 --> 02:16:26,690
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pain.

1259
02:16:28,611 --> 02:16:30,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna log out and then log back in.

1260
02:16:30,733 --> 02:16:33,054
[SPEAKER_07]: First person's gonna get three minutes timed on Doug's phone.

1261
02:16:33,114 --> 02:16:35,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug's phone, everyone else should have it in the Zoom window.

1262
02:16:38,058 --> 02:16:39,459
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll start at the podium.

1263
02:16:39,799 --> 02:16:41,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1264
02:16:43,302 --> 02:16:45,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi there, Nick Uleg, 62 Taner Street.

1265
02:16:46,464 --> 02:16:47,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, everyone, for the time.

1266
02:16:49,148 --> 02:16:50,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to get too technical.

1267
02:16:50,589 --> 02:16:53,731
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been a lot of really interesting ideas and suggestions proposed in this meeting.

1268
02:16:53,892 --> 02:16:59,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate the added thoroughness that seems to be built into this process starting in the new year, the new council.

1269
02:17:00,196 --> 02:17:05,160
[SPEAKER_11]: What I wanted to highlight is something that a couple of people have mentioned already, and that's the sense of urgency.

1270
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:14,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So coming from my perspective as someone who lives close to the square, I see this rezoning as something that can really, you know,

1271
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,304
[SPEAKER_11]: catch the momentum of another three projects that are ongoing right now.

1272
02:17:19,364 --> 02:17:20,606
[SPEAKER_11]: So one has been mentioned a few times.

1273
02:17:20,666 --> 02:17:22,348
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big one, the transom development, right?

1274
02:17:22,368 --> 02:17:24,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So that one has been contracted by the city and it has

1275
02:17:26,167 --> 02:17:38,312
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple things that I think are really important to this discussion, one of which is the parking garage, which actually eliminates two parking lots potentially that are city owned, but provides net 187 more parking spaces than we have in the square.

1276
02:17:38,453 --> 02:17:40,994
[SPEAKER_11]: So for people who need to drive there, that's great.

1277
02:17:41,534 --> 02:17:46,416
[SPEAKER_11]: It also provides something that I think is sorely lacking from the center of Medford, which is a grocery store.

1278
02:17:46,476 --> 02:17:50,078
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the idea behind that, which is if you want to talk about an anchor business,

1279
02:17:50,818 --> 02:17:52,219
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not much that you could do better than that.

1280
02:17:52,900 --> 02:18:04,731
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to the added housing, which are basically, as people have already said, like baked-in customers for businesses that are in the square, that is a huge opportunity, not to mention the public art, the landscaping changes, everything else that comes along with that.

1281
02:18:04,931 --> 02:18:10,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Councillor Lemming pointed out, this rezoning is really critical to getting that development underway, right?

1282
02:18:10,917 --> 02:18:15,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So it maybe has been contracted by the city, but you can't start until this rezoning happens.

1283
02:18:16,722 --> 02:18:25,590
[SPEAKER_11]: The other one that was mentioned is the redesign for the intersection of Main and High Street going down across the river.

1284
02:18:26,071 --> 02:18:37,981
[SPEAKER_11]: As someone who cycles through there every day to work, that intersection is maybe not the worst I bike through, but it's extraordinarily bad and very dangerous, and the number of times that I've been hit, almost hit, in that intersection, I can't even count.

1285
02:18:38,682 --> 02:18:44,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at the Mastop proposals for that, or actually the designs for that intersection is very exciting.

1286
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:54,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And that coupled with a third project that hasn't been mentioned tonight, which is a little bit further in the future, which is a connector for the bike path on the south side of the Mystic River, similar to the Clipper Ship connector.

1287
02:18:55,481 --> 02:19:00,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Those two projects, the redesign of that intersection and that bike path, are going to bring so many more people

1288
02:19:01,448 --> 02:19:03,230
[SPEAKER_11]: who don't drive into the square.

1289
02:19:03,851 --> 02:19:07,996
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really have a few things that are all really rowing in the same direction.

1290
02:19:08,696 --> 02:19:12,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to get this rezoning done quickly.

1291
02:19:14,503 --> 02:19:17,286
[SPEAKER_11]: As quickly as is reasonable with the process that we have in front of us.

1292
02:19:18,193 --> 02:19:28,799
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, it's nice to get things perfect, but as other people have pointed out, if you can get part of the way there and then revise as you go, surely that's better than not accomplishing anything.

1293
02:19:28,839 --> 02:19:34,702
[SPEAKER_11]: People talk about a chicken and an egg, and that's a metaphor that I think is misused, because if you want a chicken, you can get an egg.

1294
02:19:35,422 --> 02:19:37,603
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want an egg, you can get a chicken.

1295
02:19:38,164 --> 02:19:39,604
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter which one you get first.

1296
02:19:40,325 --> 02:19:44,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So if someone's offering us an egg, I would say we take it.

1297
02:19:49,119 --> 02:19:51,901
[SPEAKER_07]: That's... I forgot to change the response.

1298
02:19:53,381 --> 02:19:56,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And the winner is, is the name of that timer as well.

1299
02:19:57,864 --> 02:19:59,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, great.

1300
02:19:59,184 --> 02:20:01,005
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to Zoom next.

1301
02:20:01,105 --> 02:20:05,088
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to Ekaterini's iPad on Zoom.

1302
02:20:06,488 --> 02:20:07,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

1303
02:20:07,809 --> 02:20:08,729
[SPEAKER_07]: You have three minutes.

1304
02:20:08,749 --> 02:20:15,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I've asked you to unmute.

1305
02:20:18,243 --> 02:20:22,267
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, my name is Ekaterini, and I live on 11 Ashland Street.

1306
02:20:24,329 --> 02:20:26,050
[SPEAKER_23]: I heard a lot of things this evening.

1307
02:20:26,191 --> 02:20:29,354
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm still confused about the proposed changes in zoning.

1308
02:20:29,894 --> 02:20:34,418
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just going to make a statement of some of my concerns, if that's okay with everyone.

1309
02:20:35,339 --> 02:20:35,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1310
02:20:36,511 --> 02:20:44,539
[SPEAKER_23]: As a resident for 45 years, I've seen many versions of Ephraim Square and attempts to revisit and re-envision it.

1311
02:20:45,239 --> 02:20:53,827
[SPEAKER_23]: With a home on Ashland Street less than 100 yards from Salem Street, we are both part of, but also separate from the square itself.

1312
02:20:54,748 --> 02:21:02,997
[SPEAKER_23]: On one hand, I'm eager to see real and positive changes to the square, but also justifiably concerned about the surrounding community.

1313
02:21:03,378 --> 02:21:13,389
[SPEAKER_23]: The streets of Ashland, Oakland, and Forest, along with the cross streets, are a neighborhood near the square, but not in the square, and that distinction matters greatly.

1314
02:21:14,193 --> 02:21:16,194
[SPEAKER_23]: The zoning map misses this.

1315
02:21:16,915 --> 02:21:20,777
[SPEAKER_23]: It should be seen as a rough draft lacking some context.

1316
02:21:21,437 --> 02:21:27,020
[SPEAKER_23]: One that needs to be updated to both honor the history and uphold the character of our neighborhood.

1317
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:38,927
[SPEAKER_23]: For one, I wish to express that zoning for four or five story buildings immediately abutting historic homes on the historic register would dwarf their character and limit access to light.

1318
02:21:39,565 --> 02:21:43,510
[SPEAKER_23]: as was intended when the neighborhood first began to be developed 200 years ago.

1319
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:59,027
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, times change, but if we are meant to uphold the character of homes that built this city from several centuries ago, then it's important not to hastily provision changes that minimize their importance to Memphis' cultural fabric and history.

1320
02:21:59,828 --> 02:22:07,032
[SPEAKER_23]: I asked her to revisit the boundaries of zoning and actively involve the households which have bought any proposed changes.

1321
02:22:07,632 --> 02:22:13,395
[SPEAKER_23]: As it stands, I cannot support the zoning to permit buildings to tower over ours or our neighbors' homes.

1322
02:22:13,875 --> 02:22:18,997
[SPEAKER_23]: As a real example, when units were added above the former Elizabeth Grady 34

1323
02:22:20,818 --> 02:22:36,842
[SPEAKER_23]: Salem Street, we voiced our support for additional units and they were needed for the community and the trade-off to losing some light for us and our neighbors was meant to be the addition of green space and trees, a promise made but never kept.

1324
02:22:37,222 --> 02:22:46,805
[SPEAKER_23]: This is why a top priority ought to be that the existing green footprint not be subtracted from us but rather added to especially near homes.

1325
02:22:47,565 --> 02:22:54,989
[SPEAKER_23]: Please don't misconstrue this as the classic community complaining which is often managed as part of the planning process.

1326
02:22:55,109 --> 02:22:56,030
[SPEAKER_23]: It's far from it.

1327
02:22:56,410 --> 02:23:06,976
[SPEAKER_23]: We like to be actively engaged and hope that our voices are generally matter rather than just a function as a check in box for a community engagement process.

1328
02:23:07,717 --> 02:23:09,237
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for the opportunity.

1329
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:14,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1330
02:23:16,351 --> 02:23:18,452
[SPEAKER_07]: We will go back to the podium.

1331
02:23:18,992 --> 02:23:21,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1332
02:23:22,634 --> 02:23:24,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

1333
02:23:25,256 --> 02:23:31,799
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll start with just some technical observations and suggestions, and then I'll just give a comment about approach.

1334
02:23:32,499 --> 02:23:43,745
[SPEAKER_19]: So starting with the technical, first, with the table of uses, I noticed with the uses for mixed use, I see blank spaces in the column with the parking.

1335
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:52,907
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm wondering, I'd just like some clarification, if the current proposal is proposing no parking minimum, or that just hasn't been decided yet.

1336
02:23:55,569 --> 02:24:02,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, I was going to make a comment about that residential portion that was included within the boundary.

1337
02:24:02,314 --> 02:24:04,235
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm happy to hear that that was removed.

1338
02:24:04,295 --> 02:24:12,642
[SPEAKER_19]: I was gonna suggest exactly that, cuz I don't think it fits with kind of the purpose of this district, which is mostly focused on mixed use and commercial.

1339
02:24:12,722 --> 02:24:13,623
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was glad to see that.

1340
02:24:14,323 --> 02:24:14,784
[SPEAKER_19]: go out.

1341
02:24:15,646 --> 02:24:20,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lemming suggested looking to historic district feasibility for the square.

1342
02:24:20,634 --> 02:24:22,758
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that's a little bit outside of the scope of zoning.

1343
02:24:22,978 --> 02:24:24,040
[SPEAKER_19]: I do think that's a good idea.

1344
02:24:24,521 --> 02:24:27,647
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like zoning that takes into account the historic character.

1345
02:24:28,312 --> 02:24:28,933
[SPEAKER_19]: of Medford Square.

1346
02:24:28,953 --> 02:24:30,835
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Chair Carr also mentioned history.

1347
02:24:30,875 --> 02:24:40,748
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's important that any new developments try to integrate the history of Medford Square as much as possible and also take into account just that history is a drawer to Medford Square.

1348
02:24:41,089 --> 02:24:43,311
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think there's value in looking at that as well.

1349
02:24:46,193 --> 02:24:50,695
[SPEAKER_19]: Another thing in the table of uses, there was a neighborhood medical office included.

1350
02:24:50,715 --> 02:24:55,137
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe in all the sub-districts that's allowed as of right.

1351
02:24:55,697 --> 02:25:02,681
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thinking to the great controversy that arose with the Salem Street Corridor regarding that definition, which I personally find to be quite vague.

1352
02:25:03,041 --> 02:25:08,143
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd suggest making that discretionary and adding a special permit requirement in all of the sub-districts.

1353
02:25:10,592 --> 02:25:19,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there's also mention by Chair Carr of the church being in the district as well, or sorry, one of the churches not being in, I believe St.

1354
02:25:19,416 --> 02:25:23,257
[SPEAKER_19]: Joe's is in the district, as well as the library being out of it.

1355
02:25:24,197 --> 02:25:30,180
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would consider too, you know, the impact that, you know, maybe rising development incentives

1356
02:25:30,915 --> 02:25:43,907
[SPEAKER_19]: might have on our religious community in the square, you know, to the extent that this might motivate them to sell and leave, and obviously would detract significantly from Medford's character, which in a large part has been based on its various religious communities.

1357
02:25:44,848 --> 02:25:52,475
[SPEAKER_19]: And then my general comment here, kind of on approach, I do understand obviously that the transom project was approved.

1358
02:25:53,653 --> 02:25:54,654
[SPEAKER_19]: The bid was accepted.

1359
02:25:54,674 --> 02:26:04,957
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just encourage both bodies here not to develop zoning that really is just trying to get that developer's project through easily.

1360
02:26:05,277 --> 02:26:10,039
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, in other words, writing the zoning for the developer as opposed to what the community as a whole wants.

1361
02:26:10,519 --> 02:26:18,261
[SPEAKER_19]: So I personally don't understand why we accepted the bid before we settled the zoning question, but the fact of the matter is it has been accepted.

1362
02:26:18,802 --> 02:26:22,243
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know a goal here is to try to tailor zoning to make that project

1363
02:26:25,345 --> 02:26:30,107
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would just encourage both bodies here to just try to think of the broader purpose here.

1364
02:26:30,568 --> 02:26:30,928
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1365
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:35,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your comment.

1366
02:26:36,091 --> 02:26:37,992
[SPEAKER_07]: We will go to Zoom.

1367
02:26:38,172 --> 02:26:39,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy Martin on Zoom.

1368
02:26:39,653 --> 02:26:43,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy, I'm going to ask you to unmute and you can provide your name and address and you'll have three minutes.

1369
02:26:45,055 --> 02:26:45,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Mr. President.

1370
02:26:46,356 --> 02:26:49,658
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jeremy Martin, 65 Burgett Avenue.

1371
02:26:49,678 --> 02:26:53,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd turn on my camera, but that doesn't seem to be allowed.

1372
02:26:54,041 --> 02:27:04,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the city's leadership for reaching an agreement to restart this process, and also the staff for facilitating this meeting and posting the meeting materials early.

1373
02:27:04,348 --> 02:27:10,232
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of the process, I would ask that the baseline for all of the CDB zoning reviews

1374
02:27:11,112 --> 02:27:29,157
[SPEAKER_01]: be that the upcoming meeting materials be shared with the public at the same time as the board, especially if the content is going to evolve between meetings, as was suggested earlier this evening, because it really allows the public to come to the meetings more informed and more prepared with useful feedback instead of just complaints.

1375
02:27:29,977 --> 02:27:36,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I have reviewed the maps that are drafts now in the draft ordinance and generally support what is proposed.

1376
02:27:37,639 --> 02:27:43,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd look for some clarification about the building heights, particularly along high street to the West.

1377
02:27:44,102 --> 02:27:53,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those heights measured from the address side of the building or from the parkway side of the building that does have a drastic difference in the, in the impact of those buildings.

1378
02:27:54,166 --> 02:27:56,827
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of discussion about parking tonight, which is.

1379
02:27:57,907 --> 02:28:14,111
[SPEAKER_01]: both necessary and exhausting, but I hope we can consider really reducing those parking ratio minimums so that we can incentivize development and meet the walkability goals that are really paramount to the purpose section of the ordinance.

1380
02:28:14,811 --> 02:28:25,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And when residential zoning returns, we need to ensure that we're creating enough density around the square and in nearby neighborhoods to bring foot traffic to support the types of businesses we all want to see.

1381
02:28:26,354 --> 02:28:26,934
[SPEAKER_01]: in the square.

1382
02:28:27,794 --> 02:28:34,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I noted that one of the incentive waivers included an additional half story for providing streetscape improvements along a public street.

1383
02:28:35,337 --> 02:28:40,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, this type of improvement should be a baseline requirement of any development in the square.

1384
02:28:40,438 --> 02:28:51,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure the incentive is enough to make sure that it happens, and we should be asking developers to not just think about their building or their immediate site, but all of the impact that they have on the public realm.

1385
02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:58,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really encouraging to see the possibility of the board establishing design guidelines.

1386
02:28:58,182 --> 02:28:59,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that that happens quickly.

1387
02:29:00,563 --> 02:29:06,665
[SPEAKER_01]: These guidelines should be forward-looking and not necessarily beholden to a narrow view of what defines Medford's character.

1388
02:29:07,165 --> 02:29:11,867
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to build an urban realm that embraces the needs of a modern city and its residents.

1389
02:29:12,747 --> 02:29:20,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that the leaders of the city continue to look beyond just zoning and in concert with these updates, see the opportunities.

1390
02:29:20,553 --> 02:29:34,183
[SPEAKER_01]: We could create an incredible park along what is now Clippership Drive instead of a sea of parking and essentially a highway through our square that would encourage developers to develop on both sides of those blocks there.

1391
02:29:34,823 --> 02:29:43,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can advocate for MassDOT to find ways to create a Salem Street bypass so that we don't have a highway on and off ramp through the middle of our square.

1392
02:29:44,107 --> 02:29:52,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take leadership and drive, unwavering, but we need to stick to the vision and look beyond the status quo to get to the real potential of our city.

1393
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:53,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1394
02:29:57,552 --> 02:29:58,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jeremy.

1395
02:30:02,405 --> 02:30:03,726
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll go back to the podium.

1396
02:30:03,746 --> 02:30:06,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1397
02:30:06,889 --> 02:30:08,750
[SPEAKER_10]: John Prusch, 9 Lambert Street.

1398
02:30:09,551 --> 02:30:11,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't Medford Square be better?

1399
02:30:11,613 --> 02:30:13,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't they do something with Medford Square?

1400
02:30:13,554 --> 02:30:16,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I moved here in 2006, and I've been hearing people say that.

1401
02:30:17,398 --> 02:30:20,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Since then, not just new residents, people that grew up here.

1402
02:30:21,081 --> 02:30:27,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am really glad that we are finally really looking at doing this.

1403
02:30:27,646 --> 02:30:28,827
[SPEAKER_10]: And if there is anything,

1404
02:30:30,075 --> 02:30:37,418
[SPEAKER_10]: resembling consensus in this city about where we should be rezoning and where we can accept some new development.

1405
02:30:37,958 --> 02:30:39,038
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Medford Square.

1406
02:30:40,259 --> 02:30:42,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm glad we're moving ahead with that.

1407
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a real desire, I think, for more spaces in this community.

1408
02:30:49,236 --> 02:30:51,097
[SPEAKER_10]: where people can build community.

1409
02:30:51,177 --> 02:30:54,279
[SPEAKER_10]: We've seen a little bit with places like Deep Cuts springing up.

1410
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:56,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need more of that.

1411
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:57,561
[SPEAKER_10]: People would love it.

1412
02:30:57,621 --> 02:30:58,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I live down the street.

1413
02:30:58,721 --> 02:31:00,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love more reasons to walk down there.

1414
02:31:01,743 --> 02:31:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, I love that we are looking at allowing a little more height.

1415
02:31:07,126 --> 02:31:08,447
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the place to do it.

1416
02:31:11,108 --> 02:31:14,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really think that's gonna, you know, especially at a time when

1417
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:16,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Municipal budgets are tight.

1418
02:31:17,623 --> 02:31:19,665
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all coming up against Prop 2 and a half.

1419
02:31:20,566 --> 02:31:30,717
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of increased commercial tax base, the linkage fees, that's going to help take pressure off our residents for some of those rising costs.

1420
02:31:31,118 --> 02:31:34,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And most importantly, we know we need more housing.

1421
02:31:35,857 --> 02:31:44,184
[SPEAKER_10]: I was mentioned at the meeting last night I think how much more the need for assistance has gotten just in the last few years in our city.

1422
02:31:45,465 --> 02:31:48,327
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really glad that we are trying to make an effort.

1423
02:31:48,347 --> 02:31:56,313
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't solve it by ourselves but it seems like a real effort is being made to think about that with the plan that I saw tonight.

1424
02:31:57,934 --> 02:32:02,318
[SPEAKER_10]: The only other thing I want to mention is I know design review was mentioned earlier.

1425
02:32:03,175 --> 02:32:08,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that if we institute some kind of process like that, that the rules are very clear.

1426
02:32:09,523 --> 02:32:22,668
[SPEAKER_10]: and the process for completing it is clear because there are, in a lot of cities that have housing crisis like ours, that process is often used to delay housing indefinitely with subjective, vague rules.

1427
02:32:23,349 --> 02:32:25,029
[SPEAKER_10]: So just something to think about with that.

1428
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:37,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we can do this and keep everything, keep our historical buildings, but let's make sure that that's, you know, no matter who's on that committee, it's something where there is a real deadline.

1429
02:32:37,655 --> 02:32:38,455
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I got, thank you.

1430
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:41,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1431
02:32:42,191 --> 02:32:43,652
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go back to Zoom.

1432
02:32:43,672 --> 02:32:47,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul Geraghty, name and address for the record, please.

1433
02:32:47,336 --> 02:32:48,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll have three minutes.

1434
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:54,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I've requested to unmute you, Paul.

1435
02:32:54,762 --> 02:32:56,083
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be seeing that pop up.

1436
02:32:57,765 --> 02:32:58,225
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1437
02:32:58,365 --> 02:32:58,726
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1438
02:32:58,986 --> 02:32:59,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Paul.

1439
02:33:05,411 --> 02:33:07,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul, we can't hear you if you're speaking.

1440
02:33:12,764 --> 02:33:14,565
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he unmuted, but we can't hear him.

1441
02:33:14,585 --> 02:33:17,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there might be a technology issue maybe on his end.

1442
02:33:24,791 --> 02:33:26,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul, I'm gonna request you to unmute again.

1443
02:33:26,972 --> 02:33:39,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul, feel free to speak.

1444
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:42,861
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't hear you, yeah, okay.

1445
02:33:43,301 --> 02:33:47,943
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll stay at the podium and we'll see if we can get Paul on some other way.

1446
02:33:47,963 --> 02:33:49,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

1447
02:33:49,864 --> 02:33:51,545
[SPEAKER_20]: You have three minutes.

1448
02:33:51,565 --> 02:33:52,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, my name is Zoe Dukoch.

1449
02:33:53,006 --> 02:33:54,987
[SPEAKER_20]: I live at 72 New Bern Avenue.

1450
02:33:56,888 --> 02:34:01,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Heard a lot of discussion tonight about historical preservation.

1451
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:07,473
[SPEAKER_20]: I would just like to really emphasize that just because a building is old does not mean that it is helpful to our community.

1452
02:34:09,674 --> 02:34:23,160
[SPEAKER_20]: One thing that I really appreciated seeing in the zoning was conversation about incentives for having a pleasant facade, a plaza, green space, a fountain, that kind of thing.

1453
02:34:23,740 --> 02:34:27,262
[SPEAKER_20]: And talking about things that are draws to the neighborhood.

1454
02:34:28,002 --> 02:34:34,505
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not just having an old building, it's having a building that is pleasant to be in, that is inviting.

1455
02:34:35,505 --> 02:34:51,212
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that that is so much more important than just was this building built 100, 200 years ago, especially when we are in desperate need of more housing, more new development, and bringing in more commercial space as well.

1456
02:34:53,053 --> 02:35:08,504
[SPEAKER_20]: I've also heard a lot about parking, and if we want to have a vibrant, thriving community, including for seniors, including for everybody in our community, we need to have less space dedicated to parking.

1457
02:35:08,964 --> 02:35:11,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Parking is truly a neighborhood killer.

1458
02:35:11,526 --> 02:35:15,669
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the least useful, least productive way to use our limited space.

1459
02:35:16,650 --> 02:35:19,712
[SPEAKER_20]: I would much rather see taller buildings,

1460
02:35:21,373 --> 02:35:27,475
[SPEAKER_20]: with more housing, more commercial space, mixed use development rather than more parking lots.

1461
02:35:30,256 --> 02:35:42,059
[SPEAKER_20]: And also parking minimums are really detrimental to anyone's ability to come in and redevelop and build more in the current space.

1462
02:35:42,119 --> 02:35:46,700
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm even looking at things like neighborhood retail has a parking minimum and I can't imagine why

1463
02:35:47,660 --> 02:36:00,105
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that I bike, take the bus, take the train to all sorts of retail places all over the various cities and communities in this area.

1464
02:36:01,446 --> 02:36:10,329
[SPEAKER_20]: And if that's the kind of community that we want to see, one that is thriving and growing, adding parking minimums is the perfect way to kill it.

1465
02:36:14,425 --> 02:36:19,266
[SPEAKER_20]: Just as general comments, like I said, I want to see taller buildings.

1466
02:36:19,346 --> 02:36:20,766
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see more buildings.

1467
02:36:20,826 --> 02:36:21,846
[SPEAKER_20]: I want it to be easier.

1468
02:36:21,866 --> 02:36:35,009
[SPEAKER_20]: And even if this zoning process doesn't result in the exact perfect thing that I want to see, I want it to go through fast enough that we can have exciting new developments like the ones bringing in a grocery store.

1469
02:36:36,609 --> 02:36:40,090
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I don't want anyone to get too bogged down in the details.

1470
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:48,855
[SPEAKER_20]: But I just want to really encourage the efforts to create that kind of walkable community that will help Medford thrive into the future.

1471
02:36:49,615 --> 02:36:49,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1472
02:36:50,976 --> 02:36:51,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1473
02:36:53,698 --> 02:36:54,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul, right on time.

1474
02:36:55,399 --> 02:36:57,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul, we'll try you again.

1475
02:36:57,400 --> 02:36:59,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I see your hand still up, Paul, on Zoom.

1476
02:37:00,202 --> 02:37:02,723
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to try to speak, I've requested you to unmute again.

1477
02:37:02,743 --> 02:37:05,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me now?

1478
02:37:05,625 --> 02:37:06,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can.

1479
02:37:06,826 --> 02:37:08,887
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, David, I'm sure you'll have three minutes.

1480
02:37:09,747 --> 02:37:10,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1481
02:37:10,830 --> 02:37:17,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I do want to thank all the folks who've been involved with moving the zoning issues this far.

1482
02:37:17,776 --> 02:37:22,120
[SPEAKER_15]: But I begin by saying that zoning is a tool to support a vision, a strategy.

1483
02:37:23,101 --> 02:37:31,028
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I listen tonight, what I'm hearing is that there's conflicting endpoints for different people.

1484
02:37:31,088 --> 02:37:31,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm saying,

1485
02:37:32,426 --> 02:37:43,049
[SPEAKER_15]: As part of this process, will both parties at least attempt to come to some unified vision of what should be in the square?

1486
02:37:43,609 --> 02:37:47,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Not letting the developer come in and say, I want to put this here, but saying, this is what we like.

1487
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:53,971
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason why I say that is the city, the square is really a tale of two cities, two squares probably.

1488
02:37:54,011 --> 02:37:58,112
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you have the East side, you have the West side, you have Route 60 right down the middle.

1489
02:37:58,732 --> 02:38:01,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm saying, well, do we need to have certain provisions for, you know,

1490
02:38:02,740 --> 02:38:06,684
[SPEAKER_15]: aiding, working, relaxation on both sides of the square.

1491
02:38:06,724 --> 02:38:07,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1492
02:38:07,765 --> 02:38:10,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the vision for the square to be focusing on culture?

1493
02:38:10,327 --> 02:38:11,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it going to be in economics?

1494
02:38:11,508 --> 02:38:12,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it going to be in housing?

1495
02:38:12,449 --> 02:38:18,014
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's a whole lot of pieces here that I don't see tied into a consolidated vision.

1496
02:38:18,074 --> 02:38:25,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I would hope as part of the process, there can be a generally accepted unifying vision to say, what do we want in

1497
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:34,355
[SPEAKER_15]: on the square and then move forward to say, okay, once we decided what we'd like to have built here, then let zoning take its proper place.

1498
02:38:34,615 --> 02:38:34,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1499
02:38:38,017 --> 02:38:38,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1500
02:38:38,797 --> 02:38:40,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We will go back to the podium.

1501
02:38:40,078 --> 02:38:41,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

1502
02:38:41,138 --> 02:38:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll have three minutes.

1503
02:38:43,572 --> 02:38:45,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, my name is David Shank.

1504
02:38:45,993 --> 02:38:48,174
[SPEAKER_21]: My address is 72 New Bern Avenue.

1505
02:38:48,194 --> 02:38:52,035
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to start by saying thank you all for doing this.

1506
02:38:52,095 --> 02:38:55,557
[SPEAKER_21]: We desperately need new zoning in Medford.

1507
02:38:55,797 --> 02:39:05,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Ideally, more dense, urban, mixed-use zoning that can create a beautiful, walkable environment that everyone can live in as people and not as cars.

1508
02:39:09,143 --> 02:39:14,084
[SPEAKER_21]: My sister-in-law is currently pregnant, and she's due in February 19.

1509
02:39:15,425 --> 02:39:18,625
[SPEAKER_21]: And her and my brother do not own a car, but I do.

1510
02:39:19,026 --> 02:39:28,388
[SPEAKER_21]: And I am going to be lending them my car because I can afford to get around on foot, by bicycle, by train, by bus, in the area where I live.

1511
02:39:28,648 --> 02:39:31,689
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will be able to lend them that car for a period of months.

1512
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:36,573
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's possible because of the urban environment that we live in.

1513
02:39:36,733 --> 02:39:41,458
[SPEAKER_21]: And it is also the environment that I would like to see us move towards with this zoning.

1514
02:39:44,021 --> 02:39:51,008
[SPEAKER_21]: I am concerned at the level of protection that people feel over parking.

1515
02:39:52,049 --> 02:39:54,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Parking is not human.

1516
02:39:56,540 --> 02:40:03,202
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why the plan includes mixed use residential and commercial buildings.

1517
02:40:03,382 --> 02:40:07,123
[SPEAKER_21]: People can both live in that space and shop and work there.

1518
02:40:08,443 --> 02:40:13,185
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that is so important going forward.

1519
02:40:15,745 --> 02:40:19,286
[SPEAKER_21]: I would support no parking minimums in the area.

1520
02:40:19,707 --> 02:40:21,067
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand that there may be

1521
02:40:21,926 --> 02:40:22,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Disagreement on that.

1522
02:40:23,526 --> 02:40:27,487
[SPEAKER_21]: And as a follow up, I would say I support getting this through as quickly as possible.

1523
02:40:28,908 --> 02:40:33,609
[SPEAKER_21]: As was said, there was a plan made in 2005, 20 years ago.

1524
02:40:33,989 --> 02:40:36,630
[SPEAKER_21]: There has not been a significant overhaul in 50 years.

1525
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:47,532
[SPEAKER_21]: And we are in a housing crisis in Massachusetts at large, especially in the greater Boston area and in Medford specifically.

1526
02:40:47,552 --> 02:40:50,953
[SPEAKER_21]: And we desperately need more units.

1527
02:40:53,263 --> 02:41:04,713
[SPEAKER_21]: I would also like to say that the plan, the deal made to bring in a grocery store is an excellent addition to the mixed-use residential area.

1528
02:41:05,294 --> 02:41:06,635
[SPEAKER_21]: People will be able to shop there.

1529
02:41:06,655 --> 02:41:08,177
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll get their groceries.

1530
02:41:08,217 --> 02:41:14,542
[SPEAKER_21]: They can take advantage of all of the other amenities that are in Medford Square and will be built up.

1531
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:24,067
[SPEAKER_21]: as more businesses take advantage of that first floor area with the new customer base of people living on the stories above them.

1532
02:41:26,328 --> 02:41:26,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1533
02:41:28,250 --> 02:41:28,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1534
02:41:29,491 --> 02:41:31,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

1535
02:41:31,432 --> 02:41:33,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1536
02:41:35,403 --> 02:41:36,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Kit Nichols.

1537
02:41:36,864 --> 02:41:38,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 37 Governors Avenue.

1538
02:41:38,606 --> 02:41:45,512
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the pieces that was actually, I guess, cut off, bounded off, out of bounds for discussion tonight.

1539
02:41:46,653 --> 02:41:49,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I also serve on the Medford Historic Commission with Doug.

1540
02:41:52,037 --> 02:42:05,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make a couple of comments about historic preservation in Medford, because while it's absolutely true that not every house, every building in Medford that is old is worth preserving, we do have

1541
02:42:07,429 --> 02:42:13,598
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty remarkable historic building stock.

1542
02:42:13,818 --> 02:42:21,889
[SPEAKER_00]: This morning I was looking just at how many buildings or historic places we have in Medford, and there are 36.

1543
02:42:23,758 --> 02:42:27,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And eight of them are in the Medford Square District.

1544
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:35,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And as has already been said tonight, being on the National Register does not protect a place or a building.

1545
02:42:36,424 --> 02:42:42,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also true that the protections for historic buildings in Medford are really

1546
02:42:43,648 --> 02:42:44,970
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't very many.

1547
02:42:44,990 --> 02:42:58,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it really is the Medford historic commission and the most that the commission can do is if a building is decided to be historically significant and preferably preserved we can levy an 18 month demolition delay.

1548
02:42:59,208 --> 02:43:01,751
[SPEAKER_00]: But all a developer needs to do is wait that out.

1549
02:43:02,612 --> 02:43:19,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is a serious concern about saving and preserving some of the historic stock of buildings in Medford, I would strongly recommend that you figure that out before you pass a zoning of Medford Square.

1550
02:43:19,745 --> 02:43:25,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's nothing that anybody can do if a developer decides they want to buy something up and tear it down.

1551
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:26,491
[SPEAKER_00]: There really isn't.

1552
02:43:26,671 --> 02:43:27,732
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need to wait it out.

1553
02:43:28,752 --> 02:43:43,029
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would say is as someone who is trying to turn a property into a single family historic district there are all sorts of incentives for developers.

1554
02:43:44,190 --> 02:43:51,793
[SPEAKER_00]: to, for all sorts of reasons, there are no incentives for individual homeowners to do anything like this.

1555
02:43:52,153 --> 02:43:58,255
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no incentives to turn, in fact, it's a losing proposition to put your house in a single family historic district.

1556
02:43:58,695 --> 02:44:01,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who do it, do it because they care about the history.

1557
02:44:02,216 --> 02:44:07,158
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is really an interest in incentivizing

1558
02:44:08,918 --> 02:44:10,719
[SPEAKER_00]: not just developers, but homeowners.

1559
02:44:10,739 --> 02:44:16,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe there are ways that you can think of to incent private property owners as well.

1560
02:44:17,383 --> 02:44:17,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1561
02:44:19,144 --> 02:44:19,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Kate.

1562
02:44:20,745 --> 02:44:22,646
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we have one more hand on Zoom.

1563
02:44:23,506 --> 02:44:25,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Caitlin, name and address for the record, please.

1564
02:44:25,407 --> 02:44:26,168
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have three minutes.

1565
02:44:27,673 --> 02:44:30,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street.

1566
02:44:31,355 --> 02:44:33,837
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say thank you for having this meeting.

1567
02:44:33,897 --> 02:44:37,199
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm excited to see this process restarting.

1568
02:44:37,259 --> 02:44:42,903
[SPEAKER_18]: And I very much agree with the comments about like not needing to wait for something to be perfect.

1569
02:44:42,963 --> 02:44:48,887
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this has been a process that feels like it's been very drawn out.

1570
02:44:49,487 --> 02:44:51,268
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do hope to see progress soon.

1571
02:44:52,009 --> 02:44:53,430
[SPEAKER_18]: I do also want to speak

1572
02:44:54,358 --> 02:44:56,539
[SPEAKER_18]: to my concern for the parking minimums.

1573
02:44:57,440 --> 02:45:03,303
[SPEAKER_18]: I am very concerned about the impacts of having parking minimums in Medford Square.

1574
02:45:03,363 --> 02:45:10,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Historically, Medford Square as a historic district was not built, was not like meant to be built around parking minimums.

1575
02:45:11,408 --> 02:45:20,253
[SPEAKER_18]: And I am excited now that the rotary, the Salem Street Rotary has been much improved.

1576
02:45:20,941 --> 02:45:41,437
[SPEAKER_18]: I can walk over to Medford Square much more easily, and I would like to see Medford Square itself be a more walkable place, and I really don't wanna see parking minimums continuing to hamstring development, as well as continuing to hamstring having a walkable place.
