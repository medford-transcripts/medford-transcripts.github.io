1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:10,357
Welcome everyone to the April 3rd, 2024 meeting of the Chartered Study Committee, Article 6 Subcommittee, i.e.

2
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,558
the section on financial procedures.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,100
Maury may be joining us.

4
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,742
Hopefully he will, but he wasn't sure he had another meeting.

5
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:23,505
So the first item on the agenda is the minutes.

6
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,206
Move approval.

7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,347
Okay.

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:29,879
I'm abstaining.

9
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:30,419
I wasn't here.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,780
OK.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,200
I don't know if I can second.

12
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,481
Can I second?

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,462
But no, I can't.

14
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:39,082
I don't know.

15
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,623
We can probably table them until next time.

16
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:42,883
All right.

17
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:46,284
We'll table them until next time or until Maury gets here.

18
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:48,565
How's that?

19
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:49,205
OK.

20
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,905
Okay, I forgot to bring the agenda down.

21
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,006
I'm really sorry, guys.

22
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:04,269
I think we were going to talk about the issue of the budget ordinance.

23
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:05,890
I mean, amendment.

24
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:10,332
Which one?

25
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:13,714
The one that... There's one that passed, right?

26
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:14,935
That's just like a timeline.

27
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:22,920
Well, the ordinance is still not officially passed, but it's being finalized, as I understand it.

28
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:30,130
So the ordinance would be- Yeah, according to their first reading and the second reading, it should pass later this month.

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,431
Okay.

30
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,571
It's pretty much a done deal.

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,853
So, yeah, go ahead, Jean.

32
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:41,936
Oh, well, is that the one you mean, or the one that was sent to the mayor, which he sent to us?

33
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:50,540
Yes, the charter amendment, which we talked about at our full committee meeting last time and voted to not accept.

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,702
And then you had wanted to re-raise it, so that's-

35
00:01:54,787 --> 00:02:01,692
Yes, so I think first I want to make sure I understand what happened like the history.

36
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:04,514
But I was.

37
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:06,836
So, did that.

38
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:12,180
This is the amendment that would have allowed city council to move money.

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,781
My understanding.

40
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:14,842
Yeah.

41
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:20,356
Did they vote in favor of it and send it to the mayor who did not sign it?

42
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,117
Is that what happened?

43
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,999
Yeah, that's what I understand.

44
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,623
Okay, so city council, was it unanimous?

45
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,589
I think it was one no.

46
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:38,154
I feel that initially it was unanimous and then it turned 6-1.

47
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,436
Is that what you recall, Eunice?

48
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:48,822
I don't recall one way or the other, but I'm just thinking that amendment would have been the prior council.

49
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:50,673
Yes, that's right.

50
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:58,555
And the vote tabulation on that council was quite often four to three.

51
00:02:59,436 --> 00:02:59,676
Yes.

52
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:04,177
Versus the tabulation on this council, which is generally six to one.

53
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:11,519
For these amendments, they were unanimous, and then Adam Knight changed and ultimately voted no.

54
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:12,599
That's what I remember.

55
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:13,279
OK.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,621
So we have a near unanimous city council, even though it's a prior city council.

57
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,162
wanted this power, sent it to the mayor.

58
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,702
I'm going through my thinking with everyone.

59
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,823
Sent it to the mayor who said, I'm not going to sign it.

60
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:36,725
I would like the Charter Study Committee to review it and consider it as part of the charter, whether it made sense.

61
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:44,627
As I was thinking about that, I feel like I understand where most people are with

62
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,775
this amendment and that their vote may not change.

63
00:03:50,436 --> 00:04:08,053
Yet I feel like we should do our due diligence on researching it because it seems, I don't want to say disrespectful, I can't think of the right word, to not do due diligence on it and actually consider it since that is what

64
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:22,213
The mayor said we would do so that was we just so what I was envisioning and I'm volunteering myself for this, even though I seem to have perhaps taken on too much recently.

65
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:26,939
So I apologize was just looking into like, why.

66
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:31,208
What is the reasoning behind why most cities don't do this?

67
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,850
Do other states allow cities to do this?

68
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,433
Because our state and federal government, the legislative body, has this power.

69
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:49,198
And then research how it's going in cities in Massachusetts that have this authority with city council.

70
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:50,338
There is only one.

71
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:50,959
Is this Boston?

72
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,059
Yes.

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,128
So, and I already researched that a little bit.

74
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,737
So that's what that's my thinking is I just feel like.

75
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,979
It seems like we didn't really even consider it.

76
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,281
And I just, we need to say what we looked at and why we made our decision, but.

77
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,361
Okay.

78
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:17,123
I mean, so I hear you and thank you for offering to do the research.

79
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:22,425
I feel, and we can't do it tomorrow night because I didn't put it on the agenda, but we are still meeting on April 18th.

80
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:22,965
I feel like

81
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,150
we have to go back to the whole committee before we pay that step?

82
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,551
I saw that in the minutes, yeah.

83
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:32,453
Yeah, just because, you know, because the committee already voted.

84
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:46,561
So, you know, and we did look at this when we talked about it at the committee meeting, which is the state law, which may be one of the main reasons cities don't do it because it's,

85
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:54,385
says state law says they can't, but doesn't mean a special act couldn't get by.

86
00:05:54,405 --> 00:06:01,208
And as you can see, it exempts Boston in any city other than Boston.

87
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:13,972
And where's the part that says, the city council may by majority vote make appropriations for the purposes recommended and may reduce or reject any amount recommended in the annual budget

88
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:24,595
It shall not increase any amount in or the total of the annual budget nor add there to any amount for a purpose not included there and except on recommendation of the mayor.

89
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:32,758
Then there's a little bit of a different procedure for the school committee or there could be as I understand it.

90
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,775
But I feel like this is pretty clear.

91
00:06:38,795 --> 00:07:00,232
And I thought that the reasoning was that we, that putting something in the charter that could potentially be, it could be rejected by the state because they could say it's in conflict with the state.

92
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:03,755
So, you know, obviously,

93
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:09,870
I mean, it's a special act, so theoretically the state could say, okay.

94
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:21,274
But the advisability of including something in the charter that's clear, I mean, it's pretty clear, that statute.

95
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:27,936
So that I thought, to me, that was the reasoning why we didn't do it.

96
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:33,378
But if you feel strongly, we can go back to the committee and see

97
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,947
if they want to keep looking into it.

98
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,408
So would you look at Boston?

99
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:46,131
Yeah, I did a little Google, just like how is it going in Boston.

100
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:55,796
I mean, Boston has a huge, well, it's under a million, but people.

101
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,838
Budget probably.

102
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:03,170
is 20 times Medford budget or more.

103
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:11,816
And so they're different, I think, than Medford and other cities and towns.

104
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:15,920
And they've done two budget cycles with this process, as I understand it.

105
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,680
Right.

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,462
In the first cycle, they were late.

107
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,624
It was a messy process.

108
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:26,068
The second cycle seems like it was less messy.

109
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:41,954
so yeah yeah and i i don't completely understand the reasoning behind it like i don't know why city council can't move money around

110
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:58,197
Well, when I read about it, some of the arguments that people made were there was concern about sort of like kind of hordes trading, you know, that the, well, OK, you know, between the city councilors, it just makes a much messier process.

111
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:00,417
Right.

112
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,118
What did the Cohen Center folks say to us?

113
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:02,738
Do we remember?

114
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,319
Well, they just they were just advising us about the state law mostly.

115
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:16,004
I mean, you know, I don't know that they would, I don't know, maybe they would be willing to say whether they think it's a good idea.

116
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,307
They usually kind of, I mean, they might.

117
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:19,808
Right.

118
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:31,999
I wonder if somebody, who at the state level, what office would be the one to talk to?

119
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:37,399
Yeah, would Donato know?

120
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,060
Yeah, maybe.

121
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
What would we ask him?

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,061
Why the legislature made that the law, why?

123
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:59,564
I mean, I don't know how long the law, let's see, can you tell in the, do they indicate in the MDL how long, you know, when they passed?

124
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,084
I don't know how old the law is.

125
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:03,876
I don't know.

126
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,297
I think so, if you can.

127
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:07,558
Yeah.

128
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:14,922
All I'm saying is, depending on when the law was passed, he may not actually know.

129
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,804
Right.

130
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,585
He wasn't around when it was passed.

131
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:19,385
I don't know.

132
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:23,246
Oh, go ahead.

133
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,267
It's sort of all sides of this coin.

134
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:40,933
I mean, the conversation that we had within the whole group was sort of to reject it fairly quickly because it does go against state law that Boston is the only one that does it.

135
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,834
And that's a relatively new thing for them.

136
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,075
And as you report, Jean, the first time around was messy.

137
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:51,297
Of course, you could argue that the first time for anything is messy.

138
00:10:53,507 --> 00:11:01,173
But on the other hand, I see your point two of the mayor handed it to us.

139
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:09,399
So we should give it its due diligence that she expects of us.

140
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,286
And I think the other thought that I have is that this originated from the city council and

141
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:45,780
They want it, so if we're going to reject it, which I'm pretty sure that that's the direction I'm still continuing to go on my vote, is that we need to settle it once and for all with good, solid, factual backup to put it to bed.

142
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:47,266
Right.

143
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:51,774
And I have to say, I'm leaning towards not approving it also.

144
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:56,102
But I just, did we do our due diligence, I guess is the question.

145
00:11:57,774 --> 00:12:06,558
My feeling is that we did, but if there's ambivalence, or we can look back at it.

146
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,979
And Jean, if you're willing to look into it more.

147
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:24,045
I mean, how the process went in Boston is probably going to also be subjective, just because I know there was one member who talked about even how it went in Boston this year and felt that it was messy.

148
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,586
So there's different.

149
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,107
thoughts that people will have about that.

150
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:38,409
And I don't know, there may be fiscal concerns that states and the federal government don't have, right?

151
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:46,810
But like, Massachusetts, the state has been late on its state budget, multiple years in a row.

152
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:54,852
And, and yet the, that is the system they have set up that the legislature, the governor,

153
00:12:57,162 --> 00:13:02,244
bargain and the two houses in the legislature have to come to a conference.

154
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:15,790
So I just don't understand why cities and towns are different, but maybe it's the financial rating system is different or the reserves for a state are different than the city.

155
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,033
But it might be nice to just know some of that.

156
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:20,753
Yeah.

157
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:38,567
I mean, to me, there's an inherent difference between the state house, which is the legislative bodies in the state house represent communities all over the state, whereas when you have an individual city, there's just everybody's in the same city.

158
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,711
So it's not like you're bringing different viewpoints from across the state.

159
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,152
It's one city.

160
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:55,920
You know, and the other thing is the way the ordinance is written, if I understand it correctly, and I think I'm correct on this is that so right now, if.

161
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:09,391
the city council doesn't really have power to reject the mayor's budget because there's this one, then they do a one 12 budget and then within a certain amount of time, the mayor's budget is in place.

162
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,613
So, and I know that that upsets them.

163
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:19,677
So that's the other thing is, I mean, this was put forth by the city council and it's about giving them more power.

164
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:24,661
So I feel like there's a certain bias in the creation of it, but,

165
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:34,208
But the ordinance, I mean, the amendment would basically make it so that they could move the money, they could change it.

166
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:39,092
The only thing they can't do is they can't increase the overall amount.

167
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:46,759
But then they send it to the mayor and if the mayor sends it back, they can just overrule that with a two-thirds vote.

168
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,881
So to me, that just takes

169
00:14:52,243 --> 00:15:04,770
a lot away from the executive, which, you know, and I know that people talk about balance of power and that they think the balance of power needs to change, but at the same time, people want a mayor council form of government.

170
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,332
So this is what a mayor council form of government is.

171
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:17,137
In every community in Massachusetts that has a mayor council government, the balance of power is the way it is in Medford, because that's what a mayor council government is.

172
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:27,721
So if we want that form of government, then that's sort of where we are.

173
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:33,584
Unless we want to try to buck state law and see if it makes it through.

174
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:41,887
And I'm the person that said we shouldn't do too many big things or it might not get passed.

175
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:44,288
So I realize I'm the person that's been saying that.

176
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:58,341
I also are there other ways of because we did hear from a lot of residents that they want a better balance of power so I feel like by not.

177
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:03,225
This is one of the ways of balancing power is there.

178
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:17,221
Is there a way to change that process that you just mentioned where, you know, say they reject the budget, like is there a way to change that?

179
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:24,244
Is there a way to give them a little more, I guess, power in the process?

180
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:27,666
I was also- In the budget, you're talking about the budget process specifically.

181
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,387
Yeah, either,

182
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:35,585
You know, I know we're setting up timelines because that has always been a complaint that they get the budget last minute.

183
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:48,417
But is there like, you know, even like early in January having a meeting that

184
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:55,020
They put their priorities on the table.

185
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,666
I don't know, just setting up, even though they have no, like, is there a way they could just say, here are our priorities?

186
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:04,230
And then the city says, here's our revenue.

187
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,751
Our revenue is not what we thought.

188
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:14,220
Like, even though they didn't put fully, they do have forecasts and they have pictures and they're just forcing them to collaborate more, I guess.

189
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:24,046
Well, a lot of that is going in the budget ordinance, but I think that I feel like is shifting our discussion to our actual draft document.

190
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,148
And I think it's fine if we do that.

191
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,370
I just want to wrap up this particular topic.

192
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:44,260
So and understand the conclusion, which is that we're going to bring it back to the whole committee and see and just talk about and say that Jean is willing to research it so that we can have more information

193
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:45,557
Right.

194
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:53,880
I mean, and are we saying that we want to reopen it for another future vote or that we're just collecting more information?

195
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:58,401
Hi, Maury.

196
00:17:59,521 --> 00:17:59,861
Hi, Maury.

197
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:01,222
Hi, Maury.

198
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:08,824
I mean, maybe we should open it for a future vote.

199
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:09,244
Hi, everyone.

200
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:09,965
Sorry I'm late.

201
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:10,865
I had another meeting.

202
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:11,765
That's OK.

203
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,426
I'm glad you're here because I have to leave in a few minutes.

204
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:21,638
Well, maybe we don't have to say that.

205
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:27,401
Maybe we can just see if the committee is willing to reopen it for more information.

206
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:33,565
And then let when the information is received, there can be a decision on whether people want to.

207
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,126
I mean, you know what I mean?

208
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:36,927
Does that make sense?

209
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,047
Yeah, that makes sense.

210
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,068
Okay.

211
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,770
Research on this, like maybe I don't know.

212
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,664
Yeah, it will be interesting to see if there was, but okay.

213
00:18:47,784 --> 00:19:03,508
So this is, so Maury and I went to talk to the chief financial officer and the chief of staff, and it was a good meeting.

214
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:11,770
So the first item, Jean, is something similar to what you were saying, although it's not in January.

215
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:16,519
Oh, sorry.

216
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,961
For the blind among us.

217
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:21,603
There is that good.

218
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:21,963
Thank you.

219
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:23,224
Okay.

220
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:33,972
So, so, you know, basically what we had done was we had a bunch of, we had timelines that we thought seemed reasonable, but we wanted to make sure that they were.

221
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:45,345
that they were actually doable and talk to people who actually do the job so that we knew for sure that we weren't proposing something that wasn't feasible.

222
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:50,849
So this annual budget meeting is along the lines of what we've been talking about.

223
00:19:50,909 --> 00:20:03,358
It requires a joint meeting of all the branches of government before the commencement of the budget process to review the financial condition of the city, revenue and expenditure forecasts, and other relevant information.

224
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,761
And what we had, well, we had talked about the window, right?

225
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:15,925
So no later, it's, you have to like, July 1st is the beginning of the fiscal year, so.

226
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:20,908
So no later than 60 days is, yeah, so it's between March and May.

227
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:29,913
And I believe it was, one of the things that we heard when we talked to Nina and the CFO is,

228
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:42,970
that there's a date in the budget ordinance, which is not finalized yet, but it's in the works, to supply numbers to the school committee and that this date could sort of run into that.

229
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:50,255
Like, for instance, they were saying, well, so the two potential ways to fix that

230
00:20:51,251 --> 00:21:01,959
potential problem is to just make it no later than 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year or making the no earlier than a little later.

231
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,762
I mean, yeah, a little later.

232
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,723
So changing that to 100 days.

233
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:09,185
100 days, right, exactly.

234
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,448
So what are people's thoughts?

235
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:15,170
I'd like to give them a window, so.

236
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,492
I mean, you know,

237
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:33,617
They can have it as early as they want if we say no later than, but so, you know, it's not like it doesn't preclude them from having it earlier if they wanted to or if they were able to.

238
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,460
I like giving them the flexibility to say no later than.

239
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:43,521
Just saying no later than.

240
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:47,223
So if they want to meet earlier, they can.

241
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,703
you know, it's the charter.

242
00:21:54,223 --> 00:22:12,295
Yeah, but, Gene, my thoughts on that was when we talked about a window and so forth, and was that you don't want them to hold this meeting in November or December when they're only five or six months into the fiscal year, that they don't have any really hard numbers.

243
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,237
You know, that's kind of where we came up there.

244
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:19,344
I see.

245
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,106
So correct me if I'm wrong.

246
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:28,909
And our discussion with them is that they kind of like the 100 day thing of shortening a little bit.

247
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:37,713
I mean, I kind of like I like the window myself want to hold their feet to the fire and come back in November when they are any time they want.

248
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:43,976
As long as it's 60 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year that

249
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,618
they hold the meeting and they don't have any hardcore numbers.

250
00:22:49,859 --> 00:23:02,243
They haven't gone through any tough times during the year, only six months into the program or four or five months into the program, yet they've met the obligation of having the meeting.

251
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:10,405
I want to make sure they have a meeting that they're able to say, okay, this is where we're at for this year that we're in.

252
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:14,927
That was my only thought process on the window.

253
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:27,369
Yeah, I mean, and one of the I my thought is that another reason that the window came up is because there has been so much talk about, you know, starting the budget process earlier.

254
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,751
And one of the things that we've learned is that

255
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:42,897
that you can't really have it much before March because there's just not, you know, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be useful because there's really not information, you know, there's not reliable information.

256
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:48,422
So that, so I feel like that, that putting in the window was kind of a response to that.

257
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:53,867
But I mean, the charter is the charter and it's,

258
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:57,580
It's not, it's enshrined, right?

259
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:10,071
Theoretically, we're gonna put a regular charter review in, but leaving it general and putting in flexibility, there's something to be said for that.

260
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:11,452
Jean?

261
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,395
That makes sense to me, Maury.

262
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:21,861
What you said is that you wanna give a window that's where the numbers are firmer.

263
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:32,073
I wonder if there could be something that says nothing precludes earlier meetings to share budget forecasts.

264
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:47,716
I just know like when I worked in state government and you're halfway in, they knew if revenue was down much earlier than, you know, so there'd often be nine C cuts or things because they didn't have the revenue.

265
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:52,937
So it's just, is there a way that people can all be on the same page if they, I don't know,

266
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:02,044
I don't know if this isn't how city works, but I know that state government, they often know when their tax revenue is much lower than anticipated.

267
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:06,688
I don't think that this would preclude any meetings.

268
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:15,114
I feel like this only says that the mayor has to call an annual budget meeting in this window or before.

269
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:15,975
Okay.

270
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:16,415
I don't know.

271
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,096
That's my reading of it.

272
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:21,119
It doesn't say that they can't call other meetings.

273
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,457
That doesn't say that to me, but Eunice.

274
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:38,584
Oh, I mean, that's kind of what I was getting at in our last meeting and some other conversations where I suggested something in January and I've also suggested that.

275
00:25:41,205 --> 00:26:00,685
we put something in there and perhaps it goes in a different place under the school committee and the legislative and executive, all three, where the three branches of government get together at some regular interval and just talk about how things are going.

276
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:11,272
You know, as I said before, that some of the issues within the school system, you know, might not have come to a head if.

277
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:23,071
I mean, obviously anything that's going on in the schools, the mayor knows because she's at the school committee meetings as part of her role, but it leaves the city council in the dark.

278
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:38,016
So I think if all three branches of government had a regular schedule of collaboration, they might not do a deep dive into the budget, but at least they'll have a clue about what's going on so that

279
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,864
budget stuff is not as much of a big surprise.

280
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:48,652
And then they can do the deep dive into the budget, you know, during this March through May meeting that we're talking about.

281
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:55,059
But when you say talking, when you're talking about these regular required meetings, you're talking about them in relationship to the budget.

282
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:56,942
Um,

283
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:11,843
A meeting in January could possibly be more of a deeper dive into a budget, but I think there has to be better collaboration amongst the three branches regardless.

284
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:25,874
Yeah, I think, I believe that in, we're going to look at articles two and three tomorrow, but I believe there were some things in there about the city council and the mayor being able to

285
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:32,216
you know, compel attendance at meetings.

286
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:39,584
Yeah, well, I mean, that actually came up last night, to some degree, so.

287
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,055
Yeah, so we'll look at that.

288
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:50,977
But beyond the budget, I guess I can't think of any reason why the city council and the school committee have to meet.

289
00:27:51,497 --> 00:28:01,399
Because that's the only... The city council approves the budget, but they don't really have anything else to do with the business of the school committee.

290
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,560
Right?

291
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,680
Am I missing something?

292
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,880
No, you're not.

293
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,981
You're not missing something.

294
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:17,370
You know, as has been said many times, it's the city council where it's the people's forum, where people come to, you know, feel heard.

295
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:26,293
And that's why I'm suggesting, you know, that there be more collaboration amongst the three branches.

296
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,093
And part of that can be with the budget.

297
00:28:28,713 --> 00:28:28,953
So.

298
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:33,755
I think, Eunice, if I'm hearing you right, it's more kind of like,

299
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:57,500
the three bodies getting together in an informal type session where it's the state of the city address between themselves and what kind of condition they're in and what their needs are to stop me maybe laying the groundwork out for the upcoming budget of, we're going to need this, we're going to need that, and how do we work together to formulate that?

300
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,121
I think that's a perfect world.

301
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:03,782
I'm not so sure you're going to see that here, but I agree with that.

302
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:09,803
Well, hopefully this annual budget meeting would be in that direction.

303
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:11,003
Jean?

304
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:16,244
I don't know if there's open meeting things.

305
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:22,205
If the bodies meet, they have to just keep that in mind.

306
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,766
Yeah.

307
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:29,987
Which sometimes makes it harder for them to work together when they're on a stage.

308
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:57,747
I was curious whether other cities have anything in their budget part of the charter that, because I think some of it is, some of the stress around the budget has been that people were caught off guard when revenue was so low and there were significant cuts and they had no time to plan from the city council or school committee side.

309
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:03,400
Is there, do any cities ask for forecast updates?

310
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:11,647
Like maybe the city or the CFO, and maybe this already happens, but is there a way to?

311
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:13,769
What kind of forecasts?

312
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:23,878
Just like where they are with revenue, just sharing on a quarterly basis how expenditures and revenue are going.

313
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,159
But like orderly reports.

314
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,800
Yeah, I'm making this up here.

315
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,202
I don't know if I'm just wondering if any other cities.

316
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:42,226
I don't know, but I haven't studied carefully the budget ordinance, but I do believe there was something in there about orderly reports.

317
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:48,249
Yes, Eunice, you've looked at it probably more carefully than I.

318
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:49,945
Got it right in front of me.

319
00:30:49,965 --> 00:31:00,848
1 of the 1 of the biggest complaints over the last couple of years that the city council has put forth is that they're not getting something called the warrant articles.

320
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:06,230
The warrant articles apparently are like the monthly bills and so.

321
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,131
They don't know what money's going out for what?

322
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:12,071
So.

323
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:20,969
They've put something in here where quarterly financial reports and meetings.

324
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:29,515
The finance director will provide a written report regarding the city's finances to the council on a quarterly basis, no later than 60 days.

325
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:34,618
After the end of each quarter, the report shall contain the following.

326
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:40,082
Previous quarters accounts payable warrants by month, year to date budget to actuals,

327
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:50,683
where available updates on state certifications, revenue forecasts, spending forecasts, and any other information the finance director deems relevant.

328
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,765
So there's your forecasts, Jean.

329
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:53,945
Yeah, OK.

330
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,046
That sounds good to me.

331
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:55,787
That sounds good.

332
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:56,107
Yeah.

333
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:00,290
So going into the ordinance, which is due to pass momentarily.

334
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:18,859
And the difference between whatever ordinance gets passed and the charter is that the, you know, a charter by nature should be more general because it's a lot harder to change and it doesn't tend to, charters don't tend to go into those kinds of details.

335
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,280
Okay.

336
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,202
So, I mean, you know,

337
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:32,710
Because whatever process is outlined in the charter, it's there until you change the charter again.

338
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,230
In Medford's case.

339
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,671
Yeah, right.

340
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:36,731
It's the truth.

341
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,172
OK.

342
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,613
Well, it's good to know that's in the ordinance, I think.

343
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:44,574
Yeah.

344
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:45,274
OK.

345
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:54,414
Yeah, and what we heard from the CFO and the chief of staff is that, you know, they're both.

346
00:32:55,255 --> 00:33:02,082
I mean, it's an example of the I feel is the collaboration that we've been talking about that they've worked with the city council to come up with.

347
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:15,788
to agree on this ordinance and that they're, even though they don't, it's not passed yet, they're actually trying to do it this year anyway, just because they actually, you know, they want to see if it works well also.

348
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,210
So I think that...

349
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:20,108
They've already started it.

350
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:27,573
I mean, the council came up with their priorities and it forwarded them to the mayor.

351
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:37,419
The first set of budget meetings is Wednesday, April 17th, with the second set being, I believe, May 1st.

352
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,542
There will probably be one or two others after that.

353
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:56,198
Yeah, and they haven't, I don't think they have this annual budget meeting that we're proposing, and this wasn't actually in all the, well, I mean, of the three charters that we got from the Collins Center, I think this was only in Melrose.

354
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,699
Is that what you remember?

355
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,400
Yeah, I think so.

356
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,982
Yeah, but, you know, I think it's a good idea.

357
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:07,224
And do we remember what the timeframe was in Melrose?

358
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:11,908
I think it was, they didn't have a window, they just said no later than.

359
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,970
Yeah, they just said no later than.

360
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:18,074
Yeah, and the reason for making it May

361
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:23,115
was just because it's the charter and it's, you know, so enshrined.

362
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:35,221
And if there happened to be a year where just for whatever reason, it was just difficult to get the budget process going before that, I don't know, like maybe a pandemic or something, I don't know.

363
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:41,565
But that we just wanted to, that flexibility, wanted to build in that flexibility.

364
00:34:43,793 --> 00:35:04,918
Well, I think going back to the original point, I think doing the window of 100 days to 60 days, as Maury said, that forces them to do something within a period of time where they actually have concrete, relevant information, rather than going through the motions and checking the box and saying, oh, yeah, we did that last November.

365
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:08,380
Okay.

366
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,523
I mean, this is all going to get run by the whole committee too.

367
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:25,353
And we can keep these timeframes in yellow because when we send it to the committee, I mean, those are the parts that we want them to pay special attention to are the timeframes.

368
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:31,198
So we can keep them in yellow and then people can ask, well, why did you pick those numbers?

369
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:32,739
And we'll be able to tell them.

370
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:40,488
Right, you know, the feedback from, you know, Nina and Bob Dickinson, I think is really good because that gives us.

371
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:50,436
You know, I mean, it's 1 thing looking at, you know, charters of other communities and things, but the key always is to remember, is it going to work in Mount in Medford?

372
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:53,218
You know, Medford and now we know.

373
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:55,479
Yeah, and I think the reason they.

374
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,006
They said, I believe they said the date for providing some sort of.

375
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:09,513
financial information to the school committee was like March 1st, something like that.

376
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:23,165
It was right around, and they were- It was right around the beginning of March and so forth, so they needed like an extra month of time to put the numbers together and so forth, because their budget takes up so much of the entire budget, if I correct.

377
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,606
Right, exactly.

378
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:25,967
Yeah, that's right.

379
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:27,369
So they thought that, you know, if

380
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:36,135
Keeping this particular meeting sort of after the time when the school committee would get those numbers would be more useful.

381
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:37,516
Exactly.

382
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:39,158
So that's why we started the window.

383
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:42,663
And they were great, by the way.

384
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:50,952
They were so cordial and so helpful and so obliging to what we're, Milford handled 90% of it.

385
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:53,135
And I was there to be there.

386
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:55,257
I don't know about that.

387
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,719
You were there to look pretty, Maury.

388
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,081
No, Maury was participant.

389
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:03,037
Okay.

390
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:03,578
So we're good.

391
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,739
We're comfortable with this.

392
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:13,385
And like I said, you know, I mean, there may be other things that people, other members of the committee think of when we talk about it, but I'll just leave it in yellow.

393
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:14,246
I think it makes sense.

394
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:21,911
I had made a comment at the very, very, yeah.

395
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:29,177
You know, under the title, you know, is this provide, you know, applying to school committee as well?

396
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:36,217
You know, or are they gonna do their own, are we talking about an article four?

397
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,781
No, they wouldn't do their own budget stuff in article four.

398
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:50,109
The school committee budget process is probably one of those, another one, I mean, so much of what the school committee does is outlined in state law, right?

399
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,154
Yeah, I believe they actually have to have a budget hearing as well.

400
00:37:56,053 --> 00:37:58,654
which is something a little bit different.

401
00:37:58,674 --> 00:38:08,417
I was on the school committee budget meeting at five o'clock and they alluded to that, that they've already got their schedule.

402
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:19,190
Do you suggest that maybe there's something to go in here with a directive to the school committee?

403
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,113
Go ahead, yeah.

404
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:27,297
I think wherever anything can be ambiguous,

405
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:36,020
Or, you know, we need to make clear what does or does not apply to the school committee.

406
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:43,422
Is this, you know, the budget for the entire city or is this the city council piece of the budget or is this?

407
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:51,484
Well, the budget, this is talking about the city budget of which the school committee is budget is a part, right?

408
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:56,745
So, I mean,

409
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:08,255
Yes, there's separate it is a it is a quote unquote separate budget, but it's it's a it's one part of the city budget and this is about the city, but.

410
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:12,559
Okay, so so that's how I see it.

411
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:16,422
We we refer to the school committee, you know.

412
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:43,273
specifically so as we move through I think I just want to keep that in mind that you know this says it shall include this this it does actually you know when this mayor submits the budget it shall include the school department so it does it does it does have that specificity in it okay so that's excuse me as you know last night was another late night um

413
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:51,661
Okay, so yeah, so this is what it's saying is, you know, it basically needs to be numbers and a narrative.

414
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:56,323
And that goes for everybody.

415
00:39:57,484 --> 00:39:57,804
Yeah.

416
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:03,426
And this says it shall be submitted by June 1st?

417
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:03,666
Yeah.

418
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:14,438
So, you know, it could be submitted earlier, but June 1st is the deadline.

419
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:17,259
I think the budget ordinance says May 31st.

420
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:20,880
Yeah, so it's one day different.

421
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,661
Yeah.

422
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:24,481
Are we okay?

423
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:26,422
And I didn't put, Jean, go ahead.

424
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:29,970
No, I just have to I have to go.

425
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,771
I'm so sorry.

426
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:32,132
Okay, I'm sorry, Jean.

427
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,474
So you'll be seeing this again with the whole committee.

428
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:35,415
Okay.

429
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:36,957
Thanks for coming.

430
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:37,638
The whole meeting.

431
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:38,258
No worries.

432
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:38,979
Thanks.

433
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:39,980
Take care.

434
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,821
Good to see you, Maury.

435
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:40,961
Bye.

436
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:47,015
We're still all okay with the 30 days.

437
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,077
Should I put this in yellow too?

438
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:57,285
Since it's... No, it's in 30 days before the beginning of the... If we're putting all the timelines in yellow to sort of highlight them to the whole committee?

439
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:57,385
Yeah.

440
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,606
The whole committee, sure.

441
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,128
Okay, so I'll just...

442
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:18,321
Okay, and then do we get, basically, this was another, you know, I feel like we could take this out of yellow because, well, you know, we did talk to Nina and the CFO about this a little bit, right?

443
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:22,143
And they said- Yeah, go ahead.

444
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,423
Go ahead, Maury, go ahead.

445
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:33,707
No, they were just saying how they know what's in there and they were, when Nina said we went through the publications, they were advised basically to go through the Boston Heralds.

446
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,746
Yeah.

447
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:42,469
That counts as a local news publication.

448
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:49,354
And that's the reason, as I was looking through this today, that's the reason I called the city clerk today.

449
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,242
Because, Eunice?

450
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,423
Did Eunice just get cut off?

451
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:04,233
Odysseus.

452
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,455
Eunice, we missed you.

453
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:09,456
Go ahead.

454
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:10,797
What?

455
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:17,820
We stopped hearing you after you said, that's the reason I went to the city clerk today.

456
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,101
Oh, OK.

457
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:27,085
Yeah, so he publicizes things in what's called the Medford Transcript slash Somerville Journal.

458
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:27,805
Right.

459
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:29,166
Yeah.

460
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:31,207
And it's those little classified ads.

461
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:39,935
Occasionally, he will use the Globe or the Herald, which is significantly more expensive, he told me.

462
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:41,236
Yeah, that makes sense.

463
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:44,277
If there's a time crunch or something like that.

464
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:49,440
But I said to him, what do other communities do?

465
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,962
Who is this a requirement from?

466
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:56,884
He couldn't really,

467
00:42:58,602 --> 00:43:11,448
there was no clarity on, you know, is this, you know, it's not coming from the charter or we would know that, but it's not, he didn't know if it was coming from state law as well.

468
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:13,108
Gotta be state law.

469
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:19,571
I mean, if they're doing it because they have to, it's gotta be state law, because it's not in our current charter.

470
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:23,253
Yeah, and I just said, you know, I mean, with the fact that,

471
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:31,782
most local publications have gone the way of the dinosaur, they're left with the Globe and the Herald.

472
00:43:31,802 --> 00:43:47,859
But there doesn't seem to be anything coming from up above to get rid of this, because newspapers are vanishing.

473
00:43:50,677 --> 00:43:52,258
Yeah.

474
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:56,920
But at least we know that it's not a problem.

475
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,282
They can deal with this one way or another.

476
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:04,464
So that's good anyway.

477
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:11,969
Maury, on this section, I wrote, we still have questions on this.

478
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:17,772
Can you say what you understood about this when we talked about Nina?

479
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:24,856
It's kind of ambiguous because the 45 days goes to like June 1st through July 15th.

480
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:28,578
You have the fiscal year, you're already five days.

481
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:29,879
This is what I heard, Melba.

482
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:30,659
I don't know what you did.

483
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,841
And we're 15 days into the next,

484
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:35,421
fiscal year.

485
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:39,823
So I mean, I'm confused by all this language.

486
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:59,092
Yeah, we were trying to, we were trying to, so if the deadline for submitting the budget, I mean, yeah, for submitting the budget is June 1st, then 45 days later would be July 15th, which is after the deadline, right, the deadline of June 30th.

487
00:44:59,112 --> 00:44:59,152
So

488
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:07,238
Yeah, so we weren't really sure what to do about this.

489
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:11,182
And this number came from another charter, right?

490
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:12,203
Exactly.

491
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:12,683
Yep.

492
00:45:13,204 --> 00:45:13,464
Yeah.

493
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:22,733
I want to, I actually want to kind of look back and see if all three of the charters had the same language, the same language.

494
00:45:23,374 --> 00:45:24,075
Yeah.

495
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,096
This is article what?

496
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:29,158
Article six.

497
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:45,656
Well, what this is saying, or how I interpret it, if they have it until May 31st or June 1st to submit the budget, and then this goes back 45 days after the budget is in there, and the fiscal year starts on July 1st,

498
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,032
There's a time frame.

499
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:55,897
I'm not the smartest person in the world, but there's a time frame in there that doesn't make sense to me.

500
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,679
Yeah, I know.

501
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:59,000
That's wrong somewhere.

502
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,442
Melrose says 45.

503
00:46:02,082 --> 00:46:03,023
Oh, thank you, Eunice.

504
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:03,583
You're looking.

505
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:04,404
Melrose says 45.

506
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:06,706
Yeah, they all do, I think.

507
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:07,967
Pittsburgh says 45.

508
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,240
are friends in Weymouth.

509
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,001
They say 45 also.

510
00:46:22,941 --> 00:46:36,065
All three comparison charters that we've been kind of building eyes on and taking the good points and the bad points and learning things from them, I believe they all say 45 days.

511
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,766
Weymouth says 90.

512
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,967
Wow, well, that's even later.

513
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:43,748
That throws a wrench into things.

514
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:54,196
So, I feel like, you know, we're going to have to ask, I mean, there's got to be a reason that people are saying 45 is.

515
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:55,156
Exactly.

516
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:56,637
That's what they're saying.

517
00:46:56,677 --> 00:47:03,122
And we should maybe, maybe the Collins Center can help us understand that.

518
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:07,185
That might be a good question for them, though.

519
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:07,885
Yeah.

520
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:09,747
When they do it, they should be able to say,

521
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:21,820
I mean, the other thing that I don't understand about this language, though, it doesn't, it says adoption of the budget.

522
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:37,303
There have been years that the budget in this city has been adopted 15 minutes before the stroke of midnight for July 1st.

523
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:43,979
That's what I don't understand.

524
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,481
What if it didn't come down until June 28th that it gets adopted?

525
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:52,342
Now you're into what, June?

526
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:59,645
You'd be into August if the 45 days following the date the budget is filed with the city clerk in amending.

527
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:04,187
So this is saying 45 days following the date the budget is filed.

528
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:18,518
Well, but above it, adoption of the budget, the city council shall adopt the operating budget with or without amendments, not more than 45 days following the date the budget is filed.

529
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:27,773
So to me, what that is saying is they can file, how do we leave it?

530
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:37,541
30 days before the end of the fiscal year, the mayor has to submit the budget to the city clerk and the council at the same time.

531
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:40,283
So if the mayor submits it on June 1st.

532
00:48:40,824 --> 00:48:41,644
So you're July 15th.

533
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,454
here at July 15th, which is after June 30th.

534
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:47,595
Right, exactly.

535
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:47,915
Right.

536
00:48:48,776 --> 00:49:05,224
So what I'm wondering is whether this is, I mean, you know, there's, if the city council doesn't vote on the budget or doesn't accept the budget and they can't agree on the budget, then they go into that 112, is that what it is, 112 budget?

537
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:07,505
Yeah, 112, it almost happened a few years ago.

538
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:26,501
And I don't remember what state law says about how many days that it has to be before the mayor's budget is automatically adopted, right?

539
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:36,669
But I'm just wondering if this is about that and if this changes the window of time that there can be a 1 to 12 budget.

540
00:49:38,137 --> 00:50:05,154
Well, I think you might be exactly right, because as I pointed out the other day, that I always thought that if the budget wasn't adopted within two weeks or 15 days of the start of the next fiscal year, then the budget submitted was the one that would have to be accepted, which I call that 45-day rule.

541
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:13,565
But I don't know what, I can't remember, I think it might be longer than 45 days in state law.

542
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:15,786
I think it might be more like nine.

543
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:17,407
I don't know, I don't have any idea.

544
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:25,471
And what, yeah, so I'm just wondering if that's what this is about and if this actually shortens the window for that.

545
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:28,873
So, I mean, that's the only thing I can think of, but we'll ask that.

546
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:32,074
It might be right, yeah, exactly, it's a good question, yep.

547
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,075
And if that is right,

548
00:50:38,344 --> 00:50:41,714
Does that mean that this is desirable because

549
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,682
because it would be less time for the 1-12 budget.

550
00:50:52,722 --> 00:50:56,043
The 1-12 budget is not a good thing for the city.

551
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:57,844
Not at all.

552
00:50:57,864 --> 00:50:59,365
No, definitely not.

553
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:03,146
I'd like to hear what the call and center has to say on this.

554
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:03,486
Yeah.

555
00:51:03,506 --> 00:51:09,529
They're going to obviously have a reason that this is here and why it's been adopted in this way.

556
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,549
Right, exactly.

557
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,691
I'm going to ask them about section 6-4.

558
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,422
I mean, they're coming to our meeting tomorrow and our following meeting in April.

559
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:28,385
So if we're productive enough tomorrow, we'll be talking about this at our full committee meeting in April.

560
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:29,426
I'm hoping we get there.

561
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:36,209
Section 6-4, the adoption of budget.

562
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:36,609
Okay.

563
00:51:36,629 --> 00:51:40,391
So I guess what we'll just do is leave it there for now in yellow.

564
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:41,611
Does that sound right?

565
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:43,032
It does to me.

566
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:43,492
Yeah.

567
00:51:43,672 --> 00:51:44,152
Okay.

568
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:44,913
More clarity.

569
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:51,341
And then this stuff we didn't, this is just a posting required availability of the operating budget.

570
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,962
There was nothing really.

571
00:51:53,762 --> 00:52:01,247
The capital improvement program, I remember our question was, does every year make, you know,

572
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,787
Does every year make sense?

573
00:52:05,348 --> 00:52:08,389
Because some cities had every year and some had every three years.

574
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:10,789
I think we may have looked at one that had five years.

575
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:12,449
Yeah, had five years.

576
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:22,292
After our conversation yesterday, I think it's clear after the input of how much time goes into it that every year is unreasonable.

577
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:24,592
Five years is unreasonable.

578
00:52:24,632 --> 00:52:26,093
It's too far down the road.

579
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,094
That window of three years seem to be

580
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:35,698
for the people in the know that do this, that's a reasonable time period.

581
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:36,499
Yeah.

582
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,121
Do you agree, Eunice?

583
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:40,422
Yeah, I think so.

584
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:50,551
I think that that makes sense because I think every year is definitely too much to be tied up in.

585
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:52,633
Capital stuff is big stuff.

586
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:53,854
It's not the day-to-day.

587
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:54,775
Yeah.

588
00:52:55,015 --> 00:52:56,977
They said it's a lot of work to put it together.

589
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:07,812
Yeah, and I know that there was some, you know, contentiousness when they went through this budget ordinance about, you know, the different pieces that.

590
00:53:09,193 --> 00:53:14,936
You know, the finance staff was going to be responsible for and and what the city council was.

591
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:36,301
looking for, and I think that Nina and the finance director were pretty clear that some of this was going to be pretty hard for them to, especially under the circumstances that they have at the moment with the staffing and software and things like that.

592
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:42,385
So I think three years is the right sweet spot.

593
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:43,426
Awesome.

594
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:52,892
Okay, so the rest there was not much, but you had a question on the independent audit units, right?

595
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:53,392
Yeah.

596
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,264
I, I heard Zach mentioned something about the audit last night on the council meeting.

597
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,165
I don't know if you heard it.

598
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:04,807
I didn't stay for the whole thing.

599
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:05,367
Okay.

600
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,728
I don't and I don't remember.

601
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,711
Which of the 6 and at what point in the 6 and a half hour meeting.

602
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:20,319
You know, this occurred, but he mentioned something about the audit and I went looking for it today and it is online.

603
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:46,808
Finance page, and it seemed to me that the audit comes under the auspices of the finance office, which is logical, which comes under the auspices of the mayor, whereas this talks about city council shall provide an outside audit, and the city council, you know,

604
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:52,669
The report of the audit, you know, shall be filed in final form with the city council.

605
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,590
The city council shall conduct a competitive procurement process.

606
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:17,677
So, you know, my question, as I said, is, you know, should the audit be, you know, originating from and under the auspices of the city council or under, you know, the auspices of the mayor, which is what it seems to be like

607
00:55:19,035 --> 00:55:22,816
right now, so I'm a little bit confused.

608
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:26,576
Yeah, I don't know who does the audit now.

609
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:33,418
Well, there hasn't been one done for years because of the mayor's office for years upon years.

610
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:40,619
I like the idea of the city council having control of two things, the city clerk and the audit, you know?

611
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:44,600
And the reason being is, okay, the mayor's

612
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:50,714
They're in too much working with all these departments.

613
00:55:50,754 --> 00:56:06,083
I'd rather have the city council, as an independent, bringing in an auditor for all the in-house stuff, instead of the mayor, who has control of all the in-house stuff, not pointing any fingers at any mayor at all, just to keep it on the up and up.

614
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:08,805
That's been my philosophy for years.

615
00:56:09,668 --> 00:56:13,631
Yeah, I mean, there definitely has an audit has been done every year.

616
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:14,312
I'm sure of that.

617
00:56:15,132 --> 00:56:17,994
It's been an in-house audit.

618
00:56:19,636 --> 00:56:21,577
I thought there was an outside audit done every year.

619
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:25,040
No, I don't think it's been done in years.

620
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,174
Well, anyway, so Maury, I agree with Maury.

621
00:56:31,214 --> 00:56:39,741
I think that, I think it's, this is something that city council, that, you know, could be under the purview of the city council.

622
00:56:40,502 --> 00:56:49,070
And we also have a line in here that says, at least every three years, the city council should conduct a competitive procurement process to retain these auditing services, which I think,

623
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:56,670
could potentially prevent them from just automatically using the same firm every year.

624
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:01,017
It doesn't mean they can't use the same firm, but they're gonna have to sort of analyze that.

625
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:03,440
They're gonna have to put it out to bid.

626
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:04,754
Basically.

627
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:05,014
Right.

628
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:07,776
Which, you know, which I think is it makes sense.

629
00:57:09,116 --> 00:57:27,844
I think having things under the city council, you know, it talks a bit about that balance of power that Jean was talking about earlier and it provides, you know, some checks and balances and, you know, like Maury says, not to point fingers, um, you know, or pass dispersions on anybody.

630
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:32,526
But I think always having a fresh set of eyes where the money is concerned, um,

631
00:57:34,514 --> 00:57:35,435
is never a bad thing.

632
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:37,356
Yeah, definitely.

633
00:57:38,097 --> 00:57:38,597
I agree.

634
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:46,503
Okay, so I think that this is in pretty good shape and I feel like, you know, we do have that.

635
00:57:46,723 --> 00:57:49,005
Is it okay if I resolve this comment, Eunice?

636
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:50,927
Do you feel like we resolved it?

637
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:53,368
Say yes.

638
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:54,209
Yeah.

639
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:55,870
Okay.

640
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:57,432
Yes, boss.

641
00:57:58,535 --> 00:58:07,598
We still have that one, we're leaving 45 days in, but we still, we just have that one question, which we're going to get answered just to find out if maybe we're understanding it correctly.

642
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:13,760
And I'll send out, we can resolve this, I think.

643
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:26,424
I'll send out minutes and then we'll bring the budget amendment issue to the April 18th meeting.

644
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:26,765
Yeah.

645
00:58:31,223 --> 00:58:31,784
So thank you.

646
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,086
I think we did a good job in this.

647
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:35,667
There's a lot in this.

648
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,588
There's been a lot of input, a lot of thought.

649
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:42,952
And let the rest of the committee take a look at it and see how they feel.

650
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:44,453
And we go from there.

651
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,175
Yeah, that's great.

652
00:58:46,635 --> 00:58:47,616
You did a good job on this.

653
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:48,497
Nice job, you guys.

654
00:58:48,637 --> 00:58:49,477
Thanks, everybody.

655
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:56,323
I want to see if there's any members of the public that want to share, have comments.

656
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,981
want to speak on any of these issues?

657
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:04,102
Okay.

658
00:59:04,522 --> 00:59:12,685
So, while we're ahead of schedule, but... I'll take it.

659
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:16,046
So tomorrow night we are doing what?

660
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,606
We're doing two and three?

661
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:19,687
That's what's on the agenda.

662
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:21,608
Articles two and three and seven.

663
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:30,355
And the Collins Center is hopefully going to, they were putting together a memo and I don't know.

664
00:59:30,615 --> 00:59:31,476
Anyway, they're going to be there.

665
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:37,638
Do they have, Nova, do they already have all the stuff that we've worked on as committees?

666
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:41,580
Are we doing it with our body first before they get their hands on it?

667
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,480
They don't have everything.

668
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:48,163
They do have articles two and three, but I don't know how much, I don't know how much time they take.

669
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:56,647
I mean, in the end, they're going to look at the document and some of it, maybe they'll even draft, we don't know yet.

670
00:59:58,308 --> 01:00:00,449
You know, so the sections we haven't looked at yet.

671
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:17,598
But they'll look at it and they'll, you know, I mean, I feel like they're pretty helpful, even on the preamble, just little things like changing, you know, the state of Massachusetts to the Commonwealth, just little things like that, that, like making sure we use the right language and things like that.

672
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:22,484
So they'll help us with that.

673
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,885
2, 3, and 7 tomorrow.

674
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:31,569
On the 18th, we'll do 4 and 8 and any cleanup that we have from 2, 3, and 7 left over.

675
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:37,392
That's the whole.

676
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:41,595
2, 3, 4, and 6 is still hanging out there in midair.

677
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:49,667
Now, if we have time tomorrow, we can clean up the questions and have the whole committee move forward with it.

678
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,028
Yeah, no, this is six.

679
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:58,512
What we haven't worked on is one, five, nine, and 10, right?

680
01:01:01,893 --> 01:01:12,139
So we'll talk about that tomorrow and see how people- Let's put a committee together to see how much it entails and what we can, see if we can't bang out two or three of them all together or something like that.

681
01:01:12,611 --> 01:01:19,277
Yeah, we'll see what kind of availability people have for any more subcommittees tomorrow.

682
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:20,298
Sounds good.

683
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,000
All right.

684
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:23,221
Thank you.

685
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:24,542
We're in good shape.

686
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:25,443
All right.

687
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:26,224
Take care.

688
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:27,986
Someone move to adjourn?

689
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,468
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

690
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:31,329
Second.

691
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:32,553
Great.

692
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:33,434
All in favor?

693
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:35,396
We're all in favor, too, Nova.

694
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:36,737
Oh, wait.

695
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:37,438
You know what?

696
01:01:37,638 --> 01:01:43,964
I feel bad because we made this motion, but we didn't accept the minutes, Maury, because Gene couldn't

697
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:46,168
vote on them.

698
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:49,090
I mean, she didn't want to make the motion because she missed the last meeting.

699
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:54,114
So before we adjourn, can we look at the minutes from last?

700
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:55,375
Absolutely.

701
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:56,596
Yeah.

702
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,557
I had a chance to review them, go over them.

703
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:02,640
I thought everything was in working order and everything we've done.

704
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,162
So I'll make a motion to approve.

705
01:02:04,902 --> 01:02:05,202
Second.

706
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:07,084
All in favor?

707
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:08,165
Aye.

708
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:09,206
Okay, great.

709
01:02:09,306 --> 01:02:12,388
So that means I can send them to the city and have them posted.

710
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:13,689
Yes.

711
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:14,410
Okay.

712
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:16,217
Awesome.

713
01:02:17,164 --> 01:02:19,781
And we already made the motion to adjourn, so we're good on that.

714
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:23,003
So I will see you all tomorrow.
