1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:10,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome everyone to the April 3rd, 2024 meeting of the Chartered Study Committee, Article 6 Subcommittee, i.e.

2
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,558
[SPEAKER_03]: the section on financial procedures.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Maury may be joining us.

4
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully he will, but he wasn't sure he had another meeting.

5
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:23,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first item on the agenda is the minutes.

6
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Move approval.

7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:29,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm abstaining.

9
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:30,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't here.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,780
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I can second.

12
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I second?

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I can't.

14
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:39,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

15
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We can probably table them until next time.

16
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:42,883
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

17
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:46,284
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll table them until next time or until Maury gets here.

18
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:48,565
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

19
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:49,205
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

20
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I forgot to bring the agenda down.

21
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really sorry, guys.

22
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:04,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were going to talk about the issue of the budget ordinance.

23
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:05,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, amendment.

24
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:10,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

25
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:13,714
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that... There's one that passed, right?

26
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:14,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like a timeline.

27
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:22,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the ordinance is still not officially passed, but it's being finalized, as I understand it.

28
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:30,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ordinance would be- Yeah, according to their first reading and the second reading, it should pass later this month.

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

30
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much a done deal.

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, go ahead, Jean.

32
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:41,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, is that the one you mean, or the one that was sent to the mayor, which he sent to us?

33
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:50,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the charter amendment, which we talked about at our full committee meeting last time and voted to not accept.

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had wanted to re-raise it, so that's-

35
00:01:54,787 --> 00:02:01,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so I think first I want to make sure I understand what happened like the history.

36
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:04,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was.

37
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:06,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So, did that.

38
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:12,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the amendment that would have allowed city council to move money.

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,781
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding.

40
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:14,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

41
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:20,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they vote in favor of it and send it to the mayor who did not sign it?

42
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what happened?

43
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I understand.

44
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so city council, was it unanimous?

45
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was one no.

46
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:38,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that initially it was unanimous and then it turned 6-1.

47
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you recall, Eunice?

48
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:48,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recall one way or the other, but I'm just thinking that amendment would have been the prior council.

49
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:50,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.

50
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:58,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And the vote tabulation on that council was quite often four to three.

51
00:02:59,436 --> 00:02:59,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

52
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:04,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus the tabulation on this council, which is generally six to one.

53
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:11,519
[SPEAKER_03]: For these amendments, they were unanimous, and then Adam Knight changed and ultimately voted no.

54
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:12,599
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I remember.

55
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:13,279
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a near unanimous city council, even though it's a prior city council.

57
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted this power, sent it to the mayor.

58
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going through my thinking with everyone.

59
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent it to the mayor who said, I'm not going to sign it.

60
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:36,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like the Charter Study Committee to review it and consider it as part of the charter, whether it made sense.

61
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was thinking about that, I feel like I understand where most people are with

62
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,775
[SPEAKER_02]: this amendment and that their vote may not change.

63
00:03:50,436 --> 00:04:08,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet I feel like we should do our due diligence on researching it because it seems, I don't want to say disrespectful, I can't think of the right word, to not do due diligence on it and actually consider it since that is what

64
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:22,213
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor said we would do so that was we just so what I was envisioning and I'm volunteering myself for this, even though I seem to have perhaps taken on too much recently.

65
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:26,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize was just looking into like, why.

66
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the reasoning behind why most cities don't do this?

67
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Do other states allow cities to do this?

68
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Because our state and federal government, the legislative body, has this power.

69
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:49,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And then research how it's going in cities in Massachusetts that have this authority with city council.

70
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:50,338
[SPEAKER_02]: There is only one.

71
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:50,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Boston?

72
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I already researched that a little bit.

74
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what that's my thinking is I just feel like.

75
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we didn't really even consider it.

76
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, we need to say what we looked at and why we made our decision, but.

77
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

78
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:17,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so I hear you and thank you for offering to do the research.

79
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:22,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel, and we can't do it tomorrow night because I didn't put it on the agenda, but we are still meeting on April 18th.

80
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:22,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like

81
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: we have to go back to the whole committee before we pay that step?

82
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that in the minutes, yeah.

83
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:32,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just because, you know, because the committee already voted.

84
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:46,561
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and we did look at this when we talked about it at the committee meeting, which is the state law, which may be one of the main reasons cities don't do it because it's,

85
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: says state law says they can't, but doesn't mean a special act couldn't get by.

86
00:05:54,405 --> 00:06:01,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, it exempts Boston in any city other than Boston.

87
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And where's the part that says, the city council may by majority vote make appropriations for the purposes recommended and may reduce or reject any amount recommended in the annual budget

88
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:24,595
[SPEAKER_03]: It shall not increase any amount in or the total of the annual budget nor add there to any amount for a purpose not included there and except on recommendation of the mayor.

89
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:32,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a little bit of a different procedure for the school committee or there could be as I understand it.

90
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,775
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like this is pretty clear.

91
00:06:38,795 --> 00:07:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that the reasoning was that we, that putting something in the charter that could potentially be, it could be rejected by the state because they could say it's in conflict with the state.

92
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:03,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, obviously,

93
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:09,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a special act, so theoretically the state could say, okay.

94
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:21,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But the advisability of including something in the charter that's clear, I mean, it's pretty clear, that statute.

95
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:27,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So that I thought, to me, that was the reasoning why we didn't do it.

96
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:33,378
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you feel strongly, we can go back to the committee and see

97
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,947
[SPEAKER_03]: if they want to keep looking into it.

98
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you look at Boston?

99
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:46,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did a little Google, just like how is it going in Boston.

100
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:55,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Boston has a huge, well, it's under a million, but people.

101
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Budget probably.

102
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: is 20 times Medford budget or more.

103
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:11,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're different, I think, than Medford and other cities and towns.

104
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:15,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done two budget cycles with this process, as I understand it.

105
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,462
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first cycle, they were late.

107
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a messy process.

108
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:26,068
[SPEAKER_02]: The second cycle seems like it was less messy.

109
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:41,954
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah yeah and i i don't completely understand the reasoning behind it like i don't know why city council can't move money around

110
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:58,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I read about it, some of the arguments that people made were there was concern about sort of like kind of hordes trading, you know, that the, well, OK, you know, between the city councilors, it just makes a much messier process.

111
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:00,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

112
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,118
[SPEAKER_01]: What did the Cohen Center folks say to us?

113
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:02,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we remember?

114
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they just they were just advising us about the state law mostly.

115
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:16,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I don't know that they would, I don't know, maybe they would be willing to say whether they think it's a good idea.

116
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They usually kind of, I mean, they might.

117
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:19,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

118
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:31,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if somebody, who at the state level, what office would be the one to talk to?

119
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:37,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, would Donato know?

120
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.

121
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
[SPEAKER_03]: What would we ask him?

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the legislature made that the law, why?

123
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know how long the law, let's see, can you tell in the, do they indicate in the MDL how long, you know, when they passed?

124
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how old the law is.

125
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:03,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

126
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, if you can.

127
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:07,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

128
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:14,922
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm saying is, depending on when the law was passed, he may not actually know.

129
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

130
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,585
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't around when it was passed.

131
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:19,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

132
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:23,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.

133
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,267
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of all sides of this coin.

134
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:40,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the conversation that we had within the whole group was sort of to reject it fairly quickly because it does go against state law that Boston is the only one that does it.

135
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a relatively new thing for them.

136
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you report, Jean, the first time around was messy.

137
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:51,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you could argue that the first time for anything is messy.

138
00:10:53,507 --> 00:11:01,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I see your point two of the mayor handed it to us.

139
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:09,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should give it its due diligence that she expects of us.

140
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the other thought that I have is that this originated from the city council and

141
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:45,780
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it, so if we're going to reject it, which I'm pretty sure that that's the direction I'm still continuing to go on my vote, is that we need to settle it once and for all with good, solid, factual backup to put it to bed.

142
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:47,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

143
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:51,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say, I'm leaning towards not approving it also.

144
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:56,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just, did we do our due diligence, I guess is the question.

145
00:11:57,774 --> 00:12:06,558
[SPEAKER_03]: My feeling is that we did, but if there's ambivalence, or we can look back at it.

146
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jean, if you're willing to look into it more.

147
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:24,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how the process went in Boston is probably going to also be subjective, just because I know there was one member who talked about even how it went in Boston this year and felt that it was messy.

148
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's different.

149
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts that people will have about that.

150
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:38,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, there may be fiscal concerns that states and the federal government don't have, right?

151
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:46,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, Massachusetts, the state has been late on its state budget, multiple years in a row.

152
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:54,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and yet the, that is the system they have set up that the legislature, the governor,

153
00:12:57,162 --> 00:13:02,244
[SPEAKER_02]: bargain and the two houses in the legislature have to come to a conference.

154
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:15,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just don't understand why cities and towns are different, but maybe it's the financial rating system is different or the reserves for a state are different than the city.

155
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,033
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might be nice to just know some of that.

156
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:20,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

157
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:38,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to me, there's an inherent difference between the state house, which is the legislative bodies in the state house represent communities all over the state, whereas when you have an individual city, there's just everybody's in the same city.

158
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like you're bringing different viewpoints from across the state.

159
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one city.

160
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:55,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the other thing is the way the ordinance is written, if I understand it correctly, and I think I'm correct on this is that so right now, if.

161
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:09,391
[SPEAKER_03]: the city council doesn't really have power to reject the mayor's budget because there's this one, then they do a one 12 budget and then within a certain amount of time, the mayor's budget is in place.

162
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I know that that upsets them.

163
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:19,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the other thing is, I mean, this was put forth by the city council and it's about giving them more power.

164
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:24,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like there's a certain bias in the creation of it, but,

165
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:34,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ordinance, I mean, the amendment would basically make it so that they could move the money, they could change it.

166
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:39,092
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing they can't do is they can't increase the overall amount.

167
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:46,759
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they send it to the mayor and if the mayor sends it back, they can just overrule that with a two-thirds vote.

168
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, that just takes

169
00:14:52,243 --> 00:15:04,770
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot away from the executive, which, you know, and I know that people talk about balance of power and that they think the balance of power needs to change, but at the same time, people want a mayor council form of government.

170
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what a mayor council form of government is.

171
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:17,137
[SPEAKER_03]: In every community in Massachusetts that has a mayor council government, the balance of power is the way it is in Medford, because that's what a mayor council government is.

172
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:27,721
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want that form of government, then that's sort of where we are.

173
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:33,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless we want to try to buck state law and see if it makes it through.

174
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:41,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm the person that said we shouldn't do too many big things or it might not get passed.

175
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:44,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realize I'm the person that's been saying that.

176
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:58,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I also are there other ways of because we did hear from a lot of residents that they want a better balance of power so I feel like by not.

177
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:03,225
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the ways of balancing power is there.

178
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:17,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way to change that process that you just mentioned where, you know, say they reject the budget, like is there a way to change that?

179
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way to give them a little more, I guess, power in the process?

180
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:27,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also- In the budget, you're talking about the budget process specifically.

181
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, either,

182
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:35,585
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know we're setting up timelines because that has always been a complaint that they get the budget last minute.

183
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:48,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there like, you know, even like early in January having a meeting that

184
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:55,020
[SPEAKER_02]: They put their priorities on the table.

185
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, just setting up, even though they have no, like, is there a way they could just say, here are our priorities?

186
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:04,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the city says, here's our revenue.

187
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Our revenue is not what we thought.

188
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:14,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, even though they didn't put fully, they do have forecasts and they have pictures and they're just forcing them to collaborate more, I guess.

189
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:24,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of that is going in the budget ordinance, but I think that I feel like is shifting our discussion to our actual draft document.

190
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's fine if we do that.

191
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to wrap up this particular topic.

192
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:44,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So and understand the conclusion, which is that we're going to bring it back to the whole committee and see and just talk about and say that Jean is willing to research it so that we can have more information

193
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:45,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

194
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:53,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and are we saying that we want to reopen it for another future vote or that we're just collecting more information?

195
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:58,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Maury.

196
00:17:59,521 --> 00:17:59,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Maury.

197
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:01,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Maury.

198
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:08,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe we should open it for a future vote.

199
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:09,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.

200
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:09,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry I'm late.

201
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:10,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another meeting.

202
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:11,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.

203
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're here because I have to leave in a few minutes.

204
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:21,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe we don't have to say that.

205
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:27,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can just see if the committee is willing to reopen it for more information.

206
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:33,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let when the information is received, there can be a decision on whether people want to.

207
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know what I mean?

208
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:36,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

209
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.

210
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

211
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Research on this, like maybe I don't know.

212
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it will be interesting to see if there was, but okay.

213
00:18:47,784 --> 00:19:03,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, so Maury and I went to talk to the chief financial officer and the chief of staff, and it was a good meeting.

214
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:11,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first item, Jean, is something similar to what you were saying, although it's not in January.

215
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:16,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

216
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,961
[SPEAKER_03]: For the blind among us.

217
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:21,603
[SPEAKER_03]: There is that good.

218
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:21,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

219
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:23,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

220
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:33,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, you know, basically what we had done was we had a bunch of, we had timelines that we thought seemed reasonable, but we wanted to make sure that they were.

221
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:45,345
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were actually doable and talk to people who actually do the job so that we knew for sure that we weren't proposing something that wasn't feasible.

222
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So this annual budget meeting is along the lines of what we've been talking about.

223
00:19:50,909 --> 00:20:03,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It requires a joint meeting of all the branches of government before the commencement of the budget process to review the financial condition of the city, revenue and expenditure forecasts, and other relevant information.

224
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we had, well, we had talked about the window, right?

225
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:15,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So no later, it's, you have to like, July 1st is the beginning of the fiscal year, so.

226
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:20,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So no later than 60 days is, yeah, so it's between March and May.

227
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:29,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it was, one of the things that we heard when we talked to Nina and the CFO is,

228
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:42,970
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's a date in the budget ordinance, which is not finalized yet, but it's in the works, to supply numbers to the school committee and that this date could sort of run into that.

229
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:50,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for instance, they were saying, well, so the two potential ways to fix that

230
00:20:51,251 --> 00:21:01,959
[SPEAKER_03]: potential problem is to just make it no later than 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year or making the no earlier than a little later.

231
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, a little later.

232
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So changing that to 100 days.

233
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:09,185
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 days, right, exactly.

234
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are people's thoughts?

235
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:15,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to give them a window, so.

236
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know,

237
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:33,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They can have it as early as they want if we say no later than, but so, you know, it's not like it doesn't preclude them from having it earlier if they wanted to or if they were able to.

238
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I like giving them the flexibility to say no later than.

239
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:43,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying no later than.

240
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:47,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they want to meet earlier, they can.

241
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,703
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's the charter.

242
00:21:54,223 --> 00:22:12,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but, Gene, my thoughts on that was when we talked about a window and so forth, and was that you don't want them to hold this meeting in November or December when they're only five or six months into the fiscal year, that they don't have any really hard numbers.

243
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,237
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of where we came up there.

244
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:19,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.

245
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So correct me if I'm wrong.

246
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:28,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And our discussion with them is that they kind of like the 100 day thing of shortening a little bit.

247
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:37,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I kind of like I like the window myself want to hold their feet to the fire and come back in November when they are any time they want.

248
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:43,976
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's 60 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year that

249
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,618
[SPEAKER_00]: they hold the meeting and they don't have any hardcore numbers.

250
00:22:49,859 --> 00:23:02,243
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't gone through any tough times during the year, only six months into the program or four or five months into the program, yet they've met the obligation of having the meeting.

251
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:10,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure they have a meeting that they're able to say, okay, this is where we're at for this year that we're in.

252
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:14,927
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my only thought process on the window.

253
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, and one of the I my thought is that another reason that the window came up is because there has been so much talk about, you know, starting the budget process earlier.

254
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we've learned is that

255
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:42,897
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can't really have it much before March because there's just not, you know, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be useful because there's really not information, you know, there's not reliable information.

256
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:48,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, so I feel like that, that putting in the window was kind of a response to that.

257
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:53,867
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, the charter is the charter and it's,

258
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:57,580
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's enshrined, right?

259
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:10,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Theoretically, we're gonna put a regular charter review in, but leaving it general and putting in flexibility, there's something to be said for that.

260
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:11,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Jean?

261
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,395
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense to me, Maury.

262
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:21,861
[SPEAKER_02]: What you said is that you wanna give a window that's where the numbers are firmer.

263
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there could be something that says nothing precludes earlier meetings to share budget forecasts.

264
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:47,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know like when I worked in state government and you're halfway in, they knew if revenue was down much earlier than, you know, so there'd often be nine C cuts or things because they didn't have the revenue.

265
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:52,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, is there a way that people can all be on the same page if they, I don't know,

266
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:02,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this isn't how city works, but I know that state government, they often know when their tax revenue is much lower than anticipated.

267
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that this would preclude any meetings.

268
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:15,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like this only says that the mayor has to call an annual budget meeting in this window or before.

269
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:15,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

270
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:16,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

271
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,096
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my reading of it.

272
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:21,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say that they can't call other meetings.

273
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,457
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't say that to me, but Eunice.

274
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:38,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, that's kind of what I was getting at in our last meeting and some other conversations where I suggested something in January and I've also suggested that.

275
00:25:41,205 --> 00:26:00,685
[SPEAKER_01]: we put something in there and perhaps it goes in a different place under the school committee and the legislative and executive, all three, where the three branches of government get together at some regular interval and just talk about how things are going.

276
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:11,272
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as I said before, that some of the issues within the school system, you know, might not have come to a head if.

277
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:23,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously anything that's going on in the schools, the mayor knows because she's at the school committee meetings as part of her role, but it leaves the city council in the dark.

278
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:38,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if all three branches of government had a regular schedule of collaboration, they might not do a deep dive into the budget, but at least they'll have a clue about what's going on so that

279
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,864
[SPEAKER_01]: budget stuff is not as much of a big surprise.

280
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:48,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can do the deep dive into the budget, you know, during this March through May meeting that we're talking about.

281
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:55,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you say talking, when you're talking about these regular required meetings, you're talking about them in relationship to the budget.

282
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:56,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

283
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:11,843
[SPEAKER_01]: A meeting in January could possibly be more of a deeper dive into a budget, but I think there has to be better collaboration amongst the three branches regardless.

284
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:25,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, I believe that in, we're going to look at articles two and three tomorrow, but I believe there were some things in there about the city council and the mayor being able to

285
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:32,216
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, compel attendance at meetings.

286
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, that actually came up last night, to some degree, so.

287
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we'll look at that.

288
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:50,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond the budget, I guess I can't think of any reason why the city council and the school committee have to meet.

289
00:27:51,497 --> 00:28:01,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the only... The city council approves the budget, but they don't really have anything else to do with the business of the school committee.

290
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

291
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I missing something?

292
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,880
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not.

293
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,981
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not missing something.

294
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:17,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as has been said many times, it's the city council where it's the people's forum, where people come to, you know, feel heard.

295
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:26,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm suggesting, you know, that there be more collaboration amongst the three branches.

296
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that can be with the budget.

297
00:28:28,713 --> 00:28:28,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

298
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:33,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, Eunice, if I'm hearing you right, it's more kind of like,

299
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:57,500
[SPEAKER_00]: the three bodies getting together in an informal type session where it's the state of the city address between themselves and what kind of condition they're in and what their needs are to stop me maybe laying the groundwork out for the upcoming budget of, we're going to need this, we're going to need that, and how do we work together to formulate that?

300
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a perfect world.

301
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:03,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so sure you're going to see that here, but I agree with that.

302
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:09,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully this annual budget meeting would be in that direction.

303
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:11,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Jean?

304
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:16,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's open meeting things.

305
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:22,205
[SPEAKER_02]: If the bodies meet, they have to just keep that in mind.

306
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

307
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:29,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Which sometimes makes it harder for them to work together when they're on a stage.

308
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:57,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious whether other cities have anything in their budget part of the charter that, because I think some of it is, some of the stress around the budget has been that people were caught off guard when revenue was so low and there were significant cuts and they had no time to plan from the city council or school committee side.

309
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:03,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there, do any cities ask for forecast updates?

310
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:11,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe the city or the CFO, and maybe this already happens, but is there a way to?

311
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:13,769
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of forecasts?

312
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:23,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like where they are with revenue, just sharing on a quarterly basis how expenditures and revenue are going.

313
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,159
[SPEAKER_03]: But like orderly reports.

314
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm making this up here.

315
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm just wondering if any other cities.

316
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:42,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I haven't studied carefully the budget ordinance, but I do believe there was something in there about orderly reports.

317
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:48,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Eunice, you've looked at it probably more carefully than I.

318
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:49,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it right in front of me.

319
00:30:49,965 --> 00:31:00,848
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 of the 1 of the biggest complaints over the last couple of years that the city council has put forth is that they're not getting something called the warrant articles.

320
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:06,230
[SPEAKER_01]: The warrant articles apparently are like the monthly bills and so.

321
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,131
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what money's going out for what?

322
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:12,071
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

323
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:20,969
[SPEAKER_01]: They've put something in here where quarterly financial reports and meetings.

324
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:29,515
[SPEAKER_01]: The finance director will provide a written report regarding the city's finances to the council on a quarterly basis, no later than 60 days.

325
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:34,618
[SPEAKER_01]: After the end of each quarter, the report shall contain the following.

326
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:40,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Previous quarters accounts payable warrants by month, year to date budget to actuals,

327
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:50,683
[SPEAKER_01]: where available updates on state certifications, revenue forecasts, spending forecasts, and any other information the finance director deems relevant.

328
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's your forecasts, Jean.

329
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:53,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.

330
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,046
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good to me.

331
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:55,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.

332
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:56,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

333
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:00,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So going into the ordinance, which is due to pass momentarily.

334
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:18,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference between whatever ordinance gets passed and the charter is that the, you know, a charter by nature should be more general because it's a lot harder to change and it doesn't tend to, charters don't tend to go into those kinds of details.

335
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

336
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know,

337
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:32,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Because whatever process is outlined in the charter, it's there until you change the charter again.

338
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,230
[SPEAKER_02]: In Medford's case.

339
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

340
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:36,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the truth.

341
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,172
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

342
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's good to know that's in the ordinance, I think.

343
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:44,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

344
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:45,274
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

345
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and what we heard from the CFO and the chief of staff is that, you know, they're both.

346
00:32:55,255 --> 00:33:02,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's an example of the I feel is the collaboration that we've been talking about that they've worked with the city council to come up with.

347
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:15,788
[SPEAKER_03]: to agree on this ordinance and that they're, even though they don't, it's not passed yet, they're actually trying to do it this year anyway, just because they actually, you know, they want to see if it works well also.

348
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that...

349
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:20,108
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already started it.

350
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:27,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the council came up with their priorities and it forwarded them to the mayor.

351
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: The first set of budget meetings is Wednesday, April 17th, with the second set being, I believe, May 1st.

352
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,542
[SPEAKER_01]: There will probably be one or two others after that.

353
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:56,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they haven't, I don't think they have this annual budget meeting that we're proposing, and this wasn't actually in all the, well, I mean, of the three charters that we got from the Collins Center, I think this was only in Melrose.

354
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you remember?

355
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

356
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but, you know, I think it's a good idea.

357
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:07,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And do we remember what the timeframe was in Melrose?

358
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:11,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was, they didn't have a window, they just said no later than.

359
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just said no later than.

360
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:18,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the reason for making it May

361
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:23,115
[SPEAKER_03]: was just because it's the charter and it's, you know, so enshrined.

362
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:35,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there happened to be a year where just for whatever reason, it was just difficult to get the budget process going before that, I don't know, like maybe a pandemic or something, I don't know.

363
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:41,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But that we just wanted to, that flexibility, wanted to build in that flexibility.

364
00:34:43,793 --> 00:35:04,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think going back to the original point, I think doing the window of 100 days to 60 days, as Maury said, that forces them to do something within a period of time where they actually have concrete, relevant information, rather than going through the motions and checking the box and saying, oh, yeah, we did that last November.

365
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:08,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

366
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is all going to get run by the whole committee too.

367
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:25,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can keep these timeframes in yellow because when we send it to the committee, I mean, those are the parts that we want them to pay special attention to are the timeframes.

368
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:31,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can keep them in yellow and then people can ask, well, why did you pick those numbers?

369
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:32,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be able to tell them.

370
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:40,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, you know, the feedback from, you know, Nina and Bob Dickinson, I think is really good because that gives us.

371
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:50,436
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it's 1 thing looking at, you know, charters of other communities and things, but the key always is to remember, is it going to work in Mount in Medford?

372
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:53,218
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Medford and now we know.

373
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:55,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think the reason they.

374
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,006
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, I believe they said the date for providing some sort of.

375
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:09,513
[SPEAKER_03]: financial information to the school committee was like March 1st, something like that.

376
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:23,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right around, and they were- It was right around the beginning of March and so forth, so they needed like an extra month of time to put the numbers together and so forth, because their budget takes up so much of the entire budget, if I correct.

377
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, exactly.

378
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:25,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

379
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So they thought that, you know, if

380
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:36,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping this particular meeting sort of after the time when the school committee would get those numbers would be more useful.

381
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:37,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

382
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:39,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we started the window.

383
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:42,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were great, by the way.

384
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:50,952
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so cordial and so helpful and so obliging to what we're, Milford handled 90% of it.

385
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:53,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there to be there.

386
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:55,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that.

387
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,719
[SPEAKER_00]: You were there to look pretty, Maury.

388
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,081
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Maury was participant.

389
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:03,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

390
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:03,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're good.

391
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We're comfortable with this.

392
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:13,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, you know, I mean, there may be other things that people, other members of the committee think of when we talk about it, but I'll just leave it in yellow.

393
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:14,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes sense.

394
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:21,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I had made a comment at the very, very, yeah.

395
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:29,177
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, under the title, you know, is this provide, you know, applying to school committee as well?

396
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:36,217
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or are they gonna do their own, are we talking about an article four?

397
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they wouldn't do their own budget stuff in article four.

398
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:50,109
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee budget process is probably one of those, another one, I mean, so much of what the school committee does is outlined in state law, right?

399
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe they actually have to have a budget hearing as well.

400
00:37:56,053 --> 00:37:58,654
[SPEAKER_01]: which is something a little bit different.

401
00:37:58,674 --> 00:38:08,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the school committee budget meeting at five o'clock and they alluded to that, that they've already got their schedule.

402
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:19,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you suggest that maybe there's something to go in here with a directive to the school committee?

403
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, yeah.

404
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:27,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I think wherever anything can be ambiguous,

405
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:36,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, we need to make clear what does or does not apply to the school committee.

406
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:43,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this, you know, the budget for the entire city or is this the city council piece of the budget or is this?

407
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:51,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the budget, this is talking about the city budget of which the school committee is budget is a part, right?

408
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:56,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean,

409
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:08,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's separate it is a it is a quote unquote separate budget, but it's it's a it's one part of the city budget and this is about the city, but.

410
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:12,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so so that's how I see it.

411
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:16,422
[SPEAKER_01]: We we refer to the school committee, you know.

412
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:43,273
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically so as we move through I think I just want to keep that in mind that you know this says it shall include this this it does actually you know when this mayor submits the budget it shall include the school department so it does it does it does have that specificity in it okay so that's excuse me as you know last night was another late night um

413
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:51,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so yeah, so this is what it's saying is, you know, it basically needs to be numbers and a narrative.

414
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:56,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes for everybody.

415
00:39:57,484 --> 00:39:57,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

416
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:03,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And this says it shall be submitted by June 1st?

417
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:03,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

418
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:14,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it could be submitted earlier, but June 1st is the deadline.

419
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:17,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the budget ordinance says May 31st.

420
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's one day different.

421
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

422
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:24,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we okay?

423
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:26,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't put, Jean, go ahead.

424
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:29,970
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just have to I have to go.

425
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

426
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:32,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm sorry, Jean.

427
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll be seeing this again with the whole committee.

428
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:35,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

429
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:36,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.

430
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:37,638
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole meeting.

431
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:38,258
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

432
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:38,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

433
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:39,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

434
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, Maury.

435
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:40,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

436
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:47,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still all okay with the 30 days.

437
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I put this in yellow too?

438
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:57,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it's... No, it's in 30 days before the beginning of the... If we're putting all the timelines in yellow to sort of highlight them to the whole committee?

439
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:57,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

440
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,606
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole committee, sure.

441
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'll just...

442
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:18,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then do we get, basically, this was another, you know, I feel like we could take this out of yellow because, well, you know, we did talk to Nina and the CFO about this a little bit, right?

443
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:22,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said- Yeah, go ahead.

444
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Maury, go ahead.

445
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:33,707
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were just saying how they know what's in there and they were, when Nina said we went through the publications, they were advised basically to go through the Boston Heralds.

446
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

447
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:42,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That counts as a local news publication.

448
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:49,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason, as I was looking through this today, that's the reason I called the city clerk today.

449
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, Eunice?

450
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Eunice just get cut off?

451
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:04,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Odysseus.

452
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Eunice, we missed you.

453
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:09,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

454
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:10,797
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

455
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:17,820
[SPEAKER_03]: We stopped hearing you after you said, that's the reason I went to the city clerk today.

456
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.

457
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so he publicizes things in what's called the Medford Transcript slash Somerville Journal.

458
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:27,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

459
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:29,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

460
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:31,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's those little classified ads.

461
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:39,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally, he will use the Globe or the Herald, which is significantly more expensive, he told me.

462
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:41,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.

463
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:44,277
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a time crunch or something like that.

464
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:49,440
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said to him, what do other communities do?

465
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is this a requirement from?

466
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:56,884
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't really,

467
00:42:58,602 --> 00:43:11,448
[SPEAKER_01]: there was no clarity on, you know, is this, you know, it's not coming from the charter or we would know that, but it's not, he didn't know if it was coming from state law as well.

468
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:13,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta be state law.

469
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:19,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they're doing it because they have to, it's gotta be state law, because it's not in our current charter.

470
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:23,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I just said, you know, I mean, with the fact that,

471
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:31,782
[SPEAKER_01]: most local publications have gone the way of the dinosaur, they're left with the Globe and the Herald.

472
00:43:31,802 --> 00:43:47,859
[SPEAKER_01]: But there doesn't seem to be anything coming from up above to get rid of this, because newspapers are vanishing.

473
00:43:50,677 --> 00:43:52,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

474
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:56,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least we know that it's not a problem.

475
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,282
[SPEAKER_03]: They can deal with this one way or another.

476
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:04,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good anyway.

477
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:11,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Maury, on this section, I wrote, we still have questions on this.

478
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:17,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you say what you understood about this when we talked about Nina?

479
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:24,856
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of ambiguous because the 45 days goes to like June 1st through July 15th.

480
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:28,578
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the fiscal year, you're already five days.

481
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:29,879
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I heard, Melba.

482
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:30,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you did.

483
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're 15 days into the next,

484
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:35,421
[SPEAKER_00]: fiscal year.

485
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:39,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I'm confused by all this language.

486
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:59,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were trying to, we were trying to, so if the deadline for submitting the budget, I mean, yeah, for submitting the budget is June 1st, then 45 days later would be July 15th, which is after the deadline, right, the deadline of June 30th.

487
00:44:59,112 --> 00:44:59,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So

488
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:07,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we weren't really sure what to do about this.

489
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:11,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And this number came from another charter, right?

490
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:12,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

491
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:12,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

492
00:45:13,204 --> 00:45:13,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

493
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:22,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to, I actually want to kind of look back and see if all three of the charters had the same language, the same language.

494
00:45:23,374 --> 00:45:24,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

495
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,096
[SPEAKER_01]: This is article what?

496
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:29,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Article six.

497
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:45,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what this is saying, or how I interpret it, if they have it until May 31st or June 1st to submit the budget, and then this goes back 45 days after the budget is in there, and the fiscal year starts on July 1st,

498
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,032
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a time frame.

499
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:55,897
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the smartest person in the world, but there's a time frame in there that doesn't make sense to me.

500
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

501
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:59,000
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong somewhere.

502
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Melrose says 45.

503
00:46:02,082 --> 00:46:03,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you, Eunice.

504
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:03,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking.

505
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:04,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Melrose says 45.

506
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:06,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they all do, I think.

507
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:07,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Pittsburgh says 45.

508
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,240
[SPEAKER_01]: are friends in Weymouth.

509
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,001
[SPEAKER_00]: They say 45 also.

510
00:46:22,941 --> 00:46:36,065
[SPEAKER_00]: All three comparison charters that we've been kind of building eyes on and taking the good points and the bad points and learning things from them, I believe they all say 45 days.

511
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Weymouth says 90.

512
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, well, that's even later.

513
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:43,748
[SPEAKER_01]: That throws a wrench into things.

514
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:54,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I feel like, you know, we're going to have to ask, I mean, there's got to be a reason that people are saying 45 is.

515
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:55,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

516
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're saying.

517
00:46:56,677 --> 00:47:03,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should maybe, maybe the Collins Center can help us understand that.

518
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:07,185
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a good question for them, though.

519
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:07,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

520
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:09,747
[SPEAKER_00]: When they do it, they should be able to say,

521
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:21,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the other thing that I don't understand about this language, though, it doesn't, it says adoption of the budget.

522
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:37,303
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been years that the budget in this city has been adopted 15 minutes before the stroke of midnight for July 1st.

523
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:43,979
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I don't understand.

524
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,481
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it didn't come down until June 28th that it gets adopted?

525
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:52,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're into what, June?

526
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:59,645
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be into August if the 45 days following the date the budget is filed with the city clerk in amending.

527
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:04,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is saying 45 days following the date the budget is filed.

528
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:18,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but above it, adoption of the budget, the city council shall adopt the operating budget with or without amendments, not more than 45 days following the date the budget is filed.

529
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:27,773
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, what that is saying is they can file, how do we leave it?

530
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:37,541
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days before the end of the fiscal year, the mayor has to submit the budget to the city clerk and the council at the same time.

531
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:40,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the mayor submits it on June 1st.

532
00:48:40,824 --> 00:48:41,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're July 15th.

533
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,454
[SPEAKER_03]: here at July 15th, which is after June 30th.

534
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:47,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.

535
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:47,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

536
00:48:48,776 --> 00:49:05,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm wondering is whether this is, I mean, you know, there's, if the city council doesn't vote on the budget or doesn't accept the budget and they can't agree on the budget, then they go into that 112, is that what it is, 112 budget?

537
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:07,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 112, it almost happened a few years ago.

538
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:26,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember what state law says about how many days that it has to be before the mayor's budget is automatically adopted, right?

539
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:36,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just wondering if this is about that and if this changes the window of time that there can be a 1 to 12 budget.

540
00:49:38,137 --> 00:50:05,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you might be exactly right, because as I pointed out the other day, that I always thought that if the budget wasn't adopted within two weeks or 15 days of the start of the next fiscal year, then the budget submitted was the one that would have to be accepted, which I call that 45-day rule.

541
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:13,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know what, I can't remember, I think it might be longer than 45 days in state law.

542
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:15,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be more like nine.

543
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:17,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I don't have any idea.

544
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:25,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And what, yeah, so I'm just wondering if that's what this is about and if this actually shortens the window for that.

545
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:28,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's the only thing I can think of, but we'll ask that.

546
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:32,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be right, yeah, exactly, it's a good question, yep.

547
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that is right,

548
00:50:38,344 --> 00:50:41,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean that this is desirable because

549
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,682
[SPEAKER_03]: because it would be less time for the 1-12 budget.

550
00:50:52,722 --> 00:50:56,043
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1-12 budget is not a good thing for the city.

551
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:57,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.

552
00:50:57,864 --> 00:50:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: No, definitely not.

553
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:03,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear what the call and center has to say on this.

554
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:03,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

555
00:51:03,506 --> 00:51:09,529
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to obviously have a reason that this is here and why it's been adopted in this way.

556
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.

557
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask them about section 6-4.

558
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're coming to our meeting tomorrow and our following meeting in April.

559
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:28,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're productive enough tomorrow, we'll be talking about this at our full committee meeting in April.

560
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:29,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping we get there.

561
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:36,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Section 6-4, the adoption of budget.

562
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:36,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

563
00:51:36,629 --> 00:51:40,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what we'll just do is leave it there for now in yellow.

564
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:41,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that sound right?

565
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:43,032
[SPEAKER_00]: It does to me.

566
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

567
00:51:43,672 --> 00:51:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

568
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:44,913
[SPEAKER_03]: More clarity.

569
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:51,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this stuff we didn't, this is just a posting required availability of the operating budget.

570
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,962
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing really.

571
00:51:53,762 --> 00:52:01,247
[SPEAKER_03]: The capital improvement program, I remember our question was, does every year make, you know,

572
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Does every year make sense?

573
00:52:05,348 --> 00:52:08,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some cities had every year and some had every three years.

574
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:10,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we may have looked at one that had five years.

575
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:12,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, had five years.

576
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:22,292
[SPEAKER_00]: After our conversation yesterday, I think it's clear after the input of how much time goes into it that every year is unreasonable.

577
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:24,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years is unreasonable.

578
00:52:24,632 --> 00:52:26,093
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too far down the road.

579
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,094
[SPEAKER_00]: That window of three years seem to be

580
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:35,698
[SPEAKER_00]: for the people in the know that do this, that's a reasonable time period.

581
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:36,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

582
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree, Eunice?

583
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:40,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.

584
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:50,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that makes sense because I think every year is definitely too much to be tied up in.

585
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:52,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Capital stuff is big stuff.

586
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:53,854
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the day-to-day.

587
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:54,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

588
00:52:55,015 --> 00:52:56,977
[SPEAKER_03]: They said it's a lot of work to put it together.

589
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:07,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I know that there was some, you know, contentiousness when they went through this budget ordinance about, you know, the different pieces that.

590
00:53:09,193 --> 00:53:14,936
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the finance staff was going to be responsible for and and what the city council was.

591
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:36,301
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for, and I think that Nina and the finance director were pretty clear that some of this was going to be pretty hard for them to, especially under the circumstances that they have at the moment with the staffing and software and things like that.

592
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:42,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think three years is the right sweet spot.

593
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:43,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

594
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:52,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the rest there was not much, but you had a question on the independent audit units, right?

595
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:53,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

596
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I heard Zach mentioned something about the audit last night on the council meeting.

597
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you heard it.

598
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:04,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't stay for the whole thing.

599
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:05,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

600
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't and I don't remember.

601
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of the 6 and at what point in the 6 and a half hour meeting.

602
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:20,319
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this occurred, but he mentioned something about the audit and I went looking for it today and it is online.

603
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:46,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Finance page, and it seemed to me that the audit comes under the auspices of the finance office, which is logical, which comes under the auspices of the mayor, whereas this talks about city council shall provide an outside audit, and the city council, you know,

604
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:52,669
[SPEAKER_01]: The report of the audit, you know, shall be filed in final form with the city council.

605
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,590
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council shall conduct a competitive procurement process.

606
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:17,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my question, as I said, is, you know, should the audit be, you know, originating from and under the auspices of the city council or under, you know, the auspices of the mayor, which is what it seems to be like

607
00:55:19,035 --> 00:55:22,816
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, so I'm a little bit confused.

608
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:26,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know who does the audit now.

609
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:33,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there hasn't been one done for years because of the mayor's office for years upon years.

610
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:40,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of the city council having control of two things, the city clerk and the audit, you know?

611
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:44,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is, okay, the mayor's

612
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:50,714
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in too much working with all these departments.

613
00:55:50,754 --> 00:56:06,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have the city council, as an independent, bringing in an auditor for all the in-house stuff, instead of the mayor, who has control of all the in-house stuff, not pointing any fingers at any mayor at all, just to keep it on the up and up.

614
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:08,805
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been my philosophy for years.

615
00:56:09,668 --> 00:56:13,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, there definitely has an audit has been done every year.

616
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:14,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure of that.

617
00:56:15,132 --> 00:56:17,994
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an in-house audit.

618
00:56:19,636 --> 00:56:21,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was an outside audit done every year.

619
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:25,040
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think it's been done in years.

620
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, so Maury, I agree with Maury.

621
00:56:31,214 --> 00:56:39,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, I think it's, this is something that city council, that, you know, could be under the purview of the city council.

622
00:56:40,502 --> 00:56:49,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have a line in here that says, at least every three years, the city council should conduct a competitive procurement process to retain these auditing services, which I think,

623
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:56,670
[SPEAKER_03]: could potentially prevent them from just automatically using the same firm every year.

624
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:01,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean they can't use the same firm, but they're gonna have to sort of analyze that.

625
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:03,440
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna have to put it out to bid.

626
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:04,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.

627
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:05,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

628
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:07,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, which I think is it makes sense.

629
00:57:09,116 --> 00:57:27,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having things under the city council, you know, it talks a bit about that balance of power that Jean was talking about earlier and it provides, you know, some checks and balances and, you know, like Maury says, not to point fingers, um, you know, or pass dispersions on anybody.

630
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:32,526
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think always having a fresh set of eyes where the money is concerned, um,

631
00:57:34,514 --> 00:57:35,435
[SPEAKER_01]: is never a bad thing.

632
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

633
00:57:38,097 --> 00:57:38,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

634
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:46,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think that this is in pretty good shape and I feel like, you know, we do have that.

635
00:57:46,723 --> 00:57:49,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it okay if I resolve this comment, Eunice?

636
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:50,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like we resolved it?

637
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:53,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Say yes.

638
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:54,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

639
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:55,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

640
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:57,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, boss.

641
00:57:58,535 --> 00:58:07,598
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have that one, we're leaving 45 days in, but we still, we just have that one question, which we're going to get answered just to find out if maybe we're understanding it correctly.

642
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:13,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll send out, we can resolve this, I think.

643
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:26,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send out minutes and then we'll bring the budget amendment issue to the April 18th meeting.

644
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:26,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

645
00:58:31,223 --> 00:58:31,784
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

646
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did a good job in this.

647
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:35,667
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot in this.

648
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,588
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of input, a lot of thought.

649
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:42,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And let the rest of the committee take a look at it and see how they feel.

650
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:44,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go from there.

651
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.

652
00:58:46,635 --> 00:58:47,616
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a good job on this.

653
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:48,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job, you guys.

654
00:58:48,637 --> 00:58:49,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everybody.

655
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:56,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see if there's any members of the public that want to share, have comments.

656
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,981
[SPEAKER_03]: want to speak on any of these issues?

657
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:04,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

658
00:59:04,522 --> 00:59:12,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So, while we're ahead of schedule, but... I'll take it.

659
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:16,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So tomorrow night we are doing what?

660
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing two and three?

661
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:19,687
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's on the agenda.

662
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:21,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Articles two and three and seven.

663
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:30,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Collins Center is hopefully going to, they were putting together a memo and I don't know.

664
00:59:30,615 --> 00:59:31,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, they're going to be there.

665
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:37,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have, Nova, do they already have all the stuff that we've worked on as committees?

666
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:41,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we doing it with our body first before they get their hands on it?

667
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have everything.

668
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:48,163
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have articles two and three, but I don't know how much, I don't know how much time they take.

669
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:56,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in the end, they're going to look at the document and some of it, maybe they'll even draft, we don't know yet.

670
00:59:58,308 --> 01:00:00,449
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so the sections we haven't looked at yet.

671
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:17,598
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll look at it and they'll, you know, I mean, I feel like they're pretty helpful, even on the preamble, just little things like changing, you know, the state of Massachusetts to the Commonwealth, just little things like that, that, like making sure we use the right language and things like that.

672
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:22,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll help us with that.

673
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,885
[SPEAKER_01]: 2, 3, and 7 tomorrow.

674
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:31,569
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 18th, we'll do 4 and 8 and any cleanup that we have from 2, 3, and 7 left over.

675
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:37,392
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole.

676
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:41,595
[SPEAKER_01]: 2, 3, 4, and 6 is still hanging out there in midair.

677
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:49,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we have time tomorrow, we can clean up the questions and have the whole committee move forward with it.

678
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, this is six.

679
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:58,512
[SPEAKER_03]: What we haven't worked on is one, five, nine, and 10, right?

680
01:01:01,893 --> 01:01:12,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about that tomorrow and see how people- Let's put a committee together to see how much it entails and what we can, see if we can't bang out two or three of them all together or something like that.

681
01:01:12,611 --> 01:01:19,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll see what kind of availability people have for any more subcommittees tomorrow.

682
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:20,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.

683
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,000
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

684
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

685
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:24,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in good shape.

686
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:25,443
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

687
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:26,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

688
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:27,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone move to adjourn?

689
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a motion to adjourn.

690
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:31,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

691
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:32,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

692
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:33,434
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

693
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:35,396
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in favor, too, Nova.

694
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:36,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

695
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

696
01:01:37,638 --> 01:01:43,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad because we made this motion, but we didn't accept the minutes, Maury, because Gene couldn't

697
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:46,168
[SPEAKER_03]: vote on them.

698
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:49,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she didn't want to make the motion because she missed the last meeting.

699
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:54,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we adjourn, can we look at the minutes from last?

700
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:55,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

701
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:56,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

702
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a chance to review them, go over them.

703
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:02,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought everything was in working order and everything we've done.

704
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll make a motion to approve.

705
01:02:04,902 --> 01:02:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

706
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:07,084
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

707
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:08,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

708
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:09,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

709
01:02:09,306 --> 01:02:12,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means I can send them to the city and have them posted.

710
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:13,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

711
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:14,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

712
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:16,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

713
01:02:17,164 --> 01:02:19,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And we already made the motion to adjourn, so we're good on that.

714
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:23,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will see you all tomorrow.
