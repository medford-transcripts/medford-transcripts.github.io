1
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:03,527
You are not the only one.

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:06,068
Okay.

3
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:20,958
I was thinking that is always such a clear speaker.

4
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:23,419
I know.

5
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:24,220
Wasn't adding up.

6
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:27,634
I think you're just going to have to speak a little louder.

7
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:07,935
The folks that are just joining us, apparently my audio is a little bit underperforming today.

8
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,756
It does not seem like it gets better.

9
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:15,817
Certainly any of the members or any of the participants are welcome to just keep raising your hand.

10
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:21,479
I can try even unplugging the headphones and the mics and just going off the audio.

11
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,680
I would suggest trying it already because it's tough.

12
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,601
All right, can somebody find say something.

13
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:53,088
Okay, how about how about that matt.

14
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,810
can you hear me.

15
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,892
it's a little better still a little echoey.

16
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,454
Oh.

17
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:09,141
All right, well it's a little better we'll just have to go with that and I will try and talk as loud as I can that's helpful.

18
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,910
That's much better though, Matt, just so you know.

19
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,330
All right, good.

20
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,251
Because if not, I'm just going to turn around and say, Helen has to run the meeting.

21
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,291
So that's what's going to happen.

22
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:25,492
All right.

23
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:30,473
So I think we have hopefully the critical mass at this point.

24
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:34,494
Like I said, we'll just give people a few minutes to jump in here.

25
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,655
But I think it's probably good to get going.

26
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:50,913
So I'm just going to start off and say welcome to our advisory team meeting for the Medford High School project that is focused here on educational planning and equity.

27
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:55,418
So we'll get into a little bit of what that means moving forward.

28
00:02:56,196 --> 00:03:01,500
But I just want to start off with a quick agenda so that you know what we're going to be covering.

29
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:09,767
We're going to do a quick round of introductions, both for project team, as well as the advisory team.

30
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:13,770
So the Medford participants right up front.

31
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:20,115
And then we're really going to cover what this advisory team process is about.

32
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:23,278
We know that there's a lot of meetings involved with this project.

33
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,801
Some people may say too many meetings, some people maybe not enough.

34
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:32,443
But this is a critically important topic to the development of the project.

35
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:40,326
And so that is why we have a special advisory team set up for this topic of educational planning and equity.

36
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:42,127
And we'll get into a little bit more about what that means.

37
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:51,170
But right after that, we're going to dive directly into hearing from all the team members, because that's really what we're here for.

38
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,191
We want to hear about your priority goals

39
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,201
either you individually or the department, the group that you represent.

40
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:09,604
And there'll be a certain set amount of time that we'll figure out for everyone to speak, depending on how many members that we have, team members we have online with us today.

41
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:15,246
And if there's not enough time for anyone to say anything, we can certainly say everything that they want to say.

42
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,606
We can accept written comments after the fact.

43
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:22,648
And then we'll close out by just looking forward to the next meetings and what to expect there.

44
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,098
All right, so we're going to start with the introductions.

45
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:31,682
And again, we'll let the design team go first, and I will start things off.

46
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:33,264
My name is Matt Rice.

47
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:36,648
I'm an architect, and I'm the principal in charge for SMMA.

48
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,593
And I am Helen Fantini.

49
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,077
I am also an architect, but I am a project manager for this project.

50
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:48,156
I'm Rosemary Park.

51
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,817
I just want to make sure people hear me.

52
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:52,678
I've been having a lot of audio issues.

53
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,901
I'm Rosemary Park, architect and educational programmer and planner with SMMA.

54
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,103
Hi, everyone.

55
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,283
I'm Sohla Janka.

56
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,304
I'm an architectural designer at SMMA.

57
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:08,506
Hi, everyone.

58
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:11,587
Mike Perlo, educational planner with MLP Integrated Design.

59
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,791
Hi, everyone.

60
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:20,194
I'm Jen Carlson, project director for the project with Leftfield.

61
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,576
We are the owner's project manager.

62
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:24,098
Apologies, I will be driving soon.

63
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,819
So if I disappear, that is why.

64
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,163
Also, Adele.

65
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:31,224
Hi, I'm Adele Sands.

66
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,846
I'm the education liaison for Leftfield.

67
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:37,689
And Matt Galeno is also with Leftfield.

68
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:41,853
I think he is not on with us at the moment, but he's the other face that you see before you.

69
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:46,554
Now I'm going to shift gears over to the team.

70
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:58,508
So what I would appreciate is if everyone could have their cameras on, as long as you're not, again, driving or in some other way that having a camera on would not be a safe thing to be doing.

71
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,013
But it's really helpful for us to be able to put a name and a face together.

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,861
So I will just read through.

73
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:11,222
I know that there's a few folks that may be joining us a little bit late.

74
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:18,424
This is some ongoing things within the district and some that have not been able to make it today.

75
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,765
So I think Will may help us out as well.

76
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:25,707
There's folks that reached out to him in advance and told him that they're not able to make it.

77
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:32,489
So I'm just gonna augment the number that we have here and then figure out how much time we have available for everyone to speak.

78
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:41,765
So if you could just introduce yourself and really briefly your connection to the project, that would be helpful and then we'll move forward.

79
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,666
But we'll start off with Joan.

80
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:47,947
Hey everyone, Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services for Medford.

81
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:56,611
I'm part of the, I'm working with everyone about what the classrooms and things will look like going forward as our educational plan.

82
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,012
Great, Martha?

83
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,671
Marta is unable to be here today, but she should be here in January.

84
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:05,951
All right.

85
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:08,272
Nicole.

86
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:21,155
All right, I'm going to take that Nicole with non-fear.

87
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,326
She is on the call, but maybe.

88
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:26,228
Oh, maybe having some audio issues.

89
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,809
Sorry, I couldn't unmute.

90
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:28,590
I apologize.

91
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,491
Hi, I'm Nicole.

92
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,872
Can you hear me?

93
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:31,232
Okay.

94
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:31,893

99
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:43,584
Principal Fallon's not on now.

100
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:44,665

Thank you.

159
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:24,129
I am noticing that we need to fix the spelling of your name.

160
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,250
I apologize for that.

161
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,293
We will correct those things moving forward.

162
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:30,493
Norman.

00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:33,055

Thank you, Norm.

167
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:48,536
Sorry, I did not get your last name, and so I was unable to put the face, but obviously you know what we mean.

168
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:49,336
Cooper.

169
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:54,198
Oh, sorry.

170
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:54,839
I meant to say that.

171
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,640
Cooper, that's your act of practice.

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:10:59,740
OK.

173
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,000

174
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:01,661
Hi, everyone.

175
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:07,583
I'm Kim Talbot, the assistant superintendent of Medford Public Schools, and I'm excited to join you in this work this afternoon.

176
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:09,224
Thank you.

177
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,074
One last, John?

178
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,656
Hi, my name is John Wilson.

179
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,578
I'm a biology and anatomy teacher up at the high school.

180
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,020
Perfect.

181
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:33,530
So we're going to jump into sort of the process here in terms of what these advisory teams are and what we're trying to achieve through this particular meeting and really

182
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:42,655
We'll talk a little bit about why this particular advisory team is a slightly different organization or the potential outcomes from it.

183
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:56,466
So the advisory teams overall are really intended as a way to collect diverse stakeholder feedback from a wide variety of voices within the community of Medford.

184
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:05,520
In terms of educational planning, that is really at the heart of the project that we're engaged in right now.

185
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,721
We are designing a high school.

186
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:11,002
There's a lot of other amazing things that happen in and around the high school.

187
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,203
But at its heart, this is a high school design project.

188
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:22,366
And so there's a lot of different educational planning, visioning, programming activities that we're currently engaged in.

189
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:26,748
We had an amazing meeting yesterday on the visioning front over at the high school

190
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,254
So there are a lot of familiar faces.

191
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:45,565
I feel like this particular group, it's less about introducing ourselves to each other, but it's really more about finding a forum to have a little bit more deeper discussion on particular topics that have come up and will come up as part of the process as we move forward.

192
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:51,109
And so it's really important to have this space to be able to have those conversations.

193
00:12:52,014 --> 00:13:00,176
Because there's even just coming out of the visioning meeting yesterday, there's a lot of really interesting ideas that were thrown around and put out there into the world.

194
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:06,138
And it's really a great opportunity to be able to have public and conversations on those.

195
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:12,480
So that's what we're going to be doing as part of this particular advisory team.

196
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:21,022
But the other advisory teams that are up on screen now, sustainability and MVP systems, site safety and security, as well as exterior interior design,

197
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:26,596
These are not things that will be talked about in the absence of educational pain and equity.

198
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:50,230
This is very much intentionally represented as a Venn diagram where the topics overlap and there's overlapping membership between the advisory teams intentionally so that the same people are hearing the same things and have the ability to relay thoughts to different constituencies that we're gonna be talking to as part of the process.

199
00:13:51,602 --> 00:14:05,991
And this particular forum, the advisory team, it's as much about us being able, the project team being able to listen to all of you, to the Medford community, but it's also about the individual members being able to hear from each other.

200
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:12,575
And so with educational planning and equity, again, it's a little bit different because everyone does have a familiarity generally.

201
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:20,100
There are actually a couple of new faces here, which is actually really exciting to be able to pull additional thoughts and perspectives into this process.

202
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:27,334
But we're going to be building on something here, and we're going to have the ability to dive in a little bit deeper on particular topics as we move forward.

203
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:32,196
We're really excited that Mike Barolo was able to join us for this discussion as well.

204
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:37,758
He's been the one leading the visioning process that a lot of us have been participating in.

205
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:47,863
So we really do value his perspective in this conversation as well as we move forward, just to be able to, again, further the discussions that we've already been having.

206
00:14:52,525 --> 00:15:00,177
Again, the goal here and this is more or less what I was just covering but with some better pictures to look at in terms of just having something up there on screen.

207
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,544
We're actually not going to be sort of focusing on the nuances of any of these spaces today.

208
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:26,442
What we're going to be doing today is really just trying to hear priority goals or sort of important takeaways, potentially, that you have been engaged with, whether it's been coming out of the school tours, now that we've done the shadowing day, shadowing day, the programming meetings, or the visioning sessions.

209
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:43,537
If you've been able to participate in some of those, we'd love to be able to hear their thoughts that have sort of risen up and sort of maybe things that are top of mind, because it's always good to sort of vocalize those as opposed to holding on to them and turning until the next opportunity.

210
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:45,918
So this is really our next opportunity for engagement.

211
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:53,061
I would say that if you have not participated in any of those prior activities, that's certainly not a problem at all.

212
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:55,782
Again, we sort of welcome those fresh perspectives

213
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:59,009
that scenario, what we really want to do is hear from you.

214
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,351
What are your priority goals for the project?

215
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:15,061
Again, everyone here has a connection to Medford High School, so we want to understand what that is and really what your aspiration is to see and be a part of when the building is completed.

216
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:19,865
So that's really what we're going to be running through as we move forward.

217
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,127
Just to help

218
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,141
conceptualize where we are in this process.

219
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:31,843
We are looking to open the new high school or essentially renovated high school in the fall of 2030.

220
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:35,283
So that's all the way on the right-hand side of our timeline.

221
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:39,925
We're on the left-hand side of our timeline in the feasibility study right at the outset of the project.

222
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:44,766
And stars that you see are the touch points that we have for these advisory team meetings.

223
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,027
So the second meeting that we'll have coming up

224
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,944
is scheduled for January 13th.

225
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,166
Hopefully already everyone has those invites.

226
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:59,411
And we'll be scheduling the third and the fourth meeting as we come and move forward.

227
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:03,995
In terms of the cadence of the meetings, this meeting today is really a listening meeting.

228
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,197
We wanna hear as much as possible from everyone.

229
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:14,505
And we're gonna be taking that feedback and using that to craft the agenda and the topics for the subsequent meetings.

230
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:29,555
In that second meeting in January, we will be compiling the feedback that we're going to be hearing, and then we're going to be diving into a little bit more discussion on every one of those, and there will be opportunities for some dialogue back and forth.

231
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:35,241
We're going to come back in that third meeting, which will be a little bit later in the feasibility study process.

232
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:45,173
We're going to go through a confirmation process just to make sure that we've been hearing what the advisory team is going to be saying and suggesting that is included in the project.

233
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:49,257
And then coming out of that third meeting, we're also going to come up with a set of recommendations.

234
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:58,564
So this advisory team is not a decision-making body, but what it is going to be doing as a mechanism is sending feedback recommendations

235
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,446
back to the full building committee.

236
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:06,511
And the full building committee is going to be the one that actually makes that decision to have something included in the project.

237
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:08,672
So that's just the mechanics of how we're going to be working.

238
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:19,520
We do get together one final time before time just to make sure that all of these recommendations are clear and that where there's consensus agreement in terms of what we move forward with.

239
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:28,067
So with that, I'm going to stop sharing my screen now.

240
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,499
So we can all see each other.

241
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:41,344
I am going to just do the quick math in terms of how many people are here, which I think is around 19 people.

242
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:45,386
And I think we have about 65 minutes.

243
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,848
So we should each have about 3 and 1⁄2 minutes to talk.

244
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,689
And so I'll just run through in alphabetical order.

245
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:58,352
I think going forward, I'm probably going to switch it around to reverse alphabetical order just to keep everybody on their toes.

246
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:06,566
But if people go over the three minutes and 30, I will interrupt you, unfortunately.

247
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:11,008
And this is what I struggle with most in these meetings, because I am not an interrupting person.

248
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,488
So I will try to be managing it.

249
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:17,090
And if there's folks that just don't need to take that full three and a half minutes, that's fine.

250
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,510
We'll try to bank that as we go.

251
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,132
And I'll just keep an eye on things as we move forward to the process.

252
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:23,692
All right.

253
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:27,954
Let me just jump back.

254
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,629
There's a list.

255
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:37,231
And I think we're going to start with Joan.

256
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,072
Hey, everyone.

257
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:47,674
So I think what I'm looking for is equitable learning services for our students with disabilities.

258
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:52,956
We have a wide variety of needs, different programming.

259
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:56,017
And to be able to have those spaces that

260
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,397
Promote learning promote equity for all of our students.

261
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:12,168
What that looks like I you know we've been part of the meetings and seeing many different schools and.

262
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,782
I like the collaborative working spaces.

263
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:21,244
I like to have students to be able to continue the services that they're currently receiving.

264
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:35,270
So students in our access programs still have, in project transition have those, the apartment and those sort of life skills opportunities that they're getting now that those continue as well.

265
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,472
All right.

266
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:41,173
Thank you, Joan.

267
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:47,385
All right, so I know Marta is not able to join.

268
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,865
Nicole, I think, was here.

269
00:20:51,885 --> 00:21:00,547
I think she was having a slight Zoom.

270
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:03,127
Oh, challenge.

271
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:04,288
OK.

272
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:08,868
Remind me to circle back then if we get Nicole back with us.

273
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,709
So I think we're going to pivot over to Suzanne.

274
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:17,319
Hi, everyone.

275
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:28,488
So just to maybe extend a little what Joan had said, we have had the privilege of digging into a lot of this work.

276
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:41,799
And having been in the district my whole career, and also seeing some of the work that was done on, I guess, what we are no longer calling the new schools, the new K-8 schools.

277
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:59,395
I think what's important is trying, we're never going to be able to like anticipate too much, but trying to be able to create spaces that are flexible enough so that we have, we can deal with the learning environments that we want to create for our students.

278
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:05,340
We have the opportunity to really be looking at a high school that is the flagship for our community.

279
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,783
Here in Medford, I think it's wonderful that our

280
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:14,600
play spaces, our schools are really truly community spaces.

281
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:31,387
And now at the high school here with bringing our Curtis Tufts students up, creating an early childhood program, really looking at what we want to see for the education of our high school students, we really have an opportunity to create

282
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:56,079
um what we envision education to be and our community spaces to be so trying to do something that is going to grow with the community and meet the needs not just for what's happening in the next 10 years but for years to come seems a little daunting but trying to create spaces that are flexible that

283
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:06,772
yes, are equitable, are cooperative, collaborative, and really bring a sense of community together.

284
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:11,538
We don't have large spaces to be able to break out and

285
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:20,409
and for teachers to grab classes together, for administrators to have meetings together, to host community meetings.

286
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:29,474
And our art spaces are not really meeting the needs of our community and our students.

287
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:34,956
So I really could probably go on for five minutes about the things I'd like to see in this space.

288
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:39,939
But I think if I had to like distill it down, it would be about community and flexibility.

289
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:43,905
That's great, Susan.

290
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:44,385
Thank you.

291
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:44,705
Yeah.

292
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:50,729
Jenny, you're up next.

293
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:52,831
Thanks, Matt.

294
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:59,636
I actually have the lucky good fortune to sit on all these advisory committees.

295
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:03,739
And part of the reason I'm doing that is because I'm like,

296
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:13,295
Taking copious notes on who I need to call on when various things come up that I think they inevitably will over the course of this project.

297
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,977
So I'm just really always very interested to learn from the expertise of everybody in the room.

298
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:26,480
And when I think about educational equity, I think the thing that's on my mind is,

299
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:38,342
What does it look like in motion, instead of like in the word salad that we use around equity, and like, I feel like, you know.

300
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:55,682
I don't have a lot of firsthand experience in this space, but what I hear from others makes me think that there's a lot of really great intentions, but something about the things happening in motion is just not quite a match yet.

301
00:24:55,843 --> 00:25:02,406
And I think the question that I have is, how do we let the building help us make a better match?

302
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:10,755
So I don't have anything really constructive to share, except that I'm listening to all of you and taking notes so I can call you later.

303
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:14,856
I actually think that's incredibly constructive.

304
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:20,637
I think the title of the advisory team is educational planning and equity for a reason.

305
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:26,339
Because I think part of what would be great to hear really is sort of what that word equity means to everybody as we go through.

306
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:36,225
And then I think we can start to really flesh out what does that mean for as a community and sort of within the building itself and beyond the bounds of it.

307
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:41,590
Because I think that the walls of the building are sort of porous when it comes to that particular term.

308
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:45,653
And then I'm going to stop because we're not supposed to be talking during this meeting.

309
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:48,035
So you guys will be doing the talking.

310
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:52,980
So I'm going to shift over to the next group here.

311
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:54,261
Sydney.

312
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:09,363
Hi, um, I feel like my goals like from the student perspective is pretty similar to what has been said so far, but also like building off of that, having like safe spaces for people interested in

313
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:27,759
like all kinds of different topics, having spaces where they are able to explore their interests personally and they feel comfortable doing that and really feel like they're getting something important out of that while being able to connect with other students that have similar interests.

314
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,201
And having like safe spaces available to students at like all the time.

315
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:55,595
where they are able to go and like de-stress, decompress, or just have like the time to just do whatever they're needing in that moment so that they are able to go back to class or go back to whatever after, even if it's during lunch, to be able to be fully engaged.

316
00:26:58,897 --> 00:26:59,497
Fantastic.

317
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:00,398
Thank you.

318
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:10,049
All right, Catherine.

319
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:24,643
Hi, so I think like my goal for our students and what I would love their day to look like in the future would be that it's very dynamic and there's a lot of like different things in their day and it doesn't feel

320
00:27:26,284 --> 00:27:42,799
kind of like as repetitive as a lot of students feel like it is now and there's a variety of like different types of learning and a lot more hands on interaction and a lot more movement and going to different spaces and collaborating and doing different things.

321
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:58,808
And I think from the building visits, we saw a lot of cool spaces that could allow for that sort of thing that I wonder, like, how can we, like, also make sure those are, like, really being used?

322
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:11,315
Like, if we create some of those things, like, I would say highest priority for me is, like, also making sure we're, like, we're ready to, like, utilize that space and, like, really kind of change the way we do things to, like, be a more

323
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:19,219
dynamic learning experience and not just like, we're in this new cool space, but we're kind of like doing things the same way.

324
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,361
Yeah, that'd be great sentiment.

325
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,122
Thank you.

326
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:26,763
Isa.

327
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:39,432
Hi, so I am reflecting back on when we talked about the collaboration spaces for the students.

328
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:44,598
I think collaboration is a really important skill and right now.

329
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:54,367
We don't have any formal spaces where teachers would collaborate or, and let alone the students, other than the classroom.

330
00:28:54,847 --> 00:29:02,354
So I would love to have more collaboration space for our children and our teachers.

331
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:08,300
It will probably be a space where we can showcase student work, teacher work.

332
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:22,431
and where really true exploration takes place, followed by a good discussion, the discourse, which I think extends, and I believe extends students' learning.

333
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:36,483
I would love for the mathematics department teachers to be closer to each other in proximity and also closer in proximity to the CTE and to the science department because

334
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:46,170
I believe that there is so much opportunity for CTE and for science collaboration with the mathematics teachers.

335
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:55,256
It's like inter-subject and intra-subject that it can lend itself to if it's closer to each other.

336
00:29:57,718 --> 00:30:11,899
That could be some coalition building with the, with the departments and there's one thing that I had mentioned in my earlier conversation, and that is the concept of a math lab that runs during the day.

337
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,801
during a wind block.

338
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:18,443
And I would like to have a space for that if possible.

339
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:27,987
And this math lab can then extend to before school help for students and or after school help for students as well.

340
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,548
So a space like that, because we currently don't have it.

341
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:42,233
And of course the director's office, the department head's office to be closer to the mathematics teachers, because right now I'm in a science

342
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:45,099
slash union office from many years ago.

343
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,100
So yeah, thank you.

344
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,221
All right, thank you, Peta.

345
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:57,304
I think Megan was maybe one that was not here and I don't think I've seen jump in.

346
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:01,385
So I'm gonna shift, oh, sorry, Sydney, were you gonna mention?

347
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,866
I was just gonna say Megan's not here.

348
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:03,946
You can go to the next person.

349
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:05,147
Okay, so I think that's Colleen.

350
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:13,386
Hi, so I'm a special ed teacher and I talked to a bunch of different teachers in different programs.

351
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:26,795
And some of the main things that came up is thinking about how we can reduce kind of the stigma of being a special education student about so being mindful of where classrooms are located as well as classroom size.

352
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:31,638
We don't want kids to have to enter into like the small classroom to receive services.

353
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,059
So that.

354
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,583
being mindful of creating sensory inclusive spaces.

355
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:46,551
So things like dimmable lights, flexible furniture, sound absorption might be appropriate in certain rooms, dividers within classrooms.

356
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:51,696
So if a kid needs to have a more individual workspace within the room, that would be really helpful.

357
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:57,442
Breakout spaces near co-taught classrooms came up a lot when I talked to people.

358
00:31:58,762 --> 00:32:15,072
When I talked to kind of transition access and learning group, they talked about wanting to increase access to like the living lab so that students that are in nine through 12 can access more kind of adaptive living skills instruction and having enough space for that.

359
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:24,177
Also something that came up was making sure we have close proximity of social emotional support to our high needs programs.

360
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:39,307
So making sure we have like a calm down or sensory room and like a counselor workspace or office near our like learning group or TLP rooms, as well as like a dedicated bathroom for those programs since there's like high anxiety in some of those rooms.

361
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:45,068
And some students avoid using the bathroom because they're afraid to go with the general school population.

362
00:32:46,509 --> 00:33:05,933
And finally, the last thing that I think came up was a multi-use rec space that would promote multi-sensory learning, movement, collaboration, and helping us meet the social, emotional, behavior, and attentional needs of students without having to go in and take up part of the gym space, which is the PE teacher's classroom.

363
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,754
That was the last thing that also came up.

364
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,720
Perfect, thank you.

365
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:20,324
Rebecca, again, I don't think is on, but I just want to mention so that I don't skip over somebody that is here.

366
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:28,688
And I know Nicole joined us, and I see Stacey is trying to jump on and maybe keeps getting disconnected.

367
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:34,651
So I think we'll circle back to Stacey and Nicole as we get through, just to let everyone know.

368
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:37,672
So I think Madeline is up next.

369
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,772
Hi, yeah, so I really enjoyed my time.

370
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:47,396
I participated in the building tours as well as a student shadow day.

371
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:57,244
And in talking with my colleagues and the students, student experience and safety are kind of like what I'm coming into this at the forefront of my mind.

372
00:33:57,765 --> 00:34:03,209
I believe as many people do, students thrive in comfortable spaces that they feel proud of being in.

373
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:06,472
And that kind of is conducive to productive routines.

374
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:12,501
So I'd like to see spaces that are designed with student reality at the forefront of our mind.

375
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:20,614
You know, I liked Jenny's analogy of the word salad that a lot of the times people bring up, but when we really come down to the basics of

376
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:27,007
How are students going to exist in spaces and is this going to promote their educational experience.

377
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:38,273
I think a lot of those reality checks and you know that can be combined with looking at how is a high quality new modern school that supports all students in an equitable manner, how will that reality look.

378
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:43,135
So yeah, modern, flexible, promoting those learning environments.

379
00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:59,220
I'd love to see community spaces, you know, that will be allowing for breakouts for, you know, I have a co-taught classroom, that would be really nice, small group work and just appropriate spaces for all students, music spaces, art spaces, athletic areas, that sort of thing.

380
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:02,562
Excellent, thank you.

381
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:06,503
All right, Dana.

382
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:08,332
Hi there.

383
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:14,596
I also got to join in with the student shadowing day as well as the building tours.

384
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:20,019
And speaking also with my colleagues, I have a lot of feedback.

385
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:29,045
Everybody, even without seeing the school tours, really spoke to that Chapman model where they really love these common spaces in a central area.

386
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:36,955
Our humanities teachers really want a space where we can join together as humanities, both social studies and ELA.

387
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:45,607
We thought a lot of the teachers like to be outside and do, whether it be like readings and plays and performances or

388
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:55,393
I'm just trying to get into the fells in nature and what an important idea would be to be making these shared spaces and accessible outside.

389
00:35:55,413 --> 00:36:03,698
We also talked about needing some sort of presentation space for social studies department in humanities we have mock trial model un.

390
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:10,581
We have our community service class that does a ton of different presentations within the community.

391
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:26,630
We have people who bring in speakers from outside and how good it would be to have a gathering space where people could come in, they could present, we would have some sort of small stage available, projection capabilities, things like that, so we could have a more formal space.

392
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:32,793
We also would love, again with these shared spaces, this idea of a writing center where

393
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:54,690
ELA and humanities could be collaborating together to be working once upon a time we would do National History Day, which we've had to eliminate and having these resources closer together would help elevate our student skills and increase collaboration between different departments, hopefully increasing the skills for our students.

394
00:36:56,151 --> 00:37:01,696
Along with what Colleen Mahaney was talking about as well, with our special ed teachers, a lot of

395
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:03,546
our support teachers.

396
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,179
are across the building.

397
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:11,360
So my co-teacher cannot even get to my room until five minutes into the period.

398
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:22,683
So thinking mindfully about where our support is and where our teacher rooms are and making sure that we have some sort of accessibility to different places within the building.

399
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,303
Let me see.

400
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:29,084
One of the major things for the humanities department is that Medford is a historic city.

401
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:33,485
And so having elements of that history really showcased in our building.

402
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:38,728
You know, we have a beautiful entryway where we have some beautiful murals.

403
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:47,573
We have the ship there and kind of preserving that history as well as highlighting other things that we may have missed.

404
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:56,418
Our social studies department wants to make sure that we're making this about Medford and making sure that we're honoring that.

405
00:37:57,198 --> 00:37:58,999
And I think that might be it.

406
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:11,468
Loving the idea that like the classroom spaces could open from the walls into shared spaces and everything else every people were saying about flexible classrooms and how they move.

407
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:14,471
Absolutely what the social studies teachers are looking for as well.

408
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:16,552
Thank you.

409
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:24,499
Dana, we may be drafting you into the exterior and interior design advisory team meeting also just to talk about sort of how that history gets represented.

410
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:28,462
But we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

411
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:29,903
Chelsea, I think you're up next.

412
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:44,585
Hi everyone, so the English learner department, similar to the special ed department like Joan mentioned, has specific programming needs and structures.

413
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:50,832
We have standalone ESL classes that are mixed grades and we have sheltered content classes.

414
00:38:51,929 --> 00:39:12,172
So we in our envisioning meetings, we've spent a lot of time thinking about the collaborative space and clustering classrooms sort of based on a team model and taking that from the CTE worlds where they really have like a tight knit community with cohorts of students.

415
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:22,324
And I absolutely love that idea, but I'd want to make sure that the ESL program is embedded into those teams and not separate from them.

416
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:30,614
And specifically thinking about if we are arranging those teams around grade levels, how would the ESL classes fit into that?

417
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:43,566
And also recognizing that while some of the content areas, the content classes are sheltered, they are still a biology class, a US history class, a math class.

418
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:50,436
really recognizing that they are content first, they just happen to be sheltered.

419
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:55,157
And so how does that fit into those clusters of teams?

420
00:39:55,977 --> 00:40:06,920
I'd also want to think about to the proximity of the ESL classes to the ELA classes and recognizing and remembering that ESL classes are those students ELA classes.

421
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,042
And I would love just if we're thinking about proximity of departments and teachers for there to be a greater bridge between

422
00:40:15,862 --> 00:40:17,544
the ESL world and the ELA world.

423
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:24,249
And also in terms of our registration office, I think we have a really great model right now.

424
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:31,495
It's very visible when you first walk into the building, and I think it sort of celebrates that part of our community.

425
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:39,722
So I'd love to continue to have a really visible, even more visible registration and EL department

426
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:46,148
offices that is accessible for the greater community, too.

427
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,151
Thank you.

428
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:49,792
Thank you.

429
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:52,415
That is a great vision.

430
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:56,380
All right, Lisa.

431
00:40:58,515 --> 00:40:58,555
Hi.

432
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:06,139
So I think that a lot of my thinking comes through the vocational school, since that's where I teach.

433
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:19,266
I think that it's really important to really listen to the teachers around vocational education, because each shop is so unique, and its needs are so unique.

434
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:22,908
And they're different than a typical classroom.

435
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:26,149
So I think it's been great, all the

436
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:33,054
Architecture team has talked with all of the vocational teachers and I think that's great.

437
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:45,503
I think that that conversation needs to continue because there are really unique needs in just in terms of the equipment that's needed, access to the community.

438
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:46,384
Many of the

439
00:41:48,132 --> 00:42:01,997
Programs do have interactions with the community, whether it's through the Bistro 49 and having customers come in, or the salon for cosmetology and having clients come in, or auto tech and having people come in and get their cars fixed.

440
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:07,559
So it's a very different kind of interaction with the community than most of the school has.

441
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:12,260
Also, there's this beautiful collaboration that happens between a lot of the shops.

442
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,121
They work together.

443
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:38,635
One of the ideas I've heard come up that I think would be great is the idea of like having a model house that the students can work on, so the electrical students can work on the electrical aspects of the model house, the plumbing students, which will be starting soon, you know, carpentry, construction craft laborers, having like that model house would be a really great collaborative space for the vocational students, I think.

444
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:42,457
I think

445
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:50,829
Again, just listening to the really unique needs of each of the programs.

446
00:42:51,810 --> 00:43:07,684
I think one of the things that I've been thinking about that I don't fully understand how it will play out in the long run is the teacher space, teacher classrooms, whether teachers will, in the main academic classes, will continue to have individual classrooms or whether they'll be all shared.

447
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:16,648
and how that will play out and really having meaningful conversations with the teachers to understand how that would work if there was more shared classrooms.

448
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:25,411
I think the other thing that one of the things that I felt was incredibly useful was touring other schools over the summer and seeing

449
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:35,886
the design decisions that were made, and really learning from the other schools what's worked really well for them, what hasn't worked as well.

450
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:40,914
Maybe what seemed like a good idea, but in practice was like, that's not really working.

451
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:46,019
You know, what kind of collaborative, we talked a lot about collaborative spaces so far.

452
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,303
What kind of collaborative spaces actually get used and how do they get used?

453
00:43:50,683 --> 00:44:02,333
And really, I want to, you know, this is such a huge opportunity for our community and I want to learn from other communities from what they've, you know, what insight they've gained from their own experiences.

454
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:08,696
Yeah, that has been sort of the really wonderful opportunity of doing the tours.

455
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:21,819
And I think probably the most valuable part of the tours from our perspective and maybe from others as well is the fact that administrators or teachers, educators are walking us around and they're telling us what works and what doesn't work.

456
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:27,200
I think everyone was very truthful and forthright with us because there are some things that are successful.

457
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,780
There are some things that were less successful.

458
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,541
And hearing those sort of that unvarnished opinion

459
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:38,800
from the people that are actually in these buildings, tremendously, tremendously useful to the conversation.

460
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:47,343
And we will definitely dive a bit more into that shared classroom model as we go forward, because we know that there is a lot of interest there.

461
00:44:49,903 --> 00:45:00,327
Lisa, I think the other thing like worth mentioning is that there is a lot of conversation going on around change and like,

462
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:13,413
What has to change in order to be able to utilize spaces differently and how you sort of get to a place where you cannot repeat those mistakes.

463
00:45:14,053 --> 00:45:17,314
And we'll probably talk about that in some of the upcoming building committee meetings.

464
00:45:17,354 --> 00:45:20,515
So if people want to join us, those meetings are open to the public.

465
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:25,737
But yes, the building isn't going to make you change.

466
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:28,983
you have to make you change.

467
00:45:30,245 --> 00:45:37,880
So there is a lot of conversation around that whole concept as well that is starting to happen across all of these sessions.

468
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:42,194
All right, Aaron, I think you were up.

469
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:43,895
Thank you.

470
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:51,339
I think like many members here and many members in the community, I think that I kind of want anything and everything, right?

471
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:58,703
There's so many different ideas that we all kind of want to put into one building because we want it to be like that universal design that we're talking about.

472
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:06,106
And it's challenging to kind of start saying what is realistic with the space that we have and the timeline and what fits our community needs.

473
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:20,213
And I know a couple other members have mentioned it, but, you know, when we talk about that universal design and equity, not just as like an abstract idea, but as like everyday experiences for all the users of the facility that we're talking about, I think is my biggest priority.

474
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:32,677
So when I talk about like accessibility and inclusion, that's built into not only like the design of the hallways and the classrooms, the shared spaces for faculty and staff, for people in the community to use.

475
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:37,278
We're also talking about how we are supporting learners of differing needs.

476
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:43,040
So the physical needs, sensory needs, linguistic negotiation needs as well.

477
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:45,281
That's a really big important thing for me.

478
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:47,442
I want this building to,

479
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:54,825
not have to ask students to accommodate to what the building can offer, I want the building to accommodate the students for what they need.

480
00:46:56,285 --> 00:47:05,729
Not only that, but I think also when we talk about including the community, there's many people in the community who can remember Medford High from 20, 30, 40 years ago and what that really meant.

481
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:33,175
um as a long-term medfordite for example versus families that are coming in today and there is some taboo that i think still is associated with the high school and like is it safe is it rigorous academically is it going to provide my students my family with what we respectively need as a family here in the city and i think a way to encourage people to feel more comfortable is to create a space that again is not just for the staff and students but also for the community use as they need it so they are not only encouraged to

482
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:41,421
send their students and their young ones to our buildings, but also to find themselves there too, to use the shared spaces that we're talking about.

483
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:54,511
I think a multi-tiered kind of universal design that I'm thinking about is going to offer at least one thing for everybody in the community, regardless of what that may be, you can find something there at the new building or the refurbished building.

484
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:02,385
And I think the last kind of portion of what I'm really excited about or I really want to work towards is continue to grow our competitive edge.

485
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:06,929
There's a lot of conversation at the federal level and the state level about school choice.

486
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,752
Research is showing that families are starting to negotiate.

487
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:21,360
Is it financially feasible to send our kids to another non-district school, for example, because of the opportunity that that supposedly offers athletically, arts-related, academically?

488
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,322
And I want our building to kind of be

489
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:27,883
again, anything and everything it needs to be for the respective family we're talking about.

490
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,223
So that's kind of a lot.

491
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:38,805
But I think that because we're talking about building something that's really never been done before in our city, it's the opportunity right now to start thinking, let's try everything.

492
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,005
Let's shoot for the stars.

493
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:43,666
And then we'll have to make those concessions when needed.

494
00:48:43,706 --> 00:48:45,407
But let's not make them too early.

495
00:48:45,427 --> 00:48:46,147
You know what I mean?

496
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:47,327
Yeah.

497
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:54,700
There's a lot of great aspirations in there and there's a lot of high bars, but it's good to have the high bar thing and for us to appreciate that.

498
00:48:57,863 --> 00:48:59,445
All right, Robert.

499
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:07,194
Rob's not with us today.

500
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:10,097
Okay, and then Ann Marie.

501
00:49:12,605 --> 00:49:20,032
Oh, it's lucky timing to go after Aaron because Aaron sort of encapsulated a lot of the things that I was already thinking both you and Colleen.

502
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:39,040
So my priority would be to focus, as Joan said, on students with disabilities, specifically the high needs learners who have specific programming needs, robust IEPs, multiple services, and really making sure that their academic needs are met.

503
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:44,164
I liked what I think Colleen said about reducing the stigma of going into a

504
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:56,139
specialized space, and almost thinking about it from the mindset of developing the classrooms and the learning spaces from what is the accessibility look like.

505
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,947
And when you're meeting the accessibility needs of people who might have particular access needs.

506
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:04,866
everybody's going to benefit from it, right?

507
00:50:04,886 --> 00:50:14,050
I mean, you think about like a curb cutout, you know, on the sidewalk, that's benefiting all of us, regardless of whether we technically need that curb cutout.

508
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:23,554
So sort of thinking like from the inside out of designing the space, what do students with high needs need?

509
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:26,155
Anybody can benefit from that.

510
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:27,955
is sort of my perspective.

511
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:32,376
And then also this concept of inclusion versus segregation.

512
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:52,421
Somebody said something about support teachers being across the building or having to go to a different location for specialized services and really thinking about like, it's not just about opportunities for inclusion, but it's really like inclusion being fundamental and not like inclusion versus segregation.

513
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:56,042
And so making sure that inclusion is like the foundation of what

514
00:50:57,183 --> 00:51:00,386
where you're starting and then going from there.

515
00:51:00,406 --> 00:51:01,968
Does that make sense?

516
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:06,272
It makes complete sense.

517
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:09,435
A foundational inclusionary goal is wonderful.

518
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,339
All right, Norm.

519
00:51:15,387 --> 00:51:16,027
I'm Norm Russo.

520
00:51:16,788 --> 00:51:22,389
I'm one of the biotechnology teachers and a CTE teacher just like Lisa Miller.

521
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:41,556
And I certainly, I think Lisa Miller was very eloquent in stating how our new school could accommodate the growing demand that we've been seeing for CTE education in our district.

522
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:45,138
And so I want to echo a lot of what she said.

523
00:51:46,259 --> 00:51:57,325
Certainly, I recognize a need for my program to change its space, to make it more accessible, and to keep up with the growing demand in the program.

524
00:51:58,126 --> 00:52:04,189
And also, I want to stress that the shop teachers, because everyone has

525
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:17,717
Everyone is representing their own industry has such unique and specific needs that the teachers be given a say and a hand in designing their space to meet their needs because I think they know best.

526
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:20,960
And so I said, I'm looking forward to that opportunity.

527
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:38,231
to creating a new space for biotech that's going to be accessible to everybody, but also reflect best industry practices and best prepare students for a career in the life sciences.

528
00:52:41,893 --> 00:52:42,174
All right.

529
00:52:42,474 --> 00:52:42,914
Thank you, Norm.

530
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:46,416
All right.

531
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:50,139
Next on the list we have Stacy, you're up.

532
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:53,164
Hi, thank you.

533
00:52:54,845 --> 00:53:03,192
I think in terms of the counseling department, first and foremost, it's pretty nice to hear what everyone else has to say in terms of like their dreams and goals.

534
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:14,242
And I agree with a lot of them, especially around focusing solely around our high needs students and that everyone can benefit from what high needs students benefit from.

535
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:17,265
In terms of the counseling department,

536
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:30,958
I, it was interesting to go to the other schools to see how they situated their counseling department Medford has gone through several iterations of how we place counselors how counselors work with other staff members.

537
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:44,876
I have seen that a lot of students benefited significantly from the house model that we have created, where we have two school counselors and at least one adjustment counselor and perhaps another service member as part of that house.

538
00:53:46,296 --> 00:53:53,118
I think that it has provided a lot of data opportunities for everyone to sit together and talk about what do students need?

539
00:53:53,198 --> 00:53:54,338
How are we supporting them?

540
00:53:54,358 --> 00:54:01,420
I think it provides students a home base to go to, and also an opportunity for counselors to collaborate with each other.

541
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:17,880
I certainly think that there is becoming more and more of a need for mental health services, which occupy a lot of a school counselor's time, even though they're also working on, of course, everyone's working on post-secondary planning for students holistically, right?

542
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:22,901
Whatever our role is, that is our goal, to get somebody off and well in the world.

543
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:27,983
So I think having counselors to have the ability to work together,

544
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:35,145
I think having a specific college and career center space is really important.

545
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:42,370
Right now we have a conference room that we have sort of dedicated, but we can't fit more than 10 people in there at once.

546
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:58,240
So when we're bringing in speakers or schools or other folks to talk about careers, we're really having to utilize other spaces, which is pretty limiting or outside the CAF, which is also not a great space for us, but has a lot of traffic.

547
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:09,747
And then the other consideration, which I'd previously talked about, is having the space for community mental health care within the health office suite.

548
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:33,808
In my conversations with other schools and providers, the connection to the health suite is really important, both for their billing and what they need, but also for the ability to add a nurse practitioner who could potentially do med management as well, which we have seen such a need for, for our students who are unable to get care elsewhere.

549
00:55:33,928 --> 00:55:35,449
So those are my top priorities.

550
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:38,810
Great, thank you.

551
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:41,856
All right, Cooper.

552
00:55:44,618 --> 00:55:45,679
Is Cooper not with us?

553
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,000
No.

554
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:48,522
OK, then Kim.

555
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:55,768
It's hard to go at the end.

556
00:55:55,808 --> 00:55:56,729
John, I don't envy you.

557
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:57,870
You're the last of all of us.

558
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:16,099
For my role, my goal is to deliver on our promise to the citizens of Medford, which is to ensure that kids who leave us are able to thrive in and positively impact the world that's available to them when they leave.

559
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:23,022
And so what that looks like now and what it looks like 10 years from now and 20 years from now could be really different.

560
00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:29,685
And so thinking about what my goals and dreams are, I feel like we need to design, as other people have said, for

561
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:31,138
flexibility.

562
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:38,041
We need to design in a space that lets teachers change and adapt to what the students need as they come in to the world.

563
00:56:39,002 --> 00:56:43,704
We know that part of our job as teachers is to help kids

564
00:56:44,282 --> 00:56:54,087
develop positive identities, both academic identities and social identities in the building can impede us from doing any of those things.

565
00:56:54,428 --> 00:57:07,735
So big vertical spaces that allow students to make their thinking visible and provide lots of sight lines, and let them grow in the sunlight rather than in dark spaces where many of us are now, I think would be really important.

566
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:13,198
Thoughtful adjacencies, eating spaces, these are things that really matter a lot

567
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:29,549
Some of the things that I noticed in some of our building tours that I really liked, that I would love to see Medford adopt as well, is I love the cafeterias in places like Wealtham, for example, that have lots of different seating options.

568
00:57:29,609 --> 00:57:34,012
There's some counter standing, there's some low tables, there's some high tables.

569
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:44,299
In a space that has lots of sight lines, because we don't have hundreds of people staffing lunch, we need students to feel seen and safe.

570
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:53,712
And we need a space that also can provide maybe some quiet moments for kiddos for whom a big loud space is just too much.

571
00:57:53,812 --> 00:57:54,913
I loved some of the library.

572
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:55,653
I see Dana nodding.

573
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,514
Dana and I were partners.

574
00:57:56,534 --> 00:57:57,515
We hit this tour together.

575
00:57:58,836 --> 00:58:09,085
Some of the library spaces were really beautiful, especially the ones that had big glass rooms as part of the library that the doors could open between them.

576
00:58:09,165 --> 00:58:11,306
It seemed like it was a space for gathering for,

577
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:15,831
two or three classes worth of students and teachers.

578
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:16,991
It could be made smaller.

579
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:23,372
Lots of sight lines through a library with collection of books is really important as well.

580
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:35,375
And I particularly appreciated the adjacencies that we saw in Weymouth where clusters of rooms had a common space that was adjacent to all of them.

581
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:44,058
I do think part of being flexible for teachers is not making a sign up two weeks in advance to take our kids to a space that's bigger and more fun than our classroom.

582
00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:48,000
I think having and have to compete with lots of teachers for that.

583
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,762
I can't imagine that's been the same for the last 30 years.

584
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:52,683
I can't imagine it's going to change in the next 30.

585
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:55,024
So having those spaces available is really important.

586
00:58:56,405 --> 00:59:00,888
And the final thing I'll say is that I think one of the challenges of designing a school

587
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:07,759
one that has both CTE and an academic side, is we're designing for the students, but the adults work here too.

588
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:14,846
And so in order to build that sense of community among the adults, we need places for the adults to gather in professional learning.

589
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:20,992
So gathering a faculty that's as big as this high schools in an auditorium is not going to cut it for us.

590
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:24,155
Our adults, in order to be the best they can for our kids,

591
00:59:24,844 --> 00:59:32,390
They need spaces to collaborate that lets them be as flexible as how we're asking them to be for our students.

592
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:34,973
John, did I leave you anything to say?

593
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:36,174
You're last, my friend.

594
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:42,679
Well, John, I don't mean to steal your thunder, but Nicole is going to go after you.

595
00:59:42,819 --> 00:59:43,820
She slid right in there.

596
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,384
So I'm not sure if that's a positive thing or a negative thing, but that's just the reality of where we are.

597
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:50,446
But definitely, you're up, John.

598
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:51,928
Perfect, works for me.

599
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,495
So let's see.

600
00:59:57,233 --> 01:00:02,136
I try to use my headphones real quick because my kids are going to be creating chaos in my house in a moment here.

601
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:08,961
So a lot of the things I was going to say have already been said, but I wanted to focus on two aspects.

602
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:16,146
I saw some missed opportunities in some of the schools we saw in terms of just the classroom design themselves.

603
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:20,689
So I think most of our learning is going to happen in those classrooms, and I thought there was

604
01:00:21,509 --> 01:00:37,876
opportunities with, like expanding the whiteboards, expanding some of that stuff that would help in ways just within the room, but I did love the excitement of some of the opportunities with the different configurations, the desks and chairs and those types of things that I'm excited about.

605
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:47,300
I think our school, as a science teacher, I already have a nice room and I already have a lot of that flexibility, but I think much of the school is going to really appreciate those opportunities.

606
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:50,122
The other thing that jumped out at me was the community spaces.

607
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:54,548
I felt that I don't.

608
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,415
How do I put it, I guess, in terms of the community spaces.

609
01:00:58,936 --> 01:01:02,363
If it's just a matter of me taking my kid my my classroom to a.

610
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:08,620
novel location, to me, that's not going to be a useful location for us in the building.

611
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:18,248
Like I wanted to have something that's either got supplies, materials, something that I can't do in my classroom, or a larger space where multiple classrooms can get together.

612
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:22,412
So I saw a bunch of spaces on the tours where I looked and I was like, all right, this would be cool.

613
01:01:22,652 --> 01:01:25,995
I bring my kids here, but I don't think it would provide any better learning

614
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:27,516
than in my classroom.

615
01:01:28,176 --> 01:01:32,219
So I was really blown away with the unique things like the Bill Ricka black box theater.

616
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:45,767
I think that's something that makes a school kind of unique and special in the cafeteria spaces being wired so they could be like, I think it was Bill Ricka that had the main caf, but they also had the smaller caf on the side.

617
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:51,128
Um, and that was a perfect space for, like, a larger collaboration.

618
01:01:51,228 --> 01:01:55,709
Multiple classes could get in their faculty meetings, whatever it is.

619
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,670
So I liked those things.

620
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,231
Um, the, I think it was in Chapman.

621
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,551
Uh, we saw, like, the, um.

622
01:02:05,372 --> 01:02:12,134
kind of smaller phys ed rooms where they had like almost like a boxing room, they had a dance room, they had all those types of things.

623
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:22,476
To me, I found those, I know they're not kind of like big open spaces, I found those more valuable than some of the big open like hey just bring your class here spaces.

624
01:02:22,496 --> 01:02:27,338
So those were exciting and I really loved and we have two lecture halls at

625
01:02:29,298 --> 01:02:47,242
at Medford High School that are just in such disrepair, but you saw them nice and how useful things like that could be at some of these other locations where you could bring in those guest speakers for Veterans Day and things like that and have a nice quality setting for them.

626
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:53,983
So those were more attractive to me than the small, like, hey, let me just take my individual class to this area.

627
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:55,944
I like the bigger,

628
01:02:56,664 --> 01:03:01,706
settings and the versatility of those settings stood out to me on the tours.

629
01:03:02,526 --> 01:03:02,887
That's all.

630
01:03:04,487 --> 01:03:04,767
Great.

631
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:05,228
Appreciate it.

632
01:03:06,228 --> 01:03:07,769
And now, Nicole, you get to wrap things up.

633
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:09,149
OK.

634
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:16,792
So I'm just can I wrap things up by just saying yes, yes, yes, and yes, because everything that everyone said really resonated with me.

635
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:23,195
The flexibility, the the knowledge and the responsibility of knowing that whatever we're creating

636
01:03:24,094 --> 01:03:30,421
is going to go well beyond, you know, most of us, right, and future generations.

637
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:34,225
So I think keeping that flexibility in mind is critical.

638
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:44,576
If I want to speak, if you want me to speak directly to humanities, I know that Dana and Maddie outlined some of what I shared as well.

639
01:03:45,347 --> 01:03:55,155
For humanities, I really do want to see a humanities hub that allows for those interdisciplinary opportunities beyond just English and social studies.

640
01:03:55,776 --> 01:04:03,482
Right now, social studies and English teachers are all over the place in the building, so it would certainly be nice to have them together more to collaborate.

641
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:12,136
But in addition to that, we do have social studies teachers that are teaching art and ideas or the history through the arts.

642
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:17,059
And so there's a lot of different disciplines that encompass humanities.

643
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:20,842
And I would like to see our new building allow for more of that.

644
01:04:21,746 --> 01:04:33,858
The other thing that's really important to our department is understanding that learning goes well beyond these four walls of our building.

645
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:36,880
So we already do a lot of simulations.

646
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:39,723
We do a lot of conferences with Model United Nations.

647
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:42,486
We Zoom with third world countries.

648
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:46,269
But we don't have a space to really do that effectively.

649
01:04:47,010 --> 01:05:09,459
I would hope that our humanities hub could have some of those smaller spaces to allow for those simulations, those conferences, and those and just to kind of be able to continue engaging in our partnership, maybe even hosting more mock trial debates, things like that, where we really don't have a space to do that right now.

650
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,120
And I know we're just bursting at the seam to do that.

651
01:05:14,554 --> 01:05:19,918
The other thing that we've talked about in my department is that writing center.

652
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:34,430
But the writing center, you know, we want to have it where it's offers quiet spaces for conferencing, for writing and for getting support and that it's open to everyone since literacy really does extend across all subject areas.

653
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:37,993
So, you know, that's that's something we're lacking.

654
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:41,136
And I, I just really

655
01:05:41,987 --> 01:05:46,209
I think that that is critical as it just kind of hits all the different disciplines.

656
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:57,553
Within the classroom itself, on multiple tours a couple of weeks ago, I really did love how the classrooms opened into different shapes and sizes.

657
01:05:58,313 --> 01:06:08,177
I liked how they really lent, many of them lent themselves well to project-based learning, which is very much emphasized in the humanities department.

658
01:06:09,237 --> 01:06:11,358
I need to see a classroom where my students can

659
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:14,919
work in lit circles, but they can also be conferencing with teachers.

660
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:24,660
They can do a variety of project-based learning within the classroom itself and not have to wait for a space to be available to do that.

661
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:36,383
So those are basically the main components of what I wanna see for humanities, but I do echo everyone on this call with their needs.

662
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,523
I'm really excited for this

663
01:06:39,004 --> 01:06:44,948
Dana's point regarding maintaining the historical aspects of Medford is really important.

664
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:48,190
I know that we have Amelia Earhart's propeller.

665
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:50,532
It used to actually be in my office at one point.

666
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:56,475
We have so many historical pieces that need a better place to be showcased.

667
01:06:56,596 --> 01:07:00,498
It's not in my office anymore, but you know, Medford is so rich in history.

668
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,260
So I would really love to see that come alive as well.

669
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:04,761
Thank you.

670
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,306
Thank you, Nicole.

671
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:11,469
I'm also now going to be drafting you into the interior design advisory team.

672
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:12,229
Thanks.

673
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:13,270
I volunteered.

674
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:14,331
I volunteered myself.

675
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:16,352
That's fine.

676
01:07:17,173 --> 01:07:20,415
Let me just pull up the slideshow again.

677
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:24,678
I think I could use.

678
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,180
There it is.

679
01:07:34,026 --> 01:07:36,068
Give me a second to come up for everybody.

680
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:54,681
So again, this is a duplicate of the slide that we saw previously, but just as a reminder in terms of what is upcoming in terms of our conversation, we are going to take all of the topics, the ideas that have been brought up, and we'll try to find commonalities where we can.

681
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:58,684
And we're going to dive deeper into each one of those as we move forward.

682
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:16,714
We've been putting these slides together just to give you a little bit of a sense of maybe what we'd be talking about if we hadn't already heard any of the topics that people brought up, just as things that we know we need to have conversations on.

683
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:23,578
And I think there's a lot of things here that we did hear today from members.

684
01:08:24,818 --> 01:08:30,621
One of the more interesting items is that first one on the list, though, the toilets.

685
01:08:31,447 --> 01:08:37,513
And I know that this is not going to turn into a toilet room advisory team.

686
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:39,255
No one would have signed up for that.

687
01:08:40,336 --> 01:08:47,103
But it is something that is important when we talk about equity specifically in terms of how those are used.

688
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:53,450
And we also know that it's a pain point in terms of what the experience is in the building today.

689
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:59,169
And also as we went on those school tours, it's a pain point in brand new buildings as well.

690
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:11,679
And we saw some extremely unfortunate resolutions in brand new buildings and talking with administrators there, there were no magic bullets to be able to solve that particular issue.

691
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:23,429
There was a very almost humorous exchange with the principal over at the Chapman School, middle school, where we walked by an open airport entry toilet room

692
01:09:23,896 --> 01:09:27,157
And somebody asked, well, like, how do you like those open airport?

693
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:28,178
And he said, don't do that.

694
01:09:28,578 --> 01:09:31,099
Don't do the open, open toilet room entrances.

695
01:09:31,179 --> 01:09:35,541
And then we had a little bit more of a conversation and someone said, well, would it work if we put doors on it?

696
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:37,822
He's like, no, no, no, don't, you can't put doors on them either.

697
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:42,124
And so he ended up saying, it's probably like no toilet rooms at all.

698
01:09:42,664 --> 01:09:43,704
That would, that would solve it.

699
01:09:43,724 --> 01:09:45,745
So there was no good solution there.

700
01:09:45,785 --> 01:09:49,707
We saw another airport entry toilet room where the school had installed

701
01:09:50,383 --> 01:09:59,390
closing scissor gates in front of it, just to lock students out of a particular toilet room, which is so just reverting back to what a door on the toilet room would do.

702
01:10:00,391 --> 01:10:11,940
So there was no real good success there, but I did want to take a second and just preface that we will talk about it at the next meeting because it does warrant conversation and it needs ideas and conversation.

703
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:17,664
And just the fact that there's going to need to be acceptance of change there as well.

704
01:10:17,724 --> 01:10:19,586
That topic came up earlier, right?

705
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:30,822
that there's going to need to be a change in terms of student behavior, in terms of adult expectation, and certainly change in terms of the design, sort of level of cleanliness of the toilet room.

706
01:10:30,842 --> 01:10:36,804
Some of the things that we heard from students earlier are all sort of that play in terms of that particular topic.

707
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:42,867
So we know it's not a simple one, but it is one that we need to talk about collectively and

708
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:53,391
It does have impact also on the perspective of equity from creating toilet facilities that are welcoming for everybody that's going to be using the building.

709
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:58,613
And that includes both sort of gender identity questions.

710
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:06,097
It includes physical accessibility as well to make sure that differently abled people are completely comfortable using different toilet rooms.

711
01:11:06,397 --> 01:11:12,020
There's that strange reality right now that we do have accessible toilet rooms in the building that aren't actually accessible.

712
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:18,533
So we have to overcome a lot on that particular topic, and that's why we're going to spend a little bit of air time there.

713
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:32,962
But I do think that we've heard about most of the rest of these, again, either today or sort of as we've been going through the different visioning meetings, the different programming meetings, and then even the shadowing day.

714
01:11:32,982 --> 01:11:36,944
So there will definitely be more to come as we go forward.

715
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:42,087
We'll do a little bit more presenting as we proceed, as we go through.

716
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:47,269
We're still definitely looking for this to be a conversation.

717
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:51,110
We're not just going to be showing you things and saying that this is how it's going to be.

718
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:52,651
We need the feedback.

719
01:11:53,051 --> 01:11:55,092
We need to understand if we're moving in the right direction.

720
01:11:55,512 --> 01:12:01,655
And again, this advisory team eventually will be making recommendations to the full building committee on these particular topics.

721
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,481
I think that is where we are.

722
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:08,743
We actually have a little bit of time here at the end.

723
01:12:09,804 --> 01:12:16,988
I'm happy to field any additional questions or thoughts or people want to just sort of elude anything.

724
01:12:17,328 --> 01:12:21,271
But I'm also happy to let people have another 60 minutes back into their lives.

725
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:26,114
And either scenario is excellent from our perspective.

726
01:12:28,235 --> 01:12:30,637
But I will pull the screen share down again.

727
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:42,205
All right, I'm not hearing a clamoring for folks that would like to offer anything up.

728
01:12:42,305 --> 01:12:43,287
I know it is late.

729
01:12:44,309 --> 01:12:45,592
Matt, Dana has her hand up.

730
01:12:45,912 --> 01:12:46,373
Oh, I'm sorry.

731
01:12:46,393 --> 01:12:46,974
I couldn't see that.

732
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:47,675
Go ahead, Dana.

733
01:12:49,113 --> 01:12:52,837
Hi, so there was a couple things that I thought of afterward that I wanted to bring up.

734
01:12:53,918 --> 01:13:07,452
I also wanted to add about considerations of safety, both entrance and exit points within the building, but also the parking lot and just how the flow is going to look in a revised space or a new space.

735
01:13:09,374 --> 01:13:16,564
Leaving on time today to get to this meeting because I have a long drive, I was in the parking lot in a gridlock for 20 minutes.

736
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:26,217
So like there are definitely considerations about how this new building or again revised entry and what flow will look like and just from a safety standpoint.

737
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:33,282
We also have kids that are trying to get out five minutes early and they're rushing out because of that gridlock.

738
01:13:33,362 --> 01:13:44,169
So I do think we have a lot of lost opportunities for instruction because this is probably a bigger issue there that we're having a hard time managing on

739
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,111
other levels.

740
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:53,958
The other thing I wanted to think about too is about we talked about quiet spaces and a lot of safe spaces for kids.

741
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:56,280
We need those in classrooms too.

742
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:07,611
A lot of teachers have their own kind of quiet calm corners if you will and being able to maintain that for our students and also I thought a lot about noise on our tours and

743
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:10,732
you know, in Medford, it's so loud.

744
01:14:10,952 --> 01:14:19,917
So, you know, our stairwells and the materials that we're using and the fact that they're so small and tiny and contained, it's like overbearing noise.

745
01:14:20,678 --> 01:14:30,003
And in each classroom, while I was being a student, I could hear very easily all the instruction coming from both sides of the room from the surrounding classrooms.

746
01:14:30,603 --> 01:14:35,726
So just thinking about quality for our students and being able to concentrate and

747
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:41,991
have a space where people were able to have that appropriate sensory experience.

748
01:14:42,571 --> 01:14:49,777
I felt a lot of times that I was overwhelmed and I was like, wow, I can't think about how our kids are handling that, going through this intensity all the time.

749
01:14:51,018 --> 01:14:53,080
So anyway, I just wanted to say that because I forgot about those moments.

750
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,562
I certainly appreciate that.

751
01:14:55,622 --> 01:14:59,826
And again, I'm going to offer more advisory team participation role to you, Dana.

752
01:15:00,614 --> 01:15:05,917
If you stick around for another 14 minutes, we're going to be talking about the site aspect specifically.

753
01:15:06,077 --> 01:15:09,299
So there's certainly a lot more to come there.

754
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:11,800
And those meetings will be recorded as well.

755
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,501
So everyone will be able to sort of log on and listen in.

756
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:19,384
If you don't want to sit in that live, just to hear what the conversation, the discussions involve as.

757
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:22,620
Right.

758
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:33,904
I will just mention one thing I neglected to note when we were doing that wrap up slide, that the next meeting, we'll probably try to find a way to have a hybrid option there for those of you that would like to be in person.

759
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:37,706
It's a tricky time of year to begin with, right?

760
01:15:37,726 --> 01:15:40,887
So which is why the remote option works so well right now.

761
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,487
It just allows more participation.

762
01:15:43,428 --> 01:15:49,250
But there's also a lot of value that comes from us being in front of each other in terms of just being able to communicate a little bit better.

763
01:15:50,438 --> 01:15:53,240
And then Rosemary and I are both in love with Kelsey as well.

764
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:59,103
So we will require that Kelsey shows up to a hybrid meeting.

765
01:16:00,784 --> 01:16:01,745
You got it, deal.

766
01:16:04,046 --> 01:16:10,470
And then just for some housekeeping as well, we'll get the invites for the January meeting sent out before the holiday break.

767
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:15,352
And then they'll probably be updated when the location gets finalized.

768
01:16:15,412 --> 01:16:17,894
So just be prepared for that to hit your inbox.

769
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:20,690
Excellent.

770
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:22,351
All right.

771
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:23,232
Thank you, everybody.

772
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:30,015
Really appreciate the participation and late into the evening and look forward to the subsequent conversations.

773
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:33,657
Thank you.

774
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:34,157
Thank you.

775
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:34,858
Thank you.

776
01:16:35,698 --> 01:16:36,098
Thank you.

777
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:37,159
Thank you.

778
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,339
You can hang on to him if you want to.

779
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:50,761
If you really do want to, you're welcome to stay for the next one.

780
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:51,841
Sure.

781
01:16:52,081 --> 01:16:53,081
What is the time for that?

782
01:16:54,222 --> 01:16:58,783
So it's going to run from 530 to seven in terms of the timeframe.

783
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,544
So it's going to be the same link.

784
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:05,106
Do you mind if I just listen while I'm making dinner for my son here?

785
01:17:05,586 --> 01:17:06,746
That is perfectly fine.

786
01:17:06,766 --> 01:17:07,406
Okay.

787
01:17:07,686 --> 01:17:08,027
Thanks.

788
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:09,207
I won't call on you.

789
01:17:10,838 --> 01:17:13,239
Dana, it's also going to be streamed on our YouTube channel.

790
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:20,383
So if you'd rather just like have a live link up there as opposed to being on the Zoom, totally up to you, but that's an option as well.

791
01:17:20,743 --> 01:17:21,423
That would be a great idea.

792
01:17:21,443 --> 01:17:22,044
Thank you so much.

793
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:23,104
You're welcome.

794
01:17:23,504 --> 01:17:24,465
All right, then I'll do that.

795
01:17:24,685 --> 01:17:25,285
But I'll see you.

796
01:17:25,865 --> 01:17:27,086
All right, sounds good.

797
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:28,127
Thank you.

798
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:28,647
Thanks, Matt.

799
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:29,867
Thank you.

800
01:17:31,008 --> 01:17:35,750
Will, I see that there's somebody, John Prestigiovanni, in the room, in the waiting room.

801
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,271
Is he there for the second meeting?

802
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:37,651
Is that?

803
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:38,652
Yeah, yeah, he is.

804
01:17:40,637 --> 01:17:47,586
Yeah, so we're still live right now, so we'll just hang out for a little bit and then we'll roll right into the next one too.

805
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:51,971
Okay, I'll just pause and go off camera, but we'll be back in probably five minutes.

806
01:28:00,883 --> 01:28:01,824
Hello, everybody.

807
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:06,107
Hello.

808
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:09,989
Somebody needs to break the awkward silence at the beginning.

809
01:28:10,029 --> 01:28:11,270
That is always me now.

810
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:15,493
Everyone.

811
01:28:17,855 --> 01:28:18,095
Well.

812
01:28:25,132 --> 01:28:30,856
So Ken, are you taking over the ownership of the remote meeting at this point or is Will still up?

813
01:28:30,876 --> 01:28:31,677
There's Will, okay.

814
01:28:32,738 --> 01:28:33,118
Will's on.

815
01:28:33,578 --> 01:28:34,259
I'll still be here.

816
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:35,840
Thank you.

817
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,063
Appreciate you keeping us on the straight and narrow.

818
01:28:47,748 --> 01:28:55,356
So as we've been doing for each of these meetings, this is now the fourth and the final one in this sort of first round of these advisory team meetings.

819
01:28:55,376 --> 01:29:00,601
We're just going to give people probably about four or five minutes at the beginning just to hop on.

820
01:29:01,221 --> 01:29:04,565
So it will be a little quiet to start off with.

821
01:29:05,946 --> 01:29:11,532
If anyone wants this all the time, maybe you should get some elevator music or something similar.

822
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,251
And everyone, I'm not sure if you can hear me.

823
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:19,712
This is Jen Carlson from Love Field.

824
01:29:19,732 --> 01:29:26,657
But if you want to introduce me when you hit the introduction slides, I'm driving still, because it's that time of day.

825
01:29:27,998 --> 01:29:30,579
So just so you know, I can hear everybody very clearly.

826
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:36,103
I just cannot trustily unmute very quickly while driving.

827
01:29:36,763 --> 01:29:38,184
Yep, we got your back, Jen.

828
01:29:38,484 --> 01:29:39,025
Thank you.

829
01:29:39,045 --> 01:29:40,326
Thank you for the introductions.

830
01:29:41,486 --> 01:29:42,247
Stay safe out there.

831
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:01,050
Can everybody see that?

832
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:02,751
Is that up there on the screen for everyone now?

833
01:31:04,511 --> 01:31:04,811
Yes.

834
01:31:05,771 --> 01:31:06,071
All right.

835
01:31:14,013 --> 01:31:20,214
It's probably good for this advisory team discussion if you all just spend a little bit of time staring at the outside of the school on the site.

836
01:31:20,394 --> 01:31:22,595
It's definitely appropriate here.

837
01:31:29,357 --> 01:31:35,239
These images were taken as we flew a drone around as well, just to get some current aerial.

838
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:37,759
So they should be pretty up to date.

839
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:40,920
This isn't just a Google stock image.

840
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:46,282
I think it was obviously before the leaves started to fall off the trees.

841
01:32:06,434 --> 01:32:09,115
It is really interesting to see it from this perspective.

842
01:32:09,976 --> 01:32:13,378
There aren't a lot of images out there where you can see this.

843
01:32:14,698 --> 01:32:14,899
No.

844
01:32:16,099 --> 01:32:22,963
You can hop on Google Earth or Google Maps and sort of spin around, but it gives you sort of a grainy view of things.

845
01:32:26,285 --> 01:32:28,866
You can definitely see it from the other angles, too.

846
01:32:30,427 --> 01:32:30,967
We do have some.

847
01:32:31,227 --> 01:32:35,650
We can certainly, as we go forward, and we're probably jumping into sort of the content of the meeting.

848
01:32:36,898 --> 01:32:41,701
We can definitely share some other views from around from different perspectives as well.

849
01:32:41,761 --> 01:32:45,642
That's helpful to gain a different understanding as we move forward for sure.

850
01:32:47,123 --> 01:32:48,044
All right.

851
01:32:48,464 --> 01:32:52,526
Since we have already jumped in, I think I'm just going to get us going.

852
01:32:53,786 --> 01:33:00,269
And I just want to welcome everybody to this advisory team meeting for the Medford High School project.

853
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:05,532
This particular advisory team meeting is going to be focused on the site

854
01:33:06,258 --> 01:33:07,239
safety and security.

855
01:33:08,379 --> 01:33:13,081
And this is going to be the first meeting of four meetings that we have on this particular topic.

856
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:15,882
So happy to have everybody here.

857
01:33:18,783 --> 01:33:24,265
I am going to run through just a quick outline of what we're going to cover to start off with.

858
01:33:24,346 --> 01:33:32,769
So we're going to do some introductions, both from the project team, and we do want to hear each individual team member

859
01:33:33,877 --> 01:33:46,307
from Medford, introduce yourselves and give us just a very short explanation of what is your connection to the project or your role responsibility within the city, just so we have some context there.

860
01:33:47,408 --> 01:33:59,857
It would be helpful if everyone can have your video on while doing those introductions so we can put a name and a face together with the one caveat that if you are like Jen Carlson and you are driving,

861
01:34:00,774 --> 01:34:04,656
We completely understand and you do not need to put your camera on for that.

862
01:34:04,976 --> 01:34:07,117
We do want everyone to be safe.

863
01:34:09,438 --> 01:34:23,305
We're going to cover really the overview of what the advisory teams are intended to do and sort of the role of this meeting and the overall project and how the schedule, the cadence of these meetings is going to proceed.

864
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:25,726
And then we're going to jump

865
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:31,689
really into the heart of this discussion, which is more of a listening meeting.

866
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:43,051
We do want to hear from every team member who's in attendance what your priority goals are for the project through the lens of site safety and security.

867
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:50,173
We know that the members of this team have particular perspectives here, which is very much what we want to hear.

868
01:34:52,045 --> 01:35:21,528
This is both about the design team listening to all of your feedback, but there's tremendous value that comes here from letting each of you hear each other as well, trying to bring together a lot of different voices and perspectives from the community that maybe don't always get the opportunity to hear from each other and understand sort of how is everyone viewing the high school project and what are the goals that everyone is hoping to achieve through this project from your own particular perspective.

869
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:25,192
So we'll start off the introductions.

870
01:35:25,673 --> 01:35:26,673
My name is Matt Rice.

871
01:35:26,993 --> 01:35:30,295
I'm an architect and a principal in charge for SMMA.

872
01:35:32,496 --> 01:35:33,777
And good evening, everyone.

873
01:35:33,837 --> 01:35:36,358
Helen Fantini, project manager with SMMA.

874
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:42,562
Laura Sanchez here.

875
01:35:42,742 --> 01:35:43,942
Dramatic entry from Laura.

876
01:35:43,962 --> 01:35:46,984
All right.

877
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:55,586
Hi, everyone.

878
01:35:55,707 --> 01:35:56,147
I'm Sola.

879
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,308
Should I go ahead?

880
01:35:58,649 --> 01:35:59,209
Yeah, go ahead.

881
01:35:59,229 --> 01:35:59,449
Sorry.

882
01:35:59,549 --> 01:35:59,789
Okay.

883
01:35:59,869 --> 01:36:01,270
Hi, everyone.

884
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:02,371
I'm Sola Janka.

885
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:04,693
I'm an architectural designer here at SMME.

886
01:36:07,174 --> 01:36:10,297
Great.

887
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:11,057
Kate is out.

888
01:36:11,117 --> 01:36:12,138
So go ahead, Kasia.

889
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:13,659
Hi, everybody.

890
01:36:13,759 --> 01:36:14,720
I'm Kasia Rodrigo.

891
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:17,682
I'm an urban planner and a landscape designer at Agency.

892
01:36:17,702 --> 01:36:21,024
I support the team.

893
01:36:21,244 --> 01:36:24,006
Agency is our landscape architect team member.

894
01:36:24,715 --> 01:36:28,676
And I will say that they have the best name to refer to themselves.

895
01:36:28,696 --> 01:36:31,636
They call themselves agents at agency.

896
01:36:31,816 --> 01:36:36,237
So I think we're jealous and we may have to switch our firm name over to agency going forward.

897
01:36:38,038 --> 01:36:38,838
Matt, do you want to go ahead?

898
01:36:39,478 --> 01:36:39,658
Sure.

899
01:36:39,698 --> 01:36:40,458
Good evening, everybody.

900
01:36:40,658 --> 01:36:43,159
I'm Matthew Levine, good at Harvard Tech, Mark.

901
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:46,119
I'm an architect and security consultant for the project.

902
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,200
All right.

903
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,180
And I saw Matt, but we can jump on also.

904
01:36:54,328 --> 01:36:57,929
I'm having major, oh my God.

905
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:00,690
Can anybody hear me?

906
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:01,670
We can.

907
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:03,231
Oh, you cannot.

908
01:37:04,511 --> 01:37:04,991
No, we can.

909
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:06,492
Oh, you can, I'm sorry.

910
01:37:06,552 --> 01:37:08,232
My computer, I don't know what's going on.

911
01:37:08,552 --> 01:37:09,773
Hi everybody, I'm Matt Galussi.

912
01:37:09,793 --> 01:37:11,413
I'm a phys ed teacher at Medford High School.

913
01:37:12,354 --> 01:37:16,515
I'm really glad to be here and I'm thankful that I get to be a part of this.

914
01:37:18,203 --> 01:37:19,124
My apologies, Matt.

915
01:37:19,144 --> 01:37:21,305
I think it's very close in terms of the names.

916
01:37:22,126 --> 01:37:27,530
The Matt Galino is the project manager with Leftfield, our owner and project manager.

917
01:37:28,531 --> 01:37:32,393
So maybe I saw you jump on instead of him, and I actually mixed up the names.

918
01:37:32,473 --> 01:37:34,415
So my apologies there.

919
01:37:34,435 --> 01:37:38,077
And then Jen Carlson is also with Leftfield, the OPM.

920
01:37:38,117 --> 01:37:39,278
She is the one that's in the FAR.

921
01:37:40,379 --> 01:37:43,741
And I'm just going to do that introduction for her so that she can focus on the road.

922
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,903
All right.

923
01:37:46,775 --> 01:37:54,200
And Matt, I'm going to, um, I'll give you another quick opportunity, um, with a little bit more practice as we jump in, as we go through.

924
01:37:54,220 --> 01:38:05,188
Um, so I'm just going to run through, um, and if you're here, um, when I call it, if you could just do the introductions, that would be appreciated.

925
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:07,170
Um, so we're gonna start off with Nicole.

926
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:11,032
Hi, I'm Nicole Brandley.

927
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,455
I'm a current member of the Memphis School Committee.

928
01:38:14,615 --> 01:38:16,016
I'm also an outgoing member.

929
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:21,785
Um, but I'm also a mom of a 10th grader at Meffitt High School Vocational Technical High School.

930
01:38:22,626 --> 01:38:36,189
Um, and then I had a daughter that graduated this June, and I have been, um, an advocate for the last three years, um, to make sure that our students are doing the right thing, that we're safe, that we're following policies and procedures.

931
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:37,649
So I'm happy to be here.

932
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:42,530
And can I just say really quick, Chief Buckley, it's really nice to see you.

933
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:43,571
Chief Buckley's back.

934
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:44,431
Yay!

935
01:38:46,072 --> 01:38:46,452
Thank you.

936
01:38:46,812 --> 01:38:47,632
What an introduction.

937
01:38:50,933 --> 01:38:51,833
You're up, Chief Buckley.

938
01:38:52,774 --> 01:38:54,654
Welcome, everyone, and happy to be here.

939
01:38:54,694 --> 01:38:56,615
Jack Buckley, I am Chief of Police.

940
01:38:56,695 --> 01:39:03,556
It's good to have that title because it explains my role and what my goals are to kind of support this whole operation as we go forward.

941
01:39:03,576 --> 01:39:04,556
So looking forward to it.

942
01:39:04,596 --> 01:39:05,257
Welcome, everybody.

943
01:39:05,277 --> 01:39:05,537
Thanks.

944
01:39:06,637 --> 01:39:06,997
Thank you.

945
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:07,957
And hi, Addison.

946
01:39:08,877 --> 01:39:10,458
Adelaide, I want to make sure you pass that along.

947
01:39:10,518 --> 01:39:10,918
I said that.

948
01:39:11,874 --> 01:39:12,754
I will pass that along.

949
01:39:12,794 --> 01:39:14,895
Maybe at the end of the meeting, I can have her jump in for a second.

950
01:39:15,535 --> 01:39:15,895
Excellent.

951
01:39:16,195 --> 01:39:19,636
All right, Teresa.

952
01:39:20,717 --> 01:39:21,237
Hi, everyone.

953
01:39:21,257 --> 01:39:22,257
My name is Teresa Carr.

954
01:39:22,277 --> 01:39:23,998
I'm a Medford resident.

955
01:39:24,298 --> 01:39:26,798
I live right up the road, right on Winthrop Street.

956
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:29,979
I'm a mom to two future high school kids.

957
01:39:30,299 --> 01:39:35,761
I have a daughter in the fifth grade at the Brooks and a first grader over at the Missitook.

958
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:43,757
My area of expertise and the reason I'm on this committee is I'm a transportation planner, mobility planner.

959
01:39:44,558 --> 01:39:54,788
I've been doing this for about 25 years around the country, and I focus in public transportation, but also in active transportation.

960
01:39:56,469 --> 01:39:58,111
You are definitely in the right place, Teresa.

961
01:39:58,151 --> 01:39:58,531
Thank you.

962
01:39:59,752 --> 01:40:00,233
Amanda.

963
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:03,903
Hi, everyone.

964
01:40:04,023 --> 01:40:05,404
Amanda Centrella.

965
01:40:05,484 --> 01:40:10,287
So I work for the city of Medford in our Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

966
01:40:10,307 --> 01:40:26,178
I am an open space planner, so very excited to be a part of the conversation and to be thinking about sort of how, you know, green space, recreational facilities, etc, are incorporated in the site and

967
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:31,461
and sort of circulation in and through and around the site as well.

968
01:40:32,262 --> 01:40:33,783
So thanks so much for having me.

969
01:40:35,724 --> 01:40:36,145
Thank you.

970
01:40:37,786 --> 01:40:40,348
Matthew or Matt DeMaio?

971
01:40:40,628 --> 01:40:48,173
Matt wasn't able to make it tonight, and I believe Joe Hogan, who is our other student, is not on the call right now, but he may be joining shortly.

972
01:40:48,193 --> 01:40:49,454
OK.

973
01:40:50,134 --> 01:40:51,015
We'll keep going.

974
01:40:51,255 --> 01:40:52,576
We'll get going when you say it.

975
01:40:52,596 --> 01:40:53,116
That's great.

976
01:40:53,136 --> 01:40:54,978
So Todd.

977
01:41:00,908 --> 01:41:02,929
Todd Evans, Medford Fire Chief.

978
01:41:03,429 --> 01:41:08,210
So I'm just here to see where the big red trucks are going to be going, what they're going to be doing.

979
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:11,451
Thank you.

980
01:41:11,511 --> 01:41:12,552
Chief Evans, is that better?

981
01:41:14,072 --> 01:41:15,052
No, that's fine.

982
01:41:15,072 --> 01:41:15,313
Sure.

983
01:41:15,413 --> 01:41:15,633
Okay.

984
01:41:15,913 --> 01:41:16,173
Thank you.

985
01:41:17,732 --> 01:41:22,894
And Matt, sorry, I'll let you do a do-over in terms of the introduction because I put you on the spot there.

986
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:25,955
I appreciate that and sorry for all the confusion, everybody.

987
01:41:26,635 --> 01:41:29,076
Matt Colussi, Physical Education, Medford High School.

988
01:41:30,536 --> 01:41:32,917
I've been there since 2004.

989
01:41:33,117 --> 01:41:39,499
Super excited about this whole project and hopefully I can give you some insight on the building.

990
01:41:39,999 --> 01:41:40,740
I'm there every day.

991
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,682
There's just a lot I would love to see us get accomplished.

992
01:41:45,702 --> 01:41:47,243
So I'm super thankful to be here.

993
01:41:47,403 --> 01:41:47,963
So thank you.

994
01:41:49,424 --> 01:41:49,824
That's great.

995
01:41:49,844 --> 01:41:50,185
Thank you.

996
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:51,005
Jenny.

997
01:41:52,346 --> 01:41:53,387
Everyone, I'm Jenny Graham.

998
01:41:53,447 --> 01:42:00,031
I'm the vice chair of the school committee and the chair of the member comprehensive high school building committee.

999
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:08,316
So I have the lucky job that I get to sit on all of these advisory teams and

1000
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:11,176
1 of the reasons that I'm.

1001
01:42:13,157 --> 01:42:24,241
here and interested in that role is so that I can take copious notes about who to call when we have different problems to solve as this building design unfolds.

1002
01:42:24,321 --> 01:42:31,984
So I'm super happy to be here and I'm always so amazed at like how talented the residents of Medford are.

1003
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:41,087
In fact, when we put out an ask and get like just scads of interested people who are super qualified to support various efforts.

1004
01:42:41,167 --> 01:42:42,788
So welcome everyone.

1005
01:42:44,927 --> 01:42:45,308
Thank you.

1006
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,551
Brian.

1007
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:48,556
Howdy, everybody.

1008
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,980
My name is Brian Hilliard.

1009
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:53,269
I'm a parent of a junior at the high school currently.

1010
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:57,593
And I'm also a member of the building committee.

1011
01:42:57,773 --> 01:43:02,756
So I've been sitting in a lot of these meetings so far, and happy to be here.

1012
01:43:02,896 --> 01:43:08,961
I'm also an architect, and I love urban planning and all the design that goes with it.

1013
01:43:09,782 --> 01:43:15,125
So I'm happy to see how this unfolds, and looking forward to the future.

1014
01:43:15,146 --> 01:43:16,346
Thanks.

1015
01:43:16,366 --> 01:43:19,369
Thank you.

1016
01:43:19,409 --> 01:43:19,609
Joe.

1017
01:43:27,843 --> 01:43:30,367
or is Joe our other student that was potentially joining in?

1018
01:43:30,387 --> 01:43:32,150
Yeah, Joe's our other student.

1019
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:33,111
All right, thank you.

1020
01:43:34,213 --> 01:43:35,715
Alicia or Alicia?

1021
01:43:35,735 --> 01:43:37,578
Hi, thank you.

1022
01:43:37,718 --> 01:43:38,599
It's Alicia.

1023
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,026
I am the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the city.

1024
01:43:44,329 --> 01:43:48,152
I am actually the parent of a current Medford High junior.

1025
01:43:48,792 --> 01:43:50,794
Brian, I think our boys are good friends.

1026
01:43:52,135 --> 01:43:53,816
But I'm not sure that we've actually met.

1027
01:43:54,696 --> 01:43:58,079
And I have twins who have graduated from Medford High.

1028
01:43:58,739 --> 01:44:02,802
But I've also, through my work with the city, done a lot of work on building energy.

1029
01:44:02,962 --> 01:44:05,544
But I've sent a different staff person to that project.

1030
01:44:06,485 --> 01:44:15,577
One of the things that I was really passionate about, and then I actually I'm going to call out Matt Galussi, he was one of the instigators on getting students outside of the buildings during the school days.

1031
01:44:16,177 --> 01:44:24,288
And that is a project that he and I worked together on many years ago with a bunch of teachers to sort of make it natural and part of the curriculum.

1032
01:44:24,678 --> 01:44:29,683
that classes could just go outside into the fells as part of the regular school day.

1033
01:44:30,224 --> 01:44:46,380
And I have a lot of interest in both school security and the ability of students to not feel like they're in a jail, to feel like they have movement and freedom and the ability to do things and go places and have good healthy places to be going to school.

1034
01:44:47,477 --> 01:44:54,442
I've also done a lot of work with the buildings on waste and our next thing coming up maybe hopefully January is composting.

1035
01:44:55,263 --> 01:44:59,086
So I have a lot of interest in all these different kinds of areas.

1036
01:44:59,186 --> 01:45:01,908
Plus I am the sustainability director for the city.

1037
01:45:03,009 --> 01:45:04,410
And transportation, bikes.

1038
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:06,711
These kids got to start biking to school.

1039
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:07,472
Thank you.

1040
01:45:07,812 --> 01:45:09,333
I'll get off my soapbox now.

1041
01:45:10,614 --> 01:45:11,074
That's all right.

1042
01:45:11,175 --> 01:45:14,617
This whole meeting is a perfect opportunity for soapboxing.

1043
01:45:14,657 --> 01:45:15,838
That's what we're here for.

1044
01:45:17,392 --> 01:45:18,813
All right, Nick.

1045
01:45:23,676 --> 01:45:24,637
Good evening, everyone.

1046
01:45:25,897 --> 01:45:27,598
I hope y'all can hear me well.

1047
01:45:28,339 --> 01:45:28,579
Yes.

1048
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:36,424
My name is Nicholas Kalinga, or Nick.

1049
01:45:36,544 --> 01:45:37,785
Either way goes fine by me.

1050
01:45:39,438 --> 01:45:44,680
I am the disability specialist for the city of Medford.

1051
01:45:45,061 --> 01:45:57,046
I work in the office of DEI for the city, but I am also a lifelong Medford resident and also one of the

1052
01:46:03,959 --> 01:46:14,556
one of the members of the first class to go through the mimeoglyph from start to finish.

1053
01:46:14,616 --> 01:46:14,836
So I

1054
01:46:19,518 --> 01:46:22,760
I have lived in Medford for practically my whole life.

1055
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:27,682
And I am grateful to be here.

1056
01:46:28,702 --> 01:46:43,529
Not only am I the disability specialist, I also am a young man with, with my cerebral palsy.

1057
01:46:43,549 --> 01:46:45,030
So I do use a walker.

1058
01:46:46,752 --> 01:46:50,714
and other mobility devices.

1059
01:46:50,794 --> 01:46:57,816
And so this is very crucial for someone who would be in my shoes.

1060
01:46:57,896 --> 01:47:10,200
And so I am hoping to make the future high school not only an enjoyable place, but an accessible place for all people.

1061
01:47:11,361 --> 01:47:11,641
Thank you.

1062
01:47:13,327 --> 01:47:14,268
That is great.

1063
01:47:14,388 --> 01:47:15,810
We really appreciate your perspective, Nick.

1064
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:16,110
Thank you.

1065
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:17,752
Ethan.

1066
01:47:21,395 --> 01:47:23,476
Evening folks, Ethan Lay Sleeper.

1067
01:47:23,496 --> 01:47:34,559
I'm a Medford resident and I've got a class of 2037 and a class of 2040 kids.

1068
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:41,121
And my, professionally, I worked in architecture and planning.

1069
01:47:41,141 --> 01:47:45,523
I was also on the steering committee for the comprehensive plan.

1070
01:47:46,303 --> 01:47:53,988
Um, so have, uh, curiosity for all things planning and then also, you know, some personal interest in the future of the high school.

1071
01:47:54,309 --> 01:47:55,509
Uh, also, uh.

1072
01:47:57,210 --> 01:48:00,212
Live pretty close to the fells and spend a bunch of time in there.

1073
01:48:00,232 --> 01:48:11,880
And I, I see, uh, you know, this, this committee, obviously we want to ensure that the new master plan site plan is safe and accessible for all modes transportation.

1074
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,041
Um, and.

1075
01:48:14,902 --> 01:48:41,982
also to really take advantage of this amazing site that we have and really like hearing what Alicia was saying and saw Matt nodding his head too, but the fells and the resource there just to get outside and take a breath of fresh air, maybe even look at opportunities to expand educational opportunities related to outdoor recreation and beyond would be

1076
01:48:43,793 --> 01:48:46,594
great, great thing to kind of talk about here with all of you.

1077
01:48:49,316 --> 01:48:49,656
Ken.

1078
01:48:50,877 --> 01:48:51,577
Good evening, everyone.

1079
01:48:51,637 --> 01:48:52,317
I'm Ken Lord.

1080
01:48:52,357 --> 01:48:55,039
I'm the chief operations officer for the Bedford Public Schools.

1081
01:48:55,719 --> 01:49:03,303
I am in charge of facilities, technology and security, and I'm really excited to participate in this project to try to make all those things work for us.

1082
01:49:04,924 --> 01:49:05,444
Thank you.

1083
01:49:06,725 --> 01:49:07,105
Sean.

1084
01:49:08,346 --> 01:49:09,386
Hi, good afternoon, everybody.

1085
01:49:09,406 --> 01:49:10,527
My name is Sean Mangan.

1086
01:49:11,327 --> 01:49:12,348
Sorry, I'm in the car as well.

1087
01:49:12,408 --> 01:49:13,188
I apologize for that.

1088
01:49:13,972 --> 01:49:17,013
I'm the director of operations and communications at Armstrong Ambulance.

1089
01:49:17,633 --> 01:49:19,474
I've been with Armstrong for about 30 years.

1090
01:49:20,434 --> 01:49:25,835
I'm also a lifelong resident of the city, graduate of Medford High School, along with my son a couple of years ago who graduated.

1091
01:49:27,456 --> 01:49:32,877
Been in and around Medford High School for a long time, responded to hundreds of calls in there for EMS-related incidents.

1092
01:49:33,978 --> 01:49:37,279
I'm just here, glad to be part of this and to help out however I can.

1093
01:49:37,579 --> 01:49:37,879
Thank you.

1094
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:39,819
Thank you, Sean.

1095
01:49:39,859 --> 01:49:42,020
Great to have you here.

1096
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:42,320
Tim.

1097
01:49:43,866 --> 01:49:45,206
Hi everybody, Tim McGivern.

1098
01:49:45,447 --> 01:49:48,027
I'm the Commissioner of Public Works for the City of Medford.

1099
01:49:48,748 --> 01:50:05,533
So I'm in charge of the public ways, parks, the water system, sewer system, with engineering support, fleet, the fleet of the city, forestry, Oak Grove Cemetery, and we assist with the operation and maintenance of the school sites as well, especially during winter.

1100
01:50:06,634 --> 01:50:09,895
I also have two kids in the school system and

1101
01:50:11,222 --> 01:50:17,325
I was once a practicing civil engineer, licensed civil engineer, and my focus was insight development.

1102
01:50:18,106 --> 01:50:22,088
So, and you know, I worked on some MSBA school projects as well back in those days.

1103
01:50:22,528 --> 01:50:24,829
So looking forward to helping out wherever I can.

1104
01:50:26,811 --> 01:50:28,632
A great collection of folks that we have there.

1105
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:29,432
This is wonderful.

1106
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:31,153
John.

1107
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:39,698
Sorry, John McLaughlin.

1108
01:50:39,718 --> 01:50:40,318
We have two Johns.

1109
01:50:41,646 --> 01:50:42,966
Thought I saw John logged on earlier.

1110
01:50:42,986 --> 01:50:53,310
He definitely was on earlier, but I'll let you know if he's back on.

1111
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:54,050
All right.

1112
01:50:55,851 --> 01:51:00,272
And John, I'm not going to try and pronounce your last name because I'm going to get it wrong, so.

1113
01:51:01,533 --> 01:51:01,933
Thank you.

1114
01:51:01,993 --> 01:51:02,473
Thank you.

1115
01:51:03,453 --> 01:51:04,594
Good evening, everyone.

1116
01:51:04,634 --> 01:51:05,754
John Freschi Giovanni.

1117
01:51:07,895 --> 01:51:08,615
I'm a college

1118
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:13,731
Athletic coach up here, a sports coach at Mefford High School currently.

1119
01:51:14,611 --> 01:51:17,172
Long time Mefford resident, graduated Mefford High School.

1120
01:51:17,832 --> 01:51:24,534
My three kids have graduated from Mefford High School recently in the past, within the last 10 years.

1121
01:51:24,554 --> 01:51:33,236
Excited to be part of this group, hear what's going on and hope to give some insight with an athletic perspective.

1122
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:38,717
I also work part-time, off-season, in-season with

1123
01:51:39,573 --> 01:51:46,195
our turf fields and any type of athletic events, kind of like the sort of like coming in the back of a school type activity.

1124
01:51:46,215 --> 01:51:53,956
So things like safety and some of that and planning, you know, I'd probably give some insight on that to help this group go forward.

1125
01:51:55,697 --> 01:51:56,037
Thank you.

1126
01:51:56,097 --> 01:51:58,398
It does look like you're on site as well, too.

1127
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:00,358
I'm guessing there's something going on there this evening.

1128
01:52:01,358 --> 01:52:06,920
Yes, we have opening night for boys basketball, so we're very busy here tonight.

1129
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:07,560
Thank you.

1130
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:08,520
Thank you, everybody.

1131
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,561
And then lastly, Melissa.

1132
01:52:11,802 --> 01:52:12,783
Hi, I'm Melissa Young.

1133
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:14,184
I've lived in Medford since 2017.

1134
01:52:14,224 --> 01:52:18,768
I'm a municipal employee, just not for the city of Medford, I work for the city of Cambridge.

1135
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:23,052
I'm an enterprise application specialist, project manager, business analyst by trade.

1136
01:52:23,593 --> 01:52:28,957
So I was really wanting to be a part of the high school project.

1137
01:52:29,718 --> 01:52:32,100
And I have a daughter who is going into kindergarten next year.

1138
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,761
I live in Data and

1139
01:52:36,197 --> 01:52:42,039
decisions made in data, you know, made with data, operational efficiency, risk management, all that kind of stuff.

1140
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:47,881
And my skill set is cross-department collaboration across cities.

1141
01:52:47,941 --> 01:52:50,542
So like I know a little bit what goes on in every little department.

1142
01:52:50,562 --> 01:52:52,223
I read all the applications for the city of Cambridge.

1143
01:52:52,263 --> 01:52:54,744
If it comes from the public end, I've written it.

1144
01:52:54,824 --> 01:52:57,465
So I'm familiar with all the different departments' roles.

1145
01:52:57,545 --> 01:53:03,527
So while not the same skill set as everybody else here, I do feel like I can bring quite a bit to the table.

1146
01:53:04,887 --> 01:53:06,168
Yeah, no, it is great.

1147
01:53:06,348 --> 01:53:15,833
I mean, this, you guys are a wonderfully diverse group and sort of really pertinent and it's good to not have overlapping skill set, but really to have sort of complimentary skill sets.

1148
01:53:15,873 --> 01:53:18,634
And I think that's exactly what I'm hearing as we go through this.

1149
01:53:19,115 --> 01:53:23,437
I just want to make sure that I didn't miss anyone that hopped on that is maybe on now.

1150
01:53:26,578 --> 01:53:35,785
All right, not sound like that is the case, so let me just advance quickly here and then we'll get into an opportunity for everyone to dive a little bit deeper.

1151
01:53:36,926 --> 01:53:42,811
So just to explain what these advisory team meetings are there's a lot of meetings going on for the high school project at the moment.

1152
01:53:44,047 --> 01:54:05,078
But this particular set of meetings, not just this advisory team, but the other three that you see up on screen right now, are really a mechanism that we've used successfully in the past to collect diverse stakeholder input from a wide variety of voices across the entire community of Medford.

1153
01:54:06,364 --> 01:54:10,125
And so it's a classic challenge with these projects.

1154
01:54:10,145 --> 01:54:27,590
These are incredibly complex buildings, sites, efforts, design projects in terms of pulling together a whole bunch of different needs, all valid and all sort of needing to orbit around sort of a high school project, right?

1155
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:38,150
The core of this project is a high school, but we know that this this school building has so many other wonderful programs inside of it and serve the community in so many different ways.

1156
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:42,975
It's been referred to as the flagship multiple times and that really is what it is.

1157
01:54:44,014 --> 01:54:59,972
And so the four advisory team groupings that you see here, Sustainability and Peace Systems, this one, Exterior and Inter-Design, Educational Planning and Equity, they are not individual siloed activities of conversation.

1158
01:55:00,373 --> 01:55:03,757
We represent these as a Venn diagram on screen very intentionally.

1159
01:55:04,712 --> 01:55:08,554
There is a tremendous amount of overlap between all four of these.

1160
01:55:09,255 --> 01:55:17,539
But at the same time, we found that we need to give enough space to each one of these topics to be able to talk through the concerns that are surrounding them.

1161
01:55:17,959 --> 01:55:25,483
And then eventually what we're going to be doing is sort of bringing all those back into the purview of the full building committee for sort of acceptance.

1162
01:55:25,523 --> 01:55:33,387
And if there's any synergies or if there's any challenges that are found to be between competing interests, maybe between different

1163
01:55:34,235 --> 01:55:36,876
Advisory teams, those are the things that we're going to try to get into.

1164
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:43,397
And we want to really illuminate up front because we want to make sure, again, that we're hearing from all these voices as we go forward.

1165
01:55:47,058 --> 01:55:55,760
The particular objective of this advisory team meeting is very much aligned with what it implies in the title.

1166
01:55:56,751 --> 01:56:10,904
It is this overlap, this sort of collision of site safety and security, which may seem in some dialogues to maybe not be sort of related topics.

1167
01:56:11,905 --> 01:56:20,753
I'm actually getting the feeling based on sort of our participants here that you all are well versed in how really interrelated these things are.

1168
01:56:21,869 --> 01:56:29,171
And it's not a scenario where we're just taking a safety and security lens and saying, okay, like, how do we make the building safe and secure?

1169
01:56:29,631 --> 01:56:30,871
That's not the goal here.

1170
01:56:30,911 --> 01:56:43,233
We really need to take a perspective of once you enter the site off Winthrop Street, or even when you're on Winthrop Street approaching from different areas, what is that holistic view of safety and security?

1171
01:56:43,273 --> 01:56:47,474
How are those two things different but related in terms of considerations?

1172
01:56:48,056 --> 01:57:02,692
And then how do we really account for all the different needs that the site has, be it athletic field, be it access into the fields, be it pick up and drop off, for a whole variety, a host of programs, community access after hours to

1173
01:57:03,122 --> 01:57:03,962
things like the pool.

1174
01:57:05,083 --> 01:57:08,924
It's a fascinating and it's a complex set of issues.

1175
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:18,247
And so that's really why we have this advisory team to be able to dig into that and start to understand sort of where are the priorities and where are things that we need to focus on.

1176
01:57:20,167 --> 01:57:23,328
A quick contextual slide here in terms of schedule.

1177
01:57:24,049 --> 01:57:31,111
We are looking to open the new school or substantially renovated, added on to school in the fall of 2030.

1178
01:57:32,957 --> 01:57:35,139
That's all the way on the right-hand side of our slide here.

1179
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:39,703
We are on the left-hand side in the feasibility study, still more or less at the beginning of this effort.

1180
01:57:40,544 --> 01:57:51,172
The stars that you see here, one through four, are the different times that we're going to come together with each advisory team to have discussions about the project on this particular topic.

1181
01:57:52,734 --> 01:57:56,817
So to look at those four meetings and sort of the intent and games behind them,

1182
01:57:57,712 --> 01:58:00,653
This first meeting is very much intended to be a listening meeting.

1183
01:58:01,213 --> 01:58:07,136
Again, we are listening to you, but we also want to give you the opportunity to listen to each other.

1184
01:58:07,156 --> 01:58:10,857
The second meeting is when we will actually come with some material.

1185
01:58:11,477 --> 01:58:22,201
And we will, based on what we're hearing as sort of the topics that need to be covered, we'll put forward some graphic material and we'll present some concepts.

1186
01:58:22,975 --> 01:58:28,759
That will look for feedback on in that second meeting, which has been scheduled for January 13th.

1187
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,582
The 3rd meeting and the 4th meeting are really meant to refine these topics.

1188
01:58:33,622 --> 01:58:35,764
We want to make sure that we're hearing everyone correctly.

1189
01:58:36,764 --> 01:58:42,408
And that we can formulate recommendations that will be shared back to the full building committee.

1190
01:58:43,589 --> 01:58:45,390
So that's really sort of the through.

1191
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,142
meetings three and four, sort of the content moving forward.

1192
01:58:50,182 --> 01:58:53,785
And we're going to set those dates as we progress into the new year here.

1193
01:58:56,928 --> 01:58:57,268
All right.

1194
01:58:58,309 --> 01:59:03,153
So I'm going to hold down the screen share here.

1195
01:59:04,934 --> 01:59:11,660
And I just need to do the quick math of how much time we have available.

1196
01:59:17,492 --> 01:59:23,634
So we're going to shoot for about three minutes in terms of time from everyone.

1197
01:59:23,654 --> 01:59:32,537
I imagine that some folks may have more than three minutes in terms of what you want to share, because it's just an arbitrary time limit that we're putting out there into the world.

1198
01:59:33,437 --> 01:59:44,261
If there are things that you want to share with us, if you want to point us to particular requirements that your department or your commission have, or if you just have a longer statement that you want to share,

1199
01:59:44,868 --> 01:59:50,009
Um, we can definitely take those in after the fact, and we'll add those to the meeting record moving forward.

1200
01:59:50,189 --> 01:59:52,890
Um, just so we have sort of enough time for everyone to speak.

1201
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:54,390
Uh, cause that is important.

1202
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:58,931
Um, and if people want to spend less than three minutes, that's absolutely fine as well.

1203
01:59:59,331 --> 02:00:05,032
Um, I will try to keep track of things and I apologize in advance that I may interrupt you.

1204
02:00:05,352 --> 02:00:09,953
I actually didn't have to do that at all, um, during the last meeting, which was nice.

1205
02:00:09,973 --> 02:00:12,214
Uh, cause I am not the interrupting type.

1206
02:00:12,714 --> 02:00:13,534
Um, but I will.

1207
02:00:14,481 --> 02:00:15,562
jump in there if I need to.

1208
02:00:15,702 --> 02:00:25,352
So to lead things off, we're going to go back to the alphabetical list and we're going to be able to start off with Nicole.

1209
02:00:32,696 --> 02:00:33,676
I'm just going to listen for now.

1210
02:00:33,716 --> 02:00:35,297
I actually have to hop off in a minute.

1211
02:00:35,317 --> 02:00:36,437
It's my daughter's birthday.

1212
02:00:36,477 --> 02:00:37,537
I'm sorry, but I'm listening.

1213
02:00:37,557 --> 02:00:44,438
I'm usually not the one that is quiet, so I'll bring a lot to the table as the time goes on.

1214
02:00:44,858 --> 02:00:51,520
I think it's really important that we talk to our security monitors who are in the building every single day, and I'll make sure that I reach out to them.

1215
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:55,921
I really wish there was someone from the vocational team on this meeting.

1216
02:00:55,941 --> 02:01:01,282
I don't know if Jenny knows if someone from that side of the high school will be joining us at all.

1217
02:01:02,802 --> 02:01:05,684
But I think it's important to definitely talk to them.

1218
02:01:05,764 --> 02:01:10,105
They direct traffic, you know, the security monitors are out there directing traffic at times.

1219
02:01:12,626 --> 02:01:18,949
And so I think it's really important to have them, you know, their input with us, you know.

1220
02:01:18,969 --> 02:01:20,069
But yeah.

1221
02:01:22,923 --> 02:01:29,728
And Nicole, just so you know, there were no volunteers for this committee.

1222
02:01:29,788 --> 02:01:32,749
But if you hear of somebody who feels left out, please let me know.

1223
02:01:32,769 --> 02:01:34,991
I will make sure they're represented.

1224
02:01:36,012 --> 02:01:39,354
And then, but they are well represented across like every other.

1225
02:01:39,394 --> 02:01:39,734
I do know.

1226
02:01:39,934 --> 02:01:40,534
Yeah.

1227
02:01:40,554 --> 02:01:42,516
So not to worry about that.

1228
02:01:42,616 --> 02:01:46,398
And then Ken and John are both here and the monitors report up to them.

1229
02:01:46,498 --> 02:01:52,362
So they also will like channel to make sure that those folks are included in the conversation.

1230
02:01:53,068 --> 02:01:53,688
That's great to hear.

1231
02:01:53,768 --> 02:02:02,231
I think sometimes, obviously, perspectives can look different depending on who you're talking to.

1232
02:02:02,471 --> 02:02:12,655
So I just want to make sure that I reach out to as many people as possible to make sure that if there's anything that someone may not feel comfortable saying to everybody, that at least their words are being said from me.

1233
02:02:12,775 --> 02:02:13,735
So that's awesome.

1234
02:02:13,755 --> 02:02:14,095
That's great.

1235
02:02:14,135 --> 02:02:14,675
Thank you so much.

1236
02:02:14,695 --> 02:02:17,536
Thank you, Nicole.

1237
02:02:18,517 --> 02:02:19,657
So Chief Buckley, you're up next.

1238
02:02:20,509 --> 02:02:21,050
Thanks, Nicole.

1239
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:22,977
It's taken a few minutes, so let me get ready.

1240
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:25,786
Want me to reintroduce you, Jack?

1241
02:02:28,587 --> 02:02:33,369
So I'm going to stop, but one of the things I follow this, I know we have a new school.

1242
02:02:33,469 --> 02:02:35,810
I'm interested in what we're very early on.

1243
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:39,991
My understanding is there are no plans, no drawings, no site ideas.

1244
02:02:40,551 --> 02:02:47,534
So when you put up the dates and the expectations, I suggest that that's going to be a fluid process, right?

1245
02:02:47,574 --> 02:02:56,496
Because there's a lot of issues related to security and site that we're not going to be able to address until we get pen on paper and start looking at what we're looking at and designing.

1246
02:02:58,177 --> 02:02:58,797
That's number one.

1247
02:02:58,837 --> 02:03:08,763
The second part is, at least from my perspective, and I know we're talking in generalities now, but there are certain security aspects that we will not discuss in a public forum.

1248
02:03:08,783 --> 02:03:17,527
I mean, I know that might send some people off, but they're security reasons, they're security for a reason, and we want to do that.

1249
02:03:17,587 --> 02:03:20,589
So we can deal with that as we move on down the line.

1250
02:03:21,249 --> 02:03:25,131
Aside from that, you know, this is a historic site for the city of Medford.

1251
02:03:25,491 --> 02:03:26,452
It's a difficult site.

1252
02:03:27,425 --> 02:03:36,723
And we just the site in and of itself is going to have some things that we have to overcome for, you know, in the main sense, I think the access and egress, right.

1253
02:03:37,798 --> 02:03:38,878
can't do one road anymore.

1254
02:03:39,678 --> 02:03:48,780
That's going to be a problem for everyone who said they were an architect and an urban designer, like we'll get your thinking caps on because that is going to be an issue that we're going to have to start thinking about.

1255
02:03:49,801 --> 02:03:52,821
Outside of that, you know, security measures we'll deal with as we go along.

1256
02:03:53,582 --> 02:04:00,843
I would really like, and I know the architects are involved in this, but like simple things about making sure everyone understands what we're designing.

1257
02:04:00,943 --> 02:04:04,384
Like this is an A side of the building and a B side of the building, the C side.

1258
02:04:04,844 --> 02:04:11,369
Common terminology, numbered stairwells, numbered doorways, numbered locations for security cameras.

1259
02:04:11,449 --> 02:04:12,550
These are some basic stuff.

1260
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:17,273
So I'm just saying them out loud to give you an idea of what some of the things that I'm looking for.

1261
02:04:19,195 --> 02:04:22,277
Communications, capabilities on site.

1262
02:04:22,577 --> 02:04:30,603
We've spent years with an old high school and my police officers go into that school, can step into one location and not have any access to our radio communications.

1263
02:04:31,626 --> 02:04:37,788
We've worked with installing BDAs to overcome those things, but modern buildings are often tight buildings, right?

1264
02:04:37,848 --> 02:04:40,490
And they often come with their own communications problem.

1265
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:43,031
We need to think about that ahead of time, right?

1266
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:46,852
That's just not going to affect the police, but the fire or the EMS.

1267
02:04:46,892 --> 02:04:53,255
It's also going to affect internal communications between teachers and staff if they use things other than the PA systems.

1268
02:04:53,395 --> 02:04:56,336
But those are the things we have to keep in mind as we go forward.

1269
02:04:59,602 --> 02:05:01,723
You know, other than that, I think it.

1270
02:05:02,363 --> 02:05:14,787
Most of my issues or concerns might come up during the design phase right like I believe in open concepts right but this this like secure lobbies, open concepts sightlines people know where to go, and we need an easy building.

1271
02:05:15,608 --> 02:05:19,291
That high school, I heard everyone, a lot of people here say that they went to this high school.

1272
02:05:19,331 --> 02:05:20,952
That is not an easy high school to get around.

1273
02:05:21,352 --> 02:05:21,692
It's not.

1274
02:05:21,812 --> 02:05:23,994
We have to design a little bit more simply, right?

1275
02:05:24,014 --> 02:05:27,976
A little bit more understanding of where we are in that building and where we're going.

1276
02:05:28,477 --> 02:05:34,981
But I have confidence in the teams that are doing this, but I'm just telling you what my mindset is going into this whole process.

1277
02:05:35,441 --> 02:05:38,323
And thanks for the opportunity to kind of spot off a little bit on it.

1278
02:05:38,443 --> 02:05:38,944
Appreciate it.

1279
02:05:40,262 --> 02:05:53,294
Yeah, and Jack to your point, like, when there are those sort of confidential sensitive conversations, like, we will carve off and engage with you and Todd about those things.

1280
02:05:55,035 --> 02:05:57,137
The way that they need to be handled, because you're right.

1281
02:05:57,197 --> 02:05:57,457
Like, we.

1282
02:05:58,568 --> 02:06:01,232
It's not secure if you tell everybody your secure plans.

1283
02:06:02,874 --> 02:06:03,736
And I knew that would come up.

1284
02:06:03,796 --> 02:06:07,281
It's a matter of who's going to have those conversations.

1285
02:06:09,304 --> 02:06:09,985
Much appreciated.

1286
02:06:11,146 --> 02:06:12,968
just to give a little insight there too.

1287
02:06:12,988 --> 02:06:20,414
So we will certainly be coming and speaking in person with police and with fire to be able to run through those things in detail.

1288
02:06:20,434 --> 02:06:22,576
And that's typically how we will handle that.

1289
02:06:23,017 --> 02:06:33,306
So good to sort of keep things at a little bit of a higher level, but that was like an excellent start just in terms of what we're interested in hearing today in terms of what those priority goals are.

1290
02:06:33,326 --> 02:06:34,287
So I really appreciate that.

1291
02:06:35,808 --> 02:06:37,530
So I think Teresa, you are up next.

1292
02:06:38,422 --> 02:06:38,902
Thank you.

1293
02:06:39,122 --> 02:06:53,889
So you asked for my goals, and here I represent not just my own family and with my expertise in urban planning, transportation planning, but I serve as a representative of Medford Safe Routes to School Task Force.

1294
02:06:54,350 --> 02:07:01,813
I'm co-chair of Medford Mothers Out Front Transportation Task Force, and I'm a member of Walk Medford.

1295
02:07:04,103 --> 02:07:11,705
I would be really interested in seeing us open up the new high school to the street and to the community.

1296
02:07:11,725 --> 02:07:15,346
It's tucked too far back where it is currently.

1297
02:07:15,366 --> 02:07:23,448
The vast array of free parking encourages driving and traffic congestion along Winthrop Street.

1298
02:07:23,928 --> 02:07:29,250
And it honestly, the way it's situated, it discourages walking and cycling.

1299
02:07:31,827 --> 02:07:37,372
The location of the high school campus is not central to all of Medford's neighborhoods.

1300
02:07:37,973 --> 02:07:52,325
There is transit access and there is bike access to excellent transit if the site design did a better job of encouraging that bike access to transit.

1301
02:07:53,126 --> 02:07:58,531
I'd love to help this team figure out ways to encourage less driving for students,

1302
02:07:59,437 --> 02:08:01,859
for teachers and for staff.

1303
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:06,763
I'd love to see you open up the high school campus to the street.

1304
02:08:07,383 --> 02:08:10,386
I don't like that there's a sidewalk on one side.

1305
02:08:10,986 --> 02:08:17,491
I've ridden my bike up to Medford Family Network many times, especially when my kids were younger.

1306
02:08:17,512 --> 02:08:24,517
I also my daughter does the band camp in summer times and the two of us will ride our bikes together.

1307
02:08:25,078 --> 02:08:26,359
She uses the snare drum.

1308
02:08:26,419 --> 02:08:27,980
It's not easy on a bike.

1309
02:08:28,677 --> 02:08:34,459
And it's also not easy because that hill is a slight hill, but it's a hill.

1310
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:38,380
And what it does is it discourages cycling.

1311
02:08:38,881 --> 02:08:42,062
Not everyone is going to have an e-bike.

1312
02:08:43,042 --> 02:08:49,044
I agree with what someone else had to say about the permeability of the high school to the fells.

1313
02:08:49,644 --> 02:08:53,786
That's a secondary focus for my interests, but I do like it.

1314
02:08:54,763 --> 02:09:02,787
And finally, the vocational school aspect of the high school is such a huge strength to Medford and to the region.

1315
02:09:03,207 --> 02:09:16,434
So the idea of involving the vocational students somehow in the design and the construction of the school, in my mind, it would be part of that concept of opening up the school to the community.

1316
02:09:16,454 --> 02:09:21,217
Thank you.

1317
02:09:25,108 --> 02:09:26,111
Amanda.

1318
02:09:29,138 --> 02:09:30,401
Awesome, excuse me.

1319
02:09:32,179 --> 02:09:34,601
I love so much of what Teresa was just saying.

1320
02:09:35,482 --> 02:09:43,889
I think, so this is a high school first, but I also think of it as this incredible community resource.

1321
02:09:44,169 --> 02:09:52,275
And so the way that it's situated now does feel sort of insulated from the surrounding neighborhood.

1322
02:09:53,516 --> 02:10:00,102
If there are ways to, I think there's a balancing act of creating a space that's

1323
02:10:00,802 --> 02:10:09,550
That has access is accessible and welcoming, while also like maintaining sort of site safety and security for students and staff.

1324
02:10:10,331 --> 02:10:14,014
I'm very interested in kind of getting into conversations around that.

1325
02:10:16,476 --> 02:10:37,276
I think that other things that are of interest to me would be, you know, what are ways that the athletic fields and other kind of green space or like public space within the school and around the school can address or at least forestall any sort of

1326
02:10:38,217 --> 02:10:39,418
Things related to climate.

1327
02:10:40,018 --> 02:10:54,845
So if you know, are we having any challenges with muddy fields or or just heat things that are responsive to, you know, our felt experience in and around the area.

1328
02:10:57,694 --> 02:11:16,022
Let's see, I think, yeah, like, what are ways that we can design to encourage different modes of getting to and from the school, getting around the school so much like what Teresa was talking about, you know, encouraging biking, encouraging, you know, use of transit.

1329
02:11:17,362 --> 02:11:22,730
And I see the fells is this incredible resource resource that is, you know, right there.

1330
02:11:23,671 --> 02:11:31,482
So, yeah, like how do we, and again I think it's it's also a little bit of that balancing act of.

1331
02:11:33,325 --> 02:11:43,327
you know, safety and security because there's this open public resource that is next door or like on the footsteps of doorsteps of the school.

1332
02:11:45,828 --> 02:11:55,730
And like we want, you know, I think to encourage folks in and to come in and around the area, particularly students, I think.

1333
02:11:56,230 --> 02:11:59,471
So that's another piece of it.

1334
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:02,511
Let's see.

1335
02:12:03,332 --> 02:12:05,153
Sorry, I'm just looking at my notes here.

1336
02:12:05,173 --> 02:12:07,935
Let's see.

1337
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:20,454
Yeah, and I think I'll just add to, like, I know that there's a bunch of programming that happens outside of school programming.

1338
02:12:21,595 --> 02:12:27,057
I'm aware of, I think there's, I wanna say there's like English language classes that happen at the high school.

1339
02:12:28,698 --> 02:12:30,098
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1340
02:12:30,698 --> 02:12:31,539
Japanese school.

1341
02:12:31,939 --> 02:12:33,039
Thank you, yes.

1342
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:33,860
On Saturdays.

1343
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:35,360
Yeah, yeah.

1344
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:45,824
So yeah, just sort of again, highlighting, you know, this is a high school first, but it's also like a huge community resource, you know, access to the pool, things like that.

1345
02:12:46,424 --> 02:12:50,505
So what are ways that we can kind of better and mesh it within our community?

1346
02:12:51,346 --> 02:12:51,646
Thanks.

1347
02:12:53,927 --> 02:12:54,247
Thank you.

1348
02:12:54,287 --> 02:12:56,868
All right.

1349
02:12:57,508 --> 02:13:00,989
I don't think that Matt is on yet, Matt DeMaio.

1350
02:13:01,629 --> 02:13:03,610
So I think we can pivot over to Chief Evan.

1351
02:13:10,732 --> 02:13:21,495
Hi, yeah, so some of my concerns kind of overlay with Chief Buckley's concerns also as far as like radio communications, BDAs installed and things like that.

1352
02:13:21,535 --> 02:13:27,117
But definitely a concern is the access routes there.

1353
02:13:27,377 --> 02:13:38,361
I mean, as far as coming in two different independent directions, I mean, right now there are currently pinch points at that school on the sides of the school

1354
02:13:39,331 --> 02:13:49,433
It basically dead ends and it does block in fire apparatus or ambulances and kind of get people stuck in there.

1355
02:13:49,793 --> 02:13:59,615
I mean, we recently had an issue with a fire in the woods nearby there and everybody was kind of congested in one area there, kind of in a dead end area.

1356
02:14:00,115 --> 02:14:08,317
And, you know, students are trying to leave and get out of there and they're blocked in and it gets ugly without two ways in and out.

1357
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:10,630
So that's definitely a concern.

1358
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:16,292
Obviously fire lanes, things like that.

1359
02:14:18,872 --> 02:14:23,153
We're going to be, we'll obviously discuss hydrant locations and things like that.

1360
02:14:23,953 --> 02:14:27,154
Landscaping, you have the landscaping team there.

1361
02:14:27,194 --> 02:14:29,694
We can address things with them as far as access goes.

1362
02:14:31,935 --> 02:14:37,736
Obviously we'll be discussing sprinkler systems and fire doors and all that stuff.

1363
02:14:37,985 --> 02:14:59,751
down the road and everything else and compartmentation, but probably especially we'd like to look at, uh, find out what your, what your plans are on like high risk spaces there, such as like labs and, uh, shops, uh, vehicle automotive, probably, uh, gymnasiums and kitchen areas and things like that.

1364
02:14:59,831 --> 02:15:03,332
So, um, those are going to be some of the things that we want to look at with you.

1365
02:15:04,013 --> 02:15:04,433
And, uh,

1366
02:15:07,472 --> 02:15:31,818
Obviously, we'll be talking about the construction phase going on there and what kind of access we will have to think about during construction phase there and like Knox box and Knox box locations and gates if you put in gates and Security such as that so that we'll be able to access that any areas if something happens during that phase And then

1367
02:15:34,355 --> 02:15:42,417
We'll probably be also talking about later on down the line about like what your plans are with rooftop units and solar panels and things like that.

1368
02:15:42,458 --> 02:15:55,582
And kind of roof access and roof safety around the perimeter of the roof also in regards to fire department operations.

1369
02:15:56,642 --> 02:16:03,204
And again, there's probably some other sensitive security things like Chief Buckley mentioned that we'll have to discuss

1370
02:16:04,517 --> 02:16:05,918
in another way.

1371
02:16:07,118 --> 02:16:11,661
But that's basically the beginning of it.

1372
02:16:12,181 --> 02:16:17,804
I'm sure we're going to have a lot of other things to discuss later on as we get further down the road and see some progress here.

1373
02:16:18,744 --> 02:16:19,345
Yeah.

1374
02:16:19,525 --> 02:16:26,348
And photovoltaic panel, that's definitely one of the topics that's going to cross into multiple advisory teams in terms of discussions.

1375
02:16:26,388 --> 02:16:29,050
I appreciate you bringing it up.

1376
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:29,410
OK.

1377
02:16:29,870 --> 02:16:31,171
Matt Felucci, I think you're up next.

1378
02:16:35,323 --> 02:16:42,909
So obviously, you know, I want to see a modern state-of-the-art building that, you know, it's flexible learning environment that can support all our growing needs.

1379
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:46,572
Right now, that building is massive.

1380
02:16:47,292 --> 02:16:53,217
And there's a lot of areas where we don't have visibility on, kids can kind of hide out.

1381
02:16:54,738 --> 02:17:00,303
I graduated in 92 with maybe 2,400 kids in the whole school, and it was too big then.

1382
02:17:01,103 --> 02:17:03,685
And here we are now with maybe 1,300 kids.

1383
02:17:03,765 --> 02:17:05,106
It is just a massive space.

1384
02:17:05,626 --> 02:17:10,590
So there's a lot of blind areas in that building, especially down my end of the building, the gymnasium area.

1385
02:17:11,470 --> 02:17:12,951
I would love to see that get cleaned up.

1386
02:17:13,512 --> 02:17:22,458
From a traffic standpoint, I would love to see a flow, like Chief Buckley and Chief Evans both said, some kind of flow around the building.

1387
02:17:24,291 --> 02:17:28,952
It is, if you go behind the gym, up by the pool area, up by the fields, you know, that's it, it stops.

1388
02:17:30,093 --> 02:17:43,316
If we could ever get some kind of traffic pattern that goes completely around the building, one way in, one way out, and then we definitely need some kind of emergency egress, which we're going to have to get super creative with that because we have all residential areas around us.

1389
02:17:43,336 --> 02:17:45,037
I don't know how that's going to happen.

1390
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:56,444
Um, obviously access to the fells is huge, you know, from in, in my world, um, 2011, 2012, I got a mass DCR grant.

1391
02:17:56,464 --> 02:18:01,166
We put in a trail, we have an almost one mile trail that we use a lot with phys ed classes.

1392
02:18:01,566 --> 02:18:04,207
So I want to make sure that we're still using the fells.

1393
02:18:05,047 --> 02:18:11,150
Um, as far as field space and whatnot, one thing I've seen with, with other schools that have been built.

1394
02:18:12,345 --> 02:18:15,607
you have to account for enough parking spaces.

1395
02:18:15,887 --> 02:18:24,593
You can build these beautiful state-of-the-art schools with these beautiful fields, and you're renting out the fields, or you're doing other stuff in the fields, and there's just not enough spots to park.

1396
02:18:24,673 --> 02:18:26,634
So we're gonna have to figure that out.

1397
02:18:27,875 --> 02:18:28,455
What else we got?

1398
02:18:29,749 --> 02:18:32,491
I love that the community utilizes the building.

1399
02:18:32,591 --> 02:18:34,012
You know, it is the flagship.

1400
02:18:34,052 --> 02:18:35,153
We do so much up there.

1401
02:18:35,613 --> 02:18:43,018
But I would like to see that community utilized spaces ideally grouped together so we can assure security.

1402
02:18:43,038 --> 02:18:49,082
I'm not saying separation, but seal them off from other parts of the building.

1403
02:18:49,702 --> 02:18:54,065
Where I am in the gym, I see all the people that go and swim every day, and I think it's fantastic.

1404
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,006
But we have had people that are new coming to swim, and they're banging on the back door of the gym.

1405
02:18:59,066 --> 02:19:00,668
And I open the door, and I'm like, can I help you?

1406
02:19:01,229 --> 02:19:02,571
And they don't know where to go.

1407
02:19:02,591 --> 02:19:05,475
And God forbid somebody ever got in the building.

1408
02:19:05,535 --> 02:19:07,497
So I'd like to see that.

1409
02:19:10,069 --> 02:19:14,511
Like I said, the gym is just, it's so large with so many blind areas.

1410
02:19:14,731 --> 02:19:24,957
I'd like to see high visibility spaces and also high visibility spaces where kids can gather, faculty can gather and we can collaborate and nobody's being hidden.

1411
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:31,721
Oh, one big thing too, my last point, I'll give everyone their time.

1412
02:19:32,322 --> 02:19:37,625
I would love to see the bus drop-off area be designated just for bus drop-off.

1413
02:19:39,895 --> 02:19:45,999
We've been super fortunate that we haven't had too many accidents, but I see the way some parents drive when their kids are late to school.

1414
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:51,062
And as currently constituted, that bus loop, parents can fly down there.

1415
02:19:51,103 --> 02:19:52,423
You can have someone crossing the street.

1416
02:19:52,924 --> 02:19:57,086
So I just definitely feel that's a danger point that we need to look at and clean up.

1417
02:19:58,047 --> 02:20:00,689
And I'm sure I'll have a lot more, but I want to give everyone their time.

1418
02:20:00,709 --> 02:20:01,149
So thanks.

1419
02:20:03,631 --> 02:20:04,712
You've been very much on time.

1420
02:20:04,732 --> 02:20:05,332
I appreciate that.

1421
02:20:05,412 --> 02:20:06,873
Thank you.

1422
02:20:07,293 --> 02:20:08,234
Jenny, you're up next.

1423
02:20:11,422 --> 02:20:19,026
When I was a kid for about 5 minutes, I wanted to be an architect and then I realized I couldn't draw a straight line and I hated physics.

1424
02:20:19,046 --> 02:20:21,647
And so I had to move on from that.

1425
02:20:22,516 --> 02:20:31,298
And I don't envy the set of challenges that we're stacking up for the architects, because I think there's a lot of them.

1426
02:20:31,338 --> 02:20:38,300
But I have also had more time than most of you to sit with all of the possibilities.

1427
02:20:38,380 --> 02:20:44,141
And I've been able to see early concept designs from all the people who were vying for this job.

1428
02:20:44,321 --> 02:20:46,121
None of them I liked in its entirety.

1429
02:20:46,201 --> 02:20:48,582
But just like my wheels about,

1430
02:20:49,322 --> 02:20:52,724
The site in particular have been turning for a really long time now.

1431
02:20:52,804 --> 02:20:53,385
It feels like.

1432
02:20:54,946 --> 02:21:03,031
So, in the last couple of weeks, like, we've been focused on what's the education going to look like in the building, which has been very interesting.

1433
02:21:03,111 --> 02:21:17,780
But since you're all here, and we have this audience, things on my mind about the site are things that include certainly a place for all of the modes of transportation to have.

1434
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:28,983
Some designated space, like, we heard from students last week that, like, it's a mad dash to the bus, because it's on the opposite end of the building from where they, they end their day.

1435
02:21:29,103 --> 02:21:38,766
So if the bus is this time sensitive thing, shouldn't it be central to the school for all students to be able to get there?

1436
02:21:38,866 --> 02:21:41,207
And shouldn't it be a different space than, like.

1437
02:21:41,807 --> 02:21:50,810
Where pickup is versus where parking is, so I think there's all this opportunity to, like, create better flow around the.

1438
02:21:50,830 --> 02:21:58,872
Around the space, and the other thing sort of I'm envisioning is that as we do a better job of.

1439
02:22:00,455 --> 02:22:05,902
Using the space, we're going to have some real estate to do more on the property.

1440
02:22:06,063 --> 02:22:12,111
Like, can we put a track and field on the property and football stadium on the property?

1441
02:22:12,732 --> 02:22:15,095
Can we create more playing fields?

1442
02:22:15,595 --> 02:22:19,759
can we, like, you know, we have, like, everyone talks about the field of dreams.

1443
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:23,923
The field, like, half the rubber from the field of dreams is in my house.

1444
02:22:24,504 --> 02:22:30,970
So I'm here to say, like, it's time for us to, like, dream again about what the field of dreams looks like.

1445
02:22:32,651 --> 02:22:38,297
But, you know, I think there's just so much opportunity to do the things on the site that

1446
02:22:39,563 --> 02:22:41,064
the community would really value.

1447
02:22:41,724 --> 02:22:48,806
And I think one of the keys to this whole project for me is that the high school is not a place you go for four years.

1448
02:22:48,986 --> 02:22:53,507
It is a community space that everyone sees as a resource.

1449
02:22:53,607 --> 02:22:55,528
So that's like the pool.

1450
02:22:55,588 --> 02:22:58,368
I have people in my ear saying, don't get rid of the pool.

1451
02:22:58,408 --> 02:23:00,489
It's one of the best pools I've seen in the area.

1452
02:23:01,029 --> 02:23:02,129
And it's the theater.

1453
02:23:02,269 --> 02:23:04,330
And it's the playing fields.

1454
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:06,411
And it's all the things that bring people

1455
02:23:08,355 --> 02:23:12,357
To the space that may have nothing to do with what goes on in the building.

1456
02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:17,179
So I just, I'm super excited about the opportunity that's created.

1457
02:23:17,259 --> 02:23:30,746
Like, we've got all this weird, these weird patches, the grass all over the place that, like, you know, the football team uses practice field and they're like, it's kind of it's kind of junk, but we can't get across the city to use the real field.

1458
02:23:31,606 --> 02:23:36,929
And there is all this space that's just not maximized in any way.

1459
02:23:37,029 --> 02:23:40,270
And then my parting thing, Chief Evans, close your ears.

1460
02:23:40,771 --> 02:23:47,174
But in my mind, I see that we have this amazing skyline view of the city of Boston.

1461
02:23:47,334 --> 02:23:53,857
And wouldn't some roof access to enjoy that space be so amazing?

1462
02:23:54,977 --> 02:24:05,643
And then the other thing I super am looking forward to is for somebody before us to solve the question of turf fields, and are they poisonous or are they not?

1463
02:24:07,043 --> 02:24:12,466
And every time I see an article, I'm like, maybe these guys have solved it so we don't have to fight about it here in Medford.

1464
02:24:12,546 --> 02:24:17,268
I haven't seen that just yet, but I'm really hopeful somebody's going to figure it out before we have to.

1465
02:24:19,149 --> 02:24:26,304
And then I think just overall, to me, this is such an opportunity for Medford to like,

1466
02:24:27,425 --> 02:24:36,908
Create space, like, we, we don't we can't create, like, we're so landlocked here that this is an opportunity to say, like, how can we create space here?

1467
02:24:36,948 --> 02:24:38,568
That doesn't exist in the city today.

1468
02:24:39,068 --> 02:24:44,430
So that everybody who ultimately has to go and say, we're going to pay more taxes to do.

1469
02:24:44,470 --> 02:24:50,371
This has a reason to say, yes, and to me, that's about creating something for everybody in this building.

1470
02:24:50,631 --> 02:24:55,913
In addition to doing right by the students who are going to spend 180 days a year there.

1471
02:24:59,803 --> 02:25:00,123
Thank you.

1472
02:25:01,203 --> 02:25:02,164
Brian, you are up next.

1473
02:25:02,184 --> 02:25:06,244
All right.

1474
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:06,984
Can you hear me now?

1475
02:25:07,564 --> 02:25:08,065
We can.

1476
02:25:08,125 --> 02:25:08,305
Yep.

1477
02:25:08,725 --> 02:25:09,045
Excellent.

1478
02:25:09,165 --> 02:25:13,486
So I think I just have two points to touch on.

1479
02:25:14,026 --> 02:25:16,866
Again, obviously, this is an incredibly difficult site.

1480
02:25:16,886 --> 02:25:21,967
There's tons of flow and pattern issues that we're all well aware of.

1481
02:25:24,427 --> 02:25:27,428
Honestly, I'm probably really fortunate as a parent because

1482
02:25:28,408 --> 02:25:42,482
You know, like I said, our son is a junior and I can honestly say I've never driven to the school during any of the rush hour time so he either walks bikes or takes public transit.

1483
02:25:42,822 --> 02:25:44,104
And so my first point is

1484
02:25:45,161 --> 02:25:49,786
the public transit, and I'm not quite sure how it works, he literally gets on the city bus that goes in.

1485
02:25:50,727 --> 02:26:03,019
And one of the things that actually Jenny and I heard in some of the earlier meetings with the kids is that it's really difficult for them to not only get to the bus stop and get out and get on their way,

1486
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:09,485
It's immediately after the bell rings, and there's only one wave of buses.

1487
02:26:09,605 --> 02:26:16,590
And if you want to meet with a teacher, if you have to take a test after school, if you do after school activities, you're on your own.

1488
02:26:16,650 --> 02:26:22,075
So it'd be interesting to work with the city and see if we can get another round of buses somehow, so public transit.

1489
02:26:22,935 --> 02:26:28,039
Because public transit's huge in my eyes, and I'm a big proponent.

1490
02:26:28,059 --> 02:26:29,600
So that's one.

1491
02:26:31,822 --> 02:26:45,566
Looking forward to the solutions, I know in my eyes, again, because I've got some history thinking about this kind of stuff, I'm really curious where the phasing goes, because it is a tight site.

1492
02:26:45,886 --> 02:26:48,707
And I would love, like somebody mentioned, to have some street presence.

1493
02:26:49,227 --> 02:26:55,168
I'd love to take advantage, obviously, of the in and out of inner space and connection to the Fells.

1494
02:26:55,709 --> 02:26:58,870
Like Jenny mentioned, up on the high point, there's great views.

1495
02:26:59,210 --> 02:27:00,010
How do we take advantage?

1496
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:05,635
This to me is all hinged upon how the phasing goes.

1497
02:27:06,075 --> 02:27:07,396
How much of the old building do we keep?

1498
02:27:07,437 --> 02:27:08,357
How much do we tear down?

1499
02:27:08,918 --> 02:27:12,561
And that's going to inform the traffic patterns, the site planning, and all these things.

1500
02:27:12,601 --> 02:27:24,813
So I'm excited for you guys as the professionals to pen to paper and see how that phasing actually informs the site planning and what we end up with.

1501
02:27:28,441 --> 02:27:30,941
Again, I think it's going to be important.

1502
02:27:30,961 --> 02:27:31,562
It's going to be tough.

1503
02:27:31,702 --> 02:27:36,303
It's going to be tight to get everything we want without a clean slate because we don't have one.

1504
02:27:36,343 --> 02:27:38,084
We have got a lot of stuff in there.

1505
02:27:39,664 --> 02:27:43,005
So I guess I'll close out by saying good luck.

1506
02:27:46,706 --> 02:27:51,308
I'm very much looking forward to it and seeing what you guys do and working with you guys.

1507
02:27:51,348 --> 02:27:52,208
So happy to be here.

1508
02:27:52,388 --> 02:27:52,568
Thanks.

1509
02:27:53,658 --> 02:28:03,966
And eventually we'll have most likely a construction manager that's going to come on and collaborate with the project team, everyone here as well, on some of those critical phasing issues.

1510
02:28:04,026 --> 02:28:09,671
But you're right, we do have to find a path forward before those folks are really engaged in the conversation.

1511
02:28:11,032 --> 02:28:14,094
So Joe, I think is not here, right?

1512
02:28:14,114 --> 02:28:15,075
That was one of our students.

1513
02:28:16,536 --> 02:28:18,097
So I think Alicia, you are up.

1514
02:28:22,494 --> 02:28:22,694
Right.

1515
02:28:23,154 --> 02:28:23,495
Okay.

1516
02:28:23,695 --> 02:28:26,556
I was making some notes on what some of the other people were saying.

1517
02:28:26,576 --> 02:28:31,159
I feel like the people who speak first are going to be like, I would have commented on those things.

1518
02:28:31,859 --> 02:28:35,341
Because I don't have a prompt to respond to.

1519
02:28:35,481 --> 02:28:38,483
But I was looking at the site.

1520
02:28:38,523 --> 02:28:42,866
The site is unfortunately extremely constrained because of its surrounding by the fells.

1521
02:28:42,986 --> 02:28:50,570
But I sent a note to Jenny and to Tim McGivern that maybe we could look at some stuff with the state that are limiting this site.

1522
02:28:52,304 --> 02:29:00,348
And like it had never occurred to me until sitting in this meeting just now that this building could be tighter and taller.

1523
02:29:01,028 --> 02:29:11,454
And as long as the programming works so that students don't literally have to run up five flights of stairs, but in the three minutes between classes, it could in fact

1524
02:29:12,214 --> 02:29:14,935
be a different configuration and taller.

1525
02:29:15,375 --> 02:29:18,197
But I know there's a lot of hope to not lose the pool.

1526
02:29:18,697 --> 02:29:26,360
But the pool needs help because we can't rent it out for real good events because there's no ADA access to the viewing area.

1527
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,881
My daughter did synchronized swimming there.

1528
02:29:29,441 --> 02:29:35,304
And it is actually an amazing pool for synchronized swimming and one of the few in this region.

1529
02:29:36,064 --> 02:29:39,826
But we could never hold a meet there because there was no good viewing for it.

1530
02:29:40,906 --> 02:29:45,469
Whereas that would have been a great addition.

1531
02:29:45,549 --> 02:29:50,952
I mean, just the opportunities that were lost because of the viewing area not being accessible.

1532
02:29:53,493 --> 02:29:57,695
When my daughter was starting in the high school, she was terrified of getting lost.

1533
02:29:57,875 --> 02:30:04,339
And she had been using just the pool for several years to the point where she made a scale model.

1534
02:30:04,359 --> 02:30:10,202
She asked me for floor plans, which I gave her, and she made a scale model of the first floor of the high school because she was so scared.

1535
02:30:11,665 --> 02:30:24,248
And so I just, I need to share that it's like we need to think about kids, I've heard that that is the number one fear of kids going into ninth grade is fear of getting lost in the high school and being late to classes.

1536
02:30:24,908 --> 02:30:34,589
And honestly, I'm thrilled that they're not fear is not of being beat up, but like right like it's not a, but like please, that shouldn't be the fear either.

1537
02:30:37,669 --> 02:30:42,756
We have been working with the transportation working group in the city that includes people from Medford high school.

1538
02:30:43,377 --> 02:30:51,988
About our transportation issues and we've engaged tops and we've engaged the senior Center and we've engaged with the transportation.

1539
02:30:52,372 --> 02:30:57,515
There are nonprofits and organizations that do transportation, and we've been trying to figure some stuff out.

1540
02:30:58,015 --> 02:31:21,428
And right now, all our solutions are only for the senior population, but I am convinced in my heart that there is a synergy between the needs of our seniors and the needs of our students, where we transport students in the mornings and in the evenings, and the seniors in the middle of the day while those kids are in school, and that the city could figure something out there, but we're not.

1541
02:31:22,024 --> 02:31:23,285
We're not ending up there yet.

1542
02:31:23,425 --> 02:31:24,485
We haven't figured that out.

1543
02:31:26,246 --> 02:31:29,688
And around the vocational spaces, so my son's in the robotics.

1544
02:31:29,708 --> 02:31:31,789
He's actually my second son to go through robotics.

1545
02:31:32,369 --> 02:31:38,252
And I just have to say, I think that you should go talk to the vocational students during the day.

1546
02:31:39,012 --> 02:31:44,315
And just go meet with some of them in some of their spaces and understand how they use those spaces.

1547
02:31:44,927 --> 02:31:49,190
Because I know that they're doing a lot of really remarkable stuff.

1548
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:53,574
My impression is that the MSBA would never fund spaces these big.

1549
02:31:54,775 --> 02:32:06,524
Please don't take the fire department, the police department, they would freak out if they saw, I'm just kidding, but I'm not, like the equipment that these guys are learning and they get OSHA training in the robotic shop, at least they get OSHA training.

1550
02:32:06,564 --> 02:32:08,806
I think a lot of the voc programs do.

1551
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:20,057
Um, so that's some of the sort of the thoughts and, um, to be clear as far as my understanding is that this building will have solar does not have to have solar on every inch of its roof.

1552
02:32:20,497 --> 02:32:23,859
But our goal is net zero buildings in the city of Medford.

1553
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:25,360
Um, and.

1554
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:29,063
This is our flagship and we need to do demonstration.

1555
02:32:29,163 --> 02:32:36,707
And the only reason that building doesn't have solar yet is because of the state of the roofs and the roofs that have been over the years.

1556
02:32:37,088 --> 02:32:38,489
I've been on a lot of those roofs.

1557
02:32:39,499 --> 02:32:45,303
And I was horrified when they took the science labs and they put all this equipment spread all over the place.

1558
02:32:45,363 --> 02:32:47,485
I'm like, you're ruining our roofs for solar.

1559
02:32:47,865 --> 02:32:53,589
Let's think about roof design and HVAC design that allows for solar on the roofs.

1560
02:32:54,089 --> 02:32:58,913
So what I heard from Chief Evans was when you do solar, let's do it safely, not don't do it.

1561
02:33:00,228 --> 02:33:02,429
Yes, and we'll get into those conversations.

1562
02:33:02,869 --> 02:33:03,750
I appreciate that.

1563
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:04,070
Thank you.

1564
02:33:04,450 --> 02:33:09,752
Yeah, I'm sure I have more thoughts, but other people started to say some of the things that I was thinking too.

1565
02:33:10,132 --> 02:33:11,292
And I've biked up there too.

1566
02:33:11,352 --> 02:33:12,093
It's not easy.

1567
02:33:12,173 --> 02:33:14,634
And I've biked up there with kids and it's not pleasant.

1568
02:33:15,234 --> 02:33:16,214
But what are you going to do?

1569
02:33:16,254 --> 02:33:17,995
We're not going to lower the site, right?

1570
02:33:18,835 --> 02:33:19,216
Could we?

1571
02:33:21,076 --> 02:33:21,596
More to come.

1572
02:33:21,737 --> 02:33:22,717
Yes, for sure.

1573
02:33:24,278 --> 02:33:25,278
Nick, you are up next.

1574
02:33:31,127 --> 02:33:34,488
Good evening once again, I hope y'all can hear me well.

1575
02:33:35,068 --> 02:33:36,109
We can, yes, thank you.

1576
02:33:36,469 --> 02:33:50,153
Yeah, so as the disability specialist and now the disabled person myself, my main concern is accessibility.

1577
02:33:52,134 --> 02:34:00,437
Accessibility to the school itself, accessibility to the various students for their classrooms and stuff like that.

1578
02:34:03,124 --> 02:34:07,325
I did not go to Medford High School precisely for this reason.

1579
02:34:11,087 --> 02:34:22,951
Even though I went through public school for all my elementary and my middle school years, I had to go to a private school.

1580
02:34:24,007 --> 02:34:33,737
because Medford High was not accessible and was way too big for someone with a walker or wheelchair to be going.

1581
02:34:36,042 --> 02:34:45,226
from the north side to the south side to the east side to the west side within five minutes would just not be possible.

1582
02:34:47,307 --> 02:34:56,111
So not only am I thinking of that, but I'm also thinking of literally entering the school building.

1583
02:34:58,252 --> 02:35:02,433
I haven't been to mention high in a few years, but

1584
02:35:04,365 --> 02:35:07,207
The ramp that they have going up to the door?

1585
02:35:08,647 --> 02:35:10,308
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

1586
02:35:11,229 --> 02:35:13,330
Way too steep, way too steep.

1587
02:35:15,411 --> 02:35:16,892
And it's not okay.

1588
02:35:20,514 --> 02:35:31,900
If someone was in a manual wheelchair and they had to come out, they'd go flying, literally flying onto the street and jump the curb.

1589
02:35:35,193 --> 02:35:47,146
and trying to access the various entryways of the building is very difficult.

1590
02:35:50,570 --> 02:35:51,591
That being said,

1591
02:35:53,204 --> 02:35:59,449
much of my job in terms of the city itself.

1592
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:07,416
I work with a lot of these people that are on this call, so it's good to see some of my friends here.

1593
02:36:08,878 --> 02:36:16,064
But one of the major things that I deal with is site plan reviews.

1594
02:36:16,344 --> 02:36:16,704
So I

1595
02:36:21,456 --> 02:36:29,124
I will be one of the people that looks at the blueprints and be like, yeah, this works or no, this does not work.

1596
02:36:30,846 --> 02:36:32,388
So that is one of my major concerns.

1597
02:36:32,448 --> 02:36:33,289
Also, just to reiterate,

1598
02:36:42,663 --> 02:36:51,091
Not just being able to access the building itself, but being able to maneuver inside.

1599
02:36:52,773 --> 02:37:01,082
Getting from class to class, getting from point A to point B. Like I said, I've lived in Medford my whole life.

1600
02:37:01,462 --> 02:37:04,185
I never knew we had a pool until just now.

1601
02:37:07,115 --> 02:37:13,660
And that's probably because I wouldn't have been able to access it anyway.

1602
02:37:15,642 --> 02:37:24,628
So things like that are very important.

1603
02:37:25,649 --> 02:37:32,855
To also reiterate, the high school is a communal space.

1604
02:37:33,969 --> 02:37:38,974
there is a church that meets in the high school on Sundays.

1605
02:37:40,215 --> 02:37:44,379
So I know some of the people that go there.

1606
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:57,050
And the fact that I know how inaccessible the high school is, so I've never made a point of going there.

1607
02:38:01,233 --> 02:38:04,736
That should tell you how many people might be thinking that same way.

1608
02:38:09,299 --> 02:38:26,252
If we have events in the school, when I was growing up, there used to be a children's chorus that used to meet in the high school.

1609
02:38:28,685 --> 02:38:33,147
And I was part of that call, call, call, call, call, callers.

1610
02:38:33,828 --> 02:38:43,152
But I remember how long of a walk it was just to get to the music room from the main door.

1611
02:38:45,033 --> 02:38:48,354
So again, being able to maneuver that.

1612
02:38:48,414 --> 02:38:49,415
And let me just say,

1613
02:38:54,468 --> 02:38:57,911
Me not going to Medford High School was not my parents' choice.

1614
02:38:58,011 --> 02:38:58,931
It was my choice.

1615
02:39:01,033 --> 02:39:12,161
Because I knew I would not be able to maneuver the inside of that building within good time, despite having all my friends go there.

1616
02:39:15,023 --> 02:39:16,904
So stuff like that.

1617
02:39:18,725 --> 02:39:19,986
And again,

1618
02:39:24,795 --> 02:39:30,237
I work very closely with both chiefs on this Zoom call.

1619
02:39:31,737 --> 02:39:39,940
And so I'm sure our roles will overlap as well in terms of safety and whatnot.

1620
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:47,862
And so, yes, I think that's really what I have to say on that.

1621
02:39:49,642 --> 02:39:50,103
Thank you, Nick.

1622
02:39:50,303 --> 02:39:51,503
I appreciate your perspective.

1623
02:39:54,916 --> 02:39:57,111
All right, Ethan, you are up next.

1624
02:40:00,819 --> 02:40:01,680
Thanks.

1625
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:07,683
So I'll start out with some just overarching kind of site planning goals and principles to consider.

1626
02:40:07,703 --> 02:40:18,769
So I think, you know, site planning goals, we want to focus on functional and welcoming campus, keep students safe, allow staff to supervise and respond quickly to emergencies.

1627
02:40:19,689 --> 02:40:27,494
And really, all those those goals should span the site planning, safety and security as the integrated package for the new high school.

1628
02:40:28,534 --> 02:40:36,082
The campus should be organized so it's clear conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians are minimized learning spaces can expand in the future.

1629
02:40:37,183 --> 02:40:39,866
We should ensure that good access to outdoor learning areas.

1630
02:40:41,400 --> 02:40:46,666
Preserving green spaces and kind of separating noisy functions from quiet academic zones.

1631
02:40:47,587 --> 02:40:55,856
So providing safe, efficient circulation for buses, parent drop off, student drivers, service vehicles, pedestrians with clearly separated paths.

1632
02:40:56,657 --> 02:41:02,003
Locate buildings, fields and parking based on topography, drainage, environmental constraints.

1633
02:41:03,293 --> 02:41:06,075
also allowing for room for future additions.

1634
02:41:06,756 --> 02:41:12,801
Create a campus that feels welcoming, legible, easy to navigate, with clear wayfinding and logical zoning of uses.

1635
02:41:13,822 --> 02:41:22,469
Relative to safety, ensure safe pedestrian routes with generous well-lit walkways, accessible entrances, protected crossings, especially near drop-off zones.

1636
02:41:23,350 --> 02:41:29,954
Designed for clear emergency egress and gathering areas with obvious evacuation routes, access for fire, police, EMS.

1637
02:41:30,895 --> 02:41:38,440
Also address environmental and building safety, so structural integrity, site drainage, indoor air quality, safe materials, et cetera for student health.

1638
02:41:40,101 --> 02:41:42,603
And also, while doing this, consider

1639
02:41:43,686 --> 02:42:07,945
uh, there's, uh, concepts from the, like, crime prevention through environmental design that could be applied, uh, things like natural surveillance, controlled access, territorial reinforcement, um, being able to, you know, detect intruders and enable staff and first responders to respond quickly, but doing all that without making the high school feel like a fortress, um,

1640
02:42:09,095 --> 02:42:26,493
And so some of the ways you could start to do that limiting and controlling public access with a smaller number of supervised entry points, secure main vestibule leading to reception, maximize visibility with clear sight lines, appropriate lighting, window placement, so parking paths and entrances can be easily monitored.

1641
02:42:27,094 --> 02:42:35,783
Defining secure perimeters, internal zones, using fencing, landscaping, doors, access controls, all aligned with lockdown and emergency procedures.

1642
02:42:36,904 --> 02:42:44,732
I think that's kind of like the baseline that we need to achieve and this next little bit is a little bit more exciting in

1643
02:42:46,652 --> 02:42:53,993
in that I'm trying to incorporate some ideas about how you could actually integrate the high school site plan with the Fells.

1644
02:42:54,113 --> 02:42:58,134
So I think site planning and Fells access needs to be a primary objective.

1645
02:42:58,154 --> 02:43:11,617
We wanna create a coherent network of pedestrian and bike connections from the campus to the Fells that are safe, visible, accessible in all seasons, reinforce the school's role as a gateway to the Fells rather than a barrier at its edge.

1646
02:43:12,657 --> 02:43:16,719
Organize buildings, parking, and circulation to pull hard edges away from the fells.

1647
02:43:18,020 --> 02:43:25,163
Reserve that edge for habitat, outdoor learning areas, low-impact recreation rather than vehicle-dominated uses like today.

1648
02:43:26,163 --> 02:43:32,085
Use site grading, planting, stormwater system to restore more natural hydrology along the fells interface.

1649
02:43:32,145 --> 02:43:33,266
Ethan, I apologize.

1650
02:43:34,867 --> 02:43:37,808
Just at the three minutes, I want to make sure that we have time for everybody

1651
02:43:38,708 --> 02:43:45,993
If it's possible for you to just give us sort of the rest of it as written, that would be very much appreciated.

1652
02:43:46,733 --> 02:43:47,174
Yeah, sure.

1653
02:43:47,914 --> 02:43:48,094
Okay.

1654
02:43:48,334 --> 02:43:48,614
Thank you.

1655
02:43:48,654 --> 02:43:49,495
I apologize again.

1656
02:43:49,515 --> 02:43:54,718
I am not the world's best interrupter by far.

1657
02:43:55,118 --> 02:43:55,519
No worries.

1658
02:43:56,699 --> 02:43:57,380
All right, Ken.

1659
02:43:58,783 --> 02:43:59,283
Yeah, thank you.

1660
02:43:59,843 --> 02:44:04,164
So over my career, I've been involved in, I think, seven other school building projects.

1661
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:11,186
I'm really interested in seeing how this one can solve some of the issues I've seen that have come out of designs and other schools that I've been involved with.

1662
02:44:11,886 --> 02:44:24,349
So my primary concern starts with just site circulation, separating the bus and parent traffic and student parking traffic and pedestrian traffic on site, making sure that's safe, well lit, but not

1663
02:44:25,009 --> 02:44:26,490
lit so it bothers the neighbors.

1664
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:52,638
That's always an important concept of light pollution, making sure that inside the building we can segment all of our public areas properly from the school areas so that if we have JLS using a tremendous amount of our building as they do it every Saturday, we can still segment it off in the rest of the building so we can have activities in other parts, making sure the gym, the library, the theater,

1665
02:44:53,218 --> 02:44:55,499
All those other spaces can be segmented and used.

1666
02:44:56,459 --> 02:45:00,281
Our meeting spaces also being able to be used.

1667
02:45:00,321 --> 02:45:06,703
Like right now we have, you know, the one popular PD place that we use is in the third floor of the science wing.

1668
02:45:06,743 --> 02:45:11,005
So getting people to and from there during the day for public meetings is difficult.

1669
02:45:12,426 --> 02:45:17,812
making sure the site's fully accessible, easily accessible for people who have disabilities.

1670
02:45:18,593 --> 02:45:30,346
And one thing we did in the last project I was in in Wilmington is we actually had CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Security Agency of the federal government, they provide physical security assessment.

1671
02:45:32,407 --> 02:45:56,082
So they'll have someone will come out and will actually advise on design and current spaces and how they can be protected for security reasons from whether it be from site circulation to avoid vehicle ramming opportunities, whether it's intentional or accidental separating traffic, internal examination for security cameras and secure glass and all that kind of stuff.

1672
02:45:56,102 --> 02:45:58,424
So I'm really interested in all of those things.

1673
02:45:59,324 --> 02:46:03,287
to make this as a safe and secure and usable space that we can.

1674
02:46:05,569 --> 02:46:08,051
Thank you.

1675
02:46:08,471 --> 02:46:08,792
All right.

1676
02:46:09,632 --> 02:46:11,313
Sean, I think had to hop off.

1677
02:46:12,194 --> 02:46:14,816
So I think it is Tim who is up next.

1678
02:46:17,018 --> 02:46:17,338
Thank you.

1679
02:46:17,999 --> 02:46:22,642
I heard a lot of great things, and I'm going to try not to repeat those things, but I heard lots of great things.

1680
02:46:24,635 --> 02:46:30,399
And I also understand it's very, very early, so there's not very many drawings or things that we can review.

1681
02:46:30,499 --> 02:46:36,884
So totally understood, which is a great opportunity for me to sort of highlight, which a lot of folks have been.

1682
02:46:37,204 --> 02:46:49,812
Early site design is really important in setting goals in your site and going up on the school if you need to, multiple stories to get some of those goals realized on the site, I think is important.

1683
02:46:52,616 --> 02:46:58,738
You know, I'm going to be looking at the circulation as well, how it's designed, especially for maintenance.

1684
02:46:59,038 --> 02:47:00,519
Obviously, that's going to be my focus.

1685
02:47:01,159 --> 02:47:19,726
But I think for things like bus loops, parking for students versus faculty versus public, buses, drop offs, a lot of things that were said, good lighting, the site work, you know, should be to city standards, materials and things like that.

1686
02:47:20,434 --> 02:47:24,497
Um, and then, you know, some folks talked about construction, but that's, that's going to matter.

1687
02:47:24,837 --> 02:47:25,878
It's a large site.

1688
02:47:25,898 --> 02:47:32,383
Uh, if, if that's the site that, that is, this is happening at, so, you know, erosion control is going to be a big deal.

1689
02:47:32,403 --> 02:47:47,694
Uh, construction traffic leaving and entering the site, those conflicts and, and those types of impacts are going to be, um, you know, going to be really important, especially when the building is, is, uh, going up and they're doing heavy, heavy, uh, site work as well.

1690
02:47:48,375 --> 02:47:48,495
Um,

1691
02:47:49,427 --> 02:47:53,551
Just a couple things to note, I think it's important to note, Steve Miller Drive is a public road.

1692
02:47:53,571 --> 02:47:54,812
It's not really part of the site.

1693
02:47:55,853 --> 02:48:02,098
So, you know, it is a landlocked site, as folks have mentioned.

1694
02:48:02,178 --> 02:48:03,820
So that's the way in, that's the way out.

1695
02:48:04,480 --> 02:48:11,366
And the hill, there's not a lot you can do about that, as Alicia mentioned, because the site's mostly probably sitting on ledge.

1696
02:48:12,607 --> 02:48:13,468
If, you know,

1697
02:48:14,477 --> 02:48:16,978
The fells right next door is any sign of that, which it is.

1698
02:48:17,518 --> 02:48:22,460
So anyway, looking forward to the project and looking forward to reviewing drawings.

1699
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:29,103
And I've worked on complex sites like this before, and the phasing is going to really drive it.

1700
02:48:29,623 --> 02:48:31,824
So it's going to be interesting to see how you guys do this.

1701
02:48:32,544 --> 02:48:33,905
So good luck in the challenge.

1702
02:48:33,925 --> 02:48:36,066
Thank you.

1703
02:48:36,086 --> 02:48:36,746
Appreciate that.

1704
02:48:37,947 --> 02:48:41,088
It really is a challenge, but we do enjoy it, actually.

1705
02:48:42,153 --> 02:48:43,554
It's a good one.

1706
02:48:43,594 --> 02:48:44,014
Definitely.

1707
02:48:45,515 --> 02:48:46,316
John McLaughlin.

1708
02:48:50,858 --> 02:48:56,662
We can't hear you yet.

1709
02:48:57,142 --> 02:48:59,064
Hi, John McLaughlin, director of facilities.

1710
02:49:01,128 --> 02:49:09,840
It's excellent to hear people's perspectives on all of the different aspects that they want to see.

1711
02:49:12,832 --> 02:49:17,376
employees of the school department for 38 years, primarily up at Merritt High School.

1712
02:49:18,116 --> 02:49:21,639
We've discussed them all in the past and in the future.

1713
02:49:21,659 --> 02:49:28,005
The security issues with Chief Buckley and Chief Evans with the fire issues.

1714
02:49:28,025 --> 02:49:34,970
I've had a unique perspective to be involved in all of those discussions over the years.

1715
02:49:37,201 --> 02:49:38,602
I'm definitely looking forward to it.

1716
02:49:39,102 --> 02:49:43,586
I do enjoy, like I said, I enjoy listening to the public's perspectives.

1717
02:49:43,606 --> 02:49:49,931
Like, I never even thought about biking up the hill and, you know, and the kids getting tired.

1718
02:49:49,991 --> 02:49:52,012
You know, that's something that it's never,

1719
02:49:53,775 --> 02:49:55,216
really I've heard before.

1720
02:49:55,236 --> 02:49:56,978
And it's a very interesting perspective.

1721
02:49:57,298 --> 02:49:58,479
And it's a real perspective.

1722
02:49:58,699 --> 02:50:04,544
And it's, you know, in designing of the building.

1723
02:50:04,924 --> 02:50:10,649
So we still don't really know what we're going to receive just yet.

1724
02:50:10,849 --> 02:50:18,795
But it's good to hear that the people that are involved, I believe that, you know, listening to everybody, Alicia,

1725
02:50:21,730 --> 02:50:27,652
We have a good understanding and idea of what we need to do.

1726
02:50:27,712 --> 02:50:29,893
Nick, you know, accessibility.

1727
02:50:30,233 --> 02:50:31,794
I mean, the building's 1970.

1728
02:50:31,834 --> 02:50:33,494
There was nothing accessible in 1970.

1729
02:50:34,615 --> 02:50:36,675
Anything that's accessible up there was an add-on.

1730
02:50:37,716 --> 02:50:40,557
And it's just, it's good to hear everybody.

1731
02:50:40,577 --> 02:50:44,458
And I look forward to moving forward.

1732
02:50:44,498 --> 02:50:44,798
Thank you.

1733
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:47,791
Thank you, John.

1734
02:50:49,132 --> 02:50:50,773
John Prestigiovanni.

1735
02:50:52,935 --> 02:50:54,596
I didn't butcher that too poorly.

1736
02:50:55,217 --> 02:50:59,020
I know that he is probably still hanging around in the gym right now.

1737
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:02,723
All right.

1738
02:51:03,784 --> 02:51:06,987
So then I think we might kick it over to Melissa.

1739
02:51:08,608 --> 02:51:09,809
Looks like we've got John.

1740
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:11,691
Oh, go ahead, John.

1741
02:51:11,871 --> 02:51:13,413
Oh, it's OK.

1742
02:51:13,513 --> 02:51:13,793
It's OK.

1743
02:51:16,082 --> 02:51:18,504
There's some awesome things happening tonight.

1744
02:51:18,825 --> 02:51:29,135
You know, as with Matt DeLucie, you know, him and I both graduated here in 1992, and we've both been pictures of the school here on site for many, many moons in different roles.

1745
02:51:30,516 --> 02:51:32,178
The site circulation is huge.

1746
02:51:33,599 --> 02:51:37,303
As there's an event going on at the Turk Field,

1747
02:51:38,468 --> 02:51:48,190
when there's events going on in the school, the gym area, a Saturday morning for Japanese school, the traffic and the safety, the parking is just horrendous.

1748
02:51:48,230 --> 02:51:53,751
So hopefully learning and helping with that function would be fantastic.

1749
02:51:53,911 --> 02:51:59,071
Everyone has really kind of ruined some ideas of the notes that I had.

1750
02:52:00,012 --> 02:52:07,653
I love the idea about this being the flagship of our city with community space, love to see

1751
02:52:08,735 --> 02:52:13,938
something like a quad area like they have on college campuses with a beautiful view of the Boston.

1752
02:52:15,159 --> 02:52:36,953
Something more into the athletic side of it, maybe an indoor, outdoor track or dome type building for winter seasons for us to utilize and for our, not just our fall, for our athletes here at Medford High School, but our youth sports can utilize this here at the high school.

1753
02:52:38,061 --> 02:52:49,991
So many great ideas, lots of, you know, looking at in and around parking areas, athletic fields, things like you mentioned already, like more lighting, more security.

1754
02:52:50,511 --> 02:52:52,713
I liked the idea, but maybe some more fencing.

1755
02:52:53,914 --> 02:53:00,239
We see it as working up at the turf fields and working in and out of the vents.

1756
02:53:00,819 --> 02:53:05,083
We have other students from other schools utilizing

1757
02:53:05,887 --> 02:53:09,848
our equipment here, using our facilities, using our turf fields.

1758
02:53:11,509 --> 02:53:12,929
They don't even live in Medford.

1759
02:53:12,969 --> 02:53:15,410
They sneak in and use our fields because it's here.

1760
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:23,152
They show more cameras, more security, more lighting to hopefully stop some of that type of stuff going on.

1761
02:53:23,172 --> 02:53:27,453
But everyone's all hit on the point that I wanted to bring up.

1762
02:53:27,533 --> 02:53:34,055
But again, the site circulation, the safety, the security is some things that

1763
02:53:34,753 --> 02:53:38,735
definitely would like to look at going forward and see what we can do from this group.

1764
02:53:38,815 --> 02:53:39,575
So thank you very much.

1765
02:53:41,777 --> 02:53:42,337
Thank you, John.

1766
02:53:42,357 --> 02:53:43,598
Appreciate that.

1767
02:53:44,458 --> 02:53:46,079
And now we can go over to Melissa.

1768
02:53:46,099 --> 02:53:47,500
Hi.

1769
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:51,502
So I guess reasons why I had interest here.

1770
02:53:51,522 --> 02:53:55,924
I work on some large scale projects in the city of Cambridge and it

1771
02:53:56,947 --> 02:54:07,474
is obvious to me that in these large-scale projects, you see a lot of departments not talking to each other or they don't realize one department's working on something or another department's.

1772
02:54:08,614 --> 02:54:15,178
My big thing I would like to bring to the table is collaboration across departments and asking people what their needs are.

1773
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:19,481
Everyone thinks they're doing the best job, but it's always surprising.

1774
02:54:19,521 --> 02:54:23,644
You usually don't have someone who has an overarching view of what is going on.

1775
02:54:23,684 --> 02:54:25,165
So the fact that we have a third party running this

1776
02:54:26,208 --> 02:54:27,109
exciting to me.

1777
02:54:27,749 --> 02:54:35,573
The two-way access, I can say I'm not, again, born and raised in Medford, but I have gone to the high school many times because I have a small child trying to go to the Medford Family Network events at night.

1778
02:54:35,813 --> 02:54:40,875
I have gone, got stuck up in that corner, and then I was trapped, and then I said, oh, maybe I belong here, maybe I don't.

1779
02:54:41,256 --> 02:54:43,237
No signs, it's dark, I'm, like, knocking.

1780
02:54:43,257 --> 02:54:46,538
I have my five-year-old daughter just trying to go in, like, that winter, like, night event.

1781
02:54:47,599 --> 02:54:51,741
It's a little wild, the way the parking works and how everything is set up in there.

1782
02:54:52,281 --> 02:54:54,523
And I've done a lot of Metro Family Network events.

1783
02:54:54,563 --> 02:54:56,565
It's just, it needs to be a circle.

1784
02:54:56,986 --> 02:54:59,908
Every time I think of that, I think of it as the same thing as that Everett Plaza.

1785
02:54:59,928 --> 02:55:03,431
Like you just, if an emergency happened there, you are trapped.

1786
02:55:03,491 --> 02:55:05,613
You are stuck there and it's like, good luck.

1787
02:55:06,154 --> 02:55:07,395
Cause it's a one way in, one way out.

1788
02:55:08,856 --> 02:55:10,758
Community, community buildings, community access.

1789
02:55:11,479 --> 02:55:17,144
Again, the Vienna flagship is something I'm interested in, in a modern flow.

1790
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:25,005
But yeah, I guess what everyone said, I really do piggyback on them, but I don't think people think hard enough, right?

1791
02:55:25,045 --> 02:55:29,129
Like I had issues with buses here in Medford, and you can work with your state representative.

1792
02:55:29,309 --> 02:55:30,590
We can ask for things.

1793
02:55:30,970 --> 02:55:33,292
I think Medford is like the last to come to the table.

1794
02:55:33,312 --> 02:55:35,754
We're like thrilled to get like other people's crumbs.

1795
02:55:35,834 --> 02:55:36,495
And in reality,

1796
02:55:36,888 --> 02:55:37,928
We are a big enough city.

1797
02:55:38,268 --> 02:55:40,349
We are here.

1798
02:55:40,369 --> 02:55:42,750
We are residents that pay taxes just like everybody else.

1799
02:55:42,790 --> 02:55:44,891
And we should be asking for things from the state.

1800
02:55:44,911 --> 02:55:46,311
We should be asking for additional buses.

1801
02:55:46,331 --> 02:55:52,353
We should be asking for grants and additional funding that I feel like we always think of like as a secondary thing.

1802
02:55:52,373 --> 02:55:55,994
And that's, I don't know, that is- It isn't true.

1803
02:55:56,994 --> 02:55:57,575
It isn't true.

1804
02:55:57,595 --> 02:55:58,655
It isn't true?

1805
02:55:59,195 --> 02:56:00,375
No, we're always looking.

1806
02:56:00,456 --> 02:56:01,956
We do ask the state to move buses.

1807
02:56:02,276 --> 02:56:03,336
We ask for more service.

1808
02:56:03,657 --> 02:56:05,037
We analyze everything that they put out.

1809
02:56:05,659 --> 02:56:09,142
And Alicia's office in particular is outstanding at getting grants.

1810
02:56:10,483 --> 02:56:13,505
I'm saying nothing doesn't happen.

1811
02:56:13,545 --> 02:56:17,688
I'm saying I was very close when I lived in Somerville.

1812
02:56:18,008 --> 02:56:19,469
I work for another community.

1813
02:56:19,650 --> 02:56:24,113
Again, funding is just done very differently in Medford than it is in neighboring communities.

1814
02:56:27,335 --> 02:56:29,417
Sorry, it wasn't meant to like, I don't know.

1815
02:56:29,437 --> 02:56:30,277
It wasn't meant to bad mouth.

1816
02:56:30,357 --> 02:56:30,878
It really is.

1817
02:56:31,078 --> 02:56:31,338
Yeah.

1818
02:56:31,438 --> 02:56:31,678
Sorry.

1819
02:56:31,918 --> 02:56:32,739
Thank you.

1820
02:56:32,759 --> 02:56:34,060
We do communicate with the MBTA.

1821
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:34,900
We request for buses.

1822
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:35,761
We change bus routes.

1823
02:56:35,801 --> 02:56:36,441
We move stuff.

1824
02:56:36,901 --> 02:56:38,242
We do that on the regular.

1825
02:56:38,642 --> 02:56:40,023
It's part of our normal process.

1826
02:56:40,504 --> 02:56:40,684
Okay.

1827
02:56:40,984 --> 02:56:41,384
I appreciate it.

1828
02:56:41,584 --> 02:56:43,085
Thank you.

1829
02:56:43,506 --> 02:56:51,891
But I think what we're getting at maybe some of this, does the school know to tell the DPW department in transportation

1830
02:56:52,464 --> 02:56:59,529
that it would be great if those MBTA buses left 15 minutes later or 10 minutes later and that we'd ask for that.

1831
02:56:59,870 --> 02:57:09,777
Like that's this internal conversation that sometimes it happens and sometimes it happens ad hoc and not like as intentional as it could be.

1832
02:57:11,138 --> 02:57:11,899
Morning, Alicia.

1833
02:57:11,919 --> 02:57:15,741
I'm keeping a very long list of asks for our state delegation, so.

1834
02:57:18,195 --> 02:57:29,981
And I'm smiling just because I know that there's a little bit of tension there, but I think it's great to be able to sort of have these conversations and have the opportunity for each department to sort of share out what they are doing.

1835
02:57:30,001 --> 02:57:36,684
I mean, that's really the focus here is to try to make sure that we can all hear each other as we start to sort through what the issues are on site.

1836
02:57:37,965 --> 02:57:39,966
So I have, I think, a minute.

1837
02:57:40,146 --> 02:57:42,087
I'm not sure if that's enough time to get the

1838
02:57:44,461 --> 02:57:45,983
screen back up here.

1839
02:57:46,003 --> 02:57:53,713
I'll try to do it very quickly just to remind people that January 13th is our next meeting.

1840
02:57:55,035 --> 02:57:59,941
We put up some topics and just so you can understand what to expect the next time as we went through.

1841
02:57:59,961 --> 02:58:02,584
I think actually we covered a lot of these.

1842
02:58:02,604 --> 02:58:03,305
There's a lot more.

1843
02:58:03,939 --> 02:58:06,520
uh, topics that were brought up today, which are absolutely excellent.

1844
02:58:06,860 --> 02:58:19,043
Um, and we will dive into, um, those as we move forward into the next meeting, um, we will be trying to do that last or sorry, the next meeting, um, as a hybrid meeting, um, so that there can be an in-person component.

1845
02:58:19,143 --> 02:58:29,806
So for the, those of you that do want to get together in person that we have that opportunity, but again, really appreciate everyone's time this evening, um, understanding that it's a busy time of year.

1846
02:58:30,541 --> 02:58:35,418
and that we're late into the evening here, but your voices are very, very much appreciated.

1847
02:58:36,900 --> 02:58:40,783
So with that, I will, oh, Chief Buckley has a parting word.

1848
02:58:40,803 --> 02:58:41,764
Sorry about that.

1849
02:58:41,824 --> 02:58:43,065
No, it's just a question.

1850
02:58:43,105 --> 02:58:45,226
Is there going to be further information we could have available?

1851
02:58:45,246 --> 02:58:52,812
Like one of the things I'm interested in is what is the actual square footage of the land we own and what is the square footage of the current building?

1852
02:58:53,513 --> 02:58:57,916
And what is, do we know yet is intended to be kept during construction?

1853
02:58:58,637 --> 02:59:01,499
I think that's going to put a little bit of perspective for me anyway.

1854
02:59:02,493 --> 02:59:04,874
We can certainly share that information just as we have it.

1855
02:59:04,934 --> 02:59:09,856
We are in the final stages of finishing up the onsite work for the survey now.

1856
02:59:10,756 --> 02:59:15,058
Probably early in the new year, we'll have an actual survey that will confirm the acreage.

1857
02:59:15,798 --> 02:59:20,600
And we're just about there with the survey of the existing building, the scanning of it as well to confirm that.

1858
02:59:21,294 --> 02:59:23,636
Um, so in the not too distant future, we definitely will have that.

1859
02:59:23,716 --> 02:59:29,680
I will leave us with the notion that we still don't have any idea of what's going to be renovated or saved or built new.

1860
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:34,183
Um, those are the things that we're going to be exploring, um, as we get into the new year.

1861
02:59:34,563 --> 02:59:40,087
Um, I think Jenny, you mentioned the fact that the building committee meetings are going to start to touch on some of those things.

1862
02:59:40,167 --> 02:59:41,568
So, um, if you're curious there.

1863
02:59:42,339 --> 02:59:46,344
And you want to either watch those live, participate in them live, or watch them after the fact.

1864
02:59:46,625 --> 02:59:52,192
It's a great opportunity to sort of become a little bit more up to speed with the project.

1865
02:59:52,652 --> 02:59:58,560
But Chief Buckley, we're also going to be reaching out to you, Chief Evans specifically, with that information as we go forward.

1866
02:59:58,580 --> 03:00:00,242
Thank you.

1867
03:00:01,353 --> 03:00:03,134
And then just some housekeeping as well.

1868
03:00:03,154 --> 03:00:09,738
We'll work on sending out the email for the calendar invite for next month's meeting before the holiday break.

1869
03:00:10,199 --> 03:00:14,881
And then we might just update it once we figure out the exact location and hybrid setup.

1870
03:00:15,022 --> 03:00:16,422
So just keep an eye out for that invite.

1871
03:00:16,442 --> 03:00:21,466
And if you could just accept it or decline, depending on your availability, that would be greatly beneficial for us.

1872
03:00:21,666 --> 03:00:22,226
So thank you.

1873
03:00:25,328 --> 03:00:25,828
Thank you, Will.

1874
03:00:26,409 --> 03:00:27,429
And thank you again, everybody.

1875
03:00:27,449 --> 03:00:29,010
I hope everyone has a good evening.

1876
03:00:29,030 --> 03:00:30,231
Bye, everyone.
