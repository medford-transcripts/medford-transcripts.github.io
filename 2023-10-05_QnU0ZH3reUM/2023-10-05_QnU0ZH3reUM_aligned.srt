00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,743
So the other day, I was talking to someone who had donated to me and some other candidates in 2020 when I was running for a different seat.

2
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:11,806
But now he said that he doesn't believe in electoral politics anymore.

3
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:15,228
He had lost faith in our democracy.

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:22,593
And I told him that in 2016, I had a similar crisis where I was really wondering if our democracy was still functioning.

5
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:29,737
And I've spent a number of years researching what makes democracy tick, creating my own theory about how we can improve it.

6
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:35,822
So I told him that I had a rough draft of a book on this topic and I sent him the first chapter.

7
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:38,304
I didn't expect anything because he said he wouldn't donate.

8
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:42,848
And the next day he actually sent me a very generous donation.

9
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:44,470
Thank you so much for that.

10
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:50,656
But I thought in case anyone else out there is worried about our democracy and wondering what you can do.

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,207
and also have time to read a 20 page chapter that I wrote.

12
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:57,551
It is linked down below.

13
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:08,778
And if you can donate a little bit to my campaign, because I am going to be doing all of the things that I describe in the chapter to reinvigorate our democracy right here in Medford.

14
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:09,520
Thank you.
