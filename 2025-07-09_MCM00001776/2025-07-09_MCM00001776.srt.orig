[SPEAKER_16]: 425-56 HP sign Rosa Chavez Durante, 12 Hale Avenue.

35
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:39,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Rosa, do you want to?

36
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Just trying to see if- Hold on, Rosa.

37
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:58,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, I went by today and I spoke to Rosa's sister.

38
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosa was at home.

39
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,336
[SPEAKER_09]: They do have a driveway.

40
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very tiny driveway, very skinny, and you'll not be able to get a car in that driveway.

41
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:15,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosa, if you're just here at the meeting, if you wouldn't mind just either raising your hand or putting in the notes here.

42
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:17,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not seeing you.

43
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:18,166
[SPEAKER_08]: There you are, okay.

44
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:21,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to ask you to unmute and then we're going to pull up your street.

45
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:27,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosa just hit, hit unmute and you should be fine.

46
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:28,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

47
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:34,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Rosa.

48
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:34,546
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

49
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:35,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm okay.

50
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:36,166
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you?

51
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:39,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to pull up your street here now.

52
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:40,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

53
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:01,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Rose, if you kind of want to explain kind of why you're applying for that placard, don't need any medical.

54
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Any medical on you or anything like that?

55
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:06,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Just I'm pulling up the street here.

56
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:10,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So the commissioners can see, but just why you're applying.

57
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,111
[SPEAKER_08]: We have all the paperwork.

58
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in order here on our end, but.

59
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:26,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, it's very hard to find a spot at the beginning of the street or in front of my house because there are cars that are parked from other streets that, you know, they're parking from the house.

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And with my medical issues, sometimes my husband has to help me cross the street or

61
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:45,186
[SPEAKER_15]: walk me through the corners straight into the house because of my sciatic and whatnot and my osteosis arthritis.

62
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,307
[SPEAKER_15]: We have contractors that come from other streets that park here.

63
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:59,950
[SPEAKER_15]: We have also people from other streets that park at the beginning of the street, as well as visitors or family from the condos of the street.

64
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:17,369
[SPEAKER_15]: And like yesterday, today's a very good days where, I mean, I did find a spot, but in as much pain as I am in, it's very hard, 90% of the time, trying to walk down the street with my illnesses.

65
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:17,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

66
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:37,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioners, any questions, commissioners?

67
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:38,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

68
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,468
[SPEAKER_20]: I do see that there's a curb cut there, but that doesn't actually look wide enough to be a driveway.

69
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:48,569
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I cannot pull my car in.

70
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Oftentimes, I drive my husband's for the comfort and we can't pull it in.

71
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:54,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

72
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,171
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very narrow.

73
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:02,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish we could because then I wouldn't be asking for a handicapped block.

74
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:03,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

75
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:08,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have cars that park and they stay there for days on end.

76
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think it's right that I have to park on Massachusetts Street or Main Street.

77
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Why can't I park on my own street?

78
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:19,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially when sometimes I can't even walk.

79
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we only have one other handcuff on the street, if I'm not mistaken.

80
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's only one, right?

81
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:35,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it's no longer there.

82
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,843
[SPEAKER_15]: They actually left.

83
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:44,545
[SPEAKER_15]: They have left, but we used to have one for my father-in-law and mother-in-law right in front of our house.

84
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:54,429
[SPEAKER_15]: We still have a little hole on the sidewalk from the park, from the pole.

85
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:02,466
[SPEAKER_20]: There appears to be a handicap sign in front of 13 Hale Avenue.

86
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,670
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that has been censored, removed.

87
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:07,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

88
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,814
[SPEAKER_15]: They moved into another state.

89
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:10,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

90
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:24,261
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did have one in front of our house for my in-laws, but when my father-in-law passed away, we called the city to remove it because it was just right.

91
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Not knowing that I was gonna need it.

92
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

93
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,306
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't have an issue with this.

94
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:34,528
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like the street is full of handicapped signs.

95
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:35,849
[SPEAKER_20]: You are aware that if,

96
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:44,465
[SPEAKER_20]: The sign goes up that it's not specific to you that anybody with a hand could legally use that spot, correct?

97
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:45,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

98
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

99
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a motion, Alicia?

100
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless somebody else has a comment before we move on.

101
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:57,895
[SPEAKER_08]: No objections.

102
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Then I'll motion to approve.

103
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:02,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

104
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:02,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

105
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:03,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

106
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner McGibbon?

107
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:08,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

108
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:10,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Hunt?

109
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:11,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

110
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Silva?

111
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:15,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

112
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:17,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Covino?

113
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:17,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

114
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:19,277
[SPEAKER_11]: One absent.

115
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:21,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, motion has passed.

116
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give DPW some time to get the sign up and should be there in the next couple of weeks.

117
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:31,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

118
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:36,865
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate all your time and effort to work this through.

119
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:37,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

120
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:38,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

121
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:39,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Very welcome.

122
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:39,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

123
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:40,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a nice night.

124
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:47,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

125
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:54,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Next item up is 2025-57, another HP sign for Antonio Barone, 29 Hamilton Street, Mr. Barone.

126
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, I won't buy today.

127
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,320
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no answer.

128
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,842
[SPEAKER_09]: My only concern is there's a very large driveway, whether it's his or not, right next door to the house, to the right of the house.

129
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:12,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you're present, please either raise your hand or.

130
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

131
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,998
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to ask you on mute and then I'll pull up the street here for.

132
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:20,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,420
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

134
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

135
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,661
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

136
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:28,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, we mentioned before, if you kind of like to.

137
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:33,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Explain kind of other than using any medical information and.

138
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Explain kind of why you're replying for the placard and we have all the information.

139
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,342
[SPEAKER_08]: here that's been paperwork, Alva, correct?

140
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:41,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do.

141
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:42,983
[SPEAKER_08]: The paperwork has been submitted for us, so.

142
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:50,408
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to kind of explain through, I'll pull up the street so that the commissioners can see the house.

143
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have chronic pain.

144
00:08:52,129 --> 00:09:03,276
[SPEAKER_06]: When I do a long walk, whether it's 20 feet or 30 feet, my back kind of gives out, and I usually sit on the wall in front of my house, so I kind of compose myself.

145
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:08,325
[SPEAKER_20]: So really, our question is why do you need a spot?

146
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, why can't you use the driveway type?

147
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:15,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, what prevents you from parking at your house at this time?

148
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,428
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really what we need to know about.

149
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:21,888
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have a handicapped placard, that covers your medical piece of it.

150
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have a two-family house.

151
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,830
[SPEAKER_06]: We have three cars, and then my tenants have cars to pull out.

152
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,751
[SPEAKER_06]: If you notice in the picture,

153
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:36,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you see the gates, there was gates put there where the yard is.

154
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:42,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now they're doing construction next door, so we kind of opened the gates so everybody can park in the yard.

155
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:47,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the picture's an older picture or a recent picture.

156
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:52,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you see the, we've shared the screen, can you see the picture that we have of the house here?

157
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:52,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this?

158
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's my house, yep.

159
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:55,409
[SPEAKER_06]: With the bricks in the front.

160
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:56,910
[SPEAKER_08]: There's gates here.

161
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:58,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously there's no gates here now.

162
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Halfway, if you like, go up into the driveway.

163
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:04,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see it now.

164
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:10,176
[SPEAKER_06]: The gates fold in to each other and we close them off and, you know, chain it so it's a yard.

165
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And only four cars fit in the front.

166
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:16,298
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the gates right there, see them?

167
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:17,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

168
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you close that, that's actually the yard back there.

169
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the driveway.

170
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're not supposed to have cars next to the back door.

171
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you notice, there's a back door.

172
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:34,120
[SPEAKER_06]: See the gate, there's two gates, one on the right-hand side of the house, one on the left-hand side of the house.

173
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:42,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually those are closed and chained, but they're doing a condominium next door, two-family condominium right next door to me.

174
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:47,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's trucks everywhere, so the tenants need a place to park.

175
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:55,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I just always usually park in front of my house, so I don't bother anybody.

176
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,491
[SPEAKER_06]: 33 Hamilton is two condos are going next door.

177
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's in the construction.

178
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the wall I actually sit on when I walk halfway up my driveway.

179
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:20,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stop, compose myself.

180
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:24,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I have chronic injury in my spine.

181
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,195
[SPEAKER_16]: How many tenants do you have?

182
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:32,396
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two.

183
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:33,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, okay.

184
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,339
[SPEAKER_06]: There's usually four cars in the driveway.

185
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:36,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

186
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:42,684
[SPEAKER_06]: The gates again, they're not closed because next door they were working.

187
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:45,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I get it.

188
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it, yeah.

189
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:54,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, any... Any other handicapped signs around, Jordan?

190
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked at the street.

191
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:00,016
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't believe there's any that we have that is listed.

192
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and no objections to this.

193
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I have no objections here.

194
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:10,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Other commissioners, any other questions or we, um,

195
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:18,222
[SPEAKER_20]: And so you're saying you do put three cars in the driveway, just four?

196
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:21,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes there's four in the driveway.

197
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:27,909
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, because as a two unit, you're required to have parking on site for three cars.

198
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:28,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

199
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:30,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

200
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,036
[SPEAKER_06]: But what happens in the wintertime, it's worse.

201
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:41,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So we open the gates, and we let more cars park in, because when you have that snow band,

202
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: to get the cars off the road, off the street.

203
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,278
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we ended up dealing with the gates.

204
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:52,299
[SPEAKER_06]: There used to be a fence there, and I took it down a long time ago.

205
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And I came up with that idea so we could put more cars in, so no cars get towed away.

206
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:05,064
[SPEAKER_20]: We appreciate that, that you make space for more vehicles during snow events.

207
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:22,652
[SPEAKER_20]: And as we just said to the previous person, I assume you heard that if it's a handicapped parking placard, it is not specific to you and your vehicle, but rather anybody that has a handicapped parking placard would be able to use it.

208
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:25,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I understand.

209
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:25,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what you mean.

210
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,397
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone's there, you can't say anything.

211
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:28,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

212
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:36,210
[SPEAKER_20]: We just like to be very clear because sometimes people in the past have thought that they are specific to them.

213
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,691
[SPEAKER_20]: So we just like to make sure everybody understands up front.

214
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

215
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:47,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

216
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:48,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioners.

217
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:52,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim, I don't know if that was a motion, but Commissioner Silver, I know.

218
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:53,854
[SPEAKER_08]: A motion to approve.

219
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:55,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

220
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:56,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

221
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, Alva.

222
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner McGiven?

223
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, indeed.

224
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:02,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Hunt?

225
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:02,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

226
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:04,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Silva?

227
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:05,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

228
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:06,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Covino?

229
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:07,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

230
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:09,903
[SPEAKER_11]: One absent.

231
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:23,446
[SPEAKER_08]: As stated before, you know, the motion has passed and just give a few weeks here for FDW and public works to get the sign over there, but thank you.

232
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:24,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate your time.

233
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:25,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

234
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:26,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks everybody.

235
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:26,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

236
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,527
[SPEAKER_08]: You're very welcome.

237
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, move on to 2025-58.

238
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:40,517
[SPEAKER_16]: We have another handicap sign for Raffaellina Maldonado, 118 Willis Avenue.

239
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,939
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like it's to be posted on Right Ave.

240
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Sarge, do you want to fill us in on that?

241
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, I went by today, no answer.

242
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,223
[SPEAKER_09]: My only comment is there is a handicap sign at 120.

243
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:55,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Willis House.

244
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,628
[SPEAKER_09]: She is looking on right there, which would be the corner.

245
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,370
[SPEAKER_09]: She has a corner house at Willis and Wright House.

246
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:04,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a resident parking there too?

247
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, correct.

248
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:08,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Because she's a corner house, so she can get a resident parking there too.

249
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:08,817
[SPEAKER_16]: She can.

250
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:09,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

251
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:11,939
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is one at 120.

252
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:20,357
[SPEAKER_16]: 120 Willis, which is right next door.

253
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:20,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

254
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:21,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Just book.

255
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this the house in the greenhouse?

256
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we don't.

257
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:26,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that belong to one 20?

258
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:29,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I think she's, I think she's on here now.

259
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:39,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I asked you on mute.

260
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:40,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you able to unmute?

261
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:41,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm right here.

262
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:49,252
[SPEAKER_08]: You just wanna just explain why you're applying for the handicap placard, like we stated before for the other.

263
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:55,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have a chronic condition called lipedema and the heaviness of my leg and pain.

264
00:15:56,674 --> 00:16:06,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have better access to go back up and down the back of my stairs to the backyard to get to my house.

265
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,058
[SPEAKER_08]: This gray house is yours, correct?

266
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:08,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right there, yeah.

267
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And you enter through the front or you enter through the back?

268
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,197
[SPEAKER_03]: the back is more helpful for me.

269
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:18,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

270
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:19,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OK.

271
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:21,518
[SPEAKER_20]: And can you clarify?

272
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:25,439
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like there's a parking garage in a driveway right there.

273
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:25,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

274
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did park my car there for a while.

275
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And the park clerk came by and said I couldn't park there because my car is too long.

276
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It sticks out to the sidewalk.

277
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't put it in the garage?

278
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:43,436
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we already have, we've got two, we've got two family there.

279
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:45,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got, I already have like three cars, four cars.

280
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:47,717
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already two cars in there.

281
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cars, they do stick out in the sidewalk.

282
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did you say it was?

283
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,760
[SPEAKER_08]: The other handicap?

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there one at 120?

285
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,320
[SPEAKER_08]: On the front.

286
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,000
[SPEAKER_08]: On Willis Ave.

287
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,165
[SPEAKER_08]: but a left on the left.

288
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think you're a coach.

289
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:18,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you should be able to unmute.

290
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be right there.

291
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:31,170
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to comment, I'm looking at the list of accessible spaces that we have, and this space at 120 will 70 was granted in 2010.

292
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's going to impact.

293
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if we want to see if that person is still using that space or.

294
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:39,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they do.

295
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:40,791
[SPEAKER_14]: They do.

296
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:41,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

297
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:45,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, it might be used by somebody because there's 113 Willis, 120 Willis, 195 Willis.

298
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,272
[SPEAKER_14]: 113, they do use theirs.

299
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:53,380
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time, and 120 does use theirs all the time.

300
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,740
[SPEAKER_14]: 113, that's been there since 92.

301
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

302
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:55,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

303
00:17:56,782 --> 00:18:03,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I just wanted to chime in and let y'all know what the other ones were for, and if, just info on those.

304
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not seeing, do we have any on, is there any on Wright Ave?

305
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:07,908
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

306
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:12,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Just at 113 Willis.

307
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:17,714
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one on Wright Ave, but it was granted to 113 Willis Avenue.

308
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Say, hold on.

309
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,131
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be the same guy.

310
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,472
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same name.

311
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:25,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Same name on Willis and Wright.

312
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:26,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

313
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:27,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

314
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:28,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

315
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:35,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioner, is there any?

316
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Is Wright Ave a one-way street?

317
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,096
[SPEAKER_20]: I was a little confused looking at it.

318
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:40,496
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

319
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,876
[SPEAKER_20]: The direction signs were pointed.

320
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:49,438
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one way from Maine to Willis, and then it's two way from Willis to Pierce.

321
00:18:56,611 --> 00:19:08,778
[SPEAKER_20]: Just the parking, the signs that exist, the slow children and parking by permit are on the left side of the street, which usually indicates a one-way street.

322
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:17,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so that would be a one way.

323
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:21,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the one way is coming from this way.

324
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:28,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

325
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:33,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So would, uh, is the request for behind that pickup truck, the Toyota truck?

326
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm requesting it right where the Toyota truck is.

327
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:39,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where the Toyota truck is.

328
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:39,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

329
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:40,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

330
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your entrance and those are your stairs.

331
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:43,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

332
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:45,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

333
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:49,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there should be enough room.

334
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:55,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to get a better view for you, Tim, but there should be plenty of room.

335
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:55,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

336
00:19:55,459 --> 00:20:00,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like there's a lot of middle community that we can see.

337
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you got, you got at least one that's plenty of room.

338
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:11,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think, um, and we're, we're not causing any, like, congestion of handicap spaces or anything.

339
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:15,700
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple around the corner, but, um, there's a need and right out doesn't have any.

340
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:18,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I have no objection.

341
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:21,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no objection either.

342
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other commissioners or Tim, is that a motion?

343
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:26,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be a motion.

344
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, I didn't know if anybody else had any objections.

345
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:32,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it's a motion, sure.

346
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, I'll second it.

347
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:35,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

348
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, go right, roll call, Alva.

349
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner McGibbon?

350
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:41,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

351
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Hunt?

352
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:43,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

353
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:44,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Silva?

354
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:45,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

355
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:46,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Covino?

356
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:47,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

357
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:48,939
[SPEAKER_11]: One absent.

358
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Alva, do we want to specify where it's supposed to go?

359
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sir, it's to be posted on Wright Avenue.

360
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,855
[SPEAKER_09]: from about a foot from the driveway.

361
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:03,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it should be as close as they can make it to that driver.

362
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:07,860
[SPEAKER_16]: They're blocking the driveway, making it difficult for people to get in and out.

363
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,021
[SPEAKER_11]: When I send the orders over, I will put that.

364
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:10,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

365
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:16,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Just as we stated before, just give it a few weeks here for public works and DPW to get that installed.

366
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion is passed, so.

367
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:21,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

368
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,574
[SPEAKER_16]: So in Osborne?

369
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

370
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:41,057
[SPEAKER_16]: 2025-59, safety improvements, Osborne Road and Wool Street, Placement Road.

371
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Todd Blake, you want to fill us in on that?

372
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:51,545
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to run with me, I can upload the most flyers.

373
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all yours.

374
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:54,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

375
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:04,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So over the years, we've gotten requests to make improvements at a number of intersections throughout the city, including this one.

376
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:06,185
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's come up over the years.

377
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:17,553
[SPEAKER_05]: As far back as 2016 in a complete streets priority list, I think it was number 29 out of the amount that they looked at it.

378
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:36,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And we recently received another request or complaint about the area in general, usually involves, you know, cars are going too fast, not stopping the desire to have crosswalks and things like that, but due to capital limitations.

379
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:39,306
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do well, we can't do crosswalks.

380
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:42,488
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't paint new crosswalks unless there are ramps as well.

381
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:44,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a capital expense.

382
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd like to do that, but it's a long list of ramps we have to do in the city as well.

383
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:54,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but we didn't want to continue to ignore the requests and concerns at this area.

384
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was one proposal to, um,

385
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:02,899
[SPEAKER_05]: to help remedy some of the issues, not all the issues, or improve some of the issues.

386
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to use the word fix or remedy because, you know, it's never seems to be 100%.

387
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:15,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But this will, I believe, help improve sight lines and reduce conflicts.

388
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:21,644
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll show the rough sketch of what the idea is.

389
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:24,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just share this.

390
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:35,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'll go to the map first.

391
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:39,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an aerial of the existing intersection.

392
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very wide and expansive, even though it's only one lane east direction.

393
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:49,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Osborne is currently a one-way from Pleistead to Winthrop Street.

394
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:56,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like remnants of when it must have been a two-way at one point.

395
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a median at Osborne with two entrances to get in.

396
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:11,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happens is, as described by some folks that have inquired, the stop sign and the stop line for Woburn is set way back here versus up at Playstead.

397
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:22,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And people coming from the south from West Medford Square come north on Playstead and take this angled right towards one of the openings in Osborne.

398
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And they kind of cut across traffic coming from Woburn.

399
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:30,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But if this intersection were done over from scratch today, it would be much tighter.

400
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:34,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And these folks that are trying to take it right onto Osborne.

401
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:37,524
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, one option is likely to go up here.

402
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:51,871
[SPEAKER_05]: If all my cars then take a more pronounced right turn so they go slower, that would enable the stop bar on Woburn to be pulled up much closer to playstead and enable that the drivers on Woburn to see if cars are coming up playstead or not.

403
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:59,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And it keeps that right turn up from kind of almost broadsiding those folks on Woburn.

404
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'll try to bring up the graphic.

405
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:23,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a graphic kind of indicating what it could look could be one of the potential options of many that could improve this in section by tightening it up and

406
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:37,893
[SPEAKER_05]: here at Woburn at Osborne could be moved closer to the police station section enabling that driver to look both directions and for police folks to see that car exiting Woburn.

407
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:39,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do this with paint.

408
00:25:40,565 --> 00:25:49,149
[SPEAKER_05]: the yellow and white line moved with a new stop sign that would likely have to be mounted to like a planter barrel like we have a place that in Winthrop Street.

409
00:25:49,729 --> 00:26:09,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And this graphic just indicated the potential to use physical elements to help instruct folks of the change and help prevent people, especially at the beginning from just disregarding new markings because a lot of people will drive on autopilot and not be aware of whatever changes we do end up making.

410
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:16,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So it reduces speed, reduces conflicts, improves sightlines with minimal costs.

411
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of seen as a quick build type treatment, meaning you could pilot something like this.

412
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:30,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if it does improve and people like it, you could work towards a capital project to physically implement it with curbing and things like that.

413
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:32,865
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a much larger capital improvement project.

414
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,366
[SPEAKER_05]: which we don't have the resources for right now.

415
00:26:35,486 --> 00:26:44,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to do things like this quick, quick build and other season towns as well, because we want to improve as many places as we can with the limited resources we have.

416
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,655
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the gist of it.

417
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the commissioners have any question?

418
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it kind of mirror the complete streets concept that was approved?

419
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually the,

420
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The Complete Streets one that was in 2016 was the opposite.

421
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It closed the opposite entrance.

422
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,914
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's pros and cons to doing one versus the other.

423
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:16,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you close the opposite and leave the opening, the one that's further down Woburn, that

424
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:21,214
[SPEAKER_05]: issue of people turning right from place that still exists.

425
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:27,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would either go right and go straight across, or they'd go right and then make a media left onto Osborne.

426
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's pros and cons.

427
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking back into the prioritization list, Tim, for like, say, Tufts Square.

428
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:36,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It was similar.

429
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:40,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Tufts Square at the time had one proposed alternative in the complete streets list.

430
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:48,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when we got into preliminary design in a memo with the consultant, they looked at three options.

431
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,294
[SPEAKER_05]: The one that was presented plus two others.

432
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And it ended up switching as well from the original idea.

433
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:55,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's many things you could do.

434
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:58,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people have suggested one way, the opposite way.

435
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,244
[SPEAKER_05]: But that has pros and cons, too, because the cuts were just introduced the opposite way, and there's other types of issues.

436
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:10,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So balancing all that, this was the one that seemed to address some of the concerns.

437
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you think you could always pilot it for six months or something?

438
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:15,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

439
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:16,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

440
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:17,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

441
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:25,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's no other questions.

442
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:34,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to put it out to the public to see if anybody from the public that would like to speak.

443
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:35,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one more.

444
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:36,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, sorry.

445
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:37,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to commission.

446
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

447
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask until right now when you said that the physical barriers, right?

448
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:47,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I know at place that we have the white and yellow, white and orange barriers.

449
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:53,720
[SPEAKER_04]: We do something similar here, or would it be what do you envision there for those barriers?

450
00:28:56,191 --> 00:29:02,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the very least, the yellow, the double yellow being extended, and then the white line and the stop sign being moved.

451
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:12,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But to help protect the stop sign, and again, help reinforce the new way of doing things, something physical usually is necessary, because people just disobey the paint.

452
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally with the larger area, with the equipment we have, we'd do like a plastic water filled barrier.

453
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:26,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't like the aesthetics of those, but those enable us to use less of them and it's more obvious to people that's blocked off.

454
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:30,037
[SPEAKER_05]: We could also use the skinny cone flex posts.

455
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:37,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this scenario where I showed those potential barriers, they could be white flex posts, the skinny variety.

456
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:43,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you could also add yellow flex posts to the double yellow itself where that

457
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:48,744
[SPEAKER_05]: the right turner from place that used to cross over where it wasn't yellow before.

458
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:54,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that at Emerson when we blocked maneuvers from Emerson onto Maine.

459
00:29:54,947 --> 00:30:00,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be a variety of things that we have available, but yeah, good question.

460
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Good deal.

461
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the sound of all those.

462
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, some people have commentary on what they see out there.

463
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:06,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

464
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:10,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good, Jordan.

465
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:15,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to pass it off to the public.

466
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:22,994
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any comments on this, please raise your hand and we'll go in order in which we receive.

467
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:29,320
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any issues raising your hand or can't figure that out, just put some comments into the

468
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:46,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Joanne, briefly before we move on to resident comps, I just want the commissioners to know that engineering department, myself and the intern individually flyered every household on Osborne and about eight houses in each direction and placed it in Woburn.

469
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:54,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And then communication with Robocall, the larger area today, but we flyered last week so that we try to get response.

470
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:55,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

471
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:07,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what you guys think.

472
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:08,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

473
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name is Deanne Wary and I live on Woburn Street.

474
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:19,166
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you, Todd, for your engagement on this ongoing challenge.

475
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:31,593
[SPEAKER_18]: While I would love a longer term solution, both for pedestrians, people in cars and people on bikes, because I find all three to be challenging at that intersection.

476
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:34,415
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the interim

477
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:49,945
[SPEAKER_18]: proposal, it still does require a car to potentially make kind of two stops to take a right on Playstead because you'll have that new stop sign and then you'll still have to sort of slow down a little bit, but it will.

478
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:57,689
[SPEAKER_18]: I sort of tested it out this morning and you could see a little bit better down to the left on Playstead.

479
00:31:59,129 --> 00:31:59,850
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're on a

480
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:15,972
[SPEAKER_18]: bike or if you're walking, you will kind of need to, you know, walk to that stop sign, walk to the stop sign on the other side of Osborne, walk halfway across Playstead and then walk the other half across Playstead just to get to Oak Grove.

481
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,213
[SPEAKER_18]: And the same goes if you're biking.

482
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:21,294
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is very challenging.

483
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:30,357
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do think that for safety, we need something because there's just zero sightline at the end of Woburn right now.

484
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:34,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

485
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary, we're gonna go to you next.

486
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:39,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ask you to unmute.

487
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:46,655
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, the barriers that you were talking about, those are the ones that are right at the top of the place they wrote, correct?

488
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:51,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's two different types of place they wrote right now.

489
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the original ones were the larger water filled plastic barriers, some orange, some white.

490
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:03,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we recently moved some of the orange away, the larger ones for the skinny white ones.

491
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:11,956
[SPEAKER_23]: And the one that, and the one pole, that flagpole, that's on the, going, a place that road to Winter Street, because those two have been knocked down.

492
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,883
[SPEAKER_23]: Those two have been knocked down, and the white barriers, three of them have been moved.

493
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:24,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the DPW is going to follow up with us, fixing those to the ground so that they wouldn't be moved so easily.

494
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,604
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just positioned temporarily.

495
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:29,725
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to use the other barriers for a different purpose.

496
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:32,426
[SPEAKER_23]: So those have been there for what, two years?

497
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:33,146
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it two years?

498
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:33,786
[SPEAKER_23]: Or is it three?

499
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,367
[SPEAKER_23]: Are we going on three for those temporary barriers at the top of Pleistats?

500
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about two plus, yeah.

501
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:41,789
[SPEAKER_23]: Two plus, yeah.

502
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:51,014
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would argue that that's enabled us to have safety in those two plus years, right?

503
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes if we wait for a capital project, I know that it's very tough to...

504
00:33:56,917 --> 00:34:03,162
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, pinpoint numbers, but a large in section like place that it went through would cost upwards of a million dollars to do it.

505
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:08,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Concrete, curbing, like tough square, like Hanes Square type of improvement.

506
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:16,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a way to, that was a way to try to curb speeding for people coming from Winchester taking that big right turn.

507
00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:20,274
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do understand the aesthetics, but these are the tools that we have.

508
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have a preference, we'd like to hear, thank you.

509
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:30,333
[SPEAKER_23]: No, but at the top of that street, you also may know that crosswalk, you take your life in your hands on that too.

510
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:34,197
[SPEAKER_23]: The two bushes there, they overgrow, so if you're in the middle there, nobody sees you.

511
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:37,160
[SPEAKER_23]: But we'll go back to Osborne Road, because that's where I live, so.

512
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,422
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm good.

513
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:41,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

514
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:46,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, we can note that DBW could trim some of those hedges in the median.

515
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:52,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask if she could maybe write me an email about where that obstruction is.

516
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:55,333
[SPEAKER_04]: We can send someone out to get protocols for that.

517
00:34:55,673 --> 00:35:00,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So a DPW office phone call or email would be fine.

518
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:02,775
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually have your, I have your card.

519
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,496
[SPEAKER_23]: You gave it to me when you guys did the street.

520
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:05,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

521
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

522
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Just show me a quick email.

523
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:08,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll, we'll send someone out and take care of the obstruction.

524
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:09,598
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

525
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:12,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Elizabeth.

526
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,439
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to you now and asking on mute.

527
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Elizabeth, yeah, I think we may have lost you here.

528
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:34,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I couldn't unmute myself, but I guess somebody finally let me.

529
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:35,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

530
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:36,783
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Elizabeth Crouchite.

531
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:42,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I live on Diane Road, just a block down from the intersection at Osborne that we're talking about.

532
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:47,388
[SPEAKER_12]: I picked up a piece of litter on Placid Road the other day, and it turned out to be the notice of this meeting.

533
00:35:47,408 --> 00:35:50,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really glad that either someone dropped it or the wind blew it.

534
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,871
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to echo Mary's comment about the obstruction of the bushes at Placid Road.

535
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:57,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for saying that.

536
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:04,267
[SPEAKER_12]: I drive and take this right at this intersection with Osborne.

537
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I bike, I walk.

538
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,008
[SPEAKER_12]: I also walk with the dog.

539
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:10,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm super in favor of you trying this.

540
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a great idea.

541
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

542
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:19,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand the limitations of the temporary barriers and all that, but I think that doing it on a pilot basis makes sense.

543
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,956
[SPEAKER_12]: My entire family is going to be very appreciative of this.

544
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,998
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I was wondering is, because I can't really tell from the drawing, is

545
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:37,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it possible with these temporary barriers, whatever, to slightly change the line of that, what will now be a much sharper right turn?

546
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:54,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Because right now, the way the road is angled, Osborne, so I'm not sure, since we're not changing the median itself for that little island, I wasn't sure if the barriers could be used to soften that angle a bit.

547
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:57,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

548
00:36:57,313 --> 00:37:01,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, I think you best answer that.

549
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I lost Todd.

550
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:12,783
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I just had my internet drop for a minute.

551
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:15,784
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we're having trouble in City Hall with our internet.

552
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:17,746
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

553
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give us one minute.

554
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:21,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll try and.

555
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:29,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Get back when a director Blake is back on here and kind of you can probably answer best if the they're able.

556
00:37:29,653 --> 00:37:34,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see why there shouldn't be an issue where they could slow that curve down with that right turn.

557
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,880
[SPEAKER_08]: But we.

558
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:52,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only speak for Emerson street, but once we got the high barriers on Emerson street, it's, it's, it's been a world of change here from Emerson at main, but, um, I know that there was a couple, uh, different ways that they changed main street from South and main street at Emerson and place that.

559
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:01,003
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's, it's definitely a temporary where they need feedback from all the residents to kind of let us know what's working and what's not working.

560
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:05,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause if we don't hear any feedback, whether it's good or bad, then we're not going to know.

561
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:06,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um,

562
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed a lot of that, but I get the gist of it.

563
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the reason I was asking Todd about the types of the barriers is because we'll probably start by doing the movable water ones.

564
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:19,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if things look, we'll tweak those and we can change curves and make things safer.

565
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's an iterative process.

566
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:24,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we anchor things to the pavement, those bollards.

567
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:27,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like Todd was saying, we line up a capital project eventually.

568
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So two plus years is actually a short amount of time that is still within the range of temporary.

569
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:35,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Temporary can be five years in this world or more.

570
00:38:35,444 --> 00:38:36,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wanted to mention that.

571
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:39,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of the process that we would go through.

572
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:41,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I just texted him.

573
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did too.

574
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:48,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Once Director Blake comes on, we can kind of re-air.

575
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:56,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask that question again, but yeah, see if it's he probably knows if it's the feasibility of it.

576
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:00,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll move on to Peter and ask you to unmute.

577
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:03,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, yeah, this is actually Michelle.

578
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:06,558
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm on my husband's account, whose name is Peter.

579
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:14,425
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually, Tim kind of answered part of my question, which I was going to ask how long temporary barriers typically stay up for.

580
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,648
[SPEAKER_19]: But I was curious, you mentioned this could be a pilot.

581
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:24,114
[SPEAKER_19]: How do pilots typically work, and how do you determine if it's working or if it's not?

582
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:28,498
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just newer to the area, so I was curious if someone could address that.

583
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:34,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to ask if Todd is back on.

584
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:35,735
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I could feel that.

585
00:39:36,056 --> 00:39:38,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I mean, I, I'm not sure he's not back on.

586
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:40,700
[SPEAKER_08]: He just texted says he's having an Internet issue.

587
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can only speak for the 1 we have here on Emerson itself.

588
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:50,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Emerson, we had 8 collisions and 7 or 8 weeks and.

589
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:59,845
[SPEAKER_08]: We have now turned Emerson street has had no collisions other than somebody colliding with cones since that was enacted.

590
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was about a 16 months ago.

591
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:09,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Main itself had 32 collisions on state and city roads.

592
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have only had 3 collisions since that was there, and that's been there 2 years.

593
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure of other ones that I'm missing.

594
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:25,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really speak and on to how long this will be a temporary 1, maybe commissioner given if you could maybe give a right.

595
00:40:26,038 --> 00:40:26,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

596
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:32,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I would only say that, as Todd mentioned, this is a complete streets target project.

597
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:36,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's on the priority list back from 2016 or 17 when we did that.

598
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:40,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's data associated with those as far as crashes and whatnot.

599
00:40:41,513 --> 00:40:46,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, just from a design standpoint, the design of this intersection is terrible.

600
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:50,054
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that it creates conflicts just because of the design.

601
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would look at data from the police as far as crashes goes.

602
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:57,356
[SPEAKER_04]: motor vehicle accidents, whatnot, pedestrians as well.

603
00:40:58,537 --> 00:41:02,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea would be those would go down, less people are complaining.

604
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:06,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we're only getting complaints about the ugly barriers, things like that.

605
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,162
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've created a safer situation.

606
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:11,703
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there are issues, sometimes there are issues.

607
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:15,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to iron those out as much as we can before we actually put curb in the ground.

608
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:19,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Engineers make mistakes, get radiuses wrong and things like that.

609
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:30,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So sightlines and radii, I believe one of the women commented on, we take those types of things into consideration, move things around, tweak them, and then that turns into a more permanent project.

610
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:33,618
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as timeline and funding goes, that's the biggest thing.

611
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So funding has a long timeline to it.

612
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,221
[SPEAKER_04]: this would go on a capital project list.

613
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:47,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be five, six, seven years out, depending on how we do the priority list and how we fund it from the state.

614
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Todd said this is kind of down in the list.

615
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:57,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're going for that funding, it would be more than five years, because there are other intersections that would be ahead of this one that we would do with hardscaping.

616
00:41:58,374 --> 00:41:59,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that answers the question.

617
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that does.

618
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:04,938
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just curious, do you have any current data for that intersection that you could share?

619
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably do let the police talk, but we probably have the old data for a complete streets that and then whatever the police have now.

620
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:15,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

621
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:19,038
[SPEAKER_19]: And how can I reach out to you to get that data?

622
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:25,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd's not on the call, but any design information that he's using or looking at, he can share with you.

623
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's what he would talk about maybe here.

624
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if, Jordan, you want to talk about things that you've seen?

625
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,029
[SPEAKER_20]: We have Todd here now.

626
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:31,750
[SPEAKER_20]: He came in.

627
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

628
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that, folks.

629
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a connection issue.

630
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:38,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, I think Tim answered everything spot on.

631
00:42:38,074 --> 00:42:42,857
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing I would add is, regardless of the data, sometimes

632
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:50,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the issues aren't necessarily apparent in actual crashes, it's more near misses.

633
00:42:50,827 --> 00:43:05,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So just by us knowing that there's issues, I would fear that if we did nothing, you know, not the quick build stuff, and then there happens to be an incident, you know, we're aware of the concerns, so we should do something about it, right?

634
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:09,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to prevent crashes, not necessarily just respond to when they happen, so.

635
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, yeah, absolutely.

636
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:12,201
[SPEAKER_19]: That makes sense.

637
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:17,706
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think where I'm having a little bit of trouble is just like measuring the success than if it's more like preventative.

638
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:26,233
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know, do you have like a method that you use typically if it's more of a preventative measure to see if it's being successful?

639
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:35,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as Tim mentioned with the capital expenses, same thing with studying and collecting a lot of data.

640
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:43,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we could get crash data simply from the police net before and after, but again, it might not show up as apparent as some like Maine itself does.

641
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:53,445
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes we go straight to improvements without an extensive study process because that also has soft costs associated with it.

642
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:57,228
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd rather put whatever costs we do have in implementation versus

643
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:06,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in the past, the city has been criticized before, most of us have been working here, that they study something, put it on the shelf, and nothing ever happens.

644
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:09,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to take that to heart and do the best we can.

645
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are all valid and important questions that you're asking.

646
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:14,860
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, thank you.

647
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,281
[SPEAKER_19]: And sorry, I know I'm using a lot of time.

648
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,863
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just have one more quick question.

649
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:21,525
[SPEAKER_19]: I walk my dog in that area a lot.

650
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:27,979
[SPEAKER_19]: When I cross the street, the middle median, actually the brush is pretty high.

651
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:35,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're redirecting traffic to the left side there, I can't see cars coming that way through the brush.

652
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:37,789
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm also wondering if we could cut that back as well.

653
00:44:40,732 --> 00:44:46,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, any tree trimming or bush trimming or cutting back, I'm usually all for it.

654
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:48,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm all about sight lines.

655
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:54,475
[SPEAKER_05]: The better sight lines, the better chances you get drivers and pedestrians and cyclists to make good choices, right?

656
00:44:55,135 --> 00:45:00,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the interest of not taking up more time here, if you could do me a favor, give the DBW office a call.

657
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:05,217
[SPEAKER_04]: They can get the precise information from you as to where that obstruction is, and we'll take care of that one as well.

658
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:06,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

659
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:06,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

660
00:45:06,758 --> 00:45:07,518
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate your time.

661
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:08,658
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

662
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:14,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen, we're gonna go with you here and ask you to unmute.

663
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:18,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you so much.

664
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,718
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Jen Bernheisen.

665
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,879
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a Woburn Street resident as well.

666
00:45:22,899 --> 00:45:27,901
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to thank the commission for addressing this issue.

667
00:45:29,642 --> 00:45:35,745
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you know, drive and walk through this intersection as do my kids daily.

668
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:42,909
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm hopeful that we can, you know, I really appreciate the addressing the traffic issues with it.

669
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:46,611
[SPEAKER_17]: The sight lines are really rough coming out of Woburn streets.

670
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:55,656
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm hoping that at some point we can also talk a little bit about how to make it a little bit safer for pedestrians.

671
00:45:55,976 --> 00:45:59,598
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that this should help a little bit, but I'm hoping that we can think a little more about.

672
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:06,643
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a very high pedestrian area for a lot of the folks that live in this neighborhood.

673
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:11,006
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm hopeful that we can also be thinking about that at some point in the future.

674
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:18,472
[SPEAKER_17]: But thank you so much for putting this on the list and working towards some solutions to this intersection.

675
00:46:19,414 --> 00:46:20,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great point.

676
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:29,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say, since you brought that up, this improvement I believe will help all modes, vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians.

677
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as Tim mentioned, we can be flexible with the radii and different things.

678
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:45,849
[SPEAKER_05]: If we use those physical barriers in some form, that essentially creates an island, a refuge for pedestrians to walk behind to get them closer to where they want to go.

679
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is for all modes.

680
00:46:49,092 --> 00:47:00,021
[SPEAKER_05]: My apologies if it sounded like it was just crash vehicle on vehicle.

681
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:02,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to

682
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:10,661
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of another street that we, we did, uh, Todd and I was, uh, Maine and, and, uh, sorry, uh, Winthrop itself.

683
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:17,527
[SPEAKER_08]: This was an intersection that we, you know, had multiple studies on that similar intersection to this.

684
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:24,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we had brought up safety concerns and, um, luckily we didn't, we,

685
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:31,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Had a pedestrian collision there and luckily it turned out okay, but it was an intersection that we knew about that.

686
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:32,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have changed.

687
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:34,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And as long as I'm here on the.

688
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:42,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Having a voice, I'll never allow some safety concerns to come forward that we are going to be able to make some sort of improvement on.

689
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:56,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know the residents, you know, there may be not exact data that we can go off of here, but with everyone in the commissions and the police departments, we drive around and we see these intersections and we understand quickly how sightline or safety may be an issue.

690
00:47:56,857 --> 00:48:02,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is 1, that's a main reason that we had this traffic commission meeting along with other things.

691
00:48:02,862 --> 00:48:07,405
[SPEAKER_08]: to be in July so that we didn't have to wait until the next traffic meeting to bring this up.

692
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:17,792
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no sense in our collective minds being together here for a safety issue when it's right in front of our faces, but that's just my comment on it.

693
00:48:18,952 --> 00:48:26,257
[SPEAKER_20]: Chief, there is one comment in the chat with somebody saying that they're not in a good place where they could unmute and speak.

694
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:28,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you want me to just read it out loud for them?

695
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, absolutely.

696
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Their name is Catherine Mather.

697
00:48:33,653 --> 00:48:34,473
[SPEAKER_20]: They say apologies.

698
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:41,837
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not in a great place to unmute and speak, but I live on the corner of Woburn Street and Smith Lane, about a block from this intersection.

699
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:45,478
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to add my voice in support of this temporary fix.

700
00:48:45,978 --> 00:48:50,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen so many near misses here in the past 10 years I've lived in the neighborhood.

701
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,302
[SPEAKER_20]: While it certainly doesn't solve all the safety issues with this intersection,

702
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:58,444
[SPEAKER_20]: it seems like a relatively low effort and high end picked way to get started.

703
00:48:59,044 --> 00:49:03,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, there were also some people who, um, put some followup comments to their original.

704
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:06,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I don't know if you wanted to take followup comments.

705
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:13,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we just have, uh, I'm okay with followup comments as the chief is.

706
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:14,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

707
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:19,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, seems like we have iPhone, uh, three, three, nine, two, two, one, zero.

708
00:49:20,775 --> 00:49:20,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh,

709
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:29,919
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to unmute, I'll ask you to unmute and then you can, I'm not sure if you want to just state your name and if you live in the area.

710
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, my name is Linda Morelli.

711
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:38,132
[SPEAKER_22]: I live on the corner of Playstead and Rubin Street.

712
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:41,253
[SPEAKER_22]: I've lived here for 60 years.

713
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:48,695
[SPEAKER_22]: And my main concern is the aesthetics of this area and the safety.

714
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:57,778
[SPEAKER_22]: I have spoken to Todd multiple times, gave him my feelings, and I guess it wasn't addressed tonight at all.

715
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:02,280
[SPEAKER_22]: 60 years, there are not many.

716
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:05,062
[SPEAKER_22]: Alicia, are you laughing at me?

717
00:50:06,242 --> 00:50:07,023
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope not.

718
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:14,768
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw your email in the materials we were given, which is what Todd was just saying to me.

719
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:16,009
[SPEAKER_20]: I forward her email.

720
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,230
[SPEAKER_20]: But please go on.

721
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:18,290
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

722
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:25,715
[SPEAKER_22]: So as far as people saying that this is a good idea, absolutely not.

723
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:27,956
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to put barriers.

724
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,821
[SPEAKER_22]: People are gonna go through them.

725
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:34,964
[SPEAKER_22]: The same thing is happening on the top of Playstead Road.

726
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,747
[SPEAKER_22]: This is just not acceptable.

727
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:47,914
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're putting a bandage on something because of an email that someone in the city got, that is totally not acceptable.

728
00:50:48,474 --> 00:50:51,976
[SPEAKER_22]: After 60 years, I've complained multiple times.

729
00:50:52,557 --> 00:50:54,138
[SPEAKER_22]: Nothing ever gets done.

730
00:50:54,758 --> 00:50:56,119
[SPEAKER_22]: Ask for sidewalks.

731
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:03,227
[SPEAKER_22]: to be fixed, as for walkways to be fixed, they do nothing, they don't have the money.

732
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:05,889
[SPEAKER_22]: This is not acceptable.

733
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Now you're going to put yellow lines, put a bandage on it, and not bother with anything else?

734
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,798
[SPEAKER_22]: This needs to be delayed.

735
00:51:15,399 --> 00:51:18,821
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to be looked at a little bit closer.

736
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:24,386
[SPEAKER_22]: People that do not live on the corner are looking to say, oh, this is a great job.

737
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:25,486
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it isn't.

738
00:51:25,827 --> 00:51:34,914
[SPEAKER_22]: The only traffic that this is going to happen is at night when the kids come down the street with their cars.

739
00:51:34,934 --> 00:51:37,916
[SPEAKER_22]: 60 years, this cannot happen.

740
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,957
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not acceptable.

741
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:46,699
[SPEAKER_22]: You could put barriers somewhere else, but not on the corner of a place that ain't moving.

742
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,000
[SPEAKER_22]: With the traffic, they'll go right into it.

743
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:59,423
[SPEAKER_22]: You need to delay this, think a little harder, and to do it now in the summer when people are finding notices on the street.

744
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Why wasn't it announced sooner?

745
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:07,440
[SPEAKER_22]: You need to do something a little bit better.

746
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,140
[SPEAKER_22]: So please consider doing it.

747
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:13,401
[SPEAKER_22]: You should have read what I told Todd.

748
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,942
[SPEAKER_22]: And so everyone is aware.

749
00:52:17,562 --> 00:52:18,002
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

750
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:19,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, if you'd like to read it, I'm not.

751
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:27,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure of the email, but you're more than happy to read it on the... I don't have it in front of me right now, but Todd has it.

752
00:52:27,987 --> 00:52:29,808
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if he gave it to Alicia.

753
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:32,028
[SPEAKER_22]: It should have been read to the people.

754
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:35,109
[SPEAKER_22]: And you never did like a traffic study.

755
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,290
[SPEAKER_22]: How can you put lines on anything without a traffic study?

756
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:41,831
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't make sense.

757
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:51,061
[SPEAKER_22]: You need someone out there looking at the traffic, counting the numbers to say that there's a lot of traffic.

758
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:52,482
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not even acceptable.

759
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:54,243
[SPEAKER_22]: There's not hardly any traffic.

760
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:58,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Traffic is at the top of Playstead and Winthrop Street.

761
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:07,747
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have these barriers and every day or every other day, the city people come and refix the barriers.

762
00:53:08,547 --> 00:53:10,748
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't put band-aids on this anymore.

763
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:12,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

764
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure, but I believe this is the email and read it.

765
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:17,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read it.

766
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,841
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's, if it's different than you sure can correct it.

767
00:53:21,341 --> 00:53:21,621
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

768
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:23,061
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's an email, it's fine.

769
00:53:24,262 --> 00:53:31,304
[SPEAKER_08]: 205 place that road, Linda Morelli contacted a director Blake about the item, but is unable to attend the meeting.

770
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:31,824
[SPEAKER_08]: She requests.

771
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:32,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I share her comments.

772
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:39,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe she does care about improving safety and wants something to be done, particularly on place, Ted slash will burn.

773
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:40,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Not so much Osborne.

774
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:46,616
[SPEAKER_08]: She believes paint is fine slash OK, but she does not support the use of barriers or flex posts.

775
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:49,378
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't like the aesthetics of those treatments.

776
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Her preference is a physical island with curbing, etc.

777
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:55,402
[SPEAKER_08]: More like Haines Square is the example she gave.

778
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,311
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the email we have, is that correct?

779
00:53:58,872 --> 00:53:59,993
[SPEAKER_22]: It absolutely is.

780
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,975
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much for going ahead and reading that.

781
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:06,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, I'm going to say this is not an answer.

782
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:09,960
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was told, don't know if this is true.

783
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:20,808
[SPEAKER_22]: I was told today that there was a specific email sent to the mayor about this about a month ago.

784
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:24,731
[SPEAKER_22]: So sent a month ago and now it's all done.

785
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,582
[SPEAKER_22]: I tried to get the email from Alva.

786
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:30,963
[SPEAKER_22]: I called her multiple times.

787
00:54:31,043 --> 00:54:41,710
[SPEAKER_22]: She said she was gonna speak with the acting police chief and see if I could get it, because evidently the email is not confidential.

788
00:54:41,831 --> 00:54:48,855
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't know if that's right either, because if it's public knowledge about the public, then maybe I should be able to get it.

789
00:54:49,816 --> 00:54:52,157
[SPEAKER_22]: So please look into this a little more.

790
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:59,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Do not vote on this tonight and consider what is going on in this area.

791
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:01,242
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a residential area.

792
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:07,885
[SPEAKER_22]: And to put a band-aid, you're going to have more accidents by putting yellow lines on the street.

793
00:55:08,145 --> 00:55:09,125
[SPEAKER_22]: I guarantee it.

794
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:19,550
[SPEAKER_22]: I think in 60 years, I might have seen five, maybe 10 accidents, not on Rubin Street,

795
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:28,014
[SPEAKER_22]: where people come down Woburn Street and take a left on Playstead because they're going too fast.

796
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:32,837
[SPEAKER_22]: So to say that there's a lot going on there is absolutely not the truth.

797
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:34,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for listening.

798
00:55:35,378 --> 00:55:37,339
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you'll consider what I've said.

799
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you again.

800
00:55:42,665 --> 00:55:44,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Morelli, this is Chief Covino.

801
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:51,510
[SPEAKER_16]: You will be getting a response from us regarding the information request, the public information that we sent you.

802
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:57,833
[SPEAKER_16]: However, we did redact, will be redacting the name of one of the persons in the neighborhood that sent that originally.

803
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:01,815
[SPEAKER_16]: It seemed that you made a specific request for that person's name.

804
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:05,677
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not going to give information out that may cause conflict within the neighborhood.

805
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:07,824
[SPEAKER_16]: We're here at a public meeting.

806
00:56:08,024 --> 00:56:09,005
[SPEAKER_16]: It's being discussed here.

807
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:13,127
[SPEAKER_16]: There are people here that are for this issue and people that are against it, as yourself.

808
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:16,229
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds your problem as you don't like the aesthetics.

809
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:17,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with you.

810
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Not the best looking thing out there.

811
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:21,332
[SPEAKER_16]: But I disagree on the fact that it's not going to help.

812
00:56:21,873 --> 00:56:24,174
[SPEAKER_16]: There are problems in that intersection.

813
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,637
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a difficult intersection to navigate as far as coming out of Woobin Street to Placid Road.

814
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:36,084
[SPEAKER_16]: This will enable us to get the stop sign in the proper area to stop traffic before they end to place that road from urban street.

815
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:38,306
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is temporary.

816
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:40,248
[SPEAKER_16]: If it doesn't work, we'll take it away.

817
00:56:40,448 --> 00:56:41,249
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk about it.

818
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:45,233
[SPEAKER_16]: And another time a year or so from here, if it doesn't work.

819
00:56:45,813 --> 00:56:52,955
[SPEAKER_16]: If it does work, and the city can get money to make it a better looking island or something, that will happen too.

820
00:56:53,375 --> 00:57:00,536
[SPEAKER_16]: But we can't turn our head to something that's a safety issue that could become a catastrophic accident in the middle of a place that is on Woolman Street.

821
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:05,318
[SPEAKER_16]: So I apologize if you're not happy with how we're doing this, but this is how it's going to happen.

822
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:06,678
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to start this way.

823
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:32,450
[SPEAKER_16]: and maybe at some point in time the city will have money to make it um a better looking project and also in that time we may have time to adjust what's out there for barriers and things so that they work better but we need to start somewhere and unfortunately this is the way we're going to have to stop um and we will be voting on it today so i apologize if you disagree with me but um

824
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:38,839
[SPEAKER_16]: there is there is no serious safety issue here that we have to address and just turn a blind eye to that.

825
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:39,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

826
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:51,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay I'm going to go to Peter and then if anybody else has any other questions we're going to have to raise a hand.

827
00:57:51,483 --> 00:57:53,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter I'm going to ask you on your business.

828
00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:58,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hi, good afternoon, everybody.

829
00:57:58,258 --> 00:58:05,445
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Peter column, I we own the house on the corner of Osborne and Winthrop at 598 Winthrop Street.

830
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:11,009
[SPEAKER_02]: A few follow up questions to the, the questions that were just answered.

831
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:14,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does this have to happen today is my first question.

832
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:17,808
[SPEAKER_02]: because that was what you just said.

833
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to vote on this today.

834
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:24,915
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the urgency of today, July 8th, of this happening today?

835
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a few follow-up questions as well.

836
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:29,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to follow up to what you just said.

837
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't share that urgency.

838
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:36,449
[SPEAKER_16]: I said we're going to vote on it today because it's presented to us.

839
00:58:36,529 --> 00:58:37,609
[SPEAKER_16]: We may vote to table it.

840
00:58:37,669 --> 00:58:40,551
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the issue of having it immediately.

841
00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:41,192
[SPEAKER_16]: That's helpful.

842
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:42,252
[SPEAKER_16]: But let me say this.

843
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:45,234
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a temporary solution.

844
00:58:45,675 --> 00:58:48,937
[SPEAKER_16]: It gives us an idea moving forward, whether it's today or next month.

845
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:53,199
[SPEAKER_16]: So as a person who lives there, I think you want to make it a little safer.

846
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,963
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you could also help us in the future to readjust if it means changing that.

847
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:02,627
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's my I very much I'm interested in making it safer.

848
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:08,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question of how we make it safer and the conclusions we're drawing of what would make it safer.

849
00:59:08,974 --> 00:59:14,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up for discussion and hopefully we allow for time for that to happen.

850
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,222
[SPEAKER_02]: My next question is, I've been listening to the meeting.

851
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:21,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And what data are we using to make this decision today?

852
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:23,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard the term close call.

853
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:29,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So could you define a close call and how many close calls have happened in 2025 year to date?

854
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:30,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we can.

855
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:36,630
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I comment on that?

856
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,472
[SPEAKER_20]: If we wait for data, people could die, right?

857
00:59:40,552 --> 00:59:48,836
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't track, there is, you know, every resident knows that there's no way to track close calls because you don't call the police for a close call, right?

858
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:49,556
[SPEAKER_20]: That's our concern.

859
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:52,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that, that's why I'm asking this question.

860
00:59:52,738 --> 00:59:57,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's a close call is defined by citizens calling and complaining.

861
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's people that are stopped by the police.

862
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's,

863
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:03,804
[SPEAKER_02]: here's I have no idea what a close call is.

864
01:00:03,824 --> 01:00:11,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like the MPD traffic unit to define that because I would expect us to make data driven decisions.

865
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:14,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a definition for close call?

866
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:15,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that just

867
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:18,123
[SPEAKER_16]: No, there isn't a definition.

868
01:00:18,143 --> 01:00:18,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure there is.

869
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:21,125
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not document close calls.

870
01:00:22,026 --> 01:00:26,189
[SPEAKER_16]: There are people in the neighborhood that are there all the time, like yourself, that see these things.

871
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,551
[SPEAKER_16]: They're the ones that brought this to our attention.

872
01:00:29,812 --> 01:00:32,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many complaints, I guess, would be my question?

873
01:00:32,515 --> 01:00:37,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we're not documenting close calls or data, like how many complaints have we gotten year to date?

874
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Complaints about near hit, near hit?

875
01:00:41,282 --> 01:00:41,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

876
01:00:42,202 --> 01:00:43,083
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't document them.

877
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:45,285
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have that type of documentation.

878
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:53,308
[SPEAKER_16]: But when you logically go to that intersection, see where the stop sign is coming out of Woburn Street and look to your left, what do you see?

879
01:00:54,129 --> 01:01:00,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't appreciate the terms logically, because I mean, if someone disagrees with you, then that's implying that they're not logical.

880
01:01:00,598 --> 01:01:02,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, then I won't say logically.

881
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you stop.

882
01:01:04,102 --> 01:01:09,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Because logically we should fill a lot of the potholes on Playstead, but that hasn't been done, and I've called to complain about that.

883
01:01:10,006 --> 01:01:17,110
[SPEAKER_08]: You're asking us to ask a question, and we're going to try and answer it for you, but if you keep interrupting when we're trying to answer it, then we're not able to answer the full question.

884
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:20,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're going to ask us a question, we're going to try and answer it for you.

885
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:20,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we do that?

886
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:22,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

887
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:31,940
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you come out of Woburn Street to proceed down to Playstead Road, the stop sign is before Osborne, correct?

888
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:35,893
[SPEAKER_02]: according to your description, yes.

889
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:49,780
[SPEAKER_16]: When you look to your left, you still have a great distance to travel to proceed to Playstead Road, which most cases what people do is they accelerate from the stop sign after making a stop and continue.

890
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:56,204
[SPEAKER_16]: And they can't see the vehicles coming west on Playstead Road in the same direction that they're going to go.

891
01:01:56,765 --> 01:01:58,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So have there been accidents before?

892
01:01:58,726 --> 01:01:59,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure they have.

893
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,927
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have documentation of that.

894
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:06,591
[SPEAKER_16]: But does it make sense for us to look at that and say, this can be done better?

895
01:02:07,694 --> 01:02:15,641
[SPEAKER_16]: We can move this stop sign up and we can also slow down the people turning from Woolman Street onto Osborne at the same time.

896
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:20,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think just, I just want to make sure you're done.

897
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not jumping.

898
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:26,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that no one's questioning, like making things safer.

899
01:02:26,975 --> 01:02:32,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question right now that we have is, you know, what is going to make people safer?

900
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:35,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think moving the stop sign makes a lot of sense.

901
01:02:35,841 --> 01:02:37,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think cutting off access.

902
01:02:39,003 --> 01:02:40,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people will get confused.

903
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:42,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we live on this road.

904
01:02:42,245 --> 01:02:43,206
[SPEAKER_02]: We walk our dog.

905
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:45,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I go running on this road like I have never seen.

906
01:02:47,536 --> 01:02:54,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen this before, and I'm totally open to listening, but then to not see any data, not see number of complaints.

907
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure that the town tracks major accidents.

908
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:00,388
[SPEAKER_02]: We have accidents, sure.

909
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:01,669
[SPEAKER_02]: We track all our accidents.

910
01:03:02,229 --> 01:03:05,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many accidents have happened in that area this year?

911
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:06,313
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to find.

912
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:07,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it available online?

913
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:10,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can Google it while other people are asking questions.

914
01:03:11,363 --> 01:03:20,952
[SPEAKER_16]: It may be through the insurance, the state insurance agency that they document all the crashes in different locations throughout the state.

915
01:03:21,472 --> 01:03:25,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wouldn't it be logical to look at that data when making this decision?

916
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:27,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just where I'm kind of, I don't question that.

917
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:32,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's just as logical to be able to stand there and look at what potentially can happen.

918
01:03:33,635 --> 01:03:35,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Those things we can't measure is what we prevent.

919
01:03:36,296 --> 01:03:49,582
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know that if a person drives down that street, stops at that stop sign, and accelerates out, and crashes to someone else who's already going 25 to 30 miles an hour and placed that road, there's going to be a serious accident.

920
01:03:50,222 --> 01:03:54,044
[SPEAKER_16]: And all we're saying is, let's try this.

921
01:03:54,084 --> 01:04:01,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it doesn't look all that great, but let's try it and see if it slows that traffic down from the potential accidents out there.

922
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:03,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're saying.

923
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And how did this question come to consideration?

924
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it sounds like there's a lot of stakeholders were kind of like dancing around.

925
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:12,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the police?

926
01:04:12,774 --> 01:04:13,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it someone on?

927
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it enough people voted?

928
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it like how did this come up for discussion?

929
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:25,140
[SPEAKER_16]: It was brought into the traffic commission, I believe, by residents and residents or a couple of residents in the area.

930
01:04:26,747 --> 01:04:30,830
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Mr. Blake can explain how he got involved.

931
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that information.

932
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, did one resident bring this up and then you guys just decided to move forward?

933
01:04:37,914 --> 01:04:39,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Like again, it doesn't.

934
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:41,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I interject something?

935
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:45,699
[SPEAKER_20]: So the chief is an interim chief.

936
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:48,801
[SPEAKER_20]: And so this is the second traffic commission that he's been at.

937
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:52,964
[SPEAKER_20]: So he may not have the information that for many,

938
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:58,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good for us.

939
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:04,434
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we have both a list that we work down, a complete streets list, and we respond to resident concerns.

940
01:05:04,554 --> 01:05:13,155
[SPEAKER_20]: And residents contact the city, and we investigate whether those concerns are actually concerns that we can do anything about.

941
01:05:13,815 --> 01:05:17,456
[SPEAKER_20]: I would never say that whether or not they're legitimate, because all concerns are legitimate.

942
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:19,417
[SPEAKER_20]: But is this something we can do about?

943
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:21,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have the funding to do something about this?

944
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:25,960
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we move and I'm afraid that I lost my Internet completely in the middle of that.

945
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:29,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Because everybody froze, we can hear you back now.

946
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:30,144
[SPEAKER_20]: We can hear you.

947
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:32,826
[SPEAKER_04]: You can yeah, you did pretty good.

948
01:05:32,886 --> 01:05:38,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You cut out small for a moment, but.

949
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:42,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Get to Mary.

950
01:05:43,995 --> 01:05:47,839
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think Alicia just said a statement about how.

951
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:55,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she was talking about the complete streets list and how it looks like she might be back.

952
01:05:55,931 --> 01:05:59,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I switched the internet to my phone because it was too unstable.

953
01:06:00,433 --> 01:06:06,076
[SPEAKER_20]: But right, it's just that we investigate all the complaints and the concerns we get from residents.

954
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:09,478
[SPEAKER_20]: And sometimes it's one resident and sometimes it's 50.

955
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:18,543
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm unclear, as a person who cares about improving the safety of the city, why it matters whether we've heard from one resident

956
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:21,068
[SPEAKER_20]: or 50 residents on something.

957
01:06:21,388 --> 01:06:24,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Like that doesn't make the situation less.

958
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's trade-offs and there have been complaints that haven't been responded to for other traffic issues in the city.

959
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just doesn't make sense to me.

960
01:06:35,093 --> 01:06:40,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm surprised that there's such aggravation with asking about the process.

961
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:45,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just asking about, so you've confirmed that one person can make a complaint

962
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:49,078
[SPEAKER_02]: a separate person can then go validate it and then we vote on it.

963
01:06:49,198 --> 01:06:55,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am surprised if the data is not here, why isn't that data available at the hearing where we're talking about voting?

964
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,559
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, it baffles me.

965
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate your answers on how we got here.

966
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:14,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just surprising to me that we wouldn't want to have all this information as we make trade-offs for how to spend our time and what to talk about, because there's plenty of other areas and concerns in the city that aren't being responded to.

967
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:18,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna check here.

968
01:07:18,931 --> 01:07:20,779
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have valid- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

969
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have valid concerns and questions, but in the interest of time, there's other people, so we're just- Yeah, I'm all done.

970
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:31,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm responding to people directly speaking to me, so I'm all set.

971
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for answering.

972
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:47,037
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I haven't heard is what would you like to see there versus all the things, apparently, with the process you're concerned about, which is fine, but what would- to get straight to the point, to try to cut through the red tape, right, what would you like to see there?

973
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

974
01:07:48,418 --> 01:07:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I think moving the stop sign makes sense.

975
01:07:50,940 --> 01:08:04,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that cutting off and restricting, I think it's going to cause mass confusion because we see people that commute every single day that are reliant and use that as a way to get to Winthrop, especially with all the traffic around the high school.

976
01:08:04,912 --> 01:08:11,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that in a quick, hasty change, we will have more accidents of people who are confused.

977
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:26,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think as a follow up, it will be a huge eyesore, but that's my secondary concern because I haven't heard a timeline to transition if this does work, what it will look like other than probably just orange barriers that we're gonna put up and just call it a day.

978
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:33,248
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not shutting the street down, correct?

979
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two entry points and from my understanding, one entry point is going to be closed off and it's going to create a sharper turn for people coming off of, I believe it's whichever the right turn is onto Osborne.

980
01:08:48,573 --> 01:09:04,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharper turns in the entire traffic industry, nationwide, worldwide, sharper turns are actually what we prefer these days versus wide open turns like Winthrop's Place did, because they encourage slower speeds, the sharper, the more 90 degree turn there is.

981
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:08,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are consistently complaints about speeding in this area.

982
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:10,122
[SPEAKER_05]: over and over again.

983
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:14,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are elements at both ends of these blocks that we're attempting to improve stuff.

984
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:19,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanna say something about the study and it gets back to resources.

985
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:24,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So the process, this traffic commission exists since the 60s.

986
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:27,669
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Medford's process to discuss these types of issues.

987
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:36,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, we've had complaints in the past where you could spend the time and money to hire some consultants, study it,

988
01:09:37,233 --> 01:09:45,235
[SPEAKER_05]: when you also have professionals like on the police, DPW, and myself that could cut through all that and get quicker, cheaper, to the point.

989
01:09:45,675 --> 01:09:52,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So this, yes, there are different ways of going about doing this, but we've been criticized in the past for doing those things.

990
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:54,137
[SPEAKER_05]: We have years of experience.

991
01:09:54,177 --> 01:09:57,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We could look at a situation and assess it and make some options.

992
01:09:57,457 --> 01:09:58,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right that there are always trade-offs.

993
01:09:59,398 --> 01:09:59,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, any

994
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:21,206
[SPEAKER_05]: any proposed solution is going to have trade-offs and you try to weigh those things and we all have experience in the industry and in the city that help us cut quicker to the point instead of making people wait and yeah it's not my proposal so it's i'm not proposing to bring in consultants i'm asking for just basic data how many accidents have we had

995
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: How many complaints have we had?

996
01:10:26,668 --> 01:10:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: How many speeding tickets have been given?

997
01:10:29,869 --> 01:10:34,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how does that two collisions compare to the other dangerous intersections in Medford?

998
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:37,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe we rank it based on where the most accidents are happening.

999
01:10:38,412 --> 01:11:02,080
[SPEAKER_05]: so the 2016 prioritization plan did just essentially what you're saying without crashing it was a public meeting process to rank intersections throughout the city that was that was super helpful thank you for sharing what was the ranking of this intersection but this in section was unranked they only ranked the top 20 officially this one was scored i think number 29 and just this is what i'm

1000
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:08,125
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to explain to folks that Medford has resource issues, just like any other city or town, right?

1001
01:11:08,566 --> 01:11:12,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So Haines Square was one of the intersections on this top 20 list.

1002
01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:13,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like number three or four.

1003
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:15,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Tufts Square was like number three or four.

1004
01:11:16,052 --> 01:11:19,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So those were top five in the city at that time for that particular list.

1005
01:11:20,316 --> 01:11:27,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And no list is going to be perfect, but that was basically created from both of those projects upwards of a million dollars.

1006
01:11:27,803 --> 01:11:43,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm trying to explain to you and communicate, hopefully it's coming across, instead of waiting one project every five, 10 years, we're trying to address hundreds of projects every year to help improve things faster and not wait for the perfect solution.

1007
01:11:43,977 --> 01:11:45,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully that gets across to folks.

1008
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:51,884
[SPEAKER_05]: We would love to do as much as we can for every street, every intersection we can, but unfortunately that's not the reality.

1009
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:53,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are quick build,

1010
01:11:53,926 --> 01:12:00,427
[SPEAKER_05]: industry accepted standards to do quick-build type treatments, and then you call it pilot to permanence.

1011
01:12:00,467 --> 01:12:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: You could try out something, and then if it works, that could lead to a $500,000 million project later.

1012
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:08,889
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not just Medford doing these things.

1013
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:14,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It's every city or town in the Commonwealth, every major metropolitan city in the country and in the world.

1014
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, I don't really understand the, yeah,

1015
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so I would suggest to get through, you know, get to the point, get to, you know, hear what people actually want to see in terms of improvements there.

1016
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:44,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we could get to the crux of, you know, that's why this meeting exists, so that all the members that vote could hear all the sides of the story and make informed decision about what they would like to do, whether it's table approvals or something else.

1017
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:45,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that helps.

1018
01:12:45,297 --> 01:12:45,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1019
01:12:45,618 --> 01:12:46,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.

1020
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:47,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for answering my question.

1021
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:48,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to move on.

1022
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend moving the stop sign.

1023
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:54,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not recommend closing off that one entryway to the intersection.

1024
01:12:54,143 --> 01:12:57,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it makes a ton of sense to do that.

1025
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:03,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, like I hear the ranking, I would like to see where can I find that list?

1026
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm assuming nobody has it ready today to share.

1027
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:23,898
[SPEAKER_05]: we could provide that, that list that we're referring to is the list at one moment in time, and it was created to be able to be eligible for a particular funding source that we've used very successfully since then.

1028
01:13:25,259 --> 01:13:31,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not the only list, and it's not, I would say, not a list of all the issues that people have throughout the city.

1029
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:37,189
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one list that has been used for that particular funding source, and we have,

1030
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:42,351
[SPEAKER_05]: completed many of the things on that list, but we're still working through it in this many other lists.

1031
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:46,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 730 plus streets and 1600 plus intersections in the city.

1032
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:55,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to work through them as fast and as efficiently and as safely and, you know, try to actually improve things for the residents, believe it or not.

1033
01:13:56,335 --> 01:13:58,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And how could I get that list as a follow up?

1034
01:13:58,296 --> 01:14:00,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm just trying to follow the process.

1035
01:14:00,296 --> 01:14:01,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So who will provide it?

1036
01:14:01,697 --> 01:14:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Or who should I ask?

1037
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:13,354
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably follow up with engineering, right?

1038
01:14:16,775 --> 01:14:18,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult because I'm not at my computer.

1039
01:14:18,676 --> 01:14:21,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I could add stuff to the chat.

1040
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer.

1041
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:27,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter, you can call the engineering division of the DPW and request a copy.

1042
01:14:28,138 --> 01:14:33,519
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk will help you, whether it's getting it to the proper website or sending it to you via email.

1043
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:35,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1044
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:38,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long would the pilot period be that you just mentioned?

1045
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:41,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if the change does proceed, like how long?

1046
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:45,219
[SPEAKER_02]: How long will the barriers be up and all of that?

1047
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:47,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we get to decide here.

1048
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry if I'm stepping in on behalf of the commission here, because we could set it here.

1049
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So this addresses another comment that you made.

1050
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:59,169
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't the vote for the permanent project by any means.

1051
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:00,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a pilot.

1052
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:07,755
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that, as Todd mentioned, is part of the process here in Medford with the Traffic Commission and how we make traffic rules and change the regulations.

1053
01:15:08,456 --> 01:15:10,277
[SPEAKER_04]: The standard of care doesn't really involve data.

1054
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:11,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a poor design.

1055
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:18,415
[SPEAKER_04]: of an intersection with the public officials that have spoken today all believe that there are safety issues that are inherent in the design.

1056
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's been on that list.

1057
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:23,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's been on the city's radar for decades at this point.

1058
01:15:25,902 --> 01:15:28,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that said, we can set a pilot period tonight.

1059
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:29,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be in the motion.

1060
01:15:29,665 --> 01:15:35,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was thinking, and this is to my other commissioners, we look at it for a year, something along those lines.

1061
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:39,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different materials that I brought up earlier, so a lot of people don't like the water filled barriers.

1062
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:46,193
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have nicer looking materials that we kind of have to wait to install until after the barriers and what else?

1063
01:15:47,194 --> 01:15:52,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and there will be a vote on whatever permanent project there is all these complete street intersections that we work through.

1064
01:15:52,075 --> 01:15:57,957
[SPEAKER_04]: They all get a traffic commission vote because we are changing geometry and traffic regulations at the same time.

1065
01:15:57,977 --> 01:16:00,418
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not a motion folks.

1066
01:16:00,438 --> 01:16:03,019
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just me responding to Peter to give him information.

1067
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1068
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all set for now.

1069
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:08,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

1070
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a problem.

1071
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,881
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always call DPW if you've got more questions.

1072
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:18,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary, it looks like you have your hand up.

1073
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:19,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to ask you to unmute.

1074
01:16:23,786 --> 01:16:25,607
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I have two questions.

1075
01:16:25,907 --> 01:16:32,409
[SPEAKER_23]: One of them is, most of the, I've lived here since 1968, right on Osborne Road, and I'm in the middle.

1076
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:33,810
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not at either end.

1077
01:16:34,253 --> 01:16:41,075
[SPEAKER_23]: But I was here and we went before the commission at the high school in the little theater to make it a one-way.

1078
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:51,138
[SPEAKER_23]: And the reason we didn't do it from the top coming down is because five cars were totaled, trying to cut short going from Winthrop Street right onto Osborne Road.

1079
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,779
[SPEAKER_23]: And then that was the best way to do it.

1080
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:54,900
[SPEAKER_23]: That's number one.

1081
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,540
[SPEAKER_23]: But number two was here.

1082
01:16:57,501 --> 01:17:01,782
[SPEAKER_23]: Many of these almost-missed or close calls

1083
01:17:02,248 --> 01:17:06,312
[SPEAKER_23]: whatever we want to call it, and we're all here to make sure that everyone is safe.

1084
01:17:07,533 --> 01:17:12,419
[SPEAKER_23]: Come from the people that go right through that stop sign on moving street.

1085
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:13,480
[SPEAKER_23]: They blow right through it.

1086
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,241
[SPEAKER_23]: I see it every day.

1087
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:18,305
[SPEAKER_23]: I walk my dog when I was walking with my husband.

1088
01:17:19,258 --> 01:17:28,223
[SPEAKER_23]: They blow right through that, and then they come out towards Playstead Road, and as the Playstead people are coming up, they don't stop at that sign way back there.

1089
01:17:28,904 --> 01:17:31,405
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what's gonna stop them from stopping.

1090
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:34,947
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know that it's gonna stop them if we're moving it 15 feet up.

1091
01:17:35,828 --> 01:17:44,953
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's gonna be a rolling stop sign just 15 feet further up, and they're gonna try to roll right onto Playstead Road, which is what many of them do.

1092
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,461
[SPEAKER_23]: The ones that really do almost stop are the ones that are taking the turn onto Osborne because it is a sharper turn.

1093
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:53,681
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's just my opinion.

1094
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:55,162
[SPEAKER_23]: I do have a question.

1095
01:17:55,582 --> 01:18:01,403
[SPEAKER_23]: In the winter, we have those Jersey barriers up or whatever kind of call it, what we want to call those barriers.

1096
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:07,644
[SPEAKER_23]: Is the snow, when they plow the snow coming down, is the snow going to pile up there?

1097
01:18:07,664 --> 01:18:14,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Are they going to move the Jersey barriers, plow all the way down, put the Jersey barriers back there?

1098
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:24,017
[SPEAKER_23]: if that's going to cause a visual problem with people walking or people driving if the stop sign is there on the right.

1099
01:18:24,798 --> 01:18:25,399
[SPEAKER_23]: See what I'm saying?

1100
01:18:29,363 --> 01:18:29,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Anybody?

1101
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:38,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim, you wanna, I believe there's a- Sure, I can take that one, Jordan, you don't wanna take the plowing question?

1102
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:39,593
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm good with that.

1103
01:18:41,694 --> 01:18:44,036
[SPEAKER_04]: We adapt to these scenarios.

1104
01:18:44,316 --> 01:18:49,239
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times, if they're movable, we may move them out of the way if they're in the way of plowing.

1105
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that big of a deal.

1106
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:58,085
[SPEAKER_04]: When it gets to the level of bolted down bollards, we try to keep them and avoid them.

1107
01:18:58,105 --> 01:19:03,489
[SPEAKER_04]: We try not to build snow piles that will block sight lines at stop signs.

1108
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:05,010
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're doing that, we're doing something wrong anyway.

1109
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:13,334
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure that pedestrian ramps are clear at crossings and bus stops, that's a problem too.

1110
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:20,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you see any of that, as usual, just give us a call during the storm or after the storm and we try to respond to those things immediately.

1111
01:19:30,638 --> 01:19:31,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary, you got it again.

1112
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:32,739
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I do.

1113
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:34,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much for it.

1114
01:19:34,339 --> 01:19:36,660
[SPEAKER_23]: Just as a reminder, when you're talking about that,

1115
01:19:37,451 --> 01:19:50,455
[SPEAKER_23]: Those people that live on Woobin Street, they all end up parking on Osborne Road because they can't park on Woobin Street and they don't have enough driveway space to facilitate for their own cars.

1116
01:19:50,695 --> 01:19:56,857
[SPEAKER_23]: So you're going to have all those added ones on that one area of Osborne Road because it's

1117
01:19:57,343 --> 01:20:00,024
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, odd and even years.

1118
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:12,008
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's just another, I mean, these are just things that, having lived there since 1968, these are things that we have to look at, and I wanna just make sure that you're aware of them.

1119
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:15,449
[SPEAKER_23]: Woburn Street, it's a bad situation.

1120
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:18,130
[SPEAKER_23]: Woburn and Places, it's a bad situation.

1121
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:27,053
[SPEAKER_23]: But moving it up 15 feet, I'm not sure is going to make them stop any more than keeping it back where it was.

1122
01:20:27,846 --> 01:20:29,948
[SPEAKER_23]: on moving straight.

1123
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:31,530
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not stopping.

1124
01:20:32,511 --> 01:20:33,732
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not stopping, it's a fact.

1125
01:20:35,274 --> 01:20:40,859
[SPEAKER_23]: So those are the near misses that you're hearing about and people are complaining about.

1126
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,282
[SPEAKER_23]: That happens all the time.

1127
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like there's a lot of other people on the call.

1128
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:58,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if they're here for Pearl Street or this, but maybe we should at least get to everyone at least once maybe if there's others.

1129
01:20:58,888 --> 01:20:59,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1130
01:20:59,228 --> 01:21:07,630
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's anybody else that has a comment or concern about Osborne, please raise your hand or comments.

1131
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:12,692
[SPEAKER_08]: We've left the, everybody that's raised their hand, I think we've gotten to.

1132
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:16,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm assuming that everybody else that's still here is for,

1133
01:21:18,178 --> 01:21:31,881
[SPEAKER_08]: that's the only other item we have, but if you do have comments or concerns with this street and you'd like to speak about it, please either raise your hand or add into the chat that you'd like to speak.

1134
01:21:31,901 --> 01:21:45,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, seeing none, pass it back to the commissioners and I know there's a lot of, you know,

1135
01:21:49,327 --> 01:22:02,734
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm frankly surprised that there are residents who are against something that will make things that would try to get cars to slow down and to make things safer for cars, pedestrians and bicyclists.

1136
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:07,822
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that these kinds of things are very important.

1137
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:23,595
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be lovely if we could have some way of doing pretty barrels and stuff like that, rather than the barriers that people don't like the looks of.

1138
01:22:25,056 --> 01:22:29,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I think that something like this could really help that situation a lot.

1139
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:30,740
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks pretty dangerous.

1140
01:22:33,207 --> 01:22:37,328
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm surprised that we're not being encouraged to just approve this at this time.

1141
01:22:37,348 --> 01:22:41,489
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so I, I'm not really sure what to do with that.

1142
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:44,649
[SPEAKER_20]: And I did just notice that there was one person who said, hi, I'm Janice.

1143
01:22:44,689 --> 01:22:45,650
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to speak.

1144
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:50,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Alicia, if you're all set up, I'll go to Janice and ask you to unmute.

1145
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:55,111
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

1146
01:22:55,131 --> 01:22:56,172
[SPEAKER_23]: Can anybody hear me?

1147
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:57,252
[SPEAKER_08]: We can.

1148
01:22:57,592 --> 01:22:57,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1149
01:23:02,413 --> 01:23:03,133
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost you now.

1150
01:23:03,153 --> 01:23:04,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear us?

1151
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:13,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Janice, we're just going to ask you to unmute again.

1152
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,217
[SPEAKER_08]: We were not able to hear you.

1153
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:28,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like you're having issues with your audio, so if you want to type it into the messages and one of us can read it, that's fine.

1154
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:32,725
[SPEAKER_08]: just not be able to do it at this time.

1155
01:23:34,046 --> 01:23:41,531
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to type your message or your comment or concern into the messages, we can read it for the forum here on record.

1156
01:24:06,517 --> 01:24:10,758
[SPEAKER_08]: She's probably typing, so she probably have it.

1157
01:24:11,058 --> 01:24:13,179
[SPEAKER_08]: She lives in the corner place that in Osborne, so.

1158
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,781
[SPEAKER_08]: This point, I assume she's trying to type any other.

1159
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Comments on it and come back to Janice.

1160
01:24:48,727 --> 01:25:01,069
[SPEAKER_08]: If no one else would like to make a comment on this, or are having issues raising your hand, you can make a comment here on the messages.

1161
01:25:02,309 --> 01:25:08,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Click on your, I'm asking you to unmute so you can get on record here.

1162
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:18,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, pass it back to the commissioners.

1163
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:21,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And if Janice is able to put a message in there, I'll be sure.

1164
01:25:21,755 --> 01:25:29,987
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's any other comments or concerns on this, or if there was something set forth that the commissioners wanted to.

1165
01:25:30,718 --> 01:25:34,301
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I would just like to say that there needs to be a review.

1166
01:25:34,381 --> 01:25:44,328
[SPEAKER_24]: If this is passed this evening, a review within a year to look at the data that has occurred, to look at the aesthetics, to see exactly how this needs to be put into place.

1167
01:25:44,388 --> 01:25:48,311
[SPEAKER_24]: This is something that has been an ongoing process from what I understand.

1168
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:52,314
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's really important to affect some sort of change.

1169
01:25:53,034 --> 01:26:02,758
[SPEAKER_24]: And this might be the way to do this in a way that allows you again to collect data to see how it works and ultimately passes.

1170
01:26:03,179 --> 01:26:11,182
[SPEAKER_24]: So I will say that my perspective is with the caveat of a review in a year, that's something that's powerful.

1171
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:12,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1172
01:26:12,463 --> 01:26:21,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And to kind of piggyback off what Jim, uh, Commissioner Silva had said is it's, it's helpful that, that we hear feedback from the residents.

1173
01:26:22,322 --> 01:26:24,583
[SPEAKER_08]: along with the data that we collect.

1174
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:45,276
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're not getting feedback, whether it's a crosswalk issue or a crosswalk violation, or if a bicyclist had an issue, or if there was somebody's truck, all the data for us is sometimes we don't receive a collision or somebody doesn't call on a hit and run or something like that.

1175
01:26:46,057 --> 01:26:51,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there's an issue or something like that and the residents can bring it to our attention,

1176
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:57,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more than happy to put my email in the chat and somebody can email myself or Sergeant Rogers.

1177
01:26:57,351 --> 01:27:08,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're more than happy to keep a running log here for any issues that we come across along with, we have see click fix and the speeding on place that road.

1178
01:27:11,021 --> 01:27:15,745
[SPEAKER_08]: We isn't probably one of the number one streets that we receive speeding complaints for.

1179
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:22,577
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had our traffic unit and or field training officers out there and.

1180
01:27:23,779 --> 01:27:24,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Dealing with the, the.

1181
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:37,007
[SPEAKER_24]: This meeting, but if I could add something to this, there is a state of Massachusetts maintains the intersection accident list as well.

1182
01:27:37,907 --> 01:27:40,087
[SPEAKER_24]: If I Google it, I'm sure I can find it.

1183
01:27:40,227 --> 01:27:44,368
[SPEAKER_24]: And there is statistics from the last probably 15 years available.

1184
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:54,190
[SPEAKER_24]: So, if you look specifically in this corner, oftentimes that information is captured and it is available through the state government and Southern Transportation Department.

1185
01:27:54,790 --> 01:28:02,756
[SPEAKER_24]: but I will be happy to provide that information if somebody, I put my email in the chat and I'll be able to send it to you.

1186
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:04,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1187
01:28:04,997 --> 01:28:06,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did a quick search.

1188
01:28:06,358 --> 01:28:09,680
[SPEAKER_08]: We had two collisions here going back to 2021.

1189
01:28:10,721 --> 01:28:22,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not able to look up the date, but I know that I personally responded to a bicyclist collision here.

1190
01:28:23,772 --> 01:28:25,433
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'm not exactly sure on the date.

1191
01:28:26,013 --> 01:28:32,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it was in the past two years, but I can find that if I had some more time to kind of get the report.

1192
01:28:34,617 --> 01:28:44,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a great discussion about data, but this particular situation, and a lot of situations, this is one of those worlds of engineering that's a lot of art.

1193
01:28:45,442 --> 01:28:49,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was mentioning before, the standard of care doesn't really involve data here.

1194
01:28:49,383 --> 01:28:52,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be nice though, just because of the design of the intersection, and I think

1195
01:28:53,105 --> 01:29:05,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you look at these older intersections that are basically horse paths that were turned into roads and these large swaths of pavement, it's pretty objective in the engineering community that that's a problematic intersection.

1196
01:29:05,194 --> 01:29:05,835
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to fix it.

1197
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:07,356
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the 1st thing.

1198
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:11,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do love data and we should have a plan for a pilot and how we measure it.

1199
01:29:11,099 --> 01:29:11,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all great.

1200
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to piggyback on that point even more.

1201
01:29:15,502 --> 01:29:18,645
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this idea in traffic management, Todd can talk more about it.

1202
01:29:19,065 --> 01:29:24,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just about data and the rigidness of the regulations, but it's also about how people feel.

1203
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:29,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when people feel safe, they don't do unexpected things out on the road, which reduces conflict.

1204
01:29:30,415 --> 01:29:34,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes traffic engineers do things just because it feels safer.

1205
01:29:35,058 --> 01:29:39,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is elements of that in this project as well, for sure.

1206
01:29:39,703 --> 01:29:42,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to put that out there because I know there's a big need for data.

1207
01:29:43,409 --> 01:29:44,490
[SPEAKER_04]: People love talking about data.

1208
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:45,752
[SPEAKER_04]: They want data driven results.

1209
01:29:46,353 --> 01:29:48,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes in this world, it's not about the data.

1210
01:29:48,417 --> 01:29:52,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just about that's a terrible design from way long time ago and we need to fix it.

1211
01:29:52,964 --> 01:29:53,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1212
01:29:56,935 --> 01:30:06,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in favor of this, by the way, and I would vote in favor of this tonight as an interim with a 1 year check in period that any data that we collected would be great.

1213
01:30:07,219 --> 01:30:13,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And any feedback from public officials such as Todd MPD.

1214
01:30:15,321 --> 01:30:15,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else.

1215
01:30:15,762 --> 01:30:18,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1216
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:21,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a motion?

1217
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,144
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody else doesn't have any comments?

1218
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:24,665
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just my opinion as a commissioner.

1219
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,928
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know that not all commissioners have spoken on it, so.

1220
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:37,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, thank you for those comments, because I can think of so many examples in Medford and elsewhere in the Boston region that fit into what you described.

1221
01:30:37,995 --> 01:30:48,543
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, the Dayford School project for the Robert School across Felsway West, and there's not necessarily data showing pedestrians who get hit on Felsway West because they're too scared to cross the street.

1222
01:30:49,243 --> 01:31:00,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're working with the state to improve those crossings, make them safer so that people feel encouraged and safe to do so and encourage more people to walk versus drive to and from school.

1223
01:31:01,009 --> 01:31:08,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's many instances where the data won't necessarily support what people want or what we know is the right thing to do.

1224
01:31:09,194 --> 01:31:11,014
[SPEAKER_05]: But we aren't opposed to data.

1225
01:31:11,275 --> 01:31:13,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It just may not bear out the way people think it does.

1226
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:21,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1227
01:31:24,016 --> 01:31:37,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure if there's, or I'll pass it back to the public if there's no other comments or concerns that somebody would like to voice, push it back to the commissioners to table or make a motion.

1228
01:31:44,424 --> 01:31:48,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather someone else motion this just because Todd's in the DPW.

1229
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,623
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll motion to approve it with a one-year review period.

1230
01:31:56,064 --> 01:31:56,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second it.

1231
01:31:58,826 --> 01:32:01,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, Alba.

1232
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:03,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, Commissioner McGibbon?

1233
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:04,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1234
01:32:05,511 --> 01:32:06,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Hunt?

1235
01:32:06,752 --> 01:32:07,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1236
01:32:07,632 --> 01:32:08,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Silva?

1237
01:32:09,073 --> 01:32:09,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1238
01:32:10,354 --> 01:32:11,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Covino?

1239
01:32:11,575 --> 01:32:11,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1240
01:32:12,816 --> 01:32:13,516
[SPEAKER_11]: One absent.

1241
01:32:14,277 --> 01:32:16,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Forming the affirmative, one absent, the voting passes.

1242
01:32:17,984 --> 01:32:20,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you everybody for your comments and concern on that.

1243
01:32:20,946 --> 01:32:22,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1244
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:27,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the table item was Pearl Street and I'm just going to look here.

1245
01:32:41,068 --> 01:32:42,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not doing that.

1246
01:32:42,829 --> 01:32:46,892
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also, I just want to say, I also want to take a different tabled item off.

1247
01:32:47,012 --> 01:32:51,995
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like the commission to discuss the commercial parking policy.

1248
01:32:52,215 --> 01:33:04,863
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just to caveat that not with the intention of voting tonight, but if we could review the proposal with the idea that maybe then we could advertise the proposal with the thought of voting on it at a future meeting.

1249
01:33:05,244 --> 01:33:09,666
[SPEAKER_20]: But I thought we could at least have a preliminary conversation on it.

1250
01:33:12,914 --> 01:33:25,945
[SPEAKER_08]: On the commercial one, I'd like to add with that, kind of with Sarah speaking on the $40 violation to kind of go in with that, be moved to 72 hours, but sure.

1251
01:33:29,088 --> 01:33:33,412
[SPEAKER_20]: I think Pearl Street, since the other- Obviously, I'll move to take Pearl Street off the table.

1252
01:33:36,887 --> 01:33:38,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what the number is.

1253
01:33:38,548 --> 01:33:39,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you see it?

1254
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:39,829
[SPEAKER_09]: It is 2025.55.

1255
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:40,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1256
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:44,591
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. Harmon, it moves to 2025.55 out of the table of business.

1257
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:48,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And seconded by Jim.

1258
01:33:48,053 --> 01:33:50,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second that.

1259
01:34:04,242 --> 01:34:04,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1260
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:04,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1261
01:34:04,763 --> 01:34:04,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1262
01:34:05,063 --> 01:34:05,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1263
01:34:05,383 --> 01:34:05,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1264
01:34:05,563 --> 01:34:05,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1265
01:34:05,904 --> 01:34:06,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1266
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:06,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1267
01:34:06,264 --> 01:34:06,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1268
01:34:06,484 --> 01:34:06,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1269
01:34:06,765 --> 01:34:06,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1270
01:34:06,905 --> 01:34:07,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1271
01:34:07,185 --> 01:34:07,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1272
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:49,207
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, Todd is just going to see if he has internet back at his computer to be able to share the Pearl Street.

1273
01:34:49,487 --> 01:34:57,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I have what he, he sent stuff to Alva who scanned it in and I have it in black and white on my computer I can share.

1274
01:34:57,391 --> 01:34:59,672
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have his originals.

1275
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,601
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could just start off, I have been watching Pearl Street.

1276
01:35:10,842 --> 01:35:20,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been down there, I have tagged, I have talked to the neighbors, and it's been a sharp decrease in parking on the sidewalk since we have been enforcing.

1277
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:24,213
[SPEAKER_09]: About blocking traffic, are they blocking traffic?

1278
01:35:24,573 --> 01:35:26,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they parking on the opposite side?

1279
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:29,036
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not that I've come upon.

1280
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:35,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should wait for Todd's demonstration.

1281
01:35:37,568 --> 01:35:38,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Look like you're ready, Todd.

1282
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:44,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I get to get you to co-host again?

1283
01:35:44,853 --> 01:35:45,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

1284
01:35:46,014 --> 01:35:47,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Should be all set, Todd.

1285
01:35:49,737 --> 01:35:50,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

1286
01:35:50,698 --> 01:35:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I seem to be connected now in my office again.

1287
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:53,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for that.

1288
01:35:59,644 --> 01:36:02,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So this graphic, can you all see that?

1289
01:36:02,686 --> 01:36:03,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of shows parking.

1290
01:36:03,927 --> 01:36:05,328
[SPEAKER_08]: You might need to scroll in a little bit, Todd.

1291
01:36:05,348 --> 01:36:07,230
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little bit small if you can.

1292
01:36:08,475 --> 01:36:12,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for some reason, I'm still having computer issues.

1293
01:36:12,177 --> 01:36:13,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not allowing me to do that.

1294
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm lucky I have this work.

1295
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:17,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry for that.

1296
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:23,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked into the north side versus the south side, if we chose which side would result in more parking.

1297
01:36:24,063 --> 01:36:28,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looked to me, minusing the corners and the hydrants, that it's about equal.

1298
01:36:28,746 --> 01:36:33,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we fit about 24 cars on all the north side or all the south side.

1299
01:36:34,429 --> 01:36:42,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I looked at alternating, which again, it's meant to maximize parking, but also vary which side of the street.

1300
01:36:42,631 --> 01:36:45,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it has a traffic calming effect to alternate.

1301
01:36:46,872 --> 01:36:52,713
[SPEAKER_05]: The traveling would have to weave through the cars and it may simulate what's actually happening there today anyways.

1302
01:36:52,993 --> 01:36:57,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So by alternating, it looks like we're able to have 26 parking spaces.

1303
01:36:57,974 --> 01:36:59,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think alternating

1304
01:37:00,335 --> 01:37:13,106
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of parking, maximization of parking spaces does yield the most, 26 versus 24, so two as compared to just north or just south.

1305
01:37:13,806 --> 01:37:15,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know it's difficult to see.

1306
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:16,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for that.

1307
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:26,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So if parking start on the north side as you come off College Avenue and then switches to the south side, then back to the north side, then back to the south side,

1308
01:37:28,258 --> 01:37:30,580
[SPEAKER_05]: it would yield two extra spaces.

1309
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:41,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I have another graphic, but I'm not sure I can get that up.

1310
01:37:49,391 --> 01:37:54,735
[SPEAKER_05]: This just, it's not allowing me to increase for some reason.

1311
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, I could share this.

1312
01:37:57,963 --> 01:38:06,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It just alternates parking, and there would potentially be just an edge line of paint guiding the traveling public around the parked cars.

1313
01:38:06,466 --> 01:38:09,327
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an option to have the paint or not.

1314
01:38:09,427 --> 01:38:19,090
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's helpful because it may help prevent, if the parking does alternate, it will help a vehicle from potentially rear-ending the first in the string of cars.

1315
01:38:21,865 --> 01:38:25,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we had looked at since the last meeting to try it and it seems like

1316
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:31,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, it seems like this would basically replicate what may be happening today.

1317
01:38:31,347 --> 01:38:40,971
[SPEAKER_05]: As you said, if they park in the street on the non-parking side instead of on the sidewalk, then a car can't park opposing it or otherwise it would block the road.

1318
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: This just establishes that for people to know where that would occur and it would establish it for the parking officers and the police officers who may have to enforce parking.

1319
01:38:52,315 --> 01:38:59,620
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise you may not know if there's a car parked opposite each other who is there first and who is contributing to that issue of blocking the road.

1320
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:05,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So by formalizing it, you could do something like this, just throwing it out there as an option.

1321
01:39:07,485 --> 01:39:08,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that helps the discussion.

1322
01:39:08,886 --> 01:39:16,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Two different scenarios.

1323
01:39:18,212 --> 01:39:18,532
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1324
01:39:18,998 --> 01:39:23,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Were those two different, or was the second one the line with the first one?

1325
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was just to show different colors of where the space is, how it lays out with the three different options.

1326
01:39:30,062 --> 01:39:39,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So the second graphic was just, in my opinion, the preferred option, which is alternating, because it maximizes the parking spaces and has the traffic calming benefits.

1327
01:39:41,462 --> 01:39:45,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that involve edge lines or marking out L's and T's?

1328
01:39:46,123 --> 01:39:55,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would involve, in my opinion, it would involve signs where the transition occurs from no parking to parking allowed with an arrow.

1329
01:39:56,086 --> 01:39:59,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So an arrow to the no parking sign, an arrow to the parking.

1330
01:39:59,887 --> 01:40:05,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it would clearly define which several spaces of parking is allowed and which is not allowed.

1331
01:40:06,328 --> 01:40:08,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you could also add the,

1332
01:40:09,009 --> 01:40:20,440
[SPEAKER_05]: one white line on the right and one yellow line on the left to guide the motoring public to help avoid hitting the first in the string of a set of three or four parked cars.

1333
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:28,768
[SPEAKER_05]: That first one on that odd side has the potential for a vehicle to collide with the back side of it if it doesn't have markings.

1334
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:34,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, a parallel set of yellow, white line.

1335
01:40:34,491 --> 01:40:37,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But not necessarily L's and T's individually.

1336
01:40:37,893 --> 01:40:39,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1337
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:40,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Just edge line, yeah.

1338
01:40:41,254 --> 01:40:45,535
[SPEAKER_04]: An edge line and a yellow, and the edge line and yellow would meander down the street.

1339
01:40:46,055 --> 01:40:46,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1340
01:40:46,315 --> 01:40:48,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd get parking staggered.

1341
01:40:48,536 --> 01:40:56,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So the signs would help people know where they should park and where they shouldn't, and the enforcement officers, and then the lines are more for the motoring public to guide them.

1342
01:40:56,839 --> 01:41:05,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, even though as you said before we don't necessarily want to get in the habit of painting every single side street But in this case, I think the hitch line would help.

1343
01:41:06,104 --> 01:41:10,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're right And it could be people get used to it and we let it fade I

1344
01:41:12,063 --> 01:41:12,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, yeah.

1345
01:41:13,924 --> 01:41:18,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, given last conversation, we could consider one cone at the backside.

1346
01:41:19,348 --> 01:41:32,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other scenes that have done the slalom with curving, usually if the front or the front edge of that first car would usually be a curved bump out with a sign with a yellow arrow.

1347
01:41:33,457 --> 01:41:37,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So a cheap way of doing that would be one flex post in that area.

1348
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But it seems like

1349
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:44,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks maybe slow street should be anyway.

1350
01:41:47,469 --> 01:41:52,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would be interested if there are residents here to speak, I would be interested in knowing how fast people drive down the street normally.

1351
01:41:52,753 --> 01:41:56,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it seems like 1 of those streets that hopefully people creep down pretty slow.

1352
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:57,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not hitting cars.

1353
01:42:02,547 --> 01:42:09,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe either DPW or police, we have a radar feedback sign on Pearl, so we could pull some data for that as well.

1354
01:42:10,892 --> 01:42:12,133
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, we do have data.

1355
01:42:13,554 --> 01:42:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: The police department does not have one on Pearl.

1356
01:42:16,685 --> 01:42:18,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, DPW does, so we could pull data off that.

1357
01:42:20,266 --> 01:42:31,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But as some of us know, the fact that the signs there could impact people slow down, which is a good thing, but then the data won't necessarily reflect what they were doing before we had that sign.

1358
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:34,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we do chicanes, they're going to have to slow down?

1359
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:34,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to hit cars?

1360
01:42:35,251 --> 01:42:36,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, yeah.

1361
01:42:42,113 --> 01:42:42,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the chicane idea.

1362
01:42:51,145 --> 01:42:52,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1363
01:42:53,106 --> 01:42:55,467
[SPEAKER_08]: There's any residents like to speak on it?

1364
01:42:55,487 --> 01:43:01,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless commissioners have anything else to input, I'd move it to the public.

1365
01:43:04,951 --> 01:43:06,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, I will go.

1366
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:09,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, I'm just gonna ask you on mute.

1367
01:43:13,895 --> 01:43:15,116
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have come off here.

1368
01:43:16,912 --> 01:43:19,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, if you are having issues, just ask you to unmute.

1369
01:43:19,794 --> 01:43:23,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to you.

1370
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:25,337
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Lori.

1371
01:43:25,357 --> 01:43:29,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ask you to unmute, and then Diane, we'll come back to you.

1372
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:32,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Lori, good evening.

1373
01:43:32,261 --> 01:43:32,661
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

1374
01:43:33,021 --> 01:43:33,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, good.

1375
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:33,962
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

1376
01:43:33,982 --> 01:43:35,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

1377
01:43:35,763 --> 01:43:41,106
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so the staggered parking would only add two more cars to the street?

1378
01:43:43,087 --> 01:43:44,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I understand that correctly?

1379
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:45,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1380
01:43:49,269 --> 01:44:03,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Todd, I know my husband had talked to you about the sidewalk, painting a footstrip along the sidewalk edge to delineate the boundary between the sidewalk and the street.

1381
01:44:03,307 --> 01:44:06,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that at all a possibility?

1382
01:44:09,925 --> 01:44:11,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something typically done.

1383
01:44:11,566 --> 01:44:18,049
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't necessarily address the maintenance and longevity of sidewalk deterioration.

1384
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I had suggested if, you know, I believed, I can speak for the members of this commission, but I believe for the city or any commission to consider that type of solution, you know, we'd have to have very strong evidence just to even consider it from say,

1385
01:44:34,698 --> 01:44:54,103
[SPEAKER_05]: the Disability Commission of Medford or the State Disability Commission, because if those types of agencies said, oh, we're okay with that type of scenario, but it still, again, doesn't address the longevity and maintenance issues related to cars, parking on sidewalks.

1386
01:44:54,163 --> 01:45:02,825
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of the accessibility piece, I think it's highly unlikely that they would support it, but that's, in my opinion,

1387
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:09,793
[SPEAKER_05]: could contribute to making these decisions at a meeting like this for folks.

1388
01:45:09,953 --> 01:45:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if you or your husband had a chance to reach out to those types of agencies regarding accessibility.

1389
01:45:17,499 --> 01:45:26,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it would only, of the two issues we're pointing out, it would only really, even if that were the case, it would only really comment on one of the two.

1390
01:45:26,965 --> 01:45:30,568
[SPEAKER_05]: The deterioration, I know a lot of folks said before, Los Alamos was fine.

1391
01:45:30,968 --> 01:45:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: But we know as an industry and engineers,

1392
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:42,993
[SPEAKER_05]: in Medford and elsewhere that those things do contribute, because the depth of a sidewalk concrete is much less than at a driveway or a street depth.

1393
01:45:43,513 --> 01:45:48,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know that it's designed for a certain load, pedestrian load versus car load.

1394
01:45:48,915 --> 01:46:00,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if it's not apparent right now today on a particular sidewalk panel, we know that it does exist and affects the city, and not just Medford, other cities and towns and state.

1395
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:09,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And then going back to your suggestion about the line on the sidewalk again, there is a state rule of no parking on sidewalks.

1396
01:46:10,061 --> 01:46:14,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's, you know, so it would be still going against that.

1397
01:46:14,162 --> 01:46:16,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So the commission, in my opinion, has to weigh all those things.

1398
01:46:18,083 --> 01:46:18,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1399
01:46:18,383 --> 01:46:22,004
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would be saying that this is the street, this is the sidewalk.

1400
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:27,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're, uh, I believe eight and a half, um, feet.

1401
01:46:28,196 --> 01:46:33,451
[SPEAKER_10]: which is much wider than most sidewalks in the city.

1402
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:45,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, yeah, to back you up, Lori, I did say, I looked into the sidewalk widths on all the neighboring streets, like Stern, Stanley, and others in the area of Frederick.

1403
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:58,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And for whatever reason, I can't answer for whoever designed this neighborhood back in the 50s or whenever it was, but for whatever reason, the sidewalks on Pearl are a little wider than some of the other, say, Frederick and some others.

1404
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:01,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And the street is more narrow for some reason.

1405
01:47:02,543 --> 01:47:05,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that would be a major capital project to change that.

1406
01:47:06,325 --> 01:47:22,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think people voice their opinions on that in the past about whether the dollars that we have to go throughout the city would be well spent on something like that to widen the streets, to provide more parking or to provide trees or whatnot.

1407
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are decisions too that would still have to be made.

1408
01:47:25,373 --> 01:47:30,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you patiently waited during those other conversations, you heard that

1409
01:47:31,936 --> 01:47:37,918
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, my constant comments about capital improvements in resources, needs exceeding resources.

1410
01:47:37,958 --> 01:47:43,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a long list of people waiting in line for curbing and concrete for various things.

1411
01:47:44,201 --> 01:47:44,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1412
01:47:44,561 --> 01:47:46,402
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, I understand that.

1413
01:47:46,422 --> 01:47:59,587
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why I said maybe this could be a temporary thing until eventually there's funding, because the sidewalks that aren't being used for parking

1414
01:48:00,746 --> 01:48:14,177
[SPEAKER_10]: They seem to be more, um, destroyed than where the cars are parked, but I don't know if I think the staggered parking would help with the speeding.

1415
01:48:14,318 --> 01:48:20,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, there are a lot of speeding cars that go down Pearl street because it's a cut through.

1416
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:27,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but to get two cars, I mean, my opinion.

1417
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:34,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not happy, I'm not happy with the whole thing of it.

1418
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:41,451
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's just, it goes just far beyond inconvenience of parking in front of your own house.

1419
01:48:42,251 --> 01:48:55,515
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, your quality of life, like your guests, there's just nowhere to park there if you can't have the two sides.

1420
01:48:57,507 --> 01:49:11,772
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you're talking about asking people when you have a holiday or a family dinner to go find parking on side streets that you're going to inconvenience or take away from someone else's parking.

1421
01:49:12,413 --> 01:49:14,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And never mind the students that aren't even here yet.

1422
01:49:15,694 --> 01:49:16,934
[SPEAKER_10]: The street is pretty full.

1423
01:49:18,695 --> 01:49:27,158
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a lot of vacant two-family homes, which include students when they come here.

1424
01:49:28,997 --> 01:49:35,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the summer, and the summer it's a little easier, but the winter, it's gonna be a really big hardship.

1425
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:46,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know you're trying to work on it, but I don't know what else to do, to say.

1426
01:49:46,583 --> 01:49:55,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I had a drop, I had a car full of groceries, and I had to, I did park on the sidewalk so I could unload my car, because I had nowhere to go.

1427
01:49:57,707 --> 01:50:06,229
[SPEAKER_10]: son had a guest at the house, so my driveway was taken, unbeknownst to me that that was going to happen.

1428
01:50:06,409 --> 01:50:09,790
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it's hard.

1429
01:50:11,951 --> 01:50:18,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And then to boot, you're adding the cost of the permit pricing.

1430
01:50:19,073 --> 01:50:26,895
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to cost me $160 without guest parking stickers, and I won't even be able to park in my own street.

1431
01:50:33,907 --> 01:50:37,869
[SPEAKER_05]: May I ask how it's been going since the last meeting?

1432
01:50:38,109 --> 01:50:46,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So the chief had proposed since the last meeting until now that allow parking on both sides, just not directly opposite each other.

1433
01:50:46,253 --> 01:50:47,933
[SPEAKER_05]: How has that been working out?

1434
01:50:49,174 --> 01:51:00,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I have seen down the lower end when you're taking off of College Ave, I know a few cars there have parked staggered.

1435
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:03,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seemed to work.

1436
01:51:04,112 --> 01:51:06,976
[SPEAKER_10]: No one up in my area or I'm closer to Main Street.

1437
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:09,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen anyone do that there.

1438
01:51:14,463 --> 01:51:26,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason I ask, and maybe the commissioners are thinking, because if it seems to be working out, again, I'll just like the proposal to alternate would be to formalize essentially the same thing.

1439
01:51:26,474 --> 01:51:32,079
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't be able to park directly opposite each other, but at least it would inform people where to do that and how to do it.

1440
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:37,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people enforcing it, who is, you know, they wouldn't have to figure out who is there first.

1441
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:38,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1442
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:41,487
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just adding two more parking spaces.

1443
01:51:43,165 --> 01:51:46,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, we don't- Unfortunately, that's the way the math worked out.

1444
01:51:46,347 --> 01:51:57,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think historically, I don't know about the police department, but historically, I may have seen maybe three to five cars parking on the side of Pearl, roughly, so say three or four.

1445
01:51:58,973 --> 01:51:59,694
[SPEAKER_10]: On the sidewalk?

1446
01:52:00,154 --> 01:52:01,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1447
01:52:01,835 --> 01:52:03,556
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably about six or eight.

1448
01:52:04,296 --> 01:52:05,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1449
01:52:05,517 --> 01:52:06,317
[SPEAKER_10]: On a normal day.

1450
01:52:07,785 --> 01:52:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So of those six or eight, where by alternating officially would be accommodating two of them in the worst case, then if it's six or eight, those four others, some of them may compete on the other streets.

1451
01:52:22,498 --> 01:52:24,620
[SPEAKER_05]: But are we talking the worst case scenario?

1452
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So for parking in general, like at a mall, say, for instance,

1453
01:52:29,364 --> 01:52:31,385
[SPEAKER_05]: a mall parking lot isn't supposed to be designed.

1454
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:40,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is not a mall, it's a street, but the point I'm making is you don't design it for a Christmas rush, but then 90% of the other year, like the parking lot's half vacant.

1455
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a trend nowadays too.

1456
01:52:42,331 --> 01:52:45,693
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't design for the worst case scenario, you design for the, you know, the

1457
01:52:47,153 --> 01:52:51,256
[SPEAKER_05]: 85th percentile or some percentage of what mostly occurs.

1458
01:52:51,317 --> 01:52:54,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And then those few times where it's so full, you might have to walk a little further.

1459
01:52:54,799 --> 01:53:03,346
[SPEAKER_05]: But to account for like the worst case scenario all the time isn't necessarily the way to go for other treatments these days anyway.

1460
01:53:03,486 --> 01:53:04,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand.

1461
01:53:04,827 --> 01:53:08,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally hear what you're saying in terms of what impacts it will have.

1462
01:53:08,289 --> 01:53:13,994
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the G zone does help as compared to if this was proposed when there was no G zone.

1463
01:53:14,534 --> 01:53:17,335
[SPEAKER_05]: because you would only be limited to Pearl Street.

1464
01:53:17,475 --> 01:53:22,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you didn't fit on Pearl, you'd only be able to go to non-restricted streets like Main.

1465
01:53:22,916 --> 01:53:37,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So by having the zone, it does open up the option to Stearns or Stanley, even though the likelihood of using them won't be often, but it does open up more streets than what would have been if this came about before the zone was there.

1466
01:53:39,701 --> 01:53:39,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1467
01:53:42,788 --> 01:53:44,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, it would go both ways.

1468
01:53:44,409 --> 01:53:48,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Being in the G zone, yes, you could have possibly more people there.

1469
01:53:48,533 --> 01:53:51,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, we could go to other locations.

1470
01:53:52,756 --> 01:53:58,401
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, this is a good time of year when the students aren't around.

1471
01:53:59,162 --> 01:54:05,727
[SPEAKER_10]: You add the students into this, and it's very challenging.

1472
01:54:08,975 --> 01:54:09,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have another.

1473
01:54:10,015 --> 01:54:18,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to clarify that, a student shouldn't be able to get parking passes unless their vehicles are registered to the address in Medford.

1474
01:54:18,498 --> 01:54:29,742
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's an out-of-state plate that's parked on a street in Medford, I'm just using that as an example for a tough student, then they do not have a parking pass.

1475
01:54:31,283 --> 01:54:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the chat, Liberta's iPad wants to speak, and also Diane has her hand up.

1476
01:54:37,605 --> 01:54:38,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, Liberta.

1477
01:54:40,177 --> 01:54:42,278
[SPEAKER_08]: but just wanted to make sure that he didn't have anything else.

1478
01:54:42,979 --> 01:54:44,079
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, thank you though.

1479
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, we're going to go back to you and just ask you to unmute.

1480
01:54:51,607 --> 01:54:52,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, thank you.

1481
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:57,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I just kind of wanted to reinforce what Laurie was stating.

1482
01:54:57,671 --> 01:55:08,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Our street right now, if you look at it at night, even during the day, it's pretty crowded, but there's many apartments that are vacant right now.

1483
01:55:09,018 --> 01:55:19,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you said that the students, if they have out of state plates, but a lot of them, in fact, my student, my son goes to school in a different city and he has parking

1484
01:55:20,045 --> 01:55:22,067
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, at that place on the street.

1485
01:55:22,287 --> 01:55:29,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know a lot of the residents here will get permit stickers because they'll have an apartment and they'll have it year round.

1486
01:55:29,754 --> 01:55:31,075
[SPEAKER_13]: So that makes them a resident.

1487
01:55:32,096 --> 01:55:39,143
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they don't do that, I know a lot of states they'll use a visitor's pass and they'll park there.

1488
01:55:39,303 --> 01:55:40,324
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is an issue.

1489
01:55:40,484 --> 01:55:42,106
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now our street is full.

1490
01:55:45,189 --> 01:55:46,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Not our main season.

1491
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:47,954
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter that it's Christmas.

1492
01:55:48,014 --> 01:55:50,158
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just our regular normal season.

1493
01:55:50,178 --> 01:55:51,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of it is our late season.

1494
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:57,360
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other thing you asked about, questions on how this has been going.

1495
01:55:58,001 --> 01:56:06,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Lori, I think you are away, but there was a car down at the beginning of Pearl Street that was parked, they were parked on both sides of the street.

1496
01:56:07,245 --> 01:56:16,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And the mirror was ripped off a few weeks ago, in front of the new apartment at the new building down the street that they have for sale.

1497
01:56:16,630 --> 01:56:20,012
[SPEAKER_13]: The side view mirror was ripped off when it was parked on Pearl Street.

1498
01:56:20,912 --> 01:56:21,753
[SPEAKER_13]: a few weeks ago.

1499
01:56:22,753 --> 01:56:28,837
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also one of the trash trucks couldn't get down the street because they were parked on both sides of the street again.

1500
01:56:28,917 --> 01:56:33,540
[SPEAKER_13]: So they were leaning on their horn trying to get down the street to get the car to move.

1501
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:44,567
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, I don't know if Stagger Parking is gonna do the trick because I don't know if people are gonna, I know you said you're gonna mark it, but what happens when there's snow on the ground?

1502
01:56:44,647 --> 01:56:46,248
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens if, I don't know.

1503
01:56:46,789 --> 01:56:48,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I don't know what's gonna work.

1504
01:56:50,017 --> 01:56:54,160
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be an issue and a hardship for everybody who lives on the street.

1505
01:56:54,180 --> 01:57:02,686
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Laurie had said about, I thought Skip had a great idea when he had said to mock the sidewalk.

1506
01:57:02,766 --> 01:57:10,891
[SPEAKER_13]: If the sidewalks you need technically, you need five feet, I think was said for a sidewalk width and the sidewalks eight feet or whatever it is.

1507
01:57:10,992 --> 01:57:15,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't you use a couple of feet to park on if you drove a line and if cars parked over the line?

1508
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:18,261
[SPEAKER_13]: then you ticket them or tow them.

1509
01:57:18,461 --> 01:57:20,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't that be used if the sidewalk's big enough?

1510
01:57:20,802 --> 01:57:21,743
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the concern?

1511
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:23,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we changing?

1512
01:57:23,864 --> 01:57:26,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Diane, in state law, you cannot park on a sidewalk.

1513
01:57:27,045 --> 01:57:31,907
[SPEAKER_13]: But what if the sidewalk's already larger than it needs to be?

1514
01:57:32,508 --> 01:57:33,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

1515
01:57:33,728 --> 01:57:34,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a sidewalk.

1516
01:57:35,089 --> 01:57:42,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's the difference between making the sidewalk smaller, legit smaller, and drawing a line to save money?

1517
01:57:43,393 --> 01:57:45,794
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they would have to do is remove the curb,

1518
01:57:46,558 --> 01:57:49,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Go in two feet, dig it out, and put the curving in.

1519
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pointy sidewalks.

1520
01:57:52,121 --> 01:57:53,962
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you're compliant with ADA.

1521
01:57:54,642 --> 01:57:54,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1522
01:57:55,302 --> 01:57:55,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1523
01:57:55,602 --> 01:57:59,344
[SPEAKER_13]: But so even if it's wide enough, it still wouldn't be compliant.

1524
01:57:59,785 --> 01:58:03,706
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're saying this is the sidewalk, per se, you can't do it that way to save money.

1525
01:58:06,542 --> 01:58:11,486
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think one of the problems here is that there never has been these parking spaces that folks are relying on.

1526
01:58:11,866 --> 01:58:13,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So we understand, I think.

1527
01:58:13,207 --> 01:58:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only speak for myself here, but I empathize for your situation.

1528
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:19,612
[SPEAKER_04]: These spaces never really existed.

1529
01:58:19,632 --> 01:58:24,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The chicane option does add two legit spaces from one side only.

1530
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:26,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is helpful.

1531
01:58:26,497 --> 01:58:30,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The chicane option leaves parking on both sides just staggered.

1532
01:58:32,721 --> 01:58:40,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm really glad we waited this month and gave Todd some time to think about this as the city's professional in this world.

1533
01:58:40,992 --> 01:58:48,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, but, you know, I think I understand what you guys have for hardships because maybe of this decision, but also don't forget.

1534
01:58:48,982 --> 01:58:56,248
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a hardship now that's potentially preventing public safety from getting to you when you need it.

1535
01:58:56,268 --> 01:58:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Diane, you described a mirror getting hit.

1536
01:59:00,211 --> 01:59:03,914
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as you start hearing about mirrors getting hit, that means the cars are too close together.

1537
01:59:04,755 --> 01:59:07,257
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as a fire truck can't get through, an ambulance can't get through,

1538
01:59:07,777 --> 01:59:13,680
[SPEAKER_04]: or there's a traffic jam, it just creates public safety problems for you and for people downstream of you on the road.

1539
01:59:14,961 --> 01:59:26,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why it's important for us to deal with this, but we have to deal with it in a way where, as the chief said last time, we should deal with it in a way that is understanding of your situation.

1540
01:59:26,968 --> 01:59:35,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what Todd has struck here, in my opinion, does strike that balance for what it's worth.

1541
01:59:35,352 --> 01:59:36,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1542
01:59:42,282 --> 01:59:47,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Loretta, I will go to you and just ask you to unmute.

1543
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:53,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

1544
01:59:54,990 --> 01:59:56,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I worked here for 55 years.

1545
01:59:57,932 --> 02:00:04,236
[SPEAKER_21]: We've never had an issue with basically the parking situation.

1546
02:00:04,537 --> 02:00:06,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything has always been fine.

1547
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:11,301
[SPEAKER_21]: I know some people do have to park on the sidewalk a little,

1548
02:00:13,825 --> 02:00:18,747
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just not sure all of a sudden, when did this become an issue?

1549
02:00:19,848 --> 02:00:26,331
[SPEAKER_21]: For 55 years, it wasn't an issue that some cars did have to pull up.

1550
02:00:27,011 --> 02:00:31,914
[SPEAKER_21]: And honestly, it's, of course, not our fault that the street wasn't

1551
02:00:33,299 --> 02:00:38,361
[SPEAKER_21]: made correctly and the sidewalks weren't made four feet instead of the eight feet that they are.

1552
02:00:38,922 --> 02:00:41,403
[SPEAKER_21]: So I feel as though we're being penalized.

1553
02:00:41,963 --> 02:00:43,124
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no idea.

1554
02:00:43,144 --> 02:00:55,770
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm honestly not understanding this new parking, but all I can see is that I'm not gonna be able to have anyone come and visit me anymore.

1555
02:00:56,850 --> 02:01:11,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Me at my age, I'm 76, and my friends or whatever are my age or older, I can't expect them to go find parking on other streets in order to come visit me.

1556
02:01:12,341 --> 02:01:18,325
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you really realize the hardship that you are creating by doing this.

1557
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:22,842
[SPEAKER_21]: I really don't know what to say.

1558
02:01:22,862 --> 02:01:26,983
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's just not making common sense to me.

1559
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:35,765
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I know there is that law that you're not supposed to park on the sidewalk, but it's something that people have been doing.

1560
02:01:35,805 --> 02:01:38,306
[SPEAKER_21]: There aren't that many cars that need to do it.

1561
02:01:40,666 --> 02:01:42,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta, I'm Sergeant Rogers.

1562
02:01:43,107 --> 02:01:45,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I monitor the C-Click fix in the city.

1563
02:01:45,983 --> 02:01:50,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have received numerous, numerous complaints from residents.

1564
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:53,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you not doing anything?

1565
02:01:53,652 --> 02:01:55,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you allowing this?

1566
02:01:56,416 --> 02:01:57,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm handicapped.

1567
02:01:57,337 --> 02:01:58,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot get by.

1568
02:02:00,541 --> 02:02:02,443
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it finally came to a head.

1569
02:02:03,543 --> 02:02:12,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, but again, I also have a handicap and I can tell you that I can get my Walker out there when I need to use it.

1570
02:02:13,212 --> 02:02:18,096
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can walk on the sidewalk if there's a car there, I believe as far as.

1571
02:02:19,592 --> 02:02:23,275
[SPEAKER_21]: any type of obstructed path of travel.

1572
02:02:23,375 --> 02:02:25,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it has to be at least three feet.

1573
02:02:25,877 --> 02:02:36,126
[SPEAKER_21]: And because of the size of the sidewalks and the cars don't go totally on the sidewalk, they're just going up a little to make enough room.

1574
02:02:36,586 --> 02:02:43,272
[SPEAKER_21]: There's plenty of room for me to get by with my walker plus people walking alongside of me if I need it.

1575
02:02:43,292 --> 02:02:48,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta, I have cars that are parking on the curb and I'm still getting complaints.

1576
02:02:50,266 --> 02:02:55,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you cannot park on the sidewalk from a public work standpoint to liberate.

1577
02:02:55,789 --> 02:02:59,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're trying to explain this before and, you know, thank you for your patience and try to understand this.

1578
02:03:00,471 --> 02:03:03,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it, the sidewalks are not designed for that.

1579
02:03:03,553 --> 02:03:04,553
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not meant for it.

1580
02:03:04,573 --> 02:03:11,437
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of issues with federal law, state law and municipal law, like, all the way up the chain.

1581
02:03:12,417 --> 02:03:30,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're getting complaints, as Sergeant Rogers is describing, and it comes to our attention, and we monitor the situation, we've identified, even though it hasn't happened yet, we don't want it to happen, a situation where vehicle, emergency vehicles can't get down the road because you have cars parked properly on both sides.

1582
02:03:30,764 --> 02:03:41,088
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone's trying to follow the law, and someone's coming to visit you or your neighbors, and they want to legally park on that street today, and someone across the street wants to do the same thing, they can create a situation where

1583
02:03:41,388 --> 02:03:42,990
[SPEAKER_04]: They have now made the road impassable.

1584
02:03:44,091 --> 02:03:46,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we can't allow that to happen.

1585
02:03:46,633 --> 02:03:49,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the reasoning behind all of this.

1586
02:03:50,737 --> 02:03:59,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have an option on the table that is strikes a balance between the needs of the resident on the street and what you've been experiencing for the last.

1587
02:04:00,968 --> 02:04:03,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Decade or more you more than others.

1588
02:04:04,371 --> 02:04:12,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, hopefully that provides some information for you to understand to further understand what we're doing here and why we're doing it.

1589
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I would like to add to that.

1590
02:04:15,082 --> 02:04:15,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1591
02:04:15,623 --> 02:04:16,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add.

1592
02:04:16,764 --> 02:04:22,167
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, we're human, we get it, it seems all of a sudden, it seems out of the blue.

1593
02:04:22,808 --> 02:04:28,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But for us, or people in the city, and the people complaining, it's not out of the blue, they've been asking for this for years.

1594
02:04:29,512 --> 02:04:37,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, over the past so many years, Medford's been trying to do the right thing, clean up some things that may have been done incorrectly.

1595
02:04:37,616 --> 02:04:41,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Like one, for instance, is parking in the same direction or travel.

1596
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:42,780
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was something that was,

1597
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:49,964
[SPEAKER_05]: widespread in Medford and when we had to kind of re-teach everyone how to park in their proper direction of travel.

1598
02:04:50,004 --> 02:04:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also a common thing statewide in other cities and towns.

1599
02:04:53,766 --> 02:04:56,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just in Medford for whatever reason it was a long time.

1600
02:04:57,348 --> 02:05:11,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to slowly respond to people that know the rules that have been in other communities that know the rules well and constantly get in contact with all of us professionals that work for the city to do the right thing and get people off the sidewalks.

1601
02:05:11,557 --> 02:05:12,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you know

1602
02:05:13,318 --> 02:05:20,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you don't feel like it's targeting Pearl Street in particular because there are other streets that this has occurred and we've already addressed some of those.

1603
02:05:20,841 --> 02:05:24,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvard Street was one, Park Street is another, Arlington Street is another.

1604
02:05:25,062 --> 02:05:28,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just Pearl Street, just so you know, it's other streets as well.

1605
02:05:29,244 --> 02:05:36,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're systematically trying to go through piece by piece to clean this stuff up and we do realize it's a change for folks.

1606
02:05:36,546 --> 02:05:41,450
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a responsibility to look at that side of things, the state law, and the complaints about it as well.

1607
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:45,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So Arlington Street is a perfect example of a whole block that lost a whole side of parking.

1608
02:05:46,194 --> 02:05:47,435
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the same discussion.

1609
02:05:48,156 --> 02:05:50,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just Pearl Street.

1610
02:05:50,578 --> 02:05:52,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it probably feels that way.

1611
02:05:54,001 --> 02:05:57,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to let you know as well that it's not.

1612
02:05:58,224 --> 02:05:59,565
[SPEAKER_21]: Could I ask one other question?

1613
02:05:59,645 --> 02:06:03,108
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard Laurie talk about zoning and different permits.

1614
02:06:03,608 --> 02:06:05,009
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not aware of any of that.

1615
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Could someone explain that to me?

1616
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:09,653
[SPEAKER_21]: How much is it going to cost me to park on my own street now?

1617
02:06:14,677 --> 02:06:21,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim, if you want to step in and give exact numbers, that might be.

1618
02:06:23,858 --> 02:06:26,940
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it was the question, how much does it cost to park on the street?

1619
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:29,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, explain the zone.

1620
02:06:29,081 --> 02:06:30,202
[SPEAKER_16]: She doesn't understand it.

1621
02:06:30,342 --> 02:06:33,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, the G zone is a zoned area.

1622
02:06:33,023 --> 02:06:35,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So Pearl street is part of the G zone.

1623
02:06:35,585 --> 02:06:36,646
[SPEAKER_14]: There is information.

1624
02:06:36,666 --> 02:06:44,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you have access to the city's website, but we've got a whole section on the parking parking page about the G zone.

1625
02:06:45,751 --> 02:06:45,831
[SPEAKER_14]: And.

1626
02:06:48,998 --> 02:06:55,024
[SPEAKER_14]: It allows people who live in the G zone to park on with their permit on their card.

1627
02:06:55,064 --> 02:06:57,846
[SPEAKER_14]: They're allowed to park on any street within the G zone.

1628
02:06:58,407 --> 02:07:01,850
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that doesn't transfer to other streets is your visitor passes.

1629
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:14,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I think Lori mentioned having visitors over those visitor passes that any of you might have are only good on Pearl street, but your own personal vehicles that you have paid for a permit for are allowed on any street in the G zone.

1630
02:07:15,801 --> 02:07:19,864
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you give me a second, I can look at the map and give you some streets that are close by.

1631
02:07:19,884 --> 02:07:22,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can help while you pull up the maps there.

1632
02:07:23,027 --> 02:07:33,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So Stern Stanley, Credrick, Windsor, all these streets, Bowdoin, Princeton, Yale.

1633
02:07:34,695 --> 02:07:58,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvard so any pretty much it encompasses a lot of streets in the South Medford kind of hillside area That it's approximately a certain distance away from the Green Line is what the zone was created But it's resident districts parking just as other communities you may have seen it and elsewhere like Boston and others have districts so like Beacon Hill in Boston you could park on any one Beacon Hill, but not South Boston and vice versa and

1634
02:07:58,808 --> 02:08:07,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was, so South Medford in your area was a pilot that became permanent to have a zoned parking situation.

1635
02:08:07,392 --> 02:08:11,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not just restricted to Pearl Street, which is what it used to be.

1636
02:08:11,574 --> 02:08:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So you used to only be able to, with your sticker or permit, park on Pearl Street only, even non-visitor.

1637
02:08:18,397 --> 02:08:24,600
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was expanded to allow you to park on neighboring streets as well, if they're posted within that zone.

1638
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:26,821
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a green G on the parking sign.

1639
02:08:28,388 --> 02:08:34,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, is that in addition to my parking permit that I need to pack on Pearl Street?

1640
02:08:34,077 --> 02:08:36,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's permit only parking?

1641
02:08:37,563 --> 02:08:41,550
[SPEAKER_14]: The permit you have for Pearl Street applies to any street in the G zone.

1642
02:08:42,057 --> 02:08:43,937
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's say you get to pro street, it's full.

1643
02:08:44,017 --> 02:08:45,838
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go over to Stearns Avenue.

1644
02:08:46,018 --> 02:08:47,898
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go over to wedge mirror.

1645
02:08:47,978 --> 02:08:49,018
[SPEAKER_14]: You could go to Stanley.

1646
02:08:50,379 --> 02:08:54,540
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some non permitted streets on the other side of George street as well.

1647
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:59,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So, like, Royal street, and I believe it's Florence street.

1648
02:08:59,381 --> 02:09:01,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Those don't have permits at all.

1649
02:09:01,641 --> 02:09:04,202
[SPEAKER_14]: So anybody can park there, whether or not they have a permit.

1650
02:09:04,762 --> 02:09:09,823
[SPEAKER_14]: So also Dwyer circles a little farther, but there are other options for.

1651
02:09:10,627 --> 02:09:13,928
[SPEAKER_14]: you and or your guests should Pearl Street fill up.

1652
02:09:14,288 --> 02:09:21,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I know you said you had a handicap that might impair your ability to walk, but this could also apply to your guests, people who wanna come see you.

1653
02:09:22,209 --> 02:09:25,050
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's just something to keep in mind.

1654
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm sorry.

1655
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:30,511
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought they just said though that the guest passes are only good for Pearl Street.

1656
02:09:30,571 --> 02:09:32,411
[SPEAKER_21]: They can't use them on those other streets.

1657
02:09:32,471 --> 02:09:32,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, right.

1658
02:09:32,872 --> 02:09:37,272
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I wanted to put that out there for anybody from Pearl Street who's listening, not specifically for you.

1659
02:09:38,153 --> 02:09:39,753
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, so if people,

1660
02:09:40,933 --> 02:09:47,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Utilize the entire G zone residents end up on other streets that might leave space available for permit parking.

1661
02:09:47,875 --> 02:09:53,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we also highly encourage people to use their driveways, either for themselves or for their guests.

1662
02:09:53,476 --> 02:10:00,078
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a permit and move to this to the street, allow your guests in the driveway, then you can avoid buying having to buy a visitor permit.

1663
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:06,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, although if you're over 65, any permits you purchase visitor or resident wouldn't cost you anything.

1664
02:10:07,397 --> 02:10:10,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, like we have a common driveway.

1665
02:10:10,438 --> 02:10:16,020
[SPEAKER_21]: So even though it looks as though it's long, people can't use it because it's common.

1666
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:20,061
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to allow both families able to get out.

1667
02:10:20,302 --> 02:10:25,924
[SPEAKER_21]: So that would stop any visitors from being able to park in it.

1668
02:10:26,024 --> 02:10:29,885
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm still not sure with all of this where visitors are going to go because

1669
02:10:30,665 --> 02:10:36,968
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't foresee other people if they're coming home and there's a space on the street, they're going to park on the street.

1670
02:10:37,008 --> 02:10:45,631
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not going to say, let me go around to Stanley or someplace else so that I can free up a spot for someone that might have a visitor tonight.

1671
02:10:45,771 --> 02:10:53,154
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well, but if you do that, if somebody does that, they could then move their car to somewhere else in the G zone and allow their guests to park in front of their home.

1672
02:10:53,659 --> 02:10:57,861
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, I mean, I'm happy to go over the any options with you liberta.

1673
02:10:57,961 --> 02:11:01,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, info's on the website or I can send it to you in it.

1674
02:11:02,003 --> 02:11:06,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm getting I understand what you're saying.

1675
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:12,264
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just not something that I think is, you know, going to work to our advantage.

1676
02:11:12,364 --> 02:11:13,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me put it that way.

1677
02:11:13,645 --> 02:11:17,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, if we allowed, it's just, we can't allow the sidewalk anymore.

1678
02:11:17,850 --> 02:11:24,556
[SPEAKER_14]: If I let if, I mean, if, even if they could allow Pearl street to do it, then it opens other streets wanting to do it too.

1679
02:11:25,037 --> 02:11:29,842
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know that's not even it's not even it's kind of a hard stop on that because it's a state law.

1680
02:11:29,862 --> 02:11:30,503
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't just.

1681
02:11:30,803 --> 02:11:30,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1682
02:11:31,614 --> 02:11:33,535
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, unfortunately.

1683
02:11:33,555 --> 02:11:37,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully you can get on a list for new sidewalks at some point.

1684
02:11:37,857 --> 02:11:42,500
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a shame because they put new sidewalks in across the way, not that many years ago.

1685
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:47,643
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know why they didn't take the opportunity then to make them the correct size.

1686
02:11:48,123 --> 02:11:50,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we probably wouldn't even have to have this meeting.

1687
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:01,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Roberta.

1688
02:12:01,969 --> 02:12:02,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1689
02:12:03,512 --> 02:12:08,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to see if anybody else in the public would like to speak.

1690
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:10,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none here.

1691
02:12:10,663 --> 02:12:13,968
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are having issues raising your hand, just add into the comments.

1692
02:12:14,008 --> 02:12:16,032
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, I will pass it back to the commissioners.

1693
02:12:19,205 --> 02:12:21,546
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd just like to say that I think it's a great option.

1694
02:12:22,306 --> 02:12:25,928
[SPEAKER_24]: It resolves the issue with parking on the sidewalk, which again is illegal.

1695
02:12:26,688 --> 02:12:39,974
[SPEAKER_24]: But also I think as the neighbors alluded to, it's an opportunity to slow the traffic down potentially as everyone who drives there knows that it is a shortcut for George Street.

1696
02:12:40,174 --> 02:12:40,995
[SPEAKER_24]: So again.

1697
02:12:41,015 --> 02:12:44,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1698
02:12:46,277 --> 02:12:47,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, I'll just ask you to unmute me.

1699
02:12:49,437 --> 02:12:51,498
[SPEAKER_08]: should be held.

1700
02:12:52,119 --> 02:12:52,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1701
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:53,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

1702
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:57,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that I agree with my neighbors who have just talked before me.

1703
02:12:57,902 --> 02:13:03,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a resident of this Pearl Street for 57 years.

1704
02:13:03,526 --> 02:13:04,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I beat out Liberta.

1705
02:13:05,267 --> 02:13:07,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And my husband and I have been here 57 years.

1706
02:13:07,808 --> 02:13:10,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 82, 83 years of age.

1707
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:16,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, we don't have too many problems with our mobility, but who's to say?

1708
02:13:19,732 --> 02:13:25,360
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a driveway and we have loaned it to neighbors when they've had parties.

1709
02:13:26,101 --> 02:13:32,229
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I am in agreement with all my neighbors about this whole parking situation.

1710
02:13:32,329 --> 02:13:36,474
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been even inconvenience for me with the driveway because

1711
02:13:37,649 --> 02:13:43,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tree service that comes periodically to do my 200-year-old oak in my back tree.

1712
02:13:44,474 --> 02:13:51,840
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to park in front of my house somewhat and bring his long hose in, and he couldn't do it a few weeks ago.

1713
02:13:51,860 --> 02:14:00,026
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to come back a couple of weeks later when they were able to find a parking space, because some of my neighbors had moved their cars or whatever.

1714
02:14:00,046 --> 02:14:05,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And being on the odd side of the street, which is where all the cars are parked,

1715
02:14:06,563 --> 02:14:14,446
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't pack across the street to bring this long hose and because it would have been right in the way of traffic for cars coming down the street.

1716
02:14:15,026 --> 02:14:18,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another issue with any type of service trucks.

1717
02:14:18,068 --> 02:14:18,848
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come by.

1718
02:14:18,868 --> 02:14:23,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this particular instance happened right away within 2 weeks of.

1719
02:14:24,296 --> 02:14:27,319
[SPEAKER_00]: the traffic commission saying that we had to park on one side.

1720
02:14:27,339 --> 02:14:32,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are something I wouldn't even been thinking about until it happened.

1721
02:14:33,704 --> 02:14:35,486
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something to consider also.

1722
02:14:35,646 --> 02:14:38,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we cannot park on the sidewalk.

1723
02:14:38,088 --> 02:14:43,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a law, it's a federal law, it's a state law, a city law, whatever, but we've been doing it for years.

1724
02:14:45,198 --> 02:14:48,659
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't seemed to really hurt anyone, even the traffic.

1725
02:14:49,059 --> 02:14:54,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone from the traffic unit mentioned that traffic emergency vehicles couldn't get down.

1726
02:14:54,801 --> 02:15:04,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had a few emergency vehicles on the street, and they seem to get down here very fine with their police cars, fire trucks, whatever.

1727
02:15:04,964 --> 02:15:06,905
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one here just a couple of years ago.

1728
02:15:07,205 --> 02:15:09,846
[SPEAKER_00]: LaVerita can attest to that, when her husband was sick.

1729
02:15:11,796 --> 02:15:14,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's really the main issue.

1730
02:15:14,318 --> 02:15:23,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people, when they park on the sidewalk, they park far enough on the sidewalk to give the street the width that these emergency trucks do need.

1731
02:15:23,805 --> 02:15:31,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we could park on the sidewalk, you could tell everyone, you have to park this far up to make the street wide enough for emergency vehicles.

1732
02:15:32,412 --> 02:15:34,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can allow us to do that.

1733
02:15:34,493 --> 02:15:38,997
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something to consider because I am not happy about this whole situation either.

1734
02:15:39,017 --> 02:15:40,318
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening.

1735
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:41,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1736
02:15:47,521 --> 02:15:48,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else in the public?

1737
02:15:48,622 --> 02:15:54,943
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any comments, just raise your hand or type in the chat.

1738
02:15:56,523 --> 02:16:00,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Pass it back to the commissioners.

1739
02:16:01,704 --> 02:16:02,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say something?

1740
02:16:04,755 --> 02:16:13,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief Covino, I just want to say to the residents down there, gone is the day when the chief of police could say, don't worry about it, park on the sidewalk, you won't get tagged.

1741
02:16:14,423 --> 02:16:17,505
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, that is out of the question for us now.

1742
02:16:18,066 --> 02:16:24,511
[SPEAKER_16]: And what many of you don't know, as Sergeant Rogers said, we received many complaints about cars being parked on the sidewalk.

1743
02:16:24,911 --> 02:16:29,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether they're legitimate complaints about not being able to get by or not, we're not there to judge that.

1744
02:16:30,335 --> 02:16:33,217
[SPEAKER_16]: But the law does say we can't park on the sidewalks.

1745
02:16:35,162 --> 02:16:40,438
[SPEAKER_16]: those people that are hindered by it in some way have a valid complaint even though

1746
02:16:41,530 --> 02:16:43,051
[SPEAKER_16]: As you say, there is space there.

1747
02:16:43,611 --> 02:16:52,134
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Mr. McGiven would tell you, there's eventually going to be a problem with the deterioration of those sidewalks with cars parking on them.

1748
02:16:52,494 --> 02:16:57,055
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know you've been doing it a long time, and some areas have deterioration, some areas don't.

1749
02:16:57,095 --> 02:16:58,956
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is a true fact.

1750
02:16:59,056 --> 02:17:04,238
[SPEAKER_16]: But I know last week, I mean, last month, I spoke up to try to give us some time.

1751
02:17:05,558 --> 02:17:09,920
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were told back then it was usually four or five cars parked on the sidewalk.

1752
02:17:11,493 --> 02:17:13,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we did our due diligence.

1753
02:17:13,114 --> 02:17:13,795
[SPEAKER_16]: We worked hard.

1754
02:17:13,935 --> 02:17:19,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Blake did a lot of work along with Sergeant Canava about measuring spaces and counting spaces.

1755
02:17:20,419 --> 02:17:27,023
[SPEAKER_16]: They've come up with a maximum number that will give us two more than just saying, okay, you can park on one side or the other.

1756
02:17:30,085 --> 02:17:37,108
[SPEAKER_16]: all the chances of us saying, okay, park on that sidewalk, even if we put a stripe on it, too, is not going to happen.

1757
02:17:37,308 --> 02:17:38,508
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sorry for that.

1758
02:17:38,628 --> 02:17:47,572
[SPEAKER_16]: But the the fact is that we've come to a time where, unless more people want to speak about this from the public, that's fine.

1759
02:17:47,972 --> 02:17:50,733
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have come to a time where we're getting ready to vote on this.

1760
02:17:51,093 --> 02:17:54,895
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just wanted to say that, you know, in years past when Chief

1761
02:17:55,295 --> 02:18:17,630
[SPEAKER_16]: was able to say don't worry about it most certainly can't be done in today's day and age and we do have to address the issues the legitimate complaints that may not seem legitimate to you who are residents there but they are legitimate to people other people who live there that are not speaking and other people that traverse up and down that street so now our goal is to was to try and give us

1762
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:19,671
[SPEAKER_16]: maximum parking on that street.

1763
02:18:20,671 --> 02:18:24,573
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think Mr. Blake's plan with staggered parking does do that.

1764
02:18:25,133 --> 02:18:30,796
[SPEAKER_16]: And secondly, it slows down what we learned at last month's meeting that there was many people speeding up down that street.

1765
02:18:30,836 --> 02:18:34,778
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would slow down traffic as well and allow everybody to get by safely.

1766
02:18:35,298 --> 02:18:39,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know there are two conversations going here, it seems.

1767
02:18:39,981 --> 02:18:44,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And many of you are saying, no, there's never a problem with emergency vehicles getting down the street.

1768
02:18:44,323 --> 02:18:46,484
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is because cars were parked

1769
02:18:47,264 --> 02:19:05,326
[SPEAKER_16]: on one side and cars on the other side were on the sidewalk and unfortunately it's been put upon us to have to eliminate that parking on the sidewalk situation and I think you know we've come up with the best plan possible here until somehow the city can get money to

1770
02:19:06,147 --> 02:19:11,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Cut curbs in so we can add more parking on one side, but we don't have it right now.

1771
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:20,835
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, that's something that, you know, maybe in the future of someday we'll be on a list of those types of enhancements and we'll get there.

1772
02:19:20,955 --> 02:19:21,055
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

1773
02:19:21,695 --> 02:19:22,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not off the table, chief.

1774
02:19:23,056 --> 02:19:31,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not off the table, but I'll tell you, this part of Medford has a lot of pavement and one of the issues that we have in front of us is like heat island effect and also stormwater issues.

1775
02:19:32,522 --> 02:19:42,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of benefits to the city to look at streets like this one and figure out what the sidewalk should be, put the curb in the proper place, as I kind of alluded to last time.

1776
02:19:42,108 --> 02:19:43,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's definitely not off the table.

1777
02:19:43,949 --> 02:19:45,610
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, we obviously have to follow the law.

1778
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:46,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1779
02:19:46,971 --> 02:19:49,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know about this and it's one of those things.

1780
02:19:49,472 --> 02:19:51,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It will go on a list and we know about it.

1781
02:19:52,014 --> 02:19:54,536
[SPEAKER_04]: We just can't promise anything in the relative near future.

1782
02:19:55,357 --> 02:19:55,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1783
02:19:55,657 --> 02:19:56,458
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

1784
02:19:56,558 --> 02:20:02,341
[SPEAKER_16]: And I apologize for the last situation with Osborne Road where I didn't have the proper information as far as data goes.

1785
02:20:02,401 --> 02:20:14,987
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, that's another scenario where we have to make the best decision possible today or soon to make things safer for the public until we can come up with a more permanent solution.

1786
02:20:15,187 --> 02:20:16,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1787
02:20:16,587 --> 02:20:17,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't like motioning.

1788
02:20:17,528 --> 02:20:20,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I would motion, but I don't like motioning on when Todd brings stuff to the table.

1789
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would support this for sure.

1790
02:20:25,013 --> 02:20:27,054
[SPEAKER_08]: We just have two more people from the public.

1791
02:20:29,414 --> 02:20:39,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the commissioners, just asking you to unmute.

1792
02:20:40,037 --> 02:20:40,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1793
02:20:40,978 --> 02:20:41,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark, good evening.

1794
02:20:43,038 --> 02:20:43,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1795
02:20:44,539 --> 02:20:46,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'd like to also speak up.

1796
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:52,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Since they not parking on both sides, it's been like a speedway here.

1797
02:20:53,483 --> 02:20:57,865
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one of those speed things, and it's red all the time.

1798
02:20:57,945 --> 02:20:59,506
[SPEAKER_07]: People are flying down the street.

1799
02:21:00,506 --> 02:21:04,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And speed has been a problem on this street in the 45 years I've lived here.

1800
02:21:04,828 --> 02:21:13,352
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the side-to-side staggered parking, I hope it would help.

1801
02:21:15,893 --> 02:21:19,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, the studies show that, you know,

1802
02:21:20,946 --> 02:21:34,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing in speeding and enforcement is perfect, but staggered parking, the studies show that it does slow vehicles down due to their eyesight and vehicles being on each side.

1803
02:21:34,318 --> 02:21:40,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But nothing's perfect, and I know there'll be down times where vehicles won't be parked on either side and may open up some areas.

1804
02:21:40,923 --> 02:21:43,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, that's the lower end of this.

1805
02:21:46,050 --> 02:21:52,194
[SPEAKER_08]: It should lower the speeds for vehicles traveling on this road.

1806
02:21:52,955 --> 02:21:54,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly hope it helps.

1807
02:21:55,977 --> 02:21:56,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously.

1808
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:03,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, we'll go back to you as well to ask you to unmute.

1809
02:22:04,723 --> 02:22:06,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had a question.

1810
02:22:06,104 --> 02:22:12,268
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens in the winter when you're only allowed to park on one side of the street?

1811
02:22:16,161 --> 02:22:21,263
[SPEAKER_08]: the city starts obviously in which the year of the winter starts.

1812
02:22:21,303 --> 02:22:24,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So this year obviously it would be odd side parking.

1813
02:22:24,204 --> 02:22:26,905
[SPEAKER_08]: You're saying the other side just be completely eliminated?

1814
02:22:28,066 --> 02:22:28,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1815
02:22:28,386 --> 02:22:32,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Like are we going to have the whole street back again to park during the winter?

1816
02:22:32,148 --> 02:22:35,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would assume that.

1817
02:22:35,829 --> 02:22:38,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we're going to lose more parking on top of it.

1818
02:22:41,311 --> 02:22:44,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you never had the parking there anyways.

1819
02:22:45,706 --> 02:22:54,830
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're parking on the odd side there for this, this winter, for an example, you would be able to park on the odd side and next year will be the even side, just like every other.

1820
02:22:55,791 --> 02:23:05,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Public way, but then, but, but so it hasn't changed, but the other time of the year, we can only pack in certain spots on on 1 side.

1821
02:23:05,256 --> 02:23:07,337
[SPEAKER_13]: So now, don't you think that's going to confuse people now?

1822
02:23:07,737 --> 02:23:15,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Because now, at certain times of the year, you can park on the whole side of the street, but on other times of the year, you can only pack on certain spots on that side of the street.

1823
02:23:15,921 --> 02:23:16,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1824
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:17,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that might be confusing.

1825
02:23:17,582 --> 02:23:19,303
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all need the same.

1826
02:23:20,465 --> 02:23:22,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be the same as what you experienced today.

1827
02:23:22,226 --> 02:23:25,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So odd or even during the winter, that's the side you park on.

1828
02:23:26,029 --> 02:23:29,152
[SPEAKER_04]: We plow straight line down your road against the other curb line.

1829
02:23:29,632 --> 02:23:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will stay the same.

1830
02:23:31,488 --> 02:23:36,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, but aren't you going to have signs saying no parking on certain spots on both sides?

1831
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:41,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, but you're talking to the people that enforce those rules.

1832
02:23:41,311 --> 02:23:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So, during a snow emergency, you'd be allowed to park on 1 side because the reason that it's chicaned like that is to balance the idea of having availability for parking on both sides for residents.

1833
02:23:56,495 --> 02:23:59,337
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as the two spaces, that was nice, and slowing folks down.

1834
02:23:59,917 --> 02:24:06,802
[SPEAKER_04]: In the wintertime during a snow emergency, there's no reason to leave spaces between parked cars in that parking lane.

1835
02:24:07,162 --> 02:24:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure the police would agree with me.

1836
02:24:08,663 --> 02:24:15,007
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to clear the snow, so we're gonna want Pearl Street to park on whatever the parking site is for that year.

1837
02:24:15,027 --> 02:24:20,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll roll call that along with the city and if people need, no.

1838
02:24:21,211 --> 02:24:23,133
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's that we need.

1839
02:24:24,219 --> 02:24:24,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

1840
02:24:24,759 --> 02:24:29,502
[SPEAKER_20]: I can just remind people like, cause I remember the parking in Medford where it was the whole winter.

1841
02:24:29,963 --> 02:24:31,544
[SPEAKER_20]: You had to park on one side of the street.

1842
02:24:32,004 --> 02:24:41,950
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'll just remind everybody, it's not, it's literally from like a few hours around when the snow starts falling until a few hours after the snow stops falling.

1843
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:45,152
[SPEAKER_20]: We're talking about, are these, are these windows of time?

1844
02:24:45,633 --> 02:24:48,534
[SPEAKER_20]: It's they're brief and they're just a couple in the winter time.

1845
02:24:48,654 --> 02:24:49,395
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like,

1846
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:51,944
[SPEAKER_20]: For months or anything, I get that.

1847
02:24:51,984 --> 02:24:54,208
[SPEAKER_20]: But when you live here, you have to deal with that.

1848
02:24:54,328 --> 02:24:55,971
[SPEAKER_13]: So it will concern us.

1849
02:24:56,051 --> 02:24:56,873
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't concern you.

1850
02:24:57,475 --> 02:25:13,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single street has nuances, I assure you, and we do the best to listen to those nuances and take them into consideration, whether it's where the windrow is, a handicapped spot, issues with plucking sight lines with piles.

1851
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:18,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single winter we deal with it, and I'm sure we can deal with your issues as well if they come up.

1852
02:25:23,803 --> 02:25:25,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that's my kids.

1853
02:25:27,328 --> 02:25:27,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1854
02:25:31,729 --> 02:25:41,771
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are no other questions, I'll pass it back to the commissioners and.

1855
02:25:42,332 --> 02:25:46,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't want to motion.

1856
02:25:46,472 --> 02:25:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to not motion first motion things on things that Todd brings, but I'm in support of this and we'll vote for it.

1857
02:25:52,994 --> 02:25:53,454
[SPEAKER_24]: I motion.

1858
02:25:58,024 --> 02:25:58,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second it.

1859
02:25:59,624 --> 02:26:10,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt for second proposal here for additional parking, which would be two spots.

1860
02:26:10,848 --> 02:26:13,688
[SPEAKER_08]: You got that Alba?

1861
02:26:13,728 --> 02:26:14,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go to work forward.

1862
02:26:15,049 --> 02:26:15,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1863
02:26:16,769 --> 02:26:17,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner McGiven?

1864
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:18,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1865
02:26:19,290 --> 02:26:20,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Hunt?

1866
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:21,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1867
02:26:21,751 --> 02:26:22,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Silva?

1868
02:26:23,171 --> 02:26:23,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1869
02:26:24,011 --> 02:26:24,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Covino?

1870
02:26:25,051 --> 02:26:25,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1871
02:26:26,172 --> 02:26:26,792
[SPEAKER_11]: One absent.

1872
02:26:27,678 --> 02:26:29,279
[SPEAKER_11]: 4 in the affirmative, 1 absent.

1873
02:26:29,299 --> 02:26:30,400
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1874
02:26:32,441 --> 02:26:37,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I appreciate everybody's time and attendance here and.

1875
02:26:39,066 --> 02:26:41,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1876
02:26:43,009 --> 02:26:45,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Lori, I'll just going to ask you on mute.

1877
02:26:45,630 --> 02:26:49,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you.

1878
02:26:49,373 --> 02:26:50,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have a question.

1879
02:26:50,994 --> 02:26:55,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So, is this effective immediately and will you be painting?

1880
02:26:56,985 --> 02:27:03,374
[SPEAKER_10]: those parking spaces now, or is this just going to, how is this going to work?

1881
02:27:06,943 --> 02:27:08,204
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes some time.

1882
02:27:08,564 --> 02:27:10,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Tim may have hopped off.

1883
02:27:10,645 --> 02:27:16,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes some time from the meeting to when the meeting minutes get cleared and everything gets communicated to the right folks.

1884
02:27:18,510 --> 02:27:19,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to take some time.

1885
02:27:19,691 --> 02:27:21,052
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be immediately tomorrow.

1886
02:27:22,052 --> 02:27:31,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And then likely, my understanding would be the signs would likely go up first to help delineate with arrows where it's allowed, where it's not.

1887
02:27:32,299 --> 02:27:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And then likely follow up with the paints.

1888
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:35,821
[SPEAKER_05]: the paints a little more.

1889
02:27:36,481 --> 02:27:41,624
[SPEAKER_05]: It may involve third parties to schedule, whereas the signs are internal.

1890
02:27:42,504 --> 02:27:43,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1891
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:47,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So best guess would be like maybe a month or so.

1892
02:27:47,587 --> 02:27:48,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1893
02:27:49,188 --> 02:27:51,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And can I just ask Tim a question?

1894
02:27:54,190 --> 02:27:58,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, you said will possibly be put on a list.

1895
02:27:59,433 --> 02:28:02,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you make sure that Pearl Street would be on that list if the

1896
02:28:03,641 --> 02:28:05,472
[SPEAKER_10]: sidewalks are ever done over.

1897
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:10,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll make sure that it's on a list somewhere.

1898
02:28:10,641 --> 02:28:11,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It might already be.

1899
02:28:11,461 --> 02:28:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of streets out there where we know the curb line is kind of set wrong.

1900
02:28:17,283 --> 02:28:18,103
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be one of them.

1901
02:28:19,123 --> 02:28:22,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll take a look at it, see what we have.

1902
02:28:23,284 --> 02:28:26,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not, I'll make sure that it is somewhere on the list.

1903
02:28:26,185 --> 02:28:32,186
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a whole survey of all of our sidewalks a number of years ago and have a large amount of data.

1904
02:28:32,206 --> 02:28:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm saying it that way.

1905
02:28:33,266 --> 02:28:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It most likely is categorized in a place where it should be.

1906
02:28:37,107 --> 02:28:39,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll confirm that for you.

1907
02:28:39,188 --> 02:28:40,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you so much.

1908
02:28:40,368 --> 02:28:48,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1909
02:28:49,832 --> 02:28:50,332
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1910
02:28:50,372 --> 02:28:54,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Alicia, you wanted to take off?

1911
02:28:54,793 --> 02:28:56,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1912
02:28:57,094 --> 02:28:58,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just not seeing which number it is.

1913
02:28:58,394 --> 02:28:58,434
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-19-81.

1914
02:28:58,455 --> 02:28:58,515
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-19-81.

1915
02:28:58,815 --> 02:28:59,675
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one on table.

1916
02:29:07,097 --> 02:29:12,179
[SPEAKER_20]: It's actually 2019-81-81, commercial vehicle rules and regulations.

1917
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:24,024
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to point out to any members of the public who may be watching, the 2019 is the lead implies that this was an item that first went on this agenda in 2019.

1918
02:29:27,005 --> 02:29:30,626
[SPEAKER_20]: So motion to move this off the table to discuss this year.

1919
02:29:32,467 --> 02:29:33,047
[SPEAKER_08]: It's second.

1920
02:29:36,885 --> 02:29:40,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, Tim needs to be made a co-host again, so he can unmute himself.

1921
02:29:40,346 --> 02:29:40,466
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1922
02:29:40,486 --> 02:29:43,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1923
02:29:45,026 --> 02:29:46,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim, you should be all set.

1924
02:29:50,788 --> 02:29:51,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1925
02:29:51,388 --> 02:29:51,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1926
02:29:53,448 --> 02:29:53,748
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, great.

1927
02:29:54,388 --> 02:29:59,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're pulling 2019-21 clarification for a product by the middle of January.

1928
02:30:01,009 --> 02:30:02,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So Alicia, the floor is yours.

1929
02:30:04,712 --> 02:30:24,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes so we had discussed this recently and we had asked to that we wanted we've gotten a lot of requests for commercial apartment parking and a lot of the requests seemed kind of reasonable but against the rules in Medford and the rules needed to be changed rather than us just starting to issue variances on this

1930
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:31,263
[SPEAKER_20]: So we both asked Sarah if she could come up, Director McDermott, if she could come up with a proposal.

1931
02:30:31,803 --> 02:30:36,486
[SPEAKER_20]: And I had an intern do a bunch of research on other communities, what their rules were.

1932
02:30:37,606 --> 02:30:47,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And at this time, I can't remember if I circulated, I think I circulated that research to everybody, but I at least sent it to Sarah to use in her formulating of a proposal for us.

1933
02:30:47,891 --> 02:30:51,553
[SPEAKER_20]: And so my thought for this evening was to not put any undue pressure on anybody,

1934
02:30:52,054 --> 02:31:11,668
[SPEAKER_20]: but that we could discuss her proposal and if maybe we wanted to tweak it or whatever, but then to put it out to the public and ask the public to prepare to comment on it and to provide public comment on it possibly for our September meeting with the concept that maybe at that time we'd be prepared to vote.

1935
02:31:12,368 --> 02:31:16,550
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually think that this is something that has a lot of nuances to it.

1936
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:21,852
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we absolutely need public comment and warning to the public that it's gonna be on the agenda.

1937
02:31:22,612 --> 02:31:31,936
[SPEAKER_20]: But I thought it would be helpful for us to sort of discuss it a little bit and see what, put something out for the public to consider.

1938
02:31:32,656 --> 02:31:33,937
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's my thought this evening.

1939
02:31:34,831 --> 02:31:43,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, if everybody's okay with that, then maybe, um, Sarah, I don't know if you make more sense for you to explain or present what you had proposed.

1940
02:31:45,199 --> 02:31:45,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1941
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm, I'm happy to do that.

1942
02:31:46,941 --> 02:31:58,070
[SPEAKER_14]: And Alicia, I'm, I'm pretty sure you did circulate that study to everybody, but even if you hadn't, I included it to in an email, um, when I sent this out on June 6th.

1943
02:31:58,530 --> 02:32:00,972
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was accessible to everybody.

1944
02:32:00,992 --> 02:32:01,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

1945
02:32:03,698 --> 02:32:09,062
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't do you want me to share my screen so you can just read the document.

1946
02:32:17,969 --> 02:32:18,270
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1947
02:32:18,570 --> 02:32:20,191
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is what I sent out.

1948
02:32:20,932 --> 02:32:27,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly I have no commitment to any of these specific things.

1949
02:32:27,397 --> 02:32:31,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I base this entirely on what Alicia's intern

1950
02:32:31,738 --> 02:32:45,407
[SPEAKER_14]: found from other cities and what we've had seen for requests most recently since I started to allow some of those folks who've seemed like a reasonable requester to maybe get something for their vehicle.

1951
02:32:46,968 --> 02:32:57,995
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I propose, I'll make it a little bigger, is to allow for the sale of a permit for commercial vehicles meeting specific criteria.

1952
02:32:59,053 --> 02:33:04,175
[SPEAKER_14]: 1st vehicle registered garage address must be Medford that applies to all permits that we sell.

1953
02:33:05,035 --> 02:33:09,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, as far as resident to residents, a vehicle must be registered to the business.

1954
02:33:10,737 --> 02:33:12,497
[SPEAKER_14]: For which the, uh.

1955
02:33:13,518 --> 02:33:14,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Commercial plates.

1956
02:33:16,196 --> 02:33:19,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Proof of residence required of the permit requester.

1957
02:33:20,619 --> 02:33:24,362
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the same threshold that we require for resident permits.

1958
02:33:24,922 --> 02:33:30,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Employer must verify in a company letterhead that the vehicle will be driven by the employee seeking the permit.

1959
02:33:31,688 --> 02:33:43,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Vehicle must fall within the vehicle size and marking requirements of the existing ordinance and limit one per household per single family home or per unit apartment or condo unit.

1960
02:33:44,333 --> 02:33:48,235
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also added a couple of questions whether this should.

1961
02:33:49,417 --> 02:33:58,284
[SPEAKER_14]: just be for overnight parking or for 24-7 parking because there are different rules during the daytime for commercial vehicles.

1962
02:33:58,584 --> 02:34:13,014
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the towns, maybe it might have been more than one, but at least one made the employer who owned the vehicle verify that the employee was the only one allowed to drive that car.

1963
02:34:13,675 --> 02:34:16,357
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something to consider as well if we want to implement that.

1964
02:34:17,767 --> 02:34:23,649
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what I threw out there, and I'm not committed to any part of it.

1965
02:34:23,669 --> 02:34:26,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And can you clarify something?

1966
02:34:27,571 --> 02:34:32,433
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm making an assumption, and I want to check my assumption, if you don't mind.

1967
02:34:33,022 --> 02:34:55,287
[SPEAKER_20]: And that assumption is that one, because commercial vehicles are not allowed to park overnight anywhere in Medford, that this would be a permit that you may say live on a street that doesn't have permit parking, but you would still need a permit because it's a commercial vehicle, right?

1968
02:34:55,367 --> 02:35:02,288
[SPEAKER_20]: So that like you live up in North Medford, there's no permit parking in a lot of those streets, you would still need

1969
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:05,352
[SPEAKER_20]: a permit to park overnight.

1970
02:35:05,692 --> 02:35:07,454
[SPEAKER_20]: If you had it, you wouldn't be ticketed.

1971
02:35:07,474 --> 02:35:23,126
[SPEAKER_20]: And the corollary to that is, are we envisioning that it would be on this street-by-street basis like we have for most of our residents, or would this just allow you to park it in Medford?

1972
02:35:23,146 --> 02:35:30,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I might imagine that you might one day park it at your business and one day park it at your home, or your home might be your business.

1973
02:35:32,550 --> 02:35:33,531
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I considered that.

1974
02:35:33,571 --> 02:35:39,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I didn't imagine them parking anybody who gets one of these parking outside of their own streets.

1975
02:35:39,694 --> 02:35:49,759
[SPEAKER_14]: But so yes to it being issued, or at least my intent was for it to be issued to anybody on any street, whether it's a permitted street or not.

1976
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:54,922
[SPEAKER_14]: As long as obviously it's not a private way, we don't really, we can't really sell them permits.

1977
02:35:56,623 --> 02:35:59,505
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as,

1978
02:36:01,133 --> 02:36:15,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Throughout the whole city, I don't think it's my intent was not to give them access to the whole city, just to their street, because the reasonable requests that we've received, or the ones I deemed reasonable wanted to park at their home.

1979
02:36:15,821 --> 02:36:19,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Overnight, not park in square, not part, but.

1980
02:36:20,710 --> 02:36:32,618
[SPEAKER_14]: If there is an occasion where there's them wanting to park at their business, I would think they'd have parking at their business potentially to utilize that's not public.

1981
02:36:33,419 --> 02:36:33,699
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

1982
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:36,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1983
02:36:36,061 --> 02:36:42,785
[SPEAKER_20]: And could they, in theory, so like picture this, you live in North Medford, you have a car registered to your business.

1984
02:36:43,225 --> 02:36:45,447
[SPEAKER_20]: You park it on your street in North Medford.

1985
02:36:45,687 --> 02:36:48,469
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to drive to work, which is in West Medford.

1986
02:36:48,902 --> 02:36:54,626
[SPEAKER_20]: you could get a business parking permit, park in the business permit spots in West Medford.

1987
02:36:54,646 --> 02:36:55,867
[SPEAKER_20]: So you might have both, right?

1988
02:36:55,927 --> 02:37:02,492
[SPEAKER_20]: I assume we have people who have resident permit parking in South Medford and business permit parking on the same vehicle.

1989
02:37:03,813 --> 02:37:04,693
[SPEAKER_14]: That's very possible.

1990
02:37:04,733 --> 02:37:12,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not, I can't say off the top of my head that I know of that, but I mean, they're welcome to purchase both if they qualify for both.

1991
02:37:12,519 --> 02:37:12,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1992
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:14,660
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an either or situation.

1993
02:37:15,141 --> 02:37:15,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1994
02:37:16,149 --> 02:37:31,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So this probably well, that's part of that's 1 of my questions, though, is would this if we're going to allow them to park 24 7 with this, because as if I'm not mistaken, I believe the commercial vehicles during the daytime are allowed to park for an hour.

1995
02:37:32,848 --> 02:37:38,231
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they're on a residential street that requires a permit, they still need to display a visitor pass.

1996
02:37:38,431 --> 02:37:40,552
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, you have work being done at your home.

1997
02:37:40,712 --> 02:37:41,412
[SPEAKER_14]: They get an hour.

1998
02:37:41,713 --> 02:37:42,793
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to have the pass in.

1999
02:37:43,533 --> 02:37:44,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so this.

2000
02:37:45,294 --> 02:37:47,656
[SPEAKER_09]: They have 8 hours.

2001
02:37:47,976 --> 02:37:52,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Sarah, Sarah, if they're working, they're working, they're allowed to park there.

2002
02:37:52,698 --> 02:37:55,900
[SPEAKER_16]: While they're working the 1 hour is a break.

2003
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:57,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, if somebody comes home on a lunch break.

2004
02:37:58,281 --> 02:38:02,784
[SPEAKER_16]: With a work truck, they're in theory, what was supposed to be, they would have an hour to park.

2005
02:38:02,844 --> 02:38:03,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2006
02:38:03,585 --> 02:38:05,546
[SPEAKER_16]: In front of their house, right?

2007
02:38:09,291 --> 02:38:27,919
[SPEAKER_16]: I was, Sergeant and I, Sergeant Rogers, were both around when this ordinance came, and I was, I disagreed with it, and I didn't like the way it was worded, and it is very vague in some areas, but that's the way it was determined, that you have one hour to park in front of your home only for a break, like lunch.

2008
02:38:28,459 --> 02:38:34,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, if you're working at that home, you can park there for the day, for eight hours, or whatever the work time is.

2009
02:38:36,637 --> 02:38:39,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it says that.

2010
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:47,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I only say that because I'm not sure if my enforcement staff is basing their enforcement on what's written on this ordinance.

2011
02:38:48,227 --> 02:38:52,891
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it says anywhere that they're allowed to be there for eight hours.

2012
02:38:53,331 --> 02:38:56,914
[SPEAKER_16]: It says they're allowed to be there while working at a property.

2013
02:38:57,175 --> 02:38:58,556
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't have a timeframe on it.

2014
02:38:59,136 --> 02:39:03,100
[SPEAKER_16]: But if they're home on a break, they're only allowed to park there for an hour.

2015
02:39:03,947 --> 02:39:06,388
[SPEAKER_20]: How would, how would it be if we know the difference?

2016
02:39:06,428 --> 02:39:07,968
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why it's not a good ordinance.

2017
02:39:08,488 --> 02:39:09,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2018
02:39:09,589 --> 02:39:12,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I, for one, am all in favor for what you're talking about.

2019
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:13,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2020
02:39:15,631 --> 02:39:22,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially due to the fact that many people in the city are blue collar workers that have work vehicles to take home with them.

2021
02:39:23,133 --> 02:39:31,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, I always thought that 1 hour was a little bit short of amount of time for somebody doing a job, but, um,

2022
02:39:32,070 --> 02:39:49,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the ordinance you're looking at has been re-updated so many times that the wording was changed on it, but going back to the day when that came out, that was, you know, we had discussions about it here in the police department about enforcement, and this is what we're stuck with, so.

2023
02:39:50,796 --> 02:39:53,617
[SPEAKER_20]: Sarah, I don't really, I'm not familiar with that.

2024
02:39:53,697 --> 02:39:57,039
[SPEAKER_20]: Could you circulate that to the rest of the commission?

2025
02:39:57,559 --> 02:40:00,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, it's on the web somewhere.

2026
02:40:01,446 --> 02:40:02,568
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on our website.

2027
02:40:02,768 --> 02:40:08,918
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the parking website right here under commercial overnight parking prohibited on the right hand side.

2028
02:40:08,938 --> 02:40:09,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2029
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:10,501
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll look at it.

2030
02:40:13,053 --> 02:40:32,379
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other thing, when that ordinance was enacted because we did have an overnight commercial prohibited ordinance, then this one came out and it was supposed to be a 24 hour ordinance of no parking commercial vehicles other than those doing work at a establishment, a house or business in the city.

2031
02:40:32,939 --> 02:40:35,020
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the one hour rule came into play.

2032
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:41,402
[SPEAKER_16]: So someone who may be working can drive the truck home and park for an hour to go on a lunch or whatever it is.

2033
02:40:43,435 --> 02:40:51,698
[SPEAKER_14]: But if they're doing that and they're supposed to have a permit on their street, if they don't put a permit in that car, they would get a ticket still.

2034
02:40:51,958 --> 02:40:55,399
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's imperfect as well, unless they have a visitor pass.

2035
02:40:55,539 --> 02:40:59,201
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're not supposed to use your visitor pass if you're not a visitor and you live there.

2036
02:40:59,621 --> 02:41:01,982
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a disconnect there as well.

2037
02:41:02,642 --> 02:41:06,623
[SPEAKER_16]: A close personal friend of Sergeant Rogers was instrumental in bringing this together.

2038
02:41:06,663 --> 02:41:11,285
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll shut my mouth after that.

2039
02:41:13,935 --> 02:41:20,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Commissioners, again, why this was adopted, we had a problem on Ellis Ave.

2040
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:25,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Ellis Ave, where there were eight taxi cabs parking.

2041
02:41:27,251 --> 02:41:29,133
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why this was formed.

2042
02:41:31,836 --> 02:41:33,659
[SPEAKER_09]: He was not a good friend of mine.

2043
02:41:34,148 --> 02:41:39,711
[SPEAKER_20]: As I say, this feels like maybe there was a hammer used when we could have used a scalpel.

2044
02:41:40,911 --> 02:41:42,412
[SPEAKER_20]: This is neither here nor there.

2045
02:41:43,092 --> 02:41:57,839
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that people took action, but we've all heard some very reasonable reasons why people should be allowed to park a reasonably sized commercial vehicle at their home overnight.

2046
02:41:58,773 --> 02:42:03,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, which is sort of why I was really a proponent of seeing something.

2047
02:42:04,756 --> 02:42:20,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I, if, if the, I'm a little nervous about the whole, like only in front of your house, but then if we have zones, right, like if the person lives in the G zone, it shouldn't be like part of their G the G zone.

2048
02:42:20,804 --> 02:42:21,044
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

2049
02:42:21,084 --> 02:42:27,307
[SPEAKER_20]: If we eventually have other zones, you know, how is it in my mind, if you are driving this vehicle,

2050
02:42:27,817 --> 02:42:28,737
[SPEAKER_20]: to and from work.

2051
02:42:29,438 --> 02:42:38,541
[SPEAKER_20]: And I honestly, I'm not really familiar with lengths and sizes and stuff like that of vehicles.

2052
02:42:38,621 --> 02:42:41,763
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not my expertise.

2053
02:42:42,043 --> 02:42:48,525
[SPEAKER_20]: But somebody has a sedan or an SUV, you know, they have a personal one, or they have one that's owned by their business.

2054
02:42:48,646 --> 02:42:49,706
[SPEAKER_20]: And particularly when

2055
02:42:50,527 --> 02:42:53,689
[SPEAKER_20]: their business, you know, that is their own vehicle.

2056
02:42:53,749 --> 02:42:55,170
[SPEAKER_20]: They own the business, right?

2057
02:42:55,551 --> 02:42:59,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, why shouldn't they be able to park this vehicle on the street in front of their house?

2058
02:43:00,234 --> 02:43:07,820
[SPEAKER_20]: And I particularly have sympathy for people who live in areas where there's no permit parking and there's plenty of space for these vehicles.

2059
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:15,726
[SPEAKER_20]: And they get ticketed because somebody in the area complains that there's a commercial vehicle parking overnight.

2060
02:43:19,368 --> 02:43:27,471
[SPEAKER_08]: To kind of piggyback on this, I agree with this, but the other issue that I'd love to tag into this is 48 hour violations.

2061
02:43:29,131 --> 02:43:39,234
[SPEAKER_08]: We have looked at this multiple times and similar to Sarah looking at this, we are one of the only cities that do 48 hour violations.

2062
02:43:39,394 --> 02:43:48,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Every other city does 72 hours to accommodate residents in their city for going away on the weekend

2063
02:43:49,052 --> 02:43:54,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And leaving on a Friday, we are the only city that does a 48 hour piggyback on that.

2064
02:43:54,594 --> 02:44:04,037
[SPEAKER_08]: We get an abundance of phone calls, neighbors or whatnot that are using this $40 violation as a way to get back at their neighbors.

2065
02:44:05,238 --> 02:44:12,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't love the 48 hour, but I'd love to tag it along with our parking rules and regulations on top of this.

2066
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that needs to go to council, but.

2067
02:44:14,761 --> 02:44:16,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a good idea.

2068
02:44:16,601 --> 02:44:17,882
[SPEAKER_08]: 48 hour violation is not a,

2069
02:44:19,066 --> 02:44:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: rule that i mean sergeant rogers and chief cabino can kind of attest here we're getting these calls as a neighbor calling on another neighbor and i'm not a huge fan of us towing or tagging i don't believe we should be towing any vehicle that is parked on their own street for a 48 hour or a 72 hour violation that is ridiculous in my eyes

2070
02:44:42,145 --> 02:44:44,507
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think I 100% agree with you.

2071
02:44:44,707 --> 02:44:51,351
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just think that we should just write that up and submit it to Alva as another item for our agenda.

2072
02:44:51,792 --> 02:44:54,213
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be happy to see it on the September agenda.

2073
02:44:54,613 --> 02:45:01,498
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanna not confuse them and then get one delayed because the other one gets bogged down for some reason.

2074
02:45:01,798 --> 02:45:03,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put that as a separate item.

2075
02:45:03,319 --> 02:45:05,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way we- Gordon, is that an ordinance?

2076
02:45:05,861 --> 02:45:06,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

2077
02:45:07,062 --> 02:45:10,124
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a 48 hour ordinance that was also from

2078
02:45:11,487 --> 02:45:13,348
[SPEAKER_08]: the time when Sergeant Rogers first got on here in 1978.

2079
02:45:13,468 --> 02:45:19,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an ordinance that might be outside of our purview.

2080
02:45:19,749 --> 02:45:21,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a parking rule and regulation, sorry.

2081
02:45:21,769 --> 02:45:25,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Alicia, we should change it.

2082
02:45:26,170 --> 02:45:27,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a couple of questions on this.

2083
02:45:27,270 --> 02:45:31,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I totally took advantage of that.

2084
02:45:31,771 --> 02:45:35,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2085
02:45:35,952 --> 02:45:39,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Just while we're talking about the city is being sued,

2086
02:45:40,337 --> 02:45:41,938
[SPEAKER_09]: by the final analysis.

2087
02:45:42,658 --> 02:45:43,038
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2088
02:45:44,899 --> 02:45:47,079
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not funny, but no, it is.

2089
02:45:47,099 --> 02:45:49,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's interesting.

2090
02:45:50,701 --> 02:45:52,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Put it on the September agenda.

2091
02:45:52,121 --> 02:45:52,901
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll address it.

2092
02:45:53,261 --> 02:45:54,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

2093
02:45:54,882 --> 02:46:01,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask a couple of questions on the commercial vehicle ordinance?

2094
02:46:01,284 --> 02:46:03,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the size of vehicle included in there?

2095
02:46:03,065 --> 02:46:05,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know a lot of commercial vehicles can be rather large.

2096
02:46:06,726 --> 02:46:09,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a list of kind of how they break down.

2097
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:18,546
[SPEAKER_08]: sedans, SUV, and commercial vehicle sizes that I could kind of, if you want me to kind of list them out now, I don't mind doing that.

2098
02:46:18,586 --> 02:46:19,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way you guys can hear it.

2099
02:46:19,667 --> 02:46:30,694
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason I'm asking it is just if we're gonna codify a rule here, I think we should have something there about size, because I don't want tractor trailer commercial style vehicles parking on the residential streets.

2100
02:46:31,054 --> 02:46:32,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's gonna be reasonably sized.

2101
02:46:33,175 --> 02:46:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Jordan, I think sharing with Sarah or Alicia or whoever's writing this up to conclude that.

2102
02:46:38,979 --> 02:46:41,160
[SPEAKER_04]: information, you know, here's the size that we include.

2103
02:46:41,761 --> 02:46:45,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And like Alicia said, we're not going to be ready to vote tonight anyway, so this is just a discussion.

2104
02:46:45,803 --> 02:46:49,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I think yes on the 24-7, because I think we're doing something.

2105
02:46:50,005 --> 02:47:00,892
[SPEAKER_04]: My, you know, perspective, we've seen basically residents who have company cars that want to park on the streets, so we should probably mirror existing rules.

2106
02:47:01,352 --> 02:47:06,335
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these cars that are going to fit into these rules and people are going to get a permit for are just that.

2107
02:47:07,095 --> 02:47:10,438
[SPEAKER_04]: They're take-home vehicles, so they're almost like their own personal vehicles in a sense.

2108
02:47:10,638 --> 02:47:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they live in the G Zone, I feel like they should be able to park in the G Zone.

2109
02:47:15,041 --> 02:47:17,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's non-permit parking, so be it.

2110
02:47:17,984 --> 02:47:20,066
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have a permit for a commercial vehicle.

2111
02:47:20,406 --> 02:47:27,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's resident permit parking, then they should probably follow the same rules as the resident permit parking for that street.

2112
02:47:28,032 --> 02:47:29,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are my two cents on this whole thing.

2113
02:47:30,635 --> 02:47:31,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

2114
02:47:31,316 --> 02:47:40,444
[SPEAKER_20]: And actually, to clarify that, would this literally say if they live on a street with residential permit parking, do they actually just get the residential permit?

2115
02:47:40,464 --> 02:47:45,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would probably make things easier for Sarah, but Sarah, that's on you.

2116
02:47:46,110 --> 02:47:48,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the idea was to

2117
02:47:50,275 --> 02:48:11,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, when it came to cost, I think the cost of this permit was going to be in line with the business permits, the commercial, I'm sorry, the commuter permits and those similar ones that are at 125 right now, but we could allow it to be used in lieu of the resident permit if they live on a permitted street.

2118
02:48:12,189 --> 02:48:15,491
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why if we restrict this,

2119
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:21,201
[SPEAKER_14]: permit to the resident's address or to the street they live on or the G zone.

2120
02:48:21,261 --> 02:48:31,503
[SPEAKER_14]: If they live in the G zone, then we could kill two birds with one stone or, you know, instead of making them buy two, just lump it into that one, should they happen to be in a permit street.

2121
02:48:31,543 --> 02:48:34,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Another thing to consider, we're talking sizes of vehicles.

2122
02:48:34,283 --> 02:48:45,845
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the problems we've had in the past where people call and complain because a neighbor has a van or a pickup truck, which that is not the issue, but they have several ladders and equipment hanging off them.

2123
02:48:47,403 --> 02:48:55,750
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we could word that in the ordinance so that they're not allowed to have things hanging beyond, you know, however, like six inches beyond.

2124
02:48:56,190 --> 02:49:04,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people had, we had one guy with a station wagon with ladders hanging out the back, ultimately taking up two pocket spots when he did that.

2125
02:49:04,517 --> 02:49:11,843
[SPEAKER_16]: So just some sort of wording so that if you are gonna store equipment or ladders in the truck, that you don't take up more than one spot.

2126
02:49:12,123 --> 02:49:13,865
[SPEAKER_08]: And to piggyback on the chief there,

2127
02:49:14,888 --> 02:49:25,313
[SPEAKER_08]: On that, we had an issue on Lambert Street with a vehicle parking a boat, so trailers and ATVs and other trailers with equipment on it.

2128
02:49:25,513 --> 02:49:39,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We had an issue on Private Ways where a pavement company that was doing a driveway parked six commercial trucks and bobcats and things trailered.

2129
02:49:40,213 --> 02:49:43,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything with a trailer in there would be helpful for us.

2130
02:49:43,795 --> 02:49:44,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have the orders.

2131
02:49:45,636 --> 02:49:49,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we'd be covered by the length of the size.

2132
02:49:49,578 --> 02:49:54,201
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can, we can maybe add a caveat that the combined.

2133
02:49:54,781 --> 02:49:58,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, the, we can add a caveat about the width.

2134
02:49:58,763 --> 02:50:02,345
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, sorry, the length of the vehicle, including any attached trailers.

2135
02:50:04,746 --> 02:50:05,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I also forgot to say one thing.

2136
02:50:05,867 --> 02:50:08,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in favor of the exclusivity from the employer, too.

2137
02:50:09,069 --> 02:50:15,534
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, it's just that employee using that vehicle, because we don't want to do car swaps in the middle of the day and have those, you know.

2138
02:50:15,574 --> 02:50:16,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had with the cabs, too.

2139
02:50:17,596 --> 02:50:17,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

2140
02:50:18,296 --> 02:50:19,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be in favor of that.

2141
02:50:19,317 --> 02:50:23,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we confirm if Mr. Hughley's trespassing?

2142
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:25,522
[SPEAKER_16]: That created a cab company was doing that.

2143
02:50:25,542 --> 02:50:29,805
[SPEAKER_16]: So if the cabs weren't parked on the street, the employees were all parked there.

2144
02:50:30,406 --> 02:50:33,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what drew attention to that whole problem.

2145
02:50:37,962 --> 02:50:41,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think we can put that in there for a reason in the other city.

2146
02:50:41,366 --> 02:50:51,896
[SPEAKER_14]: So it, it seems, I think that the folks who've made the request most recently anyway, it didn't sound like they were trying to share it with another employee.

2147
02:50:52,057 --> 02:50:52,177
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

2148
02:50:52,875 --> 02:50:53,995
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it would impact them.

2149
02:50:54,015 --> 02:50:55,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree.

2150
02:50:55,356 --> 02:51:06,358
[SPEAKER_04]: The intention of this really is to cater to the exceptions of the commercial vehicle world, because there are so many commercial vehicles we do not want to apply to this rule.

2151
02:51:06,478 --> 02:51:06,978
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2152
02:51:07,398 --> 02:51:11,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just the people who live here and these very specific rules.

2153
02:51:12,079 --> 02:51:17,200
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad we're on.

2154
02:51:19,249 --> 02:51:23,510
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, addressing it because it's always been a bone of contention to mind the way that last.

2155
02:51:24,051 --> 02:51:29,492
[SPEAKER_16]: It was actually written as if we were like a Belmont or Lexington type town.

2156
02:51:29,572 --> 02:51:35,994
[SPEAKER_16]: It was basically ruled out any type of blue collar workers that were here and needed to park on the street.

2157
02:51:36,054 --> 02:51:40,616
[SPEAKER_16]: And these other small towns were basically mostly single family homes with driveways.

2158
02:51:41,016 --> 02:51:42,076
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't have these issues.

2159
02:51:42,456 --> 02:51:47,458
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well, I mean, I'm not sure that this is necessarily

2160
02:51:48,197 --> 02:51:55,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Any more helpful to the blue-collar community though, because a lot of the vans and trucks they would bring home wouldn't meet the criteria as far as markings.

2161
02:51:56,019 --> 02:52:05,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I say that because I had a call from Drain Doctor asking why their person kept getting tickets on their van, and it's because it was commercial and had markings all over it.

2162
02:52:05,741 --> 02:52:16,464
[SPEAKER_14]: So folks like that wouldn't necessarily benefit if we continue with the size and marking requirements as they are now.

2163
02:52:18,372 --> 02:52:23,095
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the requests are for just unmarked sedans that happen to have commercial plates.

2164
02:52:23,535 --> 02:52:28,498
[SPEAKER_14]: At least you say a lot, but it's maybe two or three that have been tabled that if I recall.

2165
02:52:28,518 --> 02:52:32,440
[SPEAKER_16]: So we only address unmarked vehicles with commercial plates?

2166
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:33,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what we're looking at?

2167
02:52:33,221 --> 02:52:34,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we discuss that though?

2168
02:52:34,681 --> 02:52:46,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I feel like in my mind, the 22 feet, so I just looked up a table of the vehicles and I saw a small sedan, 15 feet, full-size F-150.

2169
02:52:47,561 --> 02:52:48,563
[SPEAKER_20]: 20 feet, right?

2170
02:52:48,943 --> 02:52:52,187
[SPEAKER_20]: So that gave me a sense.

2171
02:52:52,247 --> 02:52:57,433
[SPEAKER_20]: So 22 feet is reasonable because then also it's taking up one parking spot.

2172
02:52:57,825 --> 02:53:00,006
[SPEAKER_20]: maybe a lot one parking spot, but one.

2173
02:53:00,946 --> 02:53:09,128
[SPEAKER_20]: I notice that in this previous version, it talks about having markings as defining it.

2174
02:53:09,268 --> 02:53:12,088
[SPEAKER_20]: If it has the markings, then it's commercial, and then it's not allowed.

2175
02:53:12,649 --> 02:53:22,151
[SPEAKER_20]: If we're saying some commercial vehicles are allowed, I think we should actively discuss whether or not we care about markings, how much, what, et cetera.

2176
02:53:22,391 --> 02:53:23,651
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with you on that.

2177
02:53:23,851 --> 02:53:25,272
[SPEAKER_20]: And make an active decision.

2178
02:53:27,192 --> 02:53:48,307
[SPEAKER_16]: person that was involved in this was so crazy about if a merry-maids person employee who worked for a cleaning company puts a small sign on the car even though they have passenger plates that they wanted to consider this a commercial vehicle and address it like a commercial vehicle you can have a small

2179
02:53:49,127 --> 02:54:16,080
[SPEAKER_16]: for passenger car that's an economy size car and he wanted this this is the way it was presented to us so i'm all for and i don't mind markings if somebody has a van with markings on it but the van is of a normal size no bigger than 20 feet i'm good with that i don't mind markings either but i have gotten feedback from a familiar constituent um to all of you about um

2180
02:54:17,508 --> 02:54:22,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Markings on a van parked with a business permit near their home and how that.

2181
02:54:23,311 --> 02:54:39,898
[SPEAKER_14]: The image of that might impact the value of their home, having a commercial vehicle within their line of sight, or, you know, the neighborhoods line of sight all the time, or, you know, potentially all the time if we were trying to address to all the people in residence.

2182
02:54:39,938 --> 02:54:40,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

2183
02:54:40,782 --> 02:54:45,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and this is the city, so I could foresee that.

2184
02:54:46,284 --> 02:54:59,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Because when I've gotten, and this is just my limited experience when I've gotten complaints about a commercial vehicle on a street, it's usually 1 with markings because not a lot of people are just taking a look at the plate and they don't they don't want to see him there a lot of time.

2185
02:54:59,150 --> 02:54:59,870
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just doing work.

2186
02:55:00,030 --> 02:55:02,551
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it's kind of a commercial vehicle parking.

2187
02:55:04,892 --> 02:55:06,153
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm talking on the street.

2188
02:55:06,173 --> 02:55:07,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a street.

2189
02:55:07,354 --> 02:55:07,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2190
02:55:08,554 --> 02:55:09,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an is that an ordinance?

2191
02:55:12,178 --> 02:55:14,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Is markings in ordinance or not allowing markings?

2192
02:55:14,979 --> 02:55:17,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that ordinance, like city council ordinance?

2193
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:18,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's written in that.

2194
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:19,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of it.

2195
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:21,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of that ordinance.

2196
02:55:21,201 --> 02:55:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so what we probably have to do if we want to change anything that's written in ordinance, we probably have to have city council vote on an ordinance change before we can change rules and regulations that may contradict or be different than what's said in ordinance.

2197
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:37,481
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we need to check.

2198
02:55:37,581 --> 02:55:42,447
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's some confusion about using the term ordinance when we mean parking regulations.

2199
02:55:42,687 --> 02:55:49,194
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that any of this is covered in the city's ordinances, which are on muni code.

2200
02:55:49,294 --> 02:55:56,763
[SPEAKER_20]: I think referring to this document, which is the traffic regulation ordinance.

2201
02:55:57,023 --> 02:55:58,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then disregard what I said.

2202
02:55:58,284 --> 02:56:03,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, it's just I just wanted to be I didn't want to take any action on this body on rules and regs.

2203
02:56:03,926 --> 02:56:05,687
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're not we don't suit up the ordinance first.

2204
02:56:05,767 --> 02:56:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Alicia.

2205
02:56:10,709 --> 02:56:19,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Vehicles, I'm gonna give I'm actually going to drop everybody a link to the the ordinances that for the section 78 traffic and vehicles.

2206
02:56:19,913 --> 02:56:24,835
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just trying to grab the link.

2207
02:56:26,548 --> 02:56:32,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like there's a little bit of crafting work still to be done on this.

2208
02:56:33,255 --> 02:56:34,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sarah, thank you for putting this together.

2209
02:56:34,737 --> 02:56:37,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely should have some conversation about it.

2210
02:56:38,020 --> 02:56:40,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I think by September, I think we should be able to lock it down.

2211
02:56:41,454 --> 02:56:58,408
[SPEAKER_20]: My thought was that several of these questions that we're asking here, and I've captured a bunch of them in my notes, perhaps we could package them together with the proposal, like the proposal of the language, maybe the language needs to spell some of these out to make it more clear for the public.

2212
02:56:59,669 --> 02:57:09,957
[SPEAKER_20]: And if not, if it's an FAQ, whichever way, and then ask the city's communications department, Sarah, whoever, to put it out to the public that this is being discussed.

2213
02:57:11,628 --> 02:57:34,125
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd love to say that we're discussing it at the September meeting, and then see what the reaction is, and whether we get, we may very well hear from members of the public that will point things out to us we haven't thought of, that we need more consideration, or they may say everything we discussed tonight, and then we're ready to vote.

2214
02:57:34,805 --> 02:57:36,106
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we don't know what we'll hear.

2215
02:57:37,525 --> 02:57:42,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we know we're going to hear some good and some people say, I don't like the looks of that.

2216
02:57:42,327 --> 02:57:48,030
[SPEAKER_24]: So I have a quick question in regards to the 24247 parking.

2217
02:57:48,490 --> 02:57:52,012
[SPEAKER_24]: Most of the other surrounding communities have restricted.

2218
02:57:52,112 --> 02:57:53,632
[SPEAKER_24]: It's only overnight parking.

2219
02:57:54,333 --> 02:57:54,553
[SPEAKER_24]: So.

2220
02:57:55,670 --> 02:58:13,057
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe because there isn't some sort of parking program that works with commercial vehicles on a daily basis, that that needs to work in conjunction with this because I think 24-7 creates a problem for many areas in Medford that are densely populated.

2221
02:58:14,677 --> 02:58:19,903
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, folks, they're paying an excise tax bill in the city of Medford.

2222
02:58:20,243 --> 02:58:21,224
[SPEAKER_24]: These folks are not.

2223
02:58:21,524 --> 02:58:24,787
[SPEAKER_24]: So I see all of those possibilities of problems.

2224
02:58:25,208 --> 02:58:26,909
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's something that needs to be addressed.

2225
02:58:27,610 --> 02:58:37,740
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, if we look at the data that was compiled, almost every, with the exception of Chelsea, everyone, it was overnight for

2226
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:40,401
[SPEAKER_24]: those commercial vehicles only.

2227
02:58:42,142 --> 02:58:42,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2228
02:58:42,522 --> 02:58:43,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Daytime parking at all?

2229
02:58:44,203 --> 02:58:45,984
[SPEAKER_20]: What if you're home during the day?

2230
02:58:46,004 --> 02:58:46,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2231
02:58:46,844 --> 02:58:47,805
[SPEAKER_20]: What if you work nights?

2232
02:58:47,925 --> 02:58:52,047
[SPEAKER_20]: Or what if you like, I'm home sick and so my vehicle is... Can we back up one second?

2233
02:58:52,707 --> 02:58:58,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Prior to this ordinance that we currently have, our commercial vehicle parking was for overnight only.

2234
02:58:59,350 --> 02:59:00,311
[SPEAKER_16]: So you were allowed

2235
02:59:00,751 --> 02:59:03,496
[SPEAKER_16]: in theory, to park on the streets in a commercial vehicle.

2236
02:59:04,017 --> 02:59:12,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm wondering, Jim, if that's not what you're seeing in these other cities and towns, that they're only addressing overnight parking and there is no restriction during the daytime.

2237
02:59:13,931 --> 02:59:15,593
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it depends on the community.

2238
02:59:15,613 --> 02:59:27,162
[SPEAKER_24]: I know the city of Austin, if you have commercial plate, you can park in a resident parking location because the idea is as long as there's lettering on the side of the car, like a real estate or something of that value.

2239
02:59:27,683 --> 02:59:31,826
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't think we even have that kind of detail at this point.

2240
02:59:32,247 --> 02:59:35,890
[SPEAKER_24]: So I also think it was done specifically to prevent

2241
02:59:36,510 --> 02:59:43,473
[SPEAKER_24]: any kind of abuses and that perspective that folks are not paying excise taxes, et cetera.

2242
02:59:43,893 --> 02:59:53,216
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think the overnight is probably practical as the approach initially, so that it allows people to understand this is an overnight process.

2243
02:59:53,676 --> 03:00:01,859
[SPEAKER_24]: And then if we receive feedback that there is a request for others or folks during the day, then that can be addressed as an addendum to this.

2244
03:00:05,457 --> 03:00:20,109
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it'll be gone, but I also think that if we just make the rules and regulations in line with just overnight stuff and don't address daytime, there's no question there, right?

2245
03:00:20,129 --> 03:00:21,630
[SPEAKER_16]: They park there and they don't park there.

2246
03:00:21,690 --> 03:00:25,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think what you're saying is, if it becomes an issue, then we address it.

2247
03:00:27,723 --> 03:00:35,528
[SPEAKER_24]: What we see here, I mean, I've been to a number of these traffic commission meetings and always the request has been for overnight commercial parking.

2248
03:00:35,988 --> 03:00:43,333
[SPEAKER_24]: There hasn't been anything during the day, primarily that when it's been submitted to traffic commission, it seems to be overnight.

2249
03:00:43,453 --> 03:00:48,096
[SPEAKER_24]: And call me wrong, but I believe that's just been what I've seen and what I've reviewed.

2250
03:00:48,576 --> 03:00:51,478
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, these other communities are doing overnight.

2251
03:00:52,338 --> 03:00:57,220
[SPEAKER_24]: I live in South Medford, as you know, and it's a very densely populated environment.

2252
03:00:57,800 --> 03:01:02,402
[SPEAKER_24]: And this sort of helps people who may have a commercial vehicle.

2253
03:01:02,682 --> 03:01:07,004
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, I understand within the limits, and that should be addressed as well.

2254
03:01:07,024 --> 03:01:12,086
[SPEAKER_24]: Because when it says within vehicle size and marketing requirements, it's sort of like, what does that mean?

2255
03:01:12,486 --> 03:01:14,387
[SPEAKER_24]: So that part of this as well.

2256
03:01:14,727 --> 03:01:15,948
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's clear to people.

2257
03:01:15,968 --> 03:01:16,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2258
03:01:17,168 --> 03:01:21,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So one thing about this current rule that we have, I think we

2259
03:01:21,830 --> 03:01:31,823
[SPEAKER_16]: We've always we were brought up on the overnight commercial vehicle parking term and then this rule came in and the difficulty of enforcing it was.

2260
03:01:33,248 --> 03:01:34,449
[SPEAKER_16]: here we go, am I on there?

2261
03:01:34,929 --> 03:01:40,271
[SPEAKER_16]: So the difficulty of enforcing it was, how do we know they're only parked there for an hour?

2262
03:01:41,132 --> 03:01:43,993
[SPEAKER_16]: So if somebody's there working on the house, that's easy to determine.

2263
03:01:44,333 --> 03:01:50,636
[SPEAKER_16]: But if somebody calls and say, hey, my neighbor's in front of his house, he's been parked there for two hours, we don't know that.

2264
03:01:50,716 --> 03:01:54,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we have to go and, in theory, chalk the wheel and come back for an hour.

2265
03:01:54,658 --> 03:01:58,480
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think just addressing overnight is the right issue to do.

2266
03:02:01,467 --> 03:02:02,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, I just have one comment.

2267
03:02:03,109 --> 03:02:11,355
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm a painter, and I have a van, and I get out of work at 7 o'clock at night, where do I park until midnight?

2268
03:02:12,255 --> 03:02:18,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what we're saying is, there will be no restriction during the daytime, unless it becomes an issue.

2269
03:02:18,980 --> 03:02:19,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2270
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:20,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we want to address it.

2271
03:02:20,441 --> 03:02:26,185
[SPEAKER_16]: But all the other cities and towns around us only address overnight commercial vehicles.

2272
03:02:27,847 --> 03:02:28,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather 24-7.

2273
03:02:31,637 --> 03:02:38,721
[SPEAKER_24]: I think also just from a perspective of why these other communities have done overnight, that's generally has been the request.

2274
03:02:39,301 --> 03:02:45,764
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we need to see the reality of the request and then make a better judgment and then go from there.

2275
03:02:46,244 --> 03:02:50,226
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's really important to see exactly what is being requested.

2276
03:02:50,726 --> 03:03:00,051
[SPEAKER_24]: It defines this, it allows this to occur, but it keeps it within parameters that is enforceable and

2277
03:03:00,990 --> 03:03:03,552
[SPEAKER_24]: helps people sort of digest this.

2278
03:03:04,352 --> 03:03:04,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm all for it.

2279
03:03:04,993 --> 03:03:07,474
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's definitely something that needs to be readdressed.

2280
03:03:08,715 --> 03:03:12,678
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we can have a good conversation on that.

2281
03:03:14,159 --> 03:03:16,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn the meeting.

2282
03:03:20,563 --> 03:03:22,924
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to know what we're putting.

2283
03:03:23,785 --> 03:03:25,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Sarah, I'm happy to send you my notes.

2284
03:03:26,573 --> 03:03:27,093
[SPEAKER_08]: It's helpful.

2285
03:03:27,193 --> 03:03:33,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you own it, Sarah, you want to email Alva, we can get it on for September and then share the Zoom link.

2286
03:03:33,154 --> 03:03:34,615
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have plenty of time to look at it.

2287
03:03:35,935 --> 03:03:39,656
[SPEAKER_20]: And somebody will talk with comms about doing some outreach on this?

2288
03:03:43,497 --> 03:03:44,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you able to do that?

2289
03:03:44,877 --> 03:03:49,878
[SPEAKER_20]: How about you copy me, because I'm talking to them a lot about another issue, and I don't want it to get confused.

2290
03:03:51,038 --> 03:03:51,318
OK.

2291
03:03:51,558 --> 03:03:54,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I actually have a couple of things I've asked them for this week already.

2292
03:03:55,767 --> 03:03:58,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Or in the last couple of weeks, so I'll add you.

2293
03:03:59,770 --> 03:04:03,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, anybody else want to be in that conversation?

2294
03:04:03,872 --> 03:04:17,781
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, I understand what was that conversation between with communications to discuss getting the word out about this being on the agenda once it's on the agenda.

2295
03:04:17,801 --> 03:04:18,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2296
03:04:18,542 --> 03:04:20,503
[SPEAKER_16]: You can keep me out of that 1. okay.

2297
03:04:22,204 --> 03:04:23,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I sent up Steve.

2298
03:04:23,305 --> 03:04:23,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Is he here?

2299
03:04:26,207 --> 03:04:26,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I signed up Todd.

2300
03:04:28,368 --> 03:04:28,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd's here.

2301
03:04:29,788 --> 03:04:34,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think we're motion to adjourn.

2302
03:04:34,710 --> 03:04:37,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, second, second.

2303
03:04:38,311 --> 03:04:41,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we need a roll call.

2304
03:04:41,392 --> 03:04:41,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

2305
03:04:41,733 --> 03:04:42,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, chief.

2306
03:04:42,133 --> 03:04:44,854
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I get from the summer and I don't text and drive.

2307
03:04:45,074 --> 03:04:45,814
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2308
03:04:55,093 --> 03:04:55,974
[SPEAKER_04]: The A's have it.

2309
03:04:56,394 --> 03:04:57,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everybody.

2310
03:04:57,054 --> 03:04:57,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy your summer.

2311
03:04:58,075 --> 03:04:58,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, everybody.

2312
03:04:59,236 --> 03:05:00,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

2313
03:05:00,256 --> 03:05:00,637
[SPEAKER_08]: 809 adjourned.
