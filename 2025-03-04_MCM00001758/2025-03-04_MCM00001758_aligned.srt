1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:02,533
All right, let's go right down the line one more time.

2
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:06,375
Vote to approve the minutes.

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:06,815
Josh?

4
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:07,796
Aye.

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:09,076
Lois?

6
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:10,377
Aye.

7
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:11,818
Benji?

8
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:12,198
Yes.

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:13,999
Barry?

10
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,660
Yes.

11
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,560
Loretta?

12
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:16,381
Yes.

13
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:18,502
Kathleen?

14
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:26,207
Not hearing you, Kathleen.

15
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,729
Yes.

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,021
Oh, perfect.

17
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,523
Prabita?

18
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:34,563
Yes.

19
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,065
Luke is also on.

20
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,006
Oh, we got Luke and John.

21
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:39,327
Fantastic.

22
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,408
Apologies, I'm late.

23
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:42,210
No worries at all.

24
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,831
We're just voting on the minutes.

25
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,213
If you'd like to weigh in, yay or nay?

26
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:50,156
If you had a chance to look at them.

27
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:52,238
I must defer.

28
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,500
I did not attend last month.

29
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,220
No worries.

30
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,381
All right.

31
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:57,222
Prabita?

32
00:00:58,423 --> 00:00:58,563
Yes.

33
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:00,913
Awesome, Dan.

34
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:03,295
Yes.

35
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:08,399
John Rogers.

36
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:23,271
All right, skip over for now.

37
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:24,952
Will, yes.

38
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,633
I also say yes.

39
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:29,999
Goodness, there's just so many.

40
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:30,679
Bob, thank you.

41
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:34,102
Yays have it across the board.

42
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,043
Oh, looks like Paul is here as well.

43
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:41,227
Wow, we really... It's so nice.

44
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,229
Fantastic.

45
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,370
All right, let's just jump right in.

46
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,852
There's so much doing and not a lot of time to do it.

47
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,415
Brenda, are there any administrative updates we should know about?

48
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,522
Um, yes.

49
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,624
Um, let's talk about when the next meeting is going to be.

50
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:05,067
Um, so the mayor can join us, um, either April 2nd or 16th.

51
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,588
Those are both Wednesdays.

52
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,653
Monday's are school committee meetings.

53
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:16,953
So that makes it difficult.

54
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:20,715
The second is currently the only one open.

55
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:23,477
Yeah.

56
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:30,942
We might have to do, why don't we just go and see how many people can make either one.

57
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:32,283
Now that we're all almost here.

58
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:35,325
Yeah, we actually have a really close to quorum.

59
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,006
Let's just go.

60
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:38,968
Is anyone unable to make the second?

61
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:42,450
I can go, I think.

62
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:42,751
OK.

63
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,332
But probably I can make it.

64
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:45,012
OK.

65
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:51,256
I'm traveling that week, but not on the second.

66
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,357
I'm leaving on the third.

67
00:02:56,756 --> 00:03:05,679
And just to clarify, I don't think that could be a hybrid meeting because there are so many meetings on Wednesday nights that it would have to be online only.

68
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,079
Well, that makes it much, much easier then.

69
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:08,780
Yeah.

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,180
All right.

71
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,762
Anyone feel very strongly about going on to the 16th instead?

72
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,863
Otherwise, I think the second will work.

73
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,087
It's cool seeing none.

74
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:36,615
Let's make sure I see you all on Zoom on the second.

75
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:38,177
Perfect.

76
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:38,658
Yes.

77
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:39,759
Thanks.

78
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,462
That was good.

79
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,679
Some other administrative updates.

80
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:51,581
The planning department is losing our housing planner this week.

81
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:57,864
But that job is already posted, so please share it with anybody that you think might be interested.

82
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,728
And we're also starting to look for interns for this summer.

83
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:10,451
So same thing, if you, yeah, please share that if anyone you know would be interested.

84
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,223
And then I heard some feedback that people are still having issues with our mailing list.

85
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:29,170
I think what's happening is when you're sending emails to each other, there's a conflict between your two emails.

86
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,092
Because I don't think it's happening when I'm sending emails out to you.

87
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,473
And it's not happening for everybody.

88
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:35,934
It's only happening to certain people.

89
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:41,698
So for instance, one bounce back said the sender is sending too much mail for its authentication status.

90
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,588
And that didn't affect everybody.

91
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,429
It only affected certain people.

92
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:56,197
But I mean, I don't think that's something that we can fix within our mailing list client.

93
00:04:56,818 --> 00:05:05,405
I think that's something where it might mean that I need to send out the agenda and minutes to everybody to make sure that everyone's going to get it.

94
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:15,144
And then you just have the understanding that if you're replying to, if you're sending, trying to send something out, everyone might not get it unless you send it through me.

95
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:25,472
That's all I had for administrative updates.

96
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:29,015
I mean, I have other- There's plenty to do, I'm sure.

97
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:31,597
With that then.

98
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:34,779
I just had a question on the mayor's availability.

99
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,181
Is there a time slot that,

100
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:39,573
We just assumed that it would be 630.

101
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:46,380
She probably wouldn't stay for the entire meeting, but she would probably come for the beginning of it.

102
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,104
Perfect.

103
00:05:52,706 --> 00:06:00,114
We can discuss at some point what we might want to share with her, make sure we have everything at the end of this meeting kind of sorted and topped off ready.

104
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:11,513
Uh, with that, I'm going to throw it to Lois and Benji, uh, who have started work on a project of their own, uh, to eliminate plastic takeout containers.

105
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,776
I see Lois online and Benji in person.

106
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,097
Hopefully you can navigate that.

107
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:27,783
Your camera is turned off and not that it's an issue for me, but are you guys in the office?

108
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,065
Yes, we are.

109
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,044
I'll get a good view of any, but.

110
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:43,606
The volume, I think the background is just blurred.

111
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:47,867
There's so much, I don't know.

112
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:59,929
Sorry, didn't mean to derail.

113
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,329
No, no, no.

114
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,422
All right, let's hear from, yeah, Lois, can you hear us?

115
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:09,803
Yeah, sure.

116
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,886
All right, take it away, please.

117
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:21,911
Yeah, I'll start and Benji will take it up if I'm on call here.

118
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:27,054
We did send around our plan.

119
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:28,735
Did everybody get to see that?

120
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:41,345
We just thought if people had a chance to look at what we're talking about, you'd be able to just say whether you think we're on the right track or not.

121
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:52,587
And if anybody has any questions, suggestions, answers.

122
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:56,588
Yeah, I know I definitely got it, but that's not really a good baseline.

123
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,243
No, I did not get it.

124
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,244
Can you pull it up?

125
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:02,364
Yes.

126
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:03,944
Oh, Tangerine was fighting.

127
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:04,764
Yes.

128
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:07,265
It is just titled The Media Project.

129
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,325
Oh, okay.

130
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,066
Let's see.

131
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:14,026
But hopefully, here we go.

132
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:22,568
Lois, if you could give a quick summary, I think that would be very helpful.

133
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,289
Folks online seeing your screen, Will,

134
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,871
Yeah, actually, that's a great question.

135
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:30,251
Are people seeing what I'm, I don't think I'm sharing.

136
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,752
Okay, I'm gonna put this in.

137
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:34,973
Can you share?

138
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:37,574
I'm just seeing the W. Share that?

139
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:37,874
Yeah.

140
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:38,334
Yeah.

141
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:39,675
Share screen.

142
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:46,317
At any rate, a couple meetings ago, people talked about what they were interested in and

143
00:08:50,447 --> 00:09:03,877
One of the things that I mentioned was black plastic, I guess, and that I wanted to try to do something about takeout containers, which sometimes horrified me.

144
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,680
I asked if anybody else was interested and Benji was.

145
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,764
We met and came up with these questions.

146
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:16,418
and a tentative plan.

147
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:35,724
And I will tell you anecdotally that it's possible that we've already made an impression because I went for Chinese food up at the hillside and they had styrofoam containers and black plastic containers.

148
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:42,506
I said, I thought styrofoam was not allowed in China.

149
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:43,742
anymore.

150
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:49,444
Yes, he said, but the city gave us permission to use up our remaining stock.

151
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,625
And then we're not going to use it anymore.

152
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,666
Which so obviously he's aware and plugged in.

153
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:57,607
And he had all these black containers.

154
00:09:57,627 --> 00:10:04,509
And he put my order in something that doesn't usually go in because he didn't want to put it black.

155
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,090
And Benji went to that same place.

156
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:15,229
and didn't see any black plastic anymore on this shelf where they have all their containers.

157
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:35,575
When I explained that the reason black plastic doesn't get recycled is because actually it's hard to read the numbers and the band that they travel through the facility on is black and they can't distinguish the black from the black.

158
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:52,172
didn't have any black on his shelf, so maybe a lot of what we have to do is inform people of what are the difficulties and find out what can be done about it.

159
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,895
If you see at the bottom of the sheet, the

160
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:11,081
We are trying to get them to talk about what they use for hot food, cold food, liquids, how they dispose of their trash.

161
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:15,202
Do they use the composting service?

162
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:16,782
Do they recycle?

163
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,983
And who do they do it with?

164
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:29,825
So these were, we hope to engage in conversations, not confrontations, and try to inform people

165
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:35,193
that they have choices and what the benefits of the choices are.

166
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,555
Did I cover it, Benji?

167
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:41,918
I guess I read a little.

168
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:44,700
Initially, it was just about black press.

169
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:50,845
And then the more I investigated, I have a good friend who's on the Recycling Committee of New York, Maine.

170
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,808
I spoke to people in Brookline and Somerville and Cambridge.

171
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,411
And I educated myself a little.

172
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,352
I don't like I'm educated.

173
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:11,380
yet, but plastic of any kind and any uses, if we could somehow get rid of it, would be a good idea.

174
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:21,645
The next thing was people talking about compostables, which are a replacement or a potential replacement for plastic.

175
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:26,588
We have not yet figured out exactly how much they cost, but it appears they cost significantly more than the plastic does.

176
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:41,779
apparently some issues with compostable stuff, which ones do and don't, off gas and when they're made, et cetera.

177
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:59,407
And so then we also stumbled on someone, a woman named, who has a business of reusable stuff, a business called Recirculable,

178
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:06,278
And she's trying to make them all reusable, which are obviously going to be dramatically more expensive by the way.

179
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:19,822
It's compostable and require significant investment and input from both restaurants and consumers.

180
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:24,243
And so it raises in my mind the question

181
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,664
most things, I think it's a good idea to try and take your best shot at first.

182
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:45,498
One strategy would be, my conclusion about the black plastic is that there's no particular reason why plastic is used instead of white plastic, except that it's used.

183
00:13:45,518 --> 00:13:46,839
When I had

184
00:13:54,387 --> 00:14:00,189
in white plastic, but it was a white plastic, what I call clamshell, that is up in the bottom and connected to each other.

185
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:05,710
And that's also true in some restaurants in Cambridge I've taken out from.

186
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:14,072
I was at my daughter's house a couple of weeks ago in New Jersey, and the containers, the bottoms were all white plastic, even in the separate ones.

187
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,733
So my conclusion is that there isn't

188
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:22,179
If there is a cost differential between white and black plastic, it's insignificant.

189
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,681
And I'm convinced without any data yet, that there isn't any difference.

190
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:30,303
And with the black plastic, it's simply a matter of educating people.

191
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:33,865
And maybe we are looking for an ordinance, maybe we aren't.

192
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,907
I'm not sure what strategy is there.

193
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:41,089
And that sort of slips over into the issues that Paul and others were raising.

194
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:47,192
Depending on what conclusion we reach, how do we see the policy?

195
00:14:48,874 --> 00:15:01,062
If you're going beyond with the plastic, if you're going beyond black plastic and replacing it, you're going to compostables.

196
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:08,267
It's going to be more expensive.

197
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:14,491
And the reusable as a complete solution is probably untenable.

198
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,751
That's what we've been told.

199
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:24,546
20% or 30% or 40% reusables component, it's not 100%.

200
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:33,408
And one of the things that we thought of was, there's one Marguerite Bell from the reusable business.

201
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:37,789
We met with her for about an hour, and she seemed extremely knowledgeable.

202
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:40,609
She definitely got an interest in selling reusables.

203
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:46,270
And so, with that filter, when you're hearing what she has to say, I was convinced that she was sincere

204
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:55,459
and that's where they should go.

205
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,880
Benji, who's this person?

206
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,220
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

207
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:03,343
A woman named Margie Bell, who has a business called ReCircleable.

208
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:05,464
ReCircleable, okay.

209
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:10,606
Which does reusable containers.

210
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:21,571
The method that they do is you have restaurants become part of a consortium, so you can take your container from one place and return it to the next place, and it makes it much easier.

211
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:25,909
to encourage use.

212
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:38,840
There's obviously a lot more involved in saving the container and washing the container and taking it back than simply putting it into a recycling bin.

213
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:44,185
What Lois and I are looking for is input from folks about what

214
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:48,913
How should we approach this?

215
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:52,614
Should we limit it to just replacing black plastic with white plastic?

216
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,815
Should we try to go further than that?

217
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,876
The York Main Ordinance essentially requires compostables.

218
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:06,598
My friend said that they managed to get that to be a pretty much joint effort with a restaurant association.

219
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:21,057
they included them in the planning and it hasn't taken effect yet and it obviously requires both the restaurant to use it and then the consumer to

220
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:24,401
to put in the curbside bin.

221
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:38,380
And I remember when curbside compostables became part of the city project, there were some issues and some concern about maybe it would be too much use, and would that be a problem everybody brought in across the

222
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:49,251
it's doing the composting, and so there are a whole variety of questions there.

223
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:59,435
Don't forget Benji, Margie Bell said she finds difficulties in the processing of compostables.

224
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:11,471
is not energy efficient or uses too much energy and releases things.

225
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:20,777
But as Benji said, her business is to do these reusable containers rather than recyclable or compostable.

226
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:26,821
And she acknowledged that you're never going to get to even 30% or 40% reusable.

227
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:32,465
So the question is, better isn't perfect, but it's better.

228
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:44,712
Again, a question on the reusable and I mean, maybe actually, Paul might know the answer as our resident chemist.

229
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:58,241
But I never, I use plastics for food storage, largely because I'm over 70 and I'm not really afraid of long term poisoning anymore.

230
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,181
But

231
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:11,259
Even I am leery about the idea of heating plastics up and reusing them because they become unstable.

232
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:22,081
If I wash stuff at home, I'm washing it in 140-degree water.

233
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:28,563
If they're washed in a restaurant, they have to be really hot because they have to meet standards.

234
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:34,593
What is that due to the stability of the containers?

235
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:36,613
Are they safe?

236
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,454
That's a good question.

237
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:40,254
And I don't know the answer to it.

238
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:46,596
And I wonder if Paul... Yes.

239
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:53,357
I can tell you that the higher the temperature, the more the shed

240
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:58,146
Can everyone hear me?

241
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,508
Yeah.

242
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:01,689
The more the shed.

243
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:06,452
So I wasn't aware of this until I looked it up.

244
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:14,138
It's whatever plastic you have sheds, essentially.

245
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:22,765
And it's very, very, very tiny particles, but it actually does shed.

246
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,266
So even

247
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:37,051
polypropylene, which doesn't have the plasticizers in it, actually sheds stuff.

248
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:41,673
Any kind of heating increases the shed.

249
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:51,236
I guess the overarching problem for me is

250
00:20:53,187 --> 00:21:07,614
is do you have is a compostable container that's essentially made of cellulose.

251
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:13,577
And that can be just discarded, and you don't have to worry about it.

252
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:19,119
And it appears there is.

253
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:20,700
But

254
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:29,465
This has to be stipulated town-wise.

255
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:32,126
It has to be regulated.

256
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:35,587
So it can't be a voluntary thing.

257
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:36,688
Because

258
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,971
businesses have to make money.

259
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:54,842
And unfortunately, they'd always go for the lowest cost container to, you know, distribute all of the goods they need to do that.

260
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:55,243
So

261
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:19,736
Yeah, I'm, I'm not sure the, the, the way to go about it in terms of like making businesses to do this, like, you know, go for the composable stuff, but perhaps finding out sources of

262
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:38,955
compostable containers for businesses and talking to the restaurants, sort of hubs would help.

263
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,383
One of Lola's suggestions was that we just take a census of restaurants.

264
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:48,544
She and I are going to divide them up and go talk to them.

265
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,707
And one issue is how do we represent ourselves?

266
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:56,228
Is it okay to represent ourselves as part of this committee?

267
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:57,649
Are we private citizens?

268
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,872
I'll set that aside for a second, but we want to figure that out before we go.

269
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:07,297
and just have conversations with this checklist, and I assume there are 50 retrons.

270
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:15,064
Some of them are willing to tell us, well, it costs this much for compostables and this much for plastic, and the reason they're back-casting is because that's what they sell.

271
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:22,037
that information I think we'll be able to obtain relatively easily.

272
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:33,802
And I guess the other thing that we didn't mention is our compostables, because we're residents, we don't pay any extra except for the bags.

273
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:40,244
I assume that businesses do, and we have to find out what the cost is.

274
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:43,686
And there's gonna be, if you wanna,

275
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:52,930
We will pay for composting for restaurants as well and paying it for residents.

276
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:58,432
I don't know what the levels of costs are on that spot, so this is what we need to gather.

277
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:07,077
I really like the idea of doing a survey and finding out what people are doing right now and gathering that information about cost differentials.

278
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:14,200
We wanted to ask you folks here, do we represent ourselves as just interested citizens or is it okay to say that we're

279
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:19,425
Oh, yeah, I mean, you can absolutely say your energy committee members.

280
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:27,753
I think if the committee wants to like officially vote on whether they can represent themselves as the committee, you know, then you can do that.

281
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,354
Definitely.

282
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,696
What we need is a badge.

283
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:39,401
Like an official badge.

284
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,462
Can you give us one?

285
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,088
But wait, is this the Energy and Environment Police?

286
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,554
No, no, I hope not.

287
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,416
We're going to be non-confrontational.

288
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:55,657
Yes, exactly.

289
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:58,760
But you need some sort of official capacity.

290
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,782
Otherwise, the guy would tell you to f off.

291
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:11,010
You know, so, you know, I have rainbows and flowers.

292
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,434
One kind of parting thought as we kind of wrap up thinking about this.

293
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:25,946
It would be to identify some kind of poster child, some kind of like, I think of like a, like Clover has like actual compostable takeout containers.

294
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,067
Identify those and say like, what are you paying for these?

295
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:30,988
How are these being disposed of?

296
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:31,749
How do you treat them?

297
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,671
To see if we can propose an alternative when we approach these other restaurants.

298
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,312
I think that's a really productive way to go about it.

299
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:55,766
And then discussing if there should be some kind of sign-on letter for restaurants as we get closer to see if they'd be interested in promoting it and saying, actually, if we got help from Medford, we would want x, y, and z assistance, and we would do it.

300
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,533
Yeah, excellent idea.

301
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:05,819
Restaurants are not only in like the five business districts.

302
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:14,728
Are restaurants even sort of allowed to take part in the city trash and recycling?

303
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:18,477
And that's only if they're below a certain size.

304
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:24,801
So if they're essentially putting out a residential building's worth of trash, then they can participate.

305
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:27,683
If it becomes more than that, then they're responsible for it themselves.

306
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:31,926
And they're not involved in the composting whatsoever.

307
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:38,370
Although there's been some discussion of trying to talk with the Chamber of Commerce

308
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:45,913
to get people to sign on to the composting program themselves and work themselves.

309
00:26:46,793 --> 00:26:48,593
But that's where that stands right now.

310
00:26:48,613 --> 00:27:00,836
I think all the other small parting bit is like, we don't have to have a perfect solution right out the gate, but a pragmatic one of eliminating plastic, I think should be a priority for what Paul was saying.

311
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:08,298
I have a final thought too, I have to go, but it occurs to me that really,

312
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:21,568
Benji and I should carry out our survey and then report back with the results and let this committee take it over.

313
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:34,116
Since we're going to say that we're on this committee, we'll gather information, bring it back to you all and see what we want to do with it.

314
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:35,537
Do we want legislation?

315
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:37,038
Do we want education?

316
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:38,419
Do we want a combination?

317
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:48,271
Some restaurants actually have signs saying we don't use plastic, you know, and maybe we can give them flyers.

318
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:51,512
This place is plastic-free, you know, whatever.

319
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:52,772
Yeah.

320
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,253
Louis, I just want to say one thing.

321
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:59,375
If you need extra hands to distribute your survey, count me in.

322
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:01,316
I'm sorry I didn't show interest earlier.

323
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:02,937
Great.

324
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:04,358
Thank you.

325
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll see you all now.

326
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,522
I'll look forward to the recording.

327
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:14,205
As indicated, she's more than happy to come make a presentation.

328
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:15,706
We should.

329
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:23,391
I think she's a, it appeared to me she learned what she was talking about.

330
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:23,671
Yes.

331
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:24,072
I see.

332
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:24,992
Yes, Jill Feldman.

333
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,094
I see you've had your hand raised very patiently.

334
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:30,396
I do.

335
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:38,173
Hi, I'm with Mothers Out Front, but the reason I wanted, I just wanted to share that I moved here from Milwaukee.

336
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,739
That's in Wisconsin, in case you're not familiar with the Midwest.

337
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,965
And they have an organization called Plastic Free Milwaukee.

338
00:28:48,005 --> 00:28:49,727
I just checked, they're still up and running.

339
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:55,130
It's a really good organization and that they're able to connect with the city.

340
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:05,154
And I would suggest that the people that are interested in this look at their website to see what they've done, because they've done a lot of this work that you're already just starting.

341
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:11,877
And the other thing that they've done, which I thought was really cool is if a restaurant meets a particular standard.

342
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:26,141
You get a medallion and then there the name of the restaurant is posted on a site that says that this is a restaurant that does not use any single use plastic.

343
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:33,929
And they also provide information to restaurants on where the best places are to get replacements for simply use plastic.

344
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,051
That is a fantastic thing to add.

345
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:42,134
We are nearing the end of the kind of allotted time.

346
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:44,535
I want to make sure we have enough time for everything else.

347
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:46,896
Anything good for the order?

348
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,677
Anything, parting thoughts?

349
00:29:48,697 --> 00:30:01,665
I bought on my phone, you can get biodegradable, compostable, clamshell, made of cane sugar fibers for about 40 cents each.

350
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,145
That's not bad.

351
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:12,460
So unfortunately, I'm on my phone because my computer's giving me a lot of trouble, and I can't raise my hand on my phone.

352
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,560
I don't know why.

353
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:28,960
So I came from the electric vehicle industry.

354
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:34,572
In the very beginning, what they had was, and this is something that may be above our pay grade, but

355
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:46,557
We converted electric vehicles, and basically, the government paid the difference between the donor vehicle and the completed electric vehicle.

356
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:48,179
So the completed electric vehicle cost about $35,000.

357
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:48,899
This is back in the 90s.

358
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:49,860
And the donor vehicle was $7,000.

359
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,743
So the rebates were such that people paid $7,000 for these electric vehicles.

360
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:07,893
Maybe we could do something where the difference between the the recyclable plastic versus the black plastic.

361
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:12,498
Maybe there's some way we could say we will cover the difference in the costs.

362
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,844
And I understand that that's like something that has to go through all kinds of everything to get done.

363
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:18,725
But it's an idea.

364
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:22,208
Well, I don't think there is a difference in the plastic.

365
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:26,089
I think that the black plastic is just sort of happening because nobody was paying attention.

366
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,610
Oh, okay.

367
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:40,055
I'm not sure about the black and white, but I'm fairly confident since I've seen white plastic in a number of different places, and a black was less expensive in New Jersey.

368
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:48,898
So, and I assume that at least some of the restaurants we've talked to will answer those questions in depth and will have the information, hopefully by the next meeting.

369
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:52,001
I'm sorry, one more thing.

370
00:31:52,622 --> 00:32:06,758
If once we get to the point, if we decide we want to be revising an ordinance or anything like that, we'd want to talk with the Board of Health first about what enforcement would look like, because we don't want to set something up that the city is in a position that they can't enforce.

371
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:21,007
In New York, Maine, and in Cambridge, and in Brookline, and in Somerville, enforcement, everybody that spoke said, this is all great, enforcement's the real issue.

372
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:28,571
So the notion of getting people on board as opposed to replying, or in addition to that, is probably the way to go.

373
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:29,652
But yes.

374
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:33,093
Start at the counters, and we'll work from there.

375
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:37,856
I want to make sure Brenda has enough time for their municipal updates.

376
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:46,701
So I'm going to cut our discussion off there, but I really appreciate the good, healthy discussions here.

377
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:50,144
And yes, Brenda, the floor is yours.

378
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:54,528
Okay, I will try to rush through these because I know we have some great products to talk about.

379
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:58,312
But Electrify Medford, we have 125 signups so far.

380
00:32:58,332 --> 00:32:58,933
We've coached 50 people.

381
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:10,644
Um, and we have a new Spanish speaking coach and we've done two coaching sessions in Spanish in the last couple of weeks.

382
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:12,046
So I'm really excited about that.

383
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:22,037
Um, I coached the mayor and the mayor posted about it on social media last week, which led to some more signups again.

384
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:40,371
And we have an upcoming event at the senior center where we'll be doing an informational session there where I'll do a short presentation and then there'll be coaches on hand so that people can just get coached right there in the moment and not have to wait.

385
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:42,712
So I'm looking forward to that.

386
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:46,733
I'm working on scheduling more sessions like that.

387
00:33:49,445 --> 00:34:00,972
I'm hoping to do the next one at the West Medford Community Center, but if you have recommendations for other locations like that, that you think would be a good place to hold one of these, please let me know.

388
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:01,892
What about the library?

389
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:03,773
Maybe you already talked about that.

390
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,455
That was the first one we did, was at the library.

391
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:07,395
Sorry.

392
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,116
Yep.

393
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:13,679
Are those events, Brenda?

394
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,680
Sorry, what was that?

395
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,982
When are those taking place?

396
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,814
Senior Center and West Senior Center is March 4 so it's when's that tomorrow.

397
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:25,175
Oh yeah.

398
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:33,522
Any events during the Earth Day week or whatever week.

399
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:34,483
Earth Week.

400
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:38,682
Um, I don't think we have anything planned for that week.

401
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:41,225
It's a, it's a pretty tight week right now.

402
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:44,008
That's like the cleanup is happening every other day.

403
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:50,735
And, um, there are holidays, religious holidays happening the weekend before and things like that.

404
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:54,819
It's always a difficult week to schedule things around.

405
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:56,361
Um,

406
00:34:58,828 --> 00:35:04,229
We are preparing some door hangers to go out at the end of March.

407
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:15,271
And I think I mentioned that we're working with a Northeastern professor who lives in Medford, who's working with student groups there to distribute those around the city.

408
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:17,651
So looking forward to that.

409
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:25,793
And then I'll be doing the Mass State Community First partnership training April 4th.

410
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:37,665
And I'll be really interested to hear the how the $500 million haircut the DPU gave their budget will will impact their plans incentives.

411
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:44,663
Let's see.

412
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:47,165
Andrews and McGlynn HVAC project.

413
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:50,307
We've received design documents last week.

414
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:53,669
We're signing a contract with the construction manager this week.

415
00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:01,595
And then the construction manager will be working with the designer to finalize the design and pre-purchase the equipment later this month.

416
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:03,676
So moving right along.

417
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,158
Every day counts there to try to get this done by the end of the summer.

418
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:19,750
have, so we have renegotiated our municipal electricity supply purchase.

419
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:35,702
So in the same way that the aggregation negotiates an electricity price for residents, the city also negotiates a price for electricity use in city-owned buildings, not separate to the residents and low business rates.

420
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:40,686
So we locked in our contract for December 25th through, sorry, December 2025 through 2028.

421
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,768
And it's a half cent lower than our current contract.

422
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:53,913
And we also sent Class 1 RECs to match with the IDPs we have right now, too.

423
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:59,177
So I'm very happy that we were able to do that with the additional renewables.

424
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:05,148
Green score zoning.

425
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:14,315
We have an updated zoning web page that summarizes suggested zoning changes in the process.

426
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:18,978
I'll pop that into the chat when I'm done talking here.

427
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:28,646
But the green score was discussed at the Community Development Board meeting on February 5th, and they recommended it to the City Council.

428
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:31,668
So that's moving forward slowly but surely.

429
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:39,397
We heard back about the MassCEC on-street charging grant.

430
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:48,484
We weren't chosen for an implementation grant, which was really disappointing, but we will likely be chosen for a feasibility study.

431
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:55,170
They've sort of bumped us into that selection category, and we'll find out about that by the end of the week.

432
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:00,054
I'm curious, did Somerville get the implementation grant?

433
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:02,222
We did, yes.

434
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,244
But that's because we have a science strategy on it.

435
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:10,286
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

436
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:15,248
So yeah, so once we, they told us that we'll likely be chosen for that.

437
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:20,450
So once we start moving forward with that, Josh, I'm going to be reaching out to you to talk to you about that.

438
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,590
Yeah.

439
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:32,943
The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources is moving forward with their large building energy reporting.

440
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,407
And that's for buildings over 20,000 square feet.

441
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:43,233
And the utilities will be reporting directly to them the energy use.

442
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:47,817
But for the delivered fuel, the building owners have to report to them.

443
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:56,988
So letters went out to building owners last week, and I have claimed Medford's city-owned buildings on their website.

444
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:07,892
And the reporting deadline for that is June 30th, and DOER will publish the usage data online by October 31st.

445
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:13,174
So you'll be able to see statewide every building over 20,000 square feet with their energy usage.

446
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:15,495
It's pretty exciting.

447
00:39:16,472 --> 00:39:24,514
And that's information that could be really useful if municipalities decide in the future, we want to set a performance standard for energy use.

448
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:30,796
We don't have to first start collecting that, doing that reporting ourselves and collecting that information.

449
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:35,997
It'll just be available to us.

450
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:43,199
And this is not a municipal update, but I was wondering, has anyone been to the Climate Book Club at the library?

451
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,602
I know there's nothing.

452
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:47,284
Oh, this is news to me.

453
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:47,985
Okay.

454
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:55,994
Next Wednesday at seven o'clock, they're discussing the book all week and save, which I actually haven't read yet, but I'm very interested in that.

455
00:39:56,534 --> 00:40:00,158
You keep going.

456
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:02,801
Okay.

457
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:13,582
I haven't seen any updates, but if anyone's been to the book club, I'd love to hear what you think about it.

458
00:40:13,642 --> 00:40:17,564
There's no chance I can read that full book in one week.

459
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:19,686
You read the audiobook at 1.4 speed.

460
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:39,066
I know I ran through all that really quickly, but do people have any comments, questions on any of that?

461
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:41,048
Yeah.

462
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:54,557
If NETVRD were to try and explore doing Virto, would that likely be pushed from this committee out, or would that be a staff initiative?

463
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:59,280
I mean, it could go either way.

464
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:04,108
I mean, I think the big issue around that would be the resources to manage it.

465
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:21,399
And I know that, I think that in Boston, there is a fee for, to building owners in order to support those sort of, you know, the staff time and, you know, software and everything that they need to do that.

466
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:25,322
So staff are probably looking for a committee to be pushing

467
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:27,152
forward on this?

468
00:41:27,212 --> 00:41:36,197
Yes, but it would be really important to obviously be working together really closely to make sure there's understanding of what the resources would be needed in order to do something like that.

469
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:50,465
And I think it's important to at least have a couple years of reporting data first, because otherwise it's hard to set the levels of the performance standard.

470
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:55,468
And Boston collected, I think, five years of data before setting their standards.

471
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:09,037
I want to just circle back for a second to the classics, what I'm going to call it.

472
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:11,858
People seem to be interested in having us invite Ms.

473
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,059
Margie Dell to make a presentation.

474
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,181
If that's the case, what month?

475
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:28,819
You should reach out to me after and we'll figure out where it's at.

476
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:34,163
We have no shortage of talented people that want to come in and join us.

477
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:38,966
That's great.

478
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:41,168
I wonder if people know about this tax

479
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:56,594
deduction you can get for, if you're on the energy aggregation, more than the basic program you can get from the Green Energy Consumer Alliance, you can get a tax.

480
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:58,654
It's considered a charitable donation.

481
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:00,435
Yes, that's right, so I got one of those.

482
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:03,436
Yeah, so if you're doing 100% renewables,

483
00:43:05,756 --> 00:43:17,240
Actually, if you're at the default level, that additional 10%, that's considered a charitable donation on your part.

484
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,641
And so you can claim that on your taxes.

485
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:20,661
If you itemize.

486
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,982
If you itemize, yes, exactly.

487
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:27,543
Actually, when the state, you get something off the state, not the federal.

488
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:31,925
I kept doing my TurboTax and every little thing I got the state,

489
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:39,609
rebate refund went up, so you get money back from the state, even if the feds say you're capped at $10,000.

490
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:43,250
I don't think the letter comes to you automatically.

491
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,812
You have to go online and apply for it.

492
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:48,733
I kind of like paying my state and local taxes.

493
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,614
I don't like paying my federal taxes.

494
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:57,412
Two quick things.

495
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:01,396
Could we switch this around back to you, perhaps?

496
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:02,037
Yeah, absolutely.

497
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,380
I think mine's going to die on me.

498
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:12,328
The other thing is, before I do that, I want to, unless there's any more, be cognizant of time and throw to Loretta.

499
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:18,316
who is listed as talking about Truth Medford updates, but that is incorrect.

500
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:24,324
It is actually about the reforestation, municipal reforestation work being done.

501
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:29,451
And of course, Loretta can say it all much better than I, so I'm going to throw it to her.

502
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:31,989
Excuse me.

503
00:44:34,611 --> 00:44:37,192
Actually, I am going to speak about Trees Metro briefly.

504
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:45,057
They had a tree giveaway, pre-tree giveaway, and the application deadline was February 28.

505
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:47,938
But I'm not sure.

506
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:49,699
Maybe people can still apply.

507
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,981
But the reason I bring this up, on March 12,

508
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:57,363
at the library which is next Wednesday from 6 30 to 7 30.

509
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:03,746
There's a training session how to plant bare root trees that I thought I'd share with everybody.

510
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:09,528
Mostly for property owners to plant trees in their property.

511
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:11,989
I hope to attend that to learn something.

512
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,831
Some of the trees that they were giving away free are

513
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,415
up to 10 feet tall and some might be taller.

514
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:22,376
So that's next Wednesday.

515
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:31,601
They also have a program and well, I think I sent you the link to that, but I'm gonna read about this program they have.

516
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:39,865
It's new and I worked with them a little bit on this and it's to nominate a significant tree in Medford.

517
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:42,787
And there's a page link for that.

518
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:44,748
where you can nominate a tree.

519
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:49,049
And I'll just read you the brief outline from Trees Medford.

520
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:52,951
We're on a mission to celebrate the trees that make our community special.

521
00:45:53,491 --> 00:46:04,115
We invite you to help us identify and honor trees in Medford that stand out because of their size, beauty, age, history, or even rare species, whether on public or private property.

522
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:08,857
We want to track and celebrate the health and progress of these remarkable trees over time.

523
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:14,772
how to nominate, share a photo and brief description of a tree you think is significant.

524
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:20,397
Tell us why you believe this tree deserves to be recognized, size, beauty, age, history, rarity, et cetera.

525
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:27,723
Let's work together to protect and appreciate the trees that make Medford thrive in this nomination form.

526
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:35,189
And once they just started this, so once they collect enough, we'll pull with other ideas that could be.

527
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,711
a walking map tour of significant trees.

528
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:47,233
It could be plaques for the trees if they're nominated as special.

529
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:53,994
So I don't know if you can drop that in the chat, the link to it.

530
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:56,335
Give me just one moment.

531
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,495
Sure, I sent it in.

532
00:46:58,496 --> 00:46:58,836
Yes.

533
00:46:59,136 --> 00:46:59,796
No, I have it.

534
00:46:59,836 --> 00:47:03,377
We're fighting a lot of systems all at once today.

535
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:04,097
Right.

536
00:47:12,135 --> 00:47:18,924
And then I'll move on to the act establishing the municipal preforestation bill.

537
00:47:18,944 --> 00:47:23,570
Please do.

538
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:25,953
OK.

539
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:29,738
Mass Community Tree Coalition and the Mass Pollinator

540
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:42,681
network group had a webinar last week regarding the municipal reforestation bill and how to fund it, how to support the funding.

541
00:47:43,842 --> 00:47:51,524
So I attended that and I sent the email out to Brenda and Will to share with the group.

542
00:47:52,985 --> 00:48:00,347
And hopefully you got it through the MEEC email server and this

543
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,987
I'll just talk briefly about the bill.

544
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,147
We have discussed this in the past.

545
00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:13,109
So there's much support for this reforestation bill that will support communities.

546
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:16,470
And I'll just review some of the notes.

547
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,051
The problem is funding it.

548
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:21,931
And this is what this is about.

549
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:25,172
So there's a bond bill coming up.

550
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:30,394
the environmental bond bill to be filed this spring.

551
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:49,657
And we want to show and tell Governor Healey that cities are interested in this, because she won't know unless mayors write in and tell them, you know, we're interested in this municipal bond bill to help support this particular reforestation bill.

552
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:55,238
And this would be to include $100 million over five years

553
00:48:56,915 --> 00:48:57,896
to support this bill.

554
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:06,268
Now the environmental bond bill, I think that's going to be presented in April.

555
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,992
So the Mass Coalition of Trees

556
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:13,406
If I got that right, there's so many notes I have here.

557
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:29,374
Mass Community Tree Coalition, sorry, has been writing and holding these webinars so that we reach out to representatives and senators in Massachusetts to tell them we would like them to support the bill and the bond that will be presented.

558
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:37,657
And our mayor has already signed on to the letter of support to Governor Healy, but there's many that haven't.

559
00:49:41,063 --> 00:49:50,947
I just wanna, there's so many ideas I had about this because there's a lot of links in the email to click on with sample letters.

560
00:49:51,767 --> 00:50:07,134
And I think the most important thing we can do is to contact as individuals, our representatives and senators and the bond bill numbers are in the email to ask them to support the bill for the bond.

561
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:11,676
And so that'll be heard supposedly in April.

562
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:26,049
But going back to some of the notes on the reforestation bill, this helps municipalities with funding for tree planning and sustainability to maintain the existing tree canopy and also plant new trees.

563
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,113
And the priorities are

564
00:50:31,485 --> 00:50:36,449
less cities that have less than 20% tree canopy cover, that's number one.

565
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:41,394
Number two, less than 40% tree canopy cover, and three, less than 60%.

566
00:50:42,094 --> 00:50:44,797
And that could be areas within a city too.

567
00:50:45,658 --> 00:50:56,687
This also includes private property and planting new trees, which would have the biggest impact because they will help with picking the right tree for the right place.

568
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:03,237
And also priorities are to environmental justice neighborhoods.

569
00:51:04,718 --> 00:51:22,265
But some of the things that people don't realize is that it includes funds for workforce development programs, administrative costs to the city, equipment to plant trees and maintain the tree canopy.

570
00:51:23,822 --> 00:51:29,285
purchasing trees, and as I said, maintaining new and existing trees.

571
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:43,011
So we really, it's an amazing program that would be assisted by different government agencies to the towns to help write the application to be considered for these.

572
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:52,515
So one of the things, as I said, I think it's important for us to share, to write to our legislature

573
00:51:53,408 --> 00:51:57,031
to support this bond in the program.

574
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:08,178
And then I was thinking, I have the letter open that they have a sample letter to mayors to write into Governor Healey to

575
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:19,279
offer support for her to present the bond at the stated amount for the act.

576
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,226
But when I looked at the bottom of the bill who was already signed on,

577
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:26,323
It was only a few cities.

578
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,684
And in the webinar, it's really worth watching in that length of the email.

579
00:52:30,704 --> 00:52:31,505
It's about an hour.

580
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:43,727
We have several professional speakers, Green Cambridge, many different people were speaking at that meeting about the bill in detail and what it can provide.

581
00:52:44,488 --> 00:52:54,190
So when I looked at the letter that they sent out, the sample that would go to governors by mayors that mayors can sign on to, it's only one, two, three, four, five cities.

582
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,010
that signed on so far.

583
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:59,512
That's Somerville, Memphis, Chelsea, Cambridge, and Pittsburgh.

584
00:53:00,692 --> 00:53:12,937
And then I remember, you know, the mayor is part of the Metro Mayors Coalition, and that's a group of 17 towns.

585
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:28,340
So, and that would include Arlington, Boston, Brantree, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Lynn, Malden-Maffitt, Melrose, and I'm like, okay, I'm going to write back to this group, the

586
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:46,689
mass community trees organization to see if they contacted this group, instead of all these people, which could be thousands writing to each mayor, maybe they can send out this proposal to the Metro Mayors Coalition to sign on to.

587
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:53,951
Brenda, are you our designee to the Metro Mayors Coalition or does Mayor Blanco-Congo or something?

588
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:54,431
What?

589
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:55,391
I'm sorry?

590
00:53:56,332 --> 00:53:58,132
Our mayor or Alicia.

591
00:53:58,272 --> 00:53:58,653
Okay.

592
00:53:58,813 --> 00:53:59,013
Yes.

593
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:01,727
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.

594
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:05,049
Oh, the question was who goes to Metro mayors.

595
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:13,051
Oh, um, mayor, um, Brianna Langer current is already on the mayor's Metro.

596
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:13,751
Yes.

597
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:17,253
And I was saying that either, either she attends those or Alicia does.

598
00:54:18,013 --> 00:54:18,333
Right.

599
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:30,237
So, but she's already signed the letter to the governor asking for support of this bondo or others in this 17 towns that I'm reading that are members that have not.

600
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:35,980
So that's why I was thinking of contacting them with this list of the mayors from those cities.

601
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:48,909
And because they're part of this coalition to support sustainability, they develop an agenda and an action plan to focus on key issues affecting urban core communities.

602
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:56,314
They promote regional collaborative approaches and utilize a wide range of methods to achieve its objectives.

603
00:55:01,342 --> 00:55:05,424
Would you like to circulate that letter to us to look at at some point?

604
00:55:07,986 --> 00:55:08,486
Which letter?

605
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:12,608
The one that you're proposing to write to the Metro mayors.

606
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:14,770
No, I'm not going to send it.

607
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:28,498
What I'm saying is the mayaskommunitytrees.org group, excuse me, they're the ones that are holding the webinars.

608
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:35,227
and asking for residents and other communities to help spread the word about this.

609
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:46,490
So what I'm proposing that I will do is send them this information about this Metro Mayors Coalition that they can write to and get everyone to sign on.

610
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:51,751
Perfect, love that.

611
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:56,653
So what I'm saying we can do is also contact our

612
00:55:57,898 --> 00:56:03,541
legislators and senators, so they will support the bill, the bond bill.

613
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:10,485
And there's sample letters that we can use to send to them if they ask for an email.

614
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:25,873
And I believe we should have received, Loretta, this information that I forwarded from Loretta, but let me know if you haven't and I can send it to you individually.

615
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:32,994
So that, is there any, are there any questions?

616
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:38,156
Or should we contact, should we do it collectively or?

617
00:56:39,236 --> 00:56:40,477
Individually or collectively?

618
00:56:40,717 --> 00:56:54,343
Individually is probably more impactful, the more people that, it could be groups too, environmental groups, like Friends of the Fells or Mystic River Watershed Association.

619
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:02,409
and maybe Tufts groups.

620
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:04,631
There's so many.

621
00:57:08,954 --> 00:57:16,639
So this template examples in the email that Brenda sent out earlier today or yes?

622
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:17,899
Today.

623
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:18,980
I think it was today.

624
00:57:23,503 --> 00:57:24,003
Good.

625
00:57:24,284 --> 00:57:24,704
Perfect.

626
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:25,705
All right.

627
00:57:26,658 --> 00:57:29,460
With that, thank you so much, Loretta.

628
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:37,765
I'm going to give the floor to Prabita to talk for a little bit about her projects in the works.

629
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:41,327
OK, great.

630
00:57:41,848 --> 00:57:48,832
I think it was also included in Brenda's agenda item.

631
00:57:49,272 --> 00:57:54,476
So two things we are working on, Loretta, Will, Brenda, and I.

632
00:57:56,757 --> 00:57:58,639
for Earth Month.

633
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:01,621
Earth Day is 22nd of April.

634
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:24,759
So the first thing we wanted to do was have a social media campaign, the Go Green website, Energy and Environment Medford, socials, Instagram, Facebook, and also potentially have an advertisement.

635
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:48,619
Basically, the idea is every day post a kind of like a Canva like infographic on tips to become more sustainable in our day-to-day life, whether it's household tips or office place, you know, and it really fits well with the reduced plastic

636
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,921
topic that we were discussing earlier.

637
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:59,924
An Excel sheet was sent around and put together 22 items in there for every weekday in April.

638
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:16,093
with a description and an image idea, hopefully, for an intern to work on.

639
00:59:16,273 --> 00:59:21,897
I've added as much details as possible that I could think of.

640
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:37,888
You can give a cut-off where the members can go and edit potentially, and we'll have to pass it over to a different team, I believe, to work on these every day.

641
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:46,096
That's really just to gather momentum around our Zero Waste initiative as well.

642
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:52,659
That's one thing, and please feel free to chime in, any of you, if I'm missing something.

643
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:59,502
And then the other topic, just to stick within the time slot, I'm rushing a little bit, is to have a…

644
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:09,010
an event, the free flea market, will Brenda and I, Loretta is also going to join.

645
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:19,199
We're working with Tufts and Everything is Free, Medford, folks who are actively involved in both, to have

646
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,422
a free flea market, something like a flea market, but everything is for free.

647
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:31,108
We're going to really highlight that we can keep things out of the landfill.

648
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:36,872
We can add more details to that if you would like.

649
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:47,139
The idea would be to have a central location where folks can drive their things that they want to offer up for free.

650
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,965
someone is not able to transport, we would also have like a map.

651
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:58,052
I believe last year there was a citywide yard sale and the map feature was utilized.

652
01:00:58,172 --> 01:01:04,781
So if I'm offering a couch that I'm not able to drive, I can sign up at my address.

653
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:06,675
put it in the driver.

654
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:09,336
So it's like a big team effort.

655
01:01:09,676 --> 01:01:13,138
We're going to work with the Department of Public Works.

656
01:01:13,918 --> 01:01:18,440
So yeah, so that event is going to be in May.

657
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:27,543
And we actually have another meeting coming up where we are going to talk more details with the Tufts person.

658
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:30,664
Anything I'm missing?

659
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:30,704
I

660
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:41,860
Yeah, I would just add that part of the purpose behind it is to schedule it around when students are leaving.

661
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,583
And Tufts is really excited about doing Christmas in May.

662
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:48,006
Exactly, yes, Christmas in May.

663
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,928
I think it's a really great opportunity to couple with

664
01:01:51,709 --> 01:02:06,414
not just the Tufts community, the Medford community, possibly the Somerville communities as well to kind of have that central space where everyone can exchange those things freely and keep them out of the landfill because goodness knows it just all gets dumped otherwise.

665
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:16,277
So I have to say I furnished after we moved in my living room and made my basement all from everything is free.

666
01:02:17,017 --> 01:02:18,118
Everything is pre-Medford.

667
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:19,018
So

668
01:02:20,968 --> 01:02:24,830
Robita, when is the next meeting date to discuss this?

669
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,370
I forgot.

670
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:29,413
I think it's coming up this week, right?

671
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:32,454
It's Thursday, May 6th.

672
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:36,856
Yeah, I can forward it to you.

673
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:37,817
Okay.

674
01:02:38,477 --> 01:02:41,039
And if there's a phone link or whatever, please.

675
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,600
Yeah, let me forward it.

676
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,200
Thank you.

677
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:56,518
So just to provide general actions and things to look out for as a committee, this will likely be in the first couple weekends of May, the ballparking probably May 10th.

678
01:02:58,938 --> 01:03:00,899
So somewhere in that weekend area.

679
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:13,064
The best thing you can start to do is to find potential volunteers, whether it be yourself or your usual networks of people that you know like to do these things.

680
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:32,795
And as we get more materials, be ready to circulate them, be ready to outreach to companies that do zero waste projects and other initiatives, things especially like repair shops that might want to be invested in getting that space and advertising in that space as well.

681
01:03:34,335 --> 01:03:45,598
So we will have more details forthwith, but until then, just get excited for some extra events to green up our city.

682
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:51,020
So not Earth Week, but not too far from it.

683
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,340
Yeah.

684
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,020
No, it's perfect.

685
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:55,421
So Walmart.

686
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:59,002
Rabita, anything else you'd like to add for the good of the order?

687
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:03,637
No, I mean, that's pretty much it.

688
01:04:03,657 --> 01:04:07,706
I hope the Excel sheet, like I know we went a little back and forth.

689
01:04:07,746 --> 01:04:09,950
I hope it has the details you were looking for Will.

690
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:22,124
Yes, yes, we will keep, I think as we add to it, we'll keep refining it until we get kind of that perfect set that we'll want to send out into the world.

691
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:26,925
But that one is definitely a team effort for those that haven't looked at the sheet.

692
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:34,747
Think about little programs that you know about, sustainability tips you have in mind that you think everybody should know about.

693
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:40,086
Do we want to set a date where we're taking last edits on those?

694
01:04:40,366 --> 01:04:42,206
That would be a great idea.

695
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:42,826
Yeah.

696
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,487
They will need some time to work.

697
01:04:46,107 --> 01:04:53,509
Even if you just do it on Canva, 22 is a lot, so we want to give them enough time to work on it.

698
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:57,189
Maybe the 17th, so two weeks from today.

699
01:04:57,209 --> 01:04:57,289
Yeah.

700
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:00,250
Then that gives another two weeks to

701
01:05:01,382 --> 01:05:03,844
To build and design design and everything.

702
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:04,104
Yeah.

703
01:05:04,505 --> 01:05:04,905
Yeah.

704
01:05:04,925 --> 01:05:08,168
So let's, let's have our final submissions in by yes.

705
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:09,549
Monday, March 17th.

706
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:14,974
Um, and that'll give us time for yeah.

707
01:05:15,174 --> 01:05:17,877
Design refining all those good things.

708
01:05:19,258 --> 01:05:22,641
Uh, so that we can start right on April 1st ready and raring to go.

709
01:05:28,494 --> 01:05:32,396
could you explain that for the rest of the members?

710
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:34,877
Let me see if I can actually share.

711
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:46,481
I didn't hear you say, maybe you did and I missed it, what the plan is that it's going to be a post every day during Earth Month.

712
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:47,582
Yeah, yeah.

713
01:05:47,982 --> 01:05:51,744
Yeah, I think I said it in the beginning, but maybe it wasn't super clear.

714
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:54,987
Yeah, it's going to be a post every day on the different socials.

715
01:05:56,227 --> 01:06:02,712
I think Facebook, different groups on the websites too.

716
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:12,598
We have a small list, and I believe it's also going to be featured in the newsletter, weekly newsletter that the mayor is going to send.

717
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:14,540
So it's going to be like an infographic.

718
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:22,346
on the household to everyday sustainability to April 1 to April 5 if it's the weekdays.

719
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:26,730
So we're collecting for all of the weekdays in April.

720
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:31,314
Yeah, so we'll do daily ones from the planning department social media.

721
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:39,662
And then it sounds like the mayor's social media will do maybe weekly ones where they're combining them together for that week.

722
01:06:40,803 --> 01:06:41,243
That's great.

723
01:06:47,347 --> 01:06:48,567
Any other closing thoughts?

724
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:59,691
Seeing none, I'm going to go to our final section of the night with Josh.

725
01:07:00,651 --> 01:07:01,531
Yeah, thanks.

726
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:14,415
Well, this is brief, but I just wanted to sort of start the conversation with you all on the idea of supporting some sort of work towards fossil fuel divestment here in the city.

727
01:07:15,395 --> 01:07:26,024
Uh, so, you know, our, our collector treasurer has certain, like, responsibilities related to, uh, investments of funds that the city council sort of in turn is responsible for.

728
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:36,574
Um, and I think it would make sense to, uh, do some work, especially some, like, solidarity work with other organizations and on other sort of topic areas.

729
01:07:37,114 --> 01:07:50,678
to develop some sort of ordinance language calling for divestment from any company that uses fossil fuels as more than 15% of their portfolio.

730
01:07:50,938 --> 01:07:54,499
That's the typical threshold for these kinds of industry scans.

731
01:07:54,859 --> 01:08:00,781
I'd also like to expand that, not just

732
01:08:01,822 --> 01:08:23,176
Fossil fuel divestment, but those general impact investing targets such as divesting from gambling, alcohol, and tobacco products, weapons manufacturers, and companies actively involved in countries and areas with humanitarian abuses and human rights violations.

733
01:08:24,957 --> 01:08:34,341
I think this would be a great opportunity for us to promote broader responsibility and support efforts.

734
01:08:34,802 --> 01:08:50,850
As I've talked to other folks involved in 350 and in some of the other cities and towns, I work in Somerville where employee pensions were set to be divested for fossil fuels circa 2014 and have

735
01:08:53,451 --> 01:08:55,732
not necessarily been successfully divested.

736
01:08:56,512 --> 01:09:00,713
Pensions are separately managed.

737
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:13,536
There's a group called HERAC, I don't know how it's supposed to be pronounced, that has a sort of long-standing prohibition on anything that would limit investments done in these public... What is the name of HERAC?

738
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,457
P-E-R-A-C is the organization.

739
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:21,538
I guess I would generally support what you're saying.

740
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:22,078
I think we should

741
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:36,136
have a conversation about whether or not you want to take on the additional political opposition that's going to come with designating various countries as being abuser of human rights.

742
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:38,257
I'm inclined to say yes, take it on.

743
01:09:38,277 --> 01:09:41,639
I think it's not something you should sort of pass by the others seem to me

744
01:09:47,169 --> 01:09:49,110
And I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know.

745
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:54,611
I'm just suggesting we shouldn't let that just slip by as something without having a conversation about it.

746
01:09:54,671 --> 01:10:01,734
And I think what I expect is that, like, I've been hearing that a divestment conversation should be happening.

747
01:10:02,214 --> 01:10:03,174
I'd like to see it happen.

748
01:10:03,214 --> 01:10:11,317
And if it were to come from me or to come from any other group, we would be supportive of it because of its fossil fuel divestment component.

749
01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:15,158
And we may not be the ones to make comments on it.

750
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:18,079
what the UN has decided or the International Court of Justice.

751
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:21,039
A little history and question.

752
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:37,743
Probably 10 years ago, we talked about, so some of the old timers would remember, that we talked about divesting pension funds from fossil fuels and other nasty stuff.

753
01:10:38,554 --> 01:10:47,536
And I think our conclusion then was that we really wanted it to happen, but we it didn't.

754
01:10:49,374 --> 01:11:00,126
feel right to tell city workers what should be done with their pension money, and that we needed to get workers and unions on board first.

755
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:04,330
And at that time, that was plausible.

756
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:08,114
Right now, unions are kind of in a different place than they were then.

757
01:11:08,955 --> 01:11:10,276
And we won't go into that.

758
01:11:10,877 --> 01:11:12,258
But which money are we talking about?

759
01:11:12,278 --> 01:11:15,521
This would be money under the jurisdiction of the treasurer.

760
01:11:15,962 --> 01:11:16,382
OK.

761
01:11:16,862 --> 01:11:21,747
So that is like city funds that are invested, which is not the pension funds.

762
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:24,209
I wholeheartedly support that.

763
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:24,269
OK.

764
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:31,346
of the bad actors on the world stage.

765
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:35,308
There's a conversation to be had in there.

766
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:36,169
Yes.

767
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,490
Absolutely.

768
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:54,618
But I just wanted to start socializing that idea and seeing that if an opportunity came up for people to be supportive of that initiative, that we might be one of those bodies that has some amount of institutional power that we can build to be supportive.

769
01:11:55,707 --> 01:11:59,515
Are there other cities that have done similar ordinances that we can point to?

770
01:12:00,217 --> 01:12:00,458
Yes.

771
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:17,480
Portland, Maine has a pretty strong one, which is related to divestment from businesses and companies involved in human rights abuses, particularly with regards to Israel and Palestine at the moment.

772
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:26,586
City of Boston has a pretty comprehensive fossil fuel, sort of social impact investing proposal on their books.

773
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:30,769
And there, in Somerville, we have

774
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:39,948
the pension fund divestment program that we're working on.

775
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:44,928
the city council would probably say, well, show me something that somebody else has done.

776
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:48,230
So we don't have to be the first one to do it.

777
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,913
I also don't envision us to be the first ones to do anything.

778
01:12:51,993 --> 01:13:04,341
I'm just thinking about this in a larger context and kind of like straw-pulling us to be supportive of a sort of broader divestment initiative, especially one that includes fossil fuel divestment.

779
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,163
Do we need a legal review of this?

780
01:13:06,843 --> 01:13:09,004
I don't think we need anything at the moment.

781
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:36,497
Yeah, I don't know much about this topic personally, and I don't know how much our, you know, our finance department would know about this right now or be supportive about it right now, but I think it's really interesting and, you know, if that's something that the city council pursues and this committee wants to sort of speak up in support of, then that would be

782
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:40,041
interesting to find out sort of what that process would be.

783
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:45,586
Yeah, and I have no illusions about Teamsters 25 being allies in this, so I wouldn't even try.

784
01:13:48,869 --> 01:13:51,311
It was plausible once.

785
01:13:56,295 --> 01:13:56,816
Great, thanks.

786
01:13:57,196 --> 01:13:57,496
Good.

787
01:13:57,716 --> 01:13:58,277
All right.

788
01:13:59,498 --> 01:14:04,983
Any questions, comments, concerns coming from the Zoom side of the world?

789
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:10,051
I see some chats here.

790
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:18,298
Seeing none, I think they're all from past things.

791
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:25,304
Yeah, seeing none, I'm going to move to our final section for new business.

792
01:14:25,384 --> 01:14:36,533
Paul said, perhaps providing options for people for personal finance divestment, as in funds and equities, et cetera, an information sheet on this would help people, which funds, which equities, and so on.

793
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:53,222
Certainly an interesting additional element, something one can do, especially with pension funds, is just add an option to allow for some funds that are not in the main pool to be in a social index fund.

794
01:14:54,082 --> 01:14:57,165
That's what I was able to do in my last public service job.

795
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:02,989
But that's also, I think, a separate but relevant and interesting threat.

796
01:15:08,022 --> 01:15:08,442
Perfect.

797
01:15:10,123 --> 01:15:13,706
Seeing nothing else, let's jump to new business.

798
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:18,269
Anything on people's minds, things that we need to be talking about?

799
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:31,138
Just another potential speaker is that I was approached by somebody who's interested in a dark skies agenda.

800
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:36,382
And she has a model ordinance that she wants to promote.

801
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:48,305
and was trying to figure out how to get started, and said, well, there isn't any obvious group in the city for you to get started with other than us.

802
01:15:52,748 --> 01:16:00,852
So she's, or they, I think they're, they're interested in presenting at

803
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:06,374
our April or May meeting if possible.

804
01:16:06,614 --> 01:16:06,954
Yes.

805
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:16,697
What you might not know is that your chair was formerly working in planetariums and did astronomy shows in dark sky areas.

806
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:18,778
You've checked a really important box for me.

807
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,480
I would love to get their contact info so we can chat.

808
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,280
Okay.

809
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,321
I will share that with you.

810
01:16:29,654 --> 01:16:31,175
Yeah, I miss the dark skies too.

811
01:16:31,536 --> 01:16:36,579
We used to have dark sky around here, you know, in pockets here and there, not so much anymore.

812
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:40,162
Yeah, I would love to pursue that more.

813
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:48,168
So that's just an excitement for me more than anything that I would love to start pushing on.

814
01:16:48,188 --> 01:16:51,911
A few years ago, we went through an LED lighting replacement that

815
01:16:54,937 --> 01:16:56,898
adversely affect dark skies or?

816
01:16:57,058 --> 01:16:59,100
Most of it has to do with just the angling of it.

817
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,722
There's like the physical design of the light more than anything, but.

818
01:17:04,523 --> 01:17:05,284
More directional.

819
01:17:05,344 --> 01:17:07,725
Directional, that's really what counts.

820
01:17:09,066 --> 01:17:12,248
And there is lighting, you know, this dark sky certified.

821
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:13,509
That's reasonable.

822
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,811
So that it shines down on your property, not up into the sky.

823
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,683
And we would get a lot of support.

824
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:26,586
I know I had professors at Tufts that worked on Firefly initiatives.

825
01:17:26,966 --> 01:17:34,330
And a lot of those revolve around the same principles of conscientious lighting and dark sky proposals.

826
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,171
So I will put them in touch with you.

827
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:42,234
And in terms of scheduling, wait on that?

828
01:17:42,734 --> 01:17:43,514
Yeah.

829
01:17:43,554 --> 01:17:46,516
In terms of April or May are probably both good.

830
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:48,863
April, we have the mayor.

831
01:17:48,883 --> 01:17:50,724
April, we'll have the mayor chatting, so.

832
01:17:51,164 --> 01:17:54,865
Yeah, we should talk about, what do we do to prepare for the mayor?

833
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:57,046
We'd love to prepare for the mayor.

834
01:17:57,066 --> 01:17:57,506
Yeah.

835
01:17:57,866 --> 01:18:08,229
I mean, I have a question about, excuse me, so you said April 2nd meeting with the mayor, does that mean that we won't have our regular monthly meeting on that Monday?

836
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:12,630
We'll do it on that Tuesday?

837
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,491
Moving this meeting to Wednesday.

838
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:23,592
Okay, I'm just looking at my account.

839
01:18:24,573 --> 01:18:27,956
Yes, I was just thinking that we would have a really packed agenda for April.

840
01:18:28,157 --> 01:18:28,457
Yeah.

841
01:18:28,477 --> 01:18:28,817
Thank you.

842
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:51,819
In terms of the meeting with the mayor, I mean, what I had suggested to her was just for the committee to talk about the projects that you're working on and that you'd like to work on, and for her to talk about some city priorities that she thought would align with what this group is doing.

843
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:52,799
Right.

844
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:56,760
With the entirety of that agenda.

845
01:18:57,795 --> 01:19:00,256
I don't think it would be the full hour and a half.

846
01:19:00,356 --> 01:19:04,979
I would expect she would be here for half an hour, maybe an hour, I don't know.

847
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:10,842
Yeah, I suspect by 7.15 we'll be able to move on to other projects and keep moving.

848
01:19:12,763 --> 01:19:22,028
But it would be great, perhaps folks that are working towards a project, I'm looking at like Prabipa,

849
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:35,735
Benji, Lois, Loretta, maybe we can discuss putting together a little slide deck or something of that like so that we can organize our thoughts and make sure we're conscientious of our time allotments.

850
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:42,238
Yeah, it'd be really interesting for Josh for you to float that idea as well.

851
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:50,163
And if anyone else feels strongly and has words the mayor needs to hear, by all means, we should

852
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,965
Maybe she circulate a draft slide deck before the meetings.

853
01:19:56,065 --> 01:19:56,325
Yes.

854
01:19:56,586 --> 01:19:57,807
That would be good.

855
01:19:57,907 --> 01:19:58,248
Yeah.

856
01:19:58,388 --> 01:19:58,748
Yeah.

857
01:19:59,068 --> 01:20:04,154
And we can bury you are working on a solar project for a little while now.

858
01:20:04,194 --> 01:20:06,517
I think that we've been working on it for

859
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:14,641
quite a while, but we've also not been working on it since the summer, and certainly not since the election.

860
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:20,522
So, I mean, my head's in a completely different space right now.

861
01:20:20,562 --> 01:20:24,303
Okay, so it would be something useful to discuss with you at this point.

862
01:20:26,343 --> 01:20:36,426
No, I don't think that it would, I don't think it's useful until we've actually ironed out

863
01:20:39,975 --> 01:20:44,136
the wrinkles that we haven't figured out like legality.

864
01:20:44,836 --> 01:21:01,680
I was going to say if there are any state climate bill issues that the mayor should be, we should be lobbying our legislators on.

865
01:21:03,136 --> 01:21:07,140
I don't know if there's any such thing, but we should maybe put that on the table.

866
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,644
Are we aware of any issues other than reforestation?

867
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:19,371
Well, I do have a new business thing.

868
01:21:20,592 --> 01:21:27,859
So at previous meetings, I was talking about rodenticide poisoning for wildlife.

869
01:21:29,412 --> 01:21:40,879
So I did get a message and I'm going to email it to Brenda that apparently there's a bill that was written to be in the use of SCARS rodenticide poisoning.

870
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,361
And I have to look that up.

871
01:21:44,822 --> 01:21:45,923
There's been a lot going on.

872
01:21:46,403 --> 01:21:52,026
So I will find it and send it to Brenda and ask her to email it to you guys.

873
01:21:53,594 --> 01:22:04,357
members share it with you so you can see where it's coming up and that we can write our legislature body to support the bill.

874
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:20,102
Yes, would you, sorry, for the redundant side, would you like to discuss it with

875
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:22,695
the mayor as well.

876
01:22:22,735 --> 01:22:25,916
Would you like to put that into a slide deck piece as well?

877
01:22:26,116 --> 01:22:28,276
Or should we just save some time next session?

878
01:22:34,277 --> 01:22:36,558
Let me get back to you on that.

879
01:22:36,878 --> 01:22:37,998
It may have already happened.

880
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:40,999
I know I got it like a week and a half ago.

881
01:22:41,019 --> 01:22:42,539
Yeah.

882
01:22:43,559 --> 01:22:45,119
There was just a lot of other meetings.

883
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,280
So I have to look it up and see.

884
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:53,332
where this bill is at and who sent the email, who sent the notification.

885
01:22:53,872 --> 01:22:56,214
It might've been a Facebook call.

886
01:22:56,494 --> 01:23:03,919
There's so many cities and wildlife rehabbers that are sharing this, but I just have to vet the information.

887
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:05,981
So I'll get back to you.

888
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:10,704
Okay, yeah, just keep us in the loop, because that's something I would like to follow.

889
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:11,485
All right.

890
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,023
All right, we're looking at two-ish more minutes.

891
01:23:19,183 --> 01:23:19,884
Anything else?

892
01:23:20,505 --> 01:23:21,786
Good for the order, good for the group.

893
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:30,076
Not really enough time to talk about that existential question that we were emailing about earlier this week, but maybe worthwhile to talk about.

894
01:23:30,336 --> 01:23:32,238
Oh, about the purpose of this.

895
01:23:32,418 --> 01:23:36,101
I mean, I think that might be a useful thing just to chat with the mayor about as well.

896
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:43,147
From my perspective, and I think according to sort of the mission of this group, it's kind of twofold.

897
01:23:43,348 --> 01:23:49,973
One is to advise the city on environmental issues, and the other is to do outreach to residents.

898
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:56,174
And so I think both of those things, it's kind of as, it's what you make of it, right?

899
01:23:56,214 --> 01:24:00,955
So if you want to be more active, then you can be more influential there.

900
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:12,259
I can't remember if I sent my email to the whole group, but I mean, I think that my argument is in addition to those things, it's a launching pad for other stuff.

901
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:22,856
We can see if the mayor wants to change our mission.

902
01:24:25,017 --> 01:24:35,420
I think the big goal I'd love to see from the conversation with the mayor is just to see where we can find alignment and be as useful and directed as possible.

903
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:41,382
Because I think we can plan a lot of things, and I'd love to make sure they're in alignment.

904
01:24:44,823 --> 01:24:48,324
I think there's a lot of expertise on this.

905
01:24:49,858 --> 01:24:53,539
body, like more than there is in most bodies in the city.

906
01:24:54,419 --> 01:24:57,240
And that the mayor probably is not aware of that.

907
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:12,604
And I think that the number of scientists and engineers and architects in this group, and lawyers, I mean, it's, it's like, it's impressive.

908
01:25:12,964 --> 01:25:15,725
And I think it would

909
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,581
it might give us more clout to make her aware of that.

910
01:25:21,661 --> 01:25:27,942
It might be a good idea to just go around and have folks just briefly introduce themselves and sort of their background.

911
01:25:28,622 --> 01:25:31,683
And brag in this context.

912
01:25:31,763 --> 01:25:33,203
Permission granted to brag.

913
01:25:33,243 --> 01:25:37,644
Make sure our agenda list is up to date as best as possible.

914
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:44,565
Our bios, little bio sketches, pictures and all that stuff.

915
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:51,714
I mean, I know members of this group have sort of represented the city at things officially in the past.

916
01:25:51,774 --> 01:25:59,879
I think Alicia had Luke go to some sort of statewide meetings for her at one point.

917
01:26:00,559 --> 01:26:04,241
And I think that's happened with some others of you as well in the past.

918
01:26:04,301 --> 01:26:07,303
So yeah, a lot of expertise here.

919
01:26:09,488 --> 01:26:15,211
But yeah, I think it'll be important next month to represent ourselves well.

920
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:23,676
And we'll show off a little and make sure that we're being used as well as just kind of making our own path.

921
01:26:26,017 --> 01:26:30,559
Actually, maybe Brenda, well, whoever is doing the introductions, probably you will.

922
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,222
But if it's Brenda beforehand.

923
01:26:37,143 --> 01:26:45,687
to prep her for, this is a very high power group.

924
01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:49,469
We want you to know that.

925
01:26:55,932 --> 01:26:59,314
Looking at the clock, do we have any final motions?

926
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:03,136
You're adjourned.

927
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:04,837
I can take that.

928
01:27:06,363 --> 01:27:07,287
Of any opposed?

929
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,871
Seeing none, let's get out of here.

930
01:27:11,891 --> 01:27:12,795
I will see you all April 2nd.
