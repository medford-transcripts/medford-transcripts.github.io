[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper 24-045, the annual budget process for fiscal 25.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,773

9
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And tonight this is the second preliminary budget meeting of the FY 25 budget process.

[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has communicated the following presentations will occur in the following departments will be present.

12
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:07,341
[SPEAKER_04]: as it stands now, kind of the top lines of the budget, and we will also hear from the legislative department, which is the city council, the city clerk, and the finance department.

13
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are all here and we are all present.

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:24,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Given that, I will turn it over to the chief of staff and the finance director, Nina Nazarian and Bob Dickinson, to give us the first look at our fiscal 25 budget, as well as a financial update.

15
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:31,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Can everyone hear me?

16
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:34,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an echo.

17
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hello.

18
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:42,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I have this before you.

19
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,371
[SPEAKER_07]: This is page one, obviously, the intro of the agenda.

20
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:47,071
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we're going to go through tonight.

21
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:51,113
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on in the finance department right now?

22
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,179
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on in the budget.

23
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:58,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you have budget sheets as of the third quarter for the city for 2024.

24
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:17,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll go through revenue estimates, the levy limit, local receipts, total available for the budget, the budget, things that are impacting the 2025 budget process, and then adjustments that we've made to try and make that look better, basically.

25
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on right now with us?

26
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:29,186
[SPEAKER_07]: State reporting and

27
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,872
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty much done with state reporting.

28
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:47,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to put it in the format that the state likes, ship it off to the Department of Local Services, our representative there.

29
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in touch with her.

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,300
[SPEAKER_07]: She knows that's going on.

31
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,904
[SPEAKER_07]: The fiscal 23 books are all closed.

32
00:02:54,064 --> 00:03:00,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I get the state reporting in, that gets shipped off to the auditors, and they will

33
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:06,174
[SPEAKER_07]: they will put out the audit, they do our Schedule A so that all of that work will be done.

34
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:09,938
[SPEAKER_07]: They do our fixed asset reporting and everything.

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:22,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And once the state has all that information, they will give us a number for free cash and retained earnings for sewer enterprise funds, sewer water enterprise fund.

36
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:34,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Our DLS representative is putting it in her schedule, so I expect that the turnaround shouldn't be long, at least I'm hoping, and then we'll have numbers for that.

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what's going on with that one.

38
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:47,422
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, general fund budget.

39
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the budget, the third quarter actuals with you right now.

40
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,369
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see, the general fund budget was $179 million.

41
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford Public Schools were $71,227.

42
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,853
[SPEAKER_07]: They also used $2.8 million in ESSER funds, which are one-time funding.

43
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:13,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to incorporate that into the fiscal 2025 budget.

44
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:19,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we've spent that, we will be able to cover it in the general fund budget, hopefully.

45
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:21,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I've worked closely with

46
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Jerry, who's the finance director over at the schools.

47
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, we believe that the public school budget will actually come in.

48
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:35,803
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be balanced.

49
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,143
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be very, very tight.

50
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:47,386
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't expect to have to do any budget transfers in order to cover a deficit for them right now.

51
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:48,867
[SPEAKER_07]: This is

52
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:54,203
[SPEAKER_07]: based on Jerry's projections, and I will be talking to him tomorrow.

53
00:04:55,463 --> 00:05:02,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, as we get closer to the end of June, I will be talking to him on an ongoing basis.

54
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna make sure that there's no surprises there.

55
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:12,270
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on.

56
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:16,532
[SPEAKER_07]: New faces here.

57
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:26,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody need a primer on proposition two and a half, new growth, the levy limit, state aid, cherry sheets?

58
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:36,360
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get into more detail when I show you the estimates for these, but if you're comfortable enough with what these things are, we could just move on.

59
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

60
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:44,179
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to hear more about the last one, state aid, chair sheets, and other things.

61
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:52,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, our friend UGA, Unrestricted General Government Aid, Chapter 70, School Aid, Veterans Benefits.

62
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,133
[SPEAKER_07]: This is state funding that they give us every year.

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Against that, there are a bunch of state assessments, for instance, charter school tuition.

64
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:08,225
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few others.

65
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:14,749
[SPEAKER_07]: There's $150,000 in the revenue side that goes directly to the library, et cetera.

66
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:27,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually what happens with state aid is the governor will put out an estimate at the beginning of midway through the previous fiscal year, and then

67
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:47,635
[SPEAKER_07]: The legislature, I have most of this stuff up here if you actually want the categories, but, I was thinking terminology, cherry sheets, yeah.

68
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:57,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Governors, House Ways and Means, and then the Senate comes and does a proposal, and then at the end they all get together and decide on how much we're gonna

69
00:06:58,146 --> 00:06:59,907
[SPEAKER_07]: be given and how much we have to pay.

70
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a large amount of Chapter 70 money and charter school tuition reimbursement.

71
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:15,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Unrestricted general government aid is also a big factor.

72
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:25,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Veterans benefits exemptions for the elderly and veterans, state-owned land,

73
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:36,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And going down here, the big ones on this side are MBTA, Transportation Authority.

74
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:37,722
[SPEAKER_07]: We get assessed for that.

75
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:40,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other smaller stuff.

76
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:46,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And then school choice sending tuition, charter school sending tuition, we get assessed for those.

77
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,748
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Chapter 90 at all.

78
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Chapter 90 is entirely separately.

79
00:07:56,352 --> 00:08:05,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a special revenue fund, and we're allocated to the entirely off-budget thing.

80
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:13,009
[SPEAKER_07]: We're allocated a certain amount by the state to fix roads, and that's managed by the DPW, and they figure out what roads.

81
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Chapter 90 says,

82
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,326
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give you $4 million.

83
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,426
[SPEAKER_07]: You have $4 million.

84
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:23,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And DPW will come up with projects.

85
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,948
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to repave the street for $1 million.

86
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we'll repave the street.

87
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Chapter 90 will give us back the money.

88
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's basically how that all works.

89
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's on an ongoing basis.

90
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:40,776
[SPEAKER_07]: DPW comes down every month or two saying, sign this.

91
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:41,376
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get money.

92
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to sign things where we'll get money.

93
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:46,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me happy.

94
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:49,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

95
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:56,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clarify that too, you can go, the Division of Local Services has a great website online where you can see the cherry sheet.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,763
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the historical cherry sheet and also the estimates of different budgets.

97
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:08,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Shane, for giving us a booster for the microphone.

98
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:17,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the other thing to note, maybe just backing up right to the beginning here, tonight we're basically just talking about the general fund budget.

99
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:33,958
[SPEAKER_04]: we're not talking about water store enterprise and then we're not talking about anything else special revenue funds or other fee fee or grant funded essentially things that are outside of the general fund budget council

100
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you talk a little bit more about what you just said about charter schools?

101
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:45,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not aware about there being a reimbursement for charter school tuition.

102
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:53,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we only paid out for charter school tuition when students attend charter schools that would normally attend Medford public schools.

103
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: You could talk about it.

104
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I just look at these numbers.

105
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,561
[SPEAKER_07]: That's mostly a school thing to me.

106
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:10,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the way that the state works, so and I worked on a bunch of education legislation, which is the only reason I'm chiming in here, but.

107
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a charter school reimbursement formula.

108
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So when a student moves from the public school system to the charter school system, there's a three-year step-down reimbursement.

109
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:26,526
[SPEAKER_04]: In their first year, I think it's 100%, second year, 80%, third year, 60%, and the year after that, 0%.

110
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:32,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So we send out over 8 million, I think, or around 8 million a year.

111
00:10:34,571 --> 00:11:00,222
[SPEAKER_04]: to charter schools we only get back somewhere in the one to two million dollar range maybe 1.6 I'd have to look at the cherry sheet but it's um it's does not fully reimburse the cost of charter sending and charter sending is our by far the biggest assessment that is placed on the city by the state so that so this is just sorry this is just the quick summary of what revenue we we receive from the state on the bottom

112
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:09,937
[SPEAKER_02]: reimbursements for various things, accounting for the small reimbursement for the charter schools.

113
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:10,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

114
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought that might be a cool new program I hadn't heard about yet.

115
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:17,639
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's part of the formula.

116
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the case.

117
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:18,839
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

118
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

119
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's all.

120
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,122
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just type in mass cherry sheets, it'll come up with a website.

121
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,543
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at the historical data, et cetera, et cetera.

122
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at what I've got up here right now,

123
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:53,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, no, we're going to have to, the governor's proposal says charter schools sending tuition, um, $8.3 million, but then they're going to give us back.

124
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:57,542
[SPEAKER_04]: They're giving us back, uh,

125
00:11:59,081 --> 00:11:59,662
[SPEAKER_07]: 1.162 right now.

126
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But 631 in the house ways and means.

127
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:03,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

128
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a total mess.

129
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:15,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it tends to be this way that we use, when I'm looking at, I can talk about this later, but basically I use the governor's proposal.

130
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It usually comes in slightly larger.

131
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:27,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't seem to come in, like the total, the net we get from cherry sheets usually does not come in much more than what the governor says.

132
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:35,003
[SPEAKER_07]: So the governor's initial proposal is usually a relatively conservative estimate for our revenue side.

133
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, we could go on with this.

134
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:42,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put up the cherry shoot for a second.

135
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:44,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to put that back.

136
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the revenue side.

137
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the estimate that Bob was using here.

138
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,946
[SPEAKER_04]: This 34, I'm guessing, if you're using the governor's budget estimate.

139
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these are the charges.

140
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So the T is about $5 million.

141
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:04,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Charter school sending is $8 plus million.

142
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:09,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow the Taos formula has us paying a lot less, but also getting a lot less back.

143
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:16,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to interrupt your share.

144
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:19,248
[SPEAKER_04]: You may re-share your presentation.

145
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,589
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

146
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:24,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's better at this.

147
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:44,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I know where I am, right.

148
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:50,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so levy limit, this is fairly straightforward.

149
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Proposition two and a half.

150
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Our levy limit on the fiscal 2024 recap was 139,985.22.

151
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,843
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the maximum amount that we can collect in property taxes.

152
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So real estate, personal property taxes, that's the total.

153
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:18,292
[SPEAKER_07]: For fiscal 2025, we're allowed a 2.5% increase.

154
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:20,574
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $3.499 million.

155
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:30,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the assessor works very hard to give me estimates on how much he thinks certified new growth will end up.

156
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:33,204
[SPEAKER_07]: The $2.25 million is an estimate.

157
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we get around to recap time,

158
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:45,967
[SPEAKER_07]: that the actual members will come in, but right now, that's pretty much what he's comfortable saying new growth will be.

159
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:52,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Councilor Kiley.

160
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

161
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:59,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there somewhere that we can look up what new growth has been in previous years?

162
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:03,716
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also see that if you go to the Division of Local Services Municipal Finance dashboard,

163
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, for instance, we estimated at $2.5 million.

164
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually came in at 2.8.

165
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:22,435
[SPEAKER_07]: But some fairly large developments closed last year, so they go on the tax rolls.

166
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:25,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this year,

167
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,454
[SPEAKER_07]: On this one, I have to defer to the assessor for his estimate.

168
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,015
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he's comfortable saying.

169
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:42,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of push him on it, which I did, but he says, look, you know, we can't go any higher than that.

170
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:49,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you put all those numbers together, we're thinking that for fiscal 2025, we'll be able to get about $145,734,000.

171
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:57,183
[SPEAKER_07]: from our tax base.

172
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,728
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our friend local receipts.

173
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Local receipts is always, all of these numbers are estimates.

174
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:18,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to look at the fiscal 2024 revenue streams to see where they're headed and to put in,

175
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,294
[SPEAKER_07]: various things in order to come up with a number.

176
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:27,517
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, payments in lieu of taxes, pilot.

177
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:33,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of those sums, and they're big, come in in June.

178
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm putting in how much I think those will be.

179
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:40,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'm looking at our motor vehicle excise receipts.

180
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:45,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So far, the numbers I have are of the end of March.

181
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:49,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm saying, OK, we'll make one third more than that.

182
00:16:50,330 --> 00:17:01,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I'm looking at our local receipts for 2024, I'm thinking they will come in slightly over $22 million.

183
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,684
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, that's an estimate.

184
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:05,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

185
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:08,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

186
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:14,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Apologize, I switched over to my laptop so I can see the presentation a little bit better.

187
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:25,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back, I know that for transparency's sake, if we could, Council President, can we please make it a motion to ask for the

188
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:32,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Projections of new growth for the last 3 years through the chair through the.

189
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:35,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Assessor and the budget director's office.

190
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:40,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, that just eliminates any questions that if I come up.

191
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:48,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bring something up and it's something that won't be questioned because it's coming from the department that's supposed to give us that information.

192
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I would really appreciate that.

193
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:49,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

194
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:51,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

195
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:54,415
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion from Councilor to request the new growth.

196
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,517
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the amounts for the last 3 fiscal years.

197
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:11,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please the projections and projections and what we were what we end up getting if we could just for just so we can have an understanding of what we looked at in the past and what we actually had in the past.

198
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can at least estimate what we're really looking at because 2.5 is pretty pretty dismal.

199
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, we will.

200
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that motion we'll take all the motions at the end of the meeting.

201
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:33,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have a motion to last 3 years of projections and the actuals for new growth for the property tax.

202
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:35,903
[SPEAKER_04]: The new growth element.

203
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:38,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

204
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:39,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

205
00:18:41,782 --> 00:18:46,403
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the actual new growth numbers are on the recap.

206
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can look at historical data for that.

207
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:57,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that for the previous fiscal year, I was estimating we'd get about 2.5 million in new growth.

208
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,106
[SPEAKER_07]: It came in slightly higher than that at 2.8.

209
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the year prior to that,

210
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:10,174
[SPEAKER_07]: This was my first year, my estimate was 18.5 and it came in significantly higher than that.

211
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:10,174
1.85?

212
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:10,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

213
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to look at my notes.

214
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like to spew out numbers.

215
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:23,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I've checked them eight times.

216
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we can get that.

217
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:29,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, I don't know what the estimate for the prior year was.

218
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very low.

219
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:36,412
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 15 something, I think, and it came in much

220
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:41,595
[SPEAKER_07]: came in higher than that, but we'll get those numbers to you.

221
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,136
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a problem.

222
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:47,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, so major components of local receipts.

223
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,400
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty normal.

224
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Motor vehicle excise.

225
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knows about motor vehicle excise who lives in Medford.

226
00:19:55,644 --> 00:20:05,191
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a nice, as the pandemic ended and supply chain issues were worked out, people went out and bought new cars.

227
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had a nice bump.

228
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:08,418
[SPEAKER_07]: a few years ago.

229
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Since then, it's basically been flat, because once people buy new cars, they tend to hang on to them.

230
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:18,565
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not really expecting that to be any larger.

231
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Same hotel meals, same thing.

232
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:27,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Once the pandemic's over, people started going out eating, and they started going back to hotels.

233
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:35,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't have any new huge hotels in Medford, so probably that is going to be maybe a little bit more looking at it.

234
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,338
[SPEAKER_07]: but probably not.

235
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:48,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Building permits have been fairly flat for the last few years, so that's the data I have, so that's what I'm expecting when I'm looking at.

236
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:55,314
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all things that I'm projecting are part of that 22.145 estimate, and they're the major components of it.

237
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:09,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Investment income, our treasurer has done a lot of work making sure that our money is invested to get the most money out of it.

238
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:15,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've actually done better in investment income this year than we had in the previous year.

239
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:18,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I think last year it was only about 1.7 or something like that.

240
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:22,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're up with investment income, which is a good thing.

241
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:30,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, there's all sorts of other smaller things in local receipts, licenses and permits.

242
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:34,998
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get a wedding license, that goes in the local receipts.

243
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:41,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, the big line on that is 22.145.

244
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm guessing we'll end up with at the end of the year.

245
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:46,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Not guessing, but estimating.

246
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,323
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best I can come up with.

247
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:58,006
[SPEAKER_07]: So for 2025, I'm working with $21 million.

248
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:08,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Local receipts is one of those things that people in my position always like to underestimate.

249
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:22,244
[SPEAKER_07]: The reasons for that is it makes up, it's usually one of the more estimated components of the revenue where you're expecting for the next year.

250
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:32,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I'm doing it, I like to make sure that I have room in case we don't actually make those numbers.

251
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is because of two things, and they're written up there.

252
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:47,812
[SPEAKER_07]: The Department of Revenue, if they look at our actuals for fiscal 2025 and they say, you're nowhere near making this money, then we have a problem.

253
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:51,836
[SPEAKER_07]: They will call me up and say, Bob, you have to justify this number.

254
00:22:53,077 --> 00:23:00,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes there's stuff in there that I can actually say, yeah, this is why that's up by this amount of money.

255
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:08,860
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they don't accept my explanation, then we get into November, early December, we're doing the tax recap.

256
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,507
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to call a council meeting, we'll have to redo the entire 2025 budget.

257
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:19,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll make our revenue estimates in a way that they will accept.

258
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And that pushes everything backwards.

259
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:28,671
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that we don't get our actual tax bills out, because the recap doesn't get finalized until we've redone the budget.

260
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:33,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we won't be able to get our tax bills out in a timely manner.

261
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:39,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they won't be due until the end of March, the end of May.

262
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Where am I?

263
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:47,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna pick a month now, the end of April, sorry.

264
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I should know this because I just had to pay taxes on my house, but I'm sitting there going March, April, which it's a quarter.

265
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's- Point being, we would like to not have this happen.

266
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:57,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

267
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:00,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it's a cashflow problem too.

268
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,804
[SPEAKER_07]: If we don't get the tax bills out, then people aren't paying us in January, they're just paying everything in April.

269
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,405
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's...

270
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:18,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also going through budgets again and coming in front of the council for another lovely session of figuring out what the budget is.

271
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:29,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, $21 million makes me nervous, but there we are.

272
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:32,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Cherry sheets.

273
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,368
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we get into the details of that.

274
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Estimated receipts, $34 million.

275
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Estimated charges, $13 million.

276
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:49,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So our net cherry sheet revenue under the governor's recommendations right now will be slightly over $20 million.

277
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually less than we got in fiscal 2024.

278
00:24:56,604 --> 00:25:10,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, historically, once the Ways and Means and the Senate get together and talk about it, maybe the final thing, that number goes up by, it can vary, but it's usually a few hundred thousand dollars.

279
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was one year it was actually significant.

280
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,051
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a million or something like that.

281
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do I have that piece of paper?

282
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:37,309
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

283
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:37,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

284
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:42,030
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last four years, it's varied between going up by $200,000 to going up by $1.4 million.

285
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Naturally, I would love it to go up by $1.4 million, but I can't count on that.

286
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:53,446
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we use the governor's proposals.

287
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:59,309
[SPEAKER_07]: We can refine that number if it really looks like Ways and Means and Senate come in much higher.

288
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:05,572
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, when I'm putting all this stuff together, that's why I'm using the governor's numbers.

289
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:10,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, trying to be conservative about the actual revenue that we will actually get.

290
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:23,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Other revenue transfers, the casino mitigation funds that we get from the Encore funds repositions.

291
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:31,659
[SPEAKER_07]: We get transfers in from sale lots and perpetual care to fund DPW cemetery budget.

292
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:41,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And then indirect costs, obviously, when we're putting together, when we're doing AP, we're paying bills for the water sewer department.

293
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,846
[SPEAKER_07]: When we do payroll, we're doing that.

294
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:53,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are costs incurred by the finance department, which are directly, indirectly attributable to the water sewer fund.

295
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:59,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, health insurance costs and pension benefits come out of the general fund.

296
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:11,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So every year, the Water Sewer Enterprise Fund is assessed an indirect cost number to basically fund the services it receives from the general fund.

297
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are our revenue sources.

298
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe, yeah, is that showing up correctly?

299
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:24,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll give you a minute or two to digest this one.

300
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:39,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You come, we have all the stuff you saw in the first page, our estimated levy capacity, which includes new growth.

301
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:48,070
[SPEAKER_07]: We have local receipts, state aid plus the library funding, sale of lots, what we're getting from the casino.

302
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:56,514
[SPEAKER_07]: then non-budgeted expenses, state assessments, state aid and state assessments are both off of the cherry sheets.

303
00:27:57,534 --> 00:28:12,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Snow and ice deficit, that's a legal deficit under Massachusetts law, so if we've overspent, if we had a bad winter, we can actually take those expenses and raise them on the recap, it's a legal deficit.

304
00:28:14,002 --> 00:28:21,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And that simply means that the DPW highway budget isn't over budget because we've raised them on the subsequent recap.

305
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:41,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, snow and ice deficit is around $350,000, but we have two months left in the year, and they usually use part of that funding to do things like fix cracks and potholes that have occurred during the winter because of snow and ice.

306
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we are in that.

307
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:46,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Overlay, that's...

308
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: the allowance for abatements.

309
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:53,437
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a good amount of numbers there.

310
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:54,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I work with the assessor.

311
00:28:54,878 --> 00:29:10,171
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks at legal cases that are coming down the road to try and figure out if we have enough in our abatement pot, which is the sum of all the abatements in prior years minus all the abatements that have been issued.

312
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:15,100
[SPEAKER_07]: to see how much money we have in total.

313
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we get hit with a big abatement, we will be able to actually fund that.

314
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:24,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't cause a problem in our receivables.

315
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:29,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, we try to put in money every year.

316
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,869
[SPEAKER_07]: This year we think we have an adequate amount in it.

317
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're proposing to put in $200,000

318
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: just to keep funding it, but it's not anywhere near what it has been in prior years.

319
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:52,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a little bit of money in there that's used to prosecute tax title cases.

320
00:29:53,935 --> 00:30:05,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the total non-budgeted expenses, which leaves $188 million in change to actually fund the general fund budget for fiscal 2025.

321
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:13,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

322
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:14,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions at this point?

323
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:36,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, I will say I think that is a, you know, we need to see the expense side of things, but that's almost $10 million more than last year, so we can always do better and do more, but that is a relatively significant number, and I think we should be aware of that.

324
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:39,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Our costs are probably growing faster, and I'm sure that's what the next slides are going to tell us.

325
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:40,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

326
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:46,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, as the budget, the devil is in the details, obviously.

327
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what's going on with the budget.

328
00:30:50,488 --> 00:31:08,412
[SPEAKER_07]: The assistant finance director, the chief of staff, and the mayor have been working with department heads to look at all of, every single line item in their budgets to make sure we are cutting them as close to the bone as we can.

329
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,042
[SPEAKER_07]: This involves looking at how much they've actually spent in the last five years.

330
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:24,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Keeping with the budget ordinance that we've been working on, we're trying to keep those things, even though that hasn't been finalized.

331
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:31,370
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to keep working on this, and it will be ongoing through mid-May.

332
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,629
[SPEAKER_07]: These year budgets will come first.

333
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:39,929
[SPEAKER_07]: My budget is fairly simple, so I'll be talking about that later.

334
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:46,250
[SPEAKER_07]: But as those budgets become finalized, we'll bring them before the council, and the council can review them.

335
00:31:47,191 --> 00:31:50,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we should have the whole shebang ready by the end of May.

336
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:57,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like last year, it should be done by the end of May, and then we can take a look at it then.

337
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Going on, here's what's fun.

338
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:09,681
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the things that we're running into this year.

339
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:19,632
[SPEAKER_07]: The GIC rates, that's the group health insurance, which provides health insurance to all of the city's employees, pretty much.

340
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,195
[SPEAKER_07]: They're expecting it to go up by 10%.

341
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Fiscal 2024 budget was $25.5 million, 10%.

342
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:31,589
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do the math in your head.

343
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:36,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're looking at over $28 million now for health insurance.

344
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:46,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I'd take a side note right here to just think about how I think about these things.

345
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,358
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have Proposition 2.5, you can only get 2.5% more

346
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:55,690
[SPEAKER_07]: from tax rates to fund the budget.

347
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:13,856
[SPEAKER_07]: To pop on new growth, our tax levy capacity has been, in the last five years or so, I think, been going up by maybe three or four percent, given two and a half plus new growth, right?

348
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:20,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Local receipts were down, but now, as we've seen before, local receipts, they're probably pretty flat.

349
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:27,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Carry sheets go up every year usually, but this year it doesn't seem like they're going up by very much.

350
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:36,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you have a significant portion of your budget go up by 10%, that causes a problem.

351
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,911
[SPEAKER_07]: workers compensation is another one.

352
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:45,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a smaller budget, but we had $675,000 in it for fiscal 2024.

353
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,914
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that on your sheets.

354
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We're expected that we won't make it on that.

355
00:33:52,275 --> 00:34:05,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so we're putting in, this is also working with human resources and our consultants on workers comp to see if there are any workers comp cases out there that need to be settled, et cetera.

356
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that can end up in lump sum payments that are significant.

357
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:20,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So for fiscal 25, we've gone up 16.7% on what we're thinking that will end up costing.

358
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:24,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, a lot more than three or 4% that we can get from the tax revenue.

359
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:29,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Pension obligations, again, that's another one.

360
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:43,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We are trying to fully fund our pension obligations by fiscal 2032, which is sooner than we were required to do so, but it's a prudent thing to do.

361
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:51,856
[SPEAKER_07]: They will be going up probably 6% per year, the amount that we have to put into that.

362
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:57,384
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's also on your sheets, that's a significant amount of money every year.

363
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:10,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Then finally, we've settled a lot of contracts in 2024, which is great, but that means that

364
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:17,067
[SPEAKER_07]: all of those contracts now have to be the new pay rates come into effect.

365
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:24,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the contracts, in fact, all of the contracts that we've settled have a pay increase as of July 1st.

366
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:30,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you think about, for instance, the clerical contract, which

367
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:34,163
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't had a contract since 2019.

368
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:46,871
[SPEAKER_07]: If you give them a pay raise, if you do retroactive raises, you're looking at 2%, or just non-union personnel, when we voted that one, it was 2%, 2%, 2%.

369
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:55,957
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the non-union personnel, and this isn't even counting if non-union gets another 2% as of July 1st,

370
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's 6% for all the non-union employees.

371
00:36:01,356 --> 00:36:05,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, more than the three or 4% we can be expecting from tax rate growth.

372
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So compounding, yeah.

373
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:17,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And clerical, you know, clerical is a lot just because, and it impacts all sorts of budget because the clerical employees are spread all over the city.

374
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:38,063
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you don't have a contract, when you don't have any pay increase since 2019, and then you do, I think they got four pay increases, five pay increases during that time period, it adds up to a significant amount of increased costs that are in the general fund now.

375
00:36:39,044 --> 00:36:45,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, for 2024, we funded the retro pay that we had to pay them with a separate line on it.

376
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:51,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But this year for 2025, we have to cover all those costs in the general fund.

377
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:57,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a general estimate of across the whole budget what the contractual increases are?

378
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:02,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a dollar amount?

379
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a dollar amount for them.

380
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's kind of hard because the unions

381
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:20,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the fire union, the fire union, there were 107 employees that were covered by the contract, but there are more people in the fire department.

382
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:26,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not, you have to pull out those people when we're looking at the budgets.

383
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:29,052
[SPEAKER_07]: we're looking at the total salary number.

384
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:33,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, we're taking into account the 107 firefighters and their increases.

385
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

386
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're also clerical employees or people who are not covered by those contracts.

387
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:40,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

388
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:51,139
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't actually have specific amounts that in 2025 would be attributable to finalizing these contracts.

389
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:51,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

390
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:59,956
[SPEAKER_07]: When we do individual budgets, you can see which, you will be able to see what percentages these are going up for salaries.

391
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:02,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's one of the things.

392
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:09,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the DPW was settled, again, it's just math.

393
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just because we hadn't settled these contracts for so long.

394
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:17,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that down the line, as we move through the process, that'll be kind of helpful for us to see and show.

395
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:19,649
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've already got it here at

396
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: just with these three, the health insurance and given the pension and workers comp.

397
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have 9 million more revenue.

398
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Just those three items is 3.5 out, because that's a fixed cost increase on the benefit side.

399
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:44,598
[SPEAKER_04]: As we move through the department budgets, we'll be able to see however many millions the contractual obligations to our union and non-union employees cost.

400
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:46,478
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably millions more.

401
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're talking about that 9 million

402
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:58,571
[SPEAKER_04]: increase going away pretty quickly with the cost growth that we have without adding anything new or doing anything more than we're doing right now.

403
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

404
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:17,201
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more just a curiosity question, but with the health insurance, is there any possibility or is it feasible at all to switch health insurance providers or is that just a non-starter?

405
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:25,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been really part of those negotiations.

406
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:28,125
[SPEAKER_07]: GIC covers a lot.

407
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to speak to that?

408
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:33,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

409
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:34,769
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit shorter here.

410
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:38,251
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did look at that.

411
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:41,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought in a broker some time ago.

412
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:45,315
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually collect your losses and use that information.

413
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:46,996
[SPEAKER_00]: The broker evaluated that.

414
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:55,303
[SPEAKER_00]: the essentially the claims, I said losses, I meant claims, the claims have shown, you know, high history.

415
00:39:55,463 --> 00:40:06,953
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion at the time, and I don't believe anything has changed since that review was conducted, the claims are in such a position that we probably wouldn't want to get out of the GIC at this stage.

416
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:07,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Now,

417
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:13,059
[SPEAKER_00]: This rate increases relatively new information and news to us.

418
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:17,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that certainly would need to be taken into consideration.

419
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be with with any new piece of information.

420
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:22,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Further evaluation is always needed.

421
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:29,122
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I don't, it does take some time to move out of the GIC.

422
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:43,446
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a process by which it would have to be done by a certain date and so on and so forth that I couldn't recite off the top of my head, but I can tell you that it's a substantial process and not long ago when we looked at it, it wasn't in the city's advantage.

423
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:56,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And along those lines, just essentially when we're in the Group Insurance Commission, the GIC, we are with almost every other city and town buying health insurance with them.

424
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:59,676
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea being that in a larger pool, you pay less.

425
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:06,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a proposed rate increase or did the Group Insurance Commission actually vote this increase through?

426
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:08,038
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding it's been voted.

427
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:08,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been voted.

428
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:09,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

429
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:10,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

430
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:17,931
[SPEAKER_07]: and needless to say, weird.

431
00:41:19,404 --> 00:41:34,928
[SPEAKER_07]: scrutinizing our actual expenses for fiscal 2024 and looking into what our probable expenses will be for fiscal 2025 based on who actually is in these plans and which plans they are in right now.

432
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:37,689
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's other components to this.

433
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:47,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, if somebody is a new employee and has been an individual for a couple of years and then gets married, they go on the family plan that costs more, so.

434
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:53,160
[SPEAKER_07]: there has to be a little bit of overage in there for situations like that.

435
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:58,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but we're monitoring that very closely because it's a big number.

436
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:03,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So, any more questions on this one?

437
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:10,273
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

438
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:17,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so when we first looked at this, we were looking at a larger deficit.

439
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:23,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when I was prevailed upon to increase the local receipt.

440
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:27,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Initially, I wanted to go with $20 million for local receipts.

441
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:34,692
[SPEAKER_07]: That gives me a comfortable, very comfortable buffer, should things not work out the way I'm projecting.

442
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:37,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm willing to go to $21 million.

443
00:42:37,393 --> 00:42:46,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Overlay, we had been historically putting at least $500,000 into overlay.

444
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:48,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, when I sat down with the assessor,

445
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:54,177
[SPEAKER_07]: and talked it over and we looked at cases that were pending.

446
00:42:54,297 --> 00:43:01,721
[SPEAKER_07]: We figured that we actually do have sufficient reserves for abatements that we can lower that number to 200,000.

447
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:12,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we want to put some money into it every single year, but the number, these are things that we can, to a certain extent, tweak.

448
00:43:13,247 --> 00:43:14,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've done that tweaking.

449
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:35,081
[SPEAKER_07]: The new growth, the third bullet point is a little bit complicated, but certain properties have been moving out of the pilot program payments in lieu of taxes on their apartment buildings on Riverside.

450
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:38,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the river's edge?

451
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,870
[SPEAKER_07]: River's edge, yes.

452
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystic Valley Development Corporation.

453
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:51,681
[SPEAKER_07]: As those parcels move, they've been paying us payments in lieu of taxes, which go in local receipts.

454
00:43:53,482 --> 00:43:56,765
[SPEAKER_07]: As they move onto the tax base,

455
00:43:59,326 --> 00:44:01,307
[SPEAKER_07]: For 25, they will still be in local receipts.

456
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:03,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be in a different revenue category.

457
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:13,770
[SPEAKER_07]: But the assessor has said, has done the calculations and has said that because of that change, we will actually capture more money.

458
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:19,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the assessor says he can get me more money, I say, do that, please, thank you.

459
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:26,674
[SPEAKER_07]: So we added that to his initial new growth estimate.

460
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:37,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get in the weeds, it'll probably end up, it'll look slightly different, but the net for us will be positive.

461
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could actually do that.

462
00:44:43,043 --> 00:44:45,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Gallagher.

463
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:52,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, that $250,000 is included in your new growth figure from before?

464
00:44:52,368 --> 00:44:55,270
[SPEAKER_12]: This $250,000 is included in the new growth figure from the previous year?

465
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's already included in the figure we have.

466
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's the big picture.

467
00:45:05,781 --> 00:45:06,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's my last slide.

468
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:09,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Expense adjustments, yes.

469
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:20,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already gone over some of this stuff, but yeah, on the granular level, department heads were tasked with reviewing budgets.

470
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:41,110
[SPEAKER_07]: We've, over the past few years, we've been trying to make sure that one-time expenses, obviously capital items, but other expenses that were only going to be incurred in one year would be removed from the operating budget so we can actually look at them separately and maybe pursue different funding sources for that.

471
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Capital is usually funded by free cash.

472
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,637
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a prudent way to do it.

473
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:53,109
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to put, you know, one time fixed cost expenses into an operational budget.

474
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:56,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then obviously reviewing past

475
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:04,546
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that we've been doing every year since I've been here, is really sitting down with departments.

476
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:08,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a devil-in-the-details type of thing.

477
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:21,896
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you have a bunch of... If you have a department and their budget is up by, you know, you look at it and it's over by $10,000 and you can cut that, well, if you do that across all the departments, you're suddenly talking real money.

478
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:27,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and that's the work that the assistant finance director and...

479
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:45,957
[SPEAKER_07]: um the chief of staff mostly and with help from the mayor have really been looking into each one of these budgets to make sure that there isn't money that's just left on the table there that goes unused and then also on this one the

480
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:50,920
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, centralizing facilities costs and information technology.

481
00:46:51,140 --> 00:47:05,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of each department going out and getting, for instance, a copy of Adobe photo of Adobe Acrobat, the town now has a license with Adobe that has seats on it.

482
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:10,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And that ends up happening because we're, you know, then we have

483
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: economies of scale that way.

484
00:47:14,995 --> 00:47:17,476
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get a better deal from them for each individual seat.

485
00:47:18,656 --> 00:47:27,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we're trying to make sure that that all goes into one budget and is monitored by one person.

486
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:28,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So

487
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:36,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Facilities costs, this is something that will probably come up in some of the budgets.

488
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:48,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I know mine tonight has one situation where we've taken an expense that's in one category in one department and moved it to another department because it makes more sense to pay for it there.

489
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:54,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be seeing some of that when we get into the granular details on each budget.

490
00:47:59,465 --> 00:48:04,130
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're doing to try and make sure that we've got everything trimmed as much as we can.

491
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:07,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not that.

492
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:08,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is that still there?

493
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:12,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's all I've got, so.

494
00:48:13,919 --> 00:48:15,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Director Dickinson.

495
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:17,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli.

496
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

497
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President to the chair.

498
00:48:20,912 --> 00:48:22,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, thank you for giving us this information.

499
00:48:23,294 --> 00:48:26,817
[SPEAKER_05]: But what what what I'm a little, I'm a little nervous about.

500
00:48:27,398 --> 00:48:30,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we just want to get through and get something on that will work.

501
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:38,669
[SPEAKER_05]: But we saw it for a minute at the school with the school department with the, you know, the 2.5 million dollars that

502
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:51,118
[SPEAKER_05]: they couldn't find and then they found and then there were a lot of budgets that were frozen and that really put the teachers in some difficult positions.

503
00:48:51,198 --> 00:49:03,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, just curiously on the city side, do we have any departments right now that we're looking to hold positions or cut positions or freeze their budgets for FY24?

504
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:20,510
[SPEAKER_05]: um before we can get into 25 because there are rumblings out there that you know there might be some key positions even maybe an overnight position at dpw that we're looking to probably eliminate for the rest of the year and that's these are these are um

505
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:28,482
[SPEAKER_05]: These are these are questions that I think we need to know, especially if you're looking at the budget moving forward and seeing that.

506
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:36,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, having every department trend, just for the sake of numbers in a budget, where do we, where do we look.

507
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:41,068
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2024 with our departments on the city side.

508
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:53,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, again, this is granular detail and which will probably be reviewed when the 2025 budgets for each individual department are reviewed.

509
00:49:53,899 --> 00:50:00,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I've lost my train of thought.

510
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:05,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

511
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So real quick, it's a simple question.

512
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:20,479
[SPEAKER_05]: As our budget director, do we have any departments right now that look like they're in jeopardy of freezing their budget or not having enough for them to finish their FY 24?

513
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:29,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, we're not expecting any budget freezes on departments.

514
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:47,569
[SPEAKER_07]: We will probably, as it's been historical practice, be looking for budget transfers probably in early June to move some sums around to cover some budget with other available funds from other budgets.

515
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:52,032
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, I'm not looking to freeze anything.

516
00:50:54,062 --> 00:51:02,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only thing, Mr. President, that I would add to that is, you know, I think the council knows this, but it hasn't been touched on today.

517
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:09,174
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had a number of ARPA positions on the city side, which we are trying to fit into this year's budget.

518
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:11,195
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working as diligently as possible.

519
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,418
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working to figure out exactly what that means.

520
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:21,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say largely we're getting to where we want to be, but we're not 100% there.

521
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:23,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the best I can say at this point.

522
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:29,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So for clarification through the chair, so we might have some freezes in some departments.

523
00:51:30,335 --> 00:51:45,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that when I asked the question, just to move forward as we move forward on this, and I'm hoping that our budget director understands that when we're asking questions that also has to do with the ARPA money, I find it a little befuddling to me that

524
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:57,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Our budget director says he doesn't see anything right now, but the chief of staff comes up and says well with our blah blah blah That we there are no there's no Definitives on that.

525
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:06,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can as we're trying to vet out next year's budget and understanding how we got getting through this budget You know, I think we got the quarterlies.

526
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I think today we got one two and three.

527
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:13,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw them again today I really appreciate that but um, you know, um

528
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hearing some trends and some concerns moving forward.

529
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:34,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could just get an update as a form of a motion for our next meeting, Mr. President, that if we do have any departments that are looking at some budget shortfalls in FY24, that we're prepared for that.

530
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:34,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

531
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:39,999
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to ask if there are any budget shortfalls for departments for FY24.

532
00:52:43,755 --> 00:52:44,615
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll take that at the end.

533
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:48,737
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to thank you, President Bears.

534
00:52:48,977 --> 00:53:02,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I take exception when, um, anyone was to if anyone on this council were to criticize the department head in this case, I feel that there was some improper criticism directed to our finance director just now.

535
00:53:03,024 --> 00:53:05,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Our finance director was asked two questions.

536
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:07,026
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question he answered directly.

537
00:53:07,326 --> 00:53:11,827
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question, I think he was, I think he didn't fully have all the information.

538
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:16,709
[SPEAKER_00]: He clearly said that he'd been working on the, on certain aspects of the budget.

539
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:20,411
[SPEAKER_00]: The assistant finance director, myself and the mayor were working on the expense side.

540
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:23,572
[SPEAKER_00]: The finance director has a high level of that information.

541
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:30,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I was simply supplementing the question he was asked to be a question that was asked by, thank you.

542
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:36,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. Mr. President, if I can, this is this is so.

543
00:53:37,078 --> 00:53:44,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Bob, if you've taken that, that my comment and anything to be disrespectful to you, please don't think of that at all.

544
00:53:45,428 --> 00:53:50,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at when we're asking questions to our budget director in the past, Bob.

545
00:53:50,934 --> 00:54:00,222
[SPEAKER_05]: in the past or in my other roles, when we have a question with the budget director, I would assume that they would have all the information in front of you.

546
00:54:00,682 --> 00:54:07,808
[SPEAKER_05]: If you weren't prepared or worked with the other people that are working on this budget together and you didn't have those numbers, that's not your fault.

547
00:54:07,988 --> 00:54:13,873
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody there took that as an insult, I apologize, but

548
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:37,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just stating the fact, in the past when we've had budget meetings, and we've had other budget directors, and we've had other administrations, or working in other city municipalities and understanding the budget, when you're asking a simple question as, do we feel that any of our departments in the FY24 budget look like it's going to be funded,

549
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume that we would know.

550
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: You answered it by saying, well, from what I know, it looks like we're not going to have a problem.

551
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:46,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I understood that.

552
00:54:47,172 --> 00:54:53,117
[SPEAKER_05]: The chief of staff then came up and said, oh, maybe the I believe it was the ARPA.

553
00:54:53,597 --> 00:54:56,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not we can't be definitive on that because of ARPA money.

554
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:04,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So I I tend to I tend to really get really disappointed when leaders of our administration

555
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:23,093
[SPEAKER_05]: come to that podium and accuse members of this council just because they're asking questions because they haven't been informed at all when it comes to information on the budget and they ask a question that wasn't clarified and then turn it around and make it sound like I insulted someone.

556
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:34,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been accused of this over and over again by this person and I find it offensive and that Mr. President and I hope you can take point to that because that is highly highly unprofessional.

557
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:35,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

558
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:40,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President and in hope to assist to clarify.

559
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:42,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this will help, but I will say it anyway.

560
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:45,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to clarify that.

561
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:59,092
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding and our finance director can correct me from wrong that the question and our Councilor can correct me from wrong that the question that was asked of our finance director, which he answered was with regard to this year's

562
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:00,511
[SPEAKER_00]: budget.

563
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:04,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Our finance director answered it as it relates to this year's budget.

564
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:20,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to supplement the answer that our finance director provided because I have firsthand knowledge as to the FY 25 budget development on the expenditure side as to the positions that we're trying to encompass in FY 25.

565
00:56:21,155 --> 00:56:25,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I may have misunderstood, that misunderstanding may have led to this frustration.

566
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:26,656
[SPEAKER_04]: The question I think was,

567
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:35,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any budget freezes on the city side or any budgets that are expected to be frozen on the city side for fiscal 24?

568
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Director Dickinson answered very clearly no.

569
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:48,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And you came up to add that there are positions that are currently funded through ARPA that may not be funded in the future, but that that's not going to affect this year's.

570
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,391
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no freezes related to that in the current budget.

571
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:53,211
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.

572
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:53,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

573
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:10,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I think on a few things here, just looking at the quarter three actuals and the quarter two actuals, I've been looking at all of them.

574
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:23,209
[SPEAKER_04]: The big six or seven budgets that I'll see, most of the budget is DPW highway, DPW water, sewer, fire, health insurance, pensions, police, and the school department.

575
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:27,554
[SPEAKER_04]: The Metropolitan Public Schools, that's basically the vast majority of the budget.

576
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like we're pretty well on track there.

577
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:45,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really have that many questions, you know, I will say, you know, as I've noted, speaking with the chief of staff, and the chief of staff has noted here at the podium when we've had specific discussions, there's the elections department.

578
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:53,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Which needs might need an end of year transfer because of the cost of the recount, which was obviously on budgeted and unexpected.

579
00:57:54,915 --> 00:58:00,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you guys want to talk about from the current fiscal year 24?

580
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:07,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Any budgets or anything that you'd like to inform us of beyond the presentation that you've made?

581
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:09,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at this time.

582
00:58:11,437 --> 00:58:17,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't when I when I'm looking, obviously we are reviews ain't reviewing the 2024 budget.

583
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that time of year.

584
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:23,862
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to go in there and scrub purchase orders and make sure of our numbers.

585
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:27,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, make sure that the purchase orders that are.

586
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:32,766
[SPEAKER_07]: On the expense side are actually what we're going to need for the rest of the year.

587
00:58:32,806 --> 00:58:33,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure the

588
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:50,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of my reticence in speaking on this is that that takes an awful lot of granular work on the budget to make sure that we're where we want to be.

589
00:58:51,422 --> 00:58:58,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, as far as I am concerned, I do not see that being a problem.

590
00:58:59,468 --> 00:59:02,550
[SPEAKER_07]: There are obviously some budgets that we are monitoring closely.

591
00:59:04,982 --> 00:59:09,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I don't see that, but I'm not really, I think with spreadsheets.

592
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:18,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really prepared to go into detail on each budget and where we think it might be by the end of the year.

593
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:35,502
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that information, when we get the PO scrubbed and look at the expected expenses for the rest of the year, all of that information will be obviously provided in advance of looking for any transfers we might have to do internally to cover budgets.

594
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:43,964
[SPEAKER_07]: But at that point I will have done all the spreadsheet work and I will be able to be more informative about exactly where we are.

595
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:45,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

596
00:59:45,345 --> 00:59:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

597
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:53,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, again, just looking at this, the pension, you know, pension obligation is a huge one that's been paid out because that's paid as a lump sum is my understanding.

598
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,790
[SPEAKER_07]: That always happens with budgets.

599
00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:01,894
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, there's, we have to pay for the 2023 audit in finance.

600
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:03,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like we haven't spent some money.

601
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:09,716
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, bonds that we have because we paid for the 2022 audit, that's another situation.

602
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:14,838
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some budgets that definitely have lumps on payments towards the end of the year.

603
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:19,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, you know, so the actual budget numbers might not reflect that.

604
01:00:20,543 --> 01:00:22,063
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the bonds.

605
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That's to come in later.

606
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:24,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

607
01:00:24,844 --> 01:00:42,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, I mean, everything in here, if you, I just, I took your sheet and I put some percentages next to it for my own edification and the vast majority of our departments are under 75%, which you'd expect them to be around 75% or less, unless they have one of those big one-time payments at a strange time of year.

608
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:44,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we paid the trash contract.

609
01:00:44,827 --> 01:00:46,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we paid the MWRA.

610
01:00:46,848 --> 01:00:47,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been,

611
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:49,217
[SPEAKER_04]: doing our job.

612
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a couple questions.

613
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:56,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I will defer to my fellow councillors first.

614
01:00:56,709 --> 01:00:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Councilor Callaghan.

615
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:58,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anybody else?

616
01:00:58,993 --> 01:00:59,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But you didn't have it.

617
01:00:59,734 --> 01:00:59,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

618
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:02,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from anyone else so far?

619
01:01:06,206 --> 01:01:06,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

620
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:06,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

621
01:01:07,107 --> 01:01:12,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, just on the budget, you know, something that we've talked about, and I know we'll look at it in the future.

622
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:13,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

623
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:21,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really appreciate having this top line number the 188.59Million available for the general fund budget.

624
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,643
[SPEAKER_04]: which again is almost exactly $9 million more than the fiscal 24 available for the general fund budget.

625
01:01:27,303 --> 01:01:42,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You've already shown us that just from health insurance, workers' compensation and the pension rate increases, that over a third of that $9 million is going just to the cost of benefits, fixed cost growth of the benefits for the city employees and school employees.

626
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:48,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Contractual obligations will eat up another large chunk of that as well.

627
01:01:49,850 --> 01:02:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I think something that will be helpful for us to know in the future, and I know we're getting them as we've been meeting so far in these preliminary meetings, but something I really appreciated hearing last week in our 1st budget meeting was that the.

628
01:02:04,484 --> 01:02:12,528
[SPEAKER_04]: departments were asked to make requests based on what, you know, not that their requests were not tailored.

629
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:21,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that is a really great thing to hear, because we can hear from our departments what they think their need is for staff and programming in the fiscal year.

630
01:02:22,554 --> 01:02:24,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I also understand that those requests came in.

631
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:38,382
[SPEAKER_04]: The total of those requests was some amount above 188.59 million, which I think is unsurprising considering just how much need every single department in the city has for additional staff and additional resources.

632
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:41,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we all see it every day in a myriad ways.

633
01:02:42,544 --> 01:02:50,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little bit more if you're in this building all the time, but I think we also see it out in the community all the time where a lot of needs are unmet due to underfunding.

634
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,050
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, if

635
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:58,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's easier, I know you guys are super busy and we're pulling all this together for this meeting.

636
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:08,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really appreciate the work that you put in to do that forward and having that number of knowing what that initial budget request was from each of the departments, I think will be really helpful.

637
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:14,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you guys in the department heads did a lot of work in the past few weeks to say, okay.

638
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:16,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We know this is our revenue estimate.

639
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:23,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to the department and say, what do you think this year that we know you asked for this, but can you maybe not bring it in this year?

640
01:03:24,152 --> 01:03:25,273
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also trying to bring on.

641
01:03:25,293 --> 01:03:29,094
[SPEAKER_04]: 1 time funded positions from ARPA onto the general fund.

642
01:03:29,114 --> 01:03:30,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of competing needs.

643
01:03:32,415 --> 01:03:44,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But at some point, having that initial budget request and then seeing the hard work done by the administration and the department heads to kind of narrow that gap between what was requested and this revenue estimate would be helpful.

644
01:03:44,623 --> 01:03:50,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I know just from some preliminary conversations that you're still working out the final amount.

645
01:03:50,387 --> 01:04:00,794
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still some hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring the expense number down to equal the revenue number, which of course we have to do because we are required to have a balanced budget every year.

646
01:04:03,355 --> 01:04:19,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Having those additional numbers will be helpful for us to understand, you know, what was requested that the departments need what we aren't able to do this year because of the fiscal restraint and restrictions put on us by what we're allowed to do as a community when it comes to raising revenue.

647
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:21,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can certainly work.

648
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:39,947
[SPEAKER_04]: to explain and educate the public on why we couldn't do certain things this year, work together to understand what was prioritized and what wasn't prioritized based on trying to save staff positions and make sure our departments can continue to provide the service level that they currently provide to the community.

649
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:41,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to doing that.

650
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:44,549
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no form of emotion there.

651
01:04:45,169 --> 01:04:48,310
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been communicating about it, so we'll continue to communicate about it.

652
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:55,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any other comments or comments?

653
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:58,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a second, Councilor Scarpelli, I'll come to you in a second.

654
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:06,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli, and we'll talk about the legislative clerk and finance budgets.

655
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:07,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

656
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:08,813
Thank you.

657
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I think Councilor Callahan had her hand up first.

658
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:18,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a general comment, I really appreciate the communication so far as our budget season gets off to its start.

659
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:19,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's been,

660
01:05:20,808 --> 01:05:24,229
[SPEAKER_01]: busy start to this kind of forecasting, assessing, and planning season.

661
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:30,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the communication so far, and I think this presentation is really helpful as we head into and get further into the weeds together.

662
01:05:30,651 --> 01:05:47,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard a lot of specific questions from me tonight because I think sort of the scope that we're looking at that President Bears just summed up are kind of the concerns and questions that are on all of our minds, which is, you know, as we, as the work gets on, it continues on your side to try to

663
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:50,943
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the two numbers in reconciliation with each other.

664
01:05:52,364 --> 01:06:09,714
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously the question that we are all, you know, continuing to discuss is reconciling what we have with our fixed non-negotiable costs, especially in our first budgeting year after ARPA, which, you know, this will be my first budget after ARPA.

665
01:06:09,914 --> 01:06:11,095
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like a seismic change.

666
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:17,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, you know, essentially we have our rock solid non-negotiables

667
01:06:18,066 --> 01:06:27,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for this council, we have other non-negotiables that are technically negotiable, but from the value that they bring to the community, you know, often come into this conversation.

668
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:32,133
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a budget conversation here that we know is fiscally really difficult.

669
01:06:33,194 --> 01:06:47,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're all, you know, all eagerly and with a little bit of anxiety anticipating, you know, when we get to that reconciliation phase, how many of those programs that are, you know, programming staff, you know, working together to make sure that we are,

670
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,722
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping as much in this budget during this very difficult year as we can.

671
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:53,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that we're doing that together.

672
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:59,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that we're starting early and I appreciate all of the early communication around what kind of scenario we find ourselves in.

673
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:15,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is great to hear about all of the coordination efforts, which I know are not new, but get a little bit more finessed every year with trying to lump together those costs that occur in different places around the building, around the institution to make sure that we are not duplicating expenses where we can.

674
01:07:15,647 --> 01:07:17,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in this type of budget year, I know that every little bit

675
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:27,538
[SPEAKER_01]: does make a difference, especially when we are talking about some of those grant-funded positions that we're trying to keep within the operating budget, which might be, you know, under $100,000.

676
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, some of those cost-saving measures could really make the difference for positions like that.

677
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,222
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that is really meaningful.

678
01:07:33,242 --> 01:07:33,922
[SPEAKER_01]: It's appreciated.

679
01:07:34,142 --> 01:07:39,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we'll probably have some tough decision points and discussions ahead of us.

680
01:07:40,546 --> 01:07:43,048
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the early information is very appreciated.

681
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:44,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate all the effort that you're putting into this.

682
01:07:45,069 --> 01:07:46,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

683
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:53,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a quick question, if you happen to have these numbers off the top of your head, if not, I can look it up later.

684
01:07:54,085 --> 01:08:04,170
[SPEAKER_12]: On this fiscal year 2025 budget impacts with these four sort of unavoidable cost increases, do you happen to know for each of those what sort of percentage of our budget those are?

685
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:09,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, what is the health insurance, you know, what about what percent of our budget?

686
01:08:12,544 --> 01:08:15,586
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, that's fine, I'll finally look at it.

687
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:22,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I think with the spreadsheet, so I would be loathe to just say off the top of my head what they are.

688
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,052
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

689
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:33,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Percentage of the budget, obviously 25 million to 28 million for health insurance, that's a big chunk of $180 million budget.

690
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:43,059
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big driver of our worries for 2025.

691
01:08:44,219 --> 01:09:02,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And then getting into the granular details of exactly how much money, precisely exactly how much money the new contracts will cost each department.

692
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just an involved calculation.

693
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:12,373
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to look at all those positions and figure out where they are.

694
01:09:15,975 --> 01:09:20,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Back of the napkin of insurance, pensions, and workers' comp is like between 20 and 25% of the budget.

695
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:27,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It was last year's $41 million on a $180 million budget base, $179 million.

696
01:09:35,094 --> 01:09:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

697
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:39,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

698
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:40,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Two quick questions.

699
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:46,157
[SPEAKER_05]: One, can we get a copy of this presentation emailed to us, Mr. President?

700
01:09:46,197 --> 01:09:56,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I've been held hostage from a virus, so if there's any way that we can get that emailed, I'd appreciate it.

701
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:59,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And next, just for

702
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for us to prepare us, Bob, and I know, like, again, I appreciate your hard work, but when we're doing our projections, our department heads looking at going through an analysis with, let's say, a 10% cut, an 8% cut, a 5% cut in their budget.

703
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:25,342
[SPEAKER_05]: just so they're prepared for next year.

704
01:10:25,362 --> 01:10:44,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know that Councilor Beall said I missed, as we're talking to each department head instead of me asking them one by one, I know that Councilor Beall is correct from wrong when I missed the meeting last week that the conversation was that these were pure numbers that department heads gave us.

705
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:51,414
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd be interested to know if they were given that exercise to prepare us for any sort of cuts moving forward for FY25.

706
01:10:51,635 --> 01:11:00,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, just to clarify, the budgets we got last week and I believe the budgets we have tonight were those as requested by the department heads.

707
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that the administration has made some adjustments.

708
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,688
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making adjustments from those initial requests to create the final budget.

709
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,163
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so but they're given to us as a wish list, correct, Councilman?

710
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:16,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a wish list.

711
01:11:17,204 --> 01:11:22,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what they would like to see this year, but not necessarily the dream budget per se.

712
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:38,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but they weren't asked to do a cut proposal so that we can we can see that to prepare ourselves.

713
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:38,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

714
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:39,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my question.

715
01:11:39,975 --> 01:11:40,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

716
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:41,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, correct.

717
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:43,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.

718
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:45,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

719
01:11:45,818 --> 01:11:46,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

720
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions or discussion on the presentation from our finance director?

721
01:12:00,626 --> 01:12:07,732
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go into the rest of this meeting, which is to discuss the three budgets.

722
01:12:08,413 --> 01:12:11,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We can start, since you're already up at the podium, with the finance department.

723
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:17,460
[SPEAKER_04]: This was included in the packets online and in our print packets.

724
01:12:19,883 --> 01:12:21,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I was asking,

725
01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:23,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Four questions.

726
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I don't think any of these departments have narrative for tonight.

727
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to come back and present your narrative at a later date, I know we'll be seeing a lot more of you over the next two months.

728
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you haven't.

729
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:36,014
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't.

730
01:12:36,034 --> 01:12:36,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

731
01:12:36,314 --> 01:12:36,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Even better.

732
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:48,899
[SPEAKER_04]: But the questions I was asking of each department, since this is a preliminary budget meeting, were, first, is there anything you want to share about your department this year, what you've done over the past year?

733
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:51,140
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your budget request?

734
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:59,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any programs that you didn't request this year that you are looking to fund in the future, not necessarily in fiscal 25, but in future budgets?

735
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:08,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after the budget is presented at the end of May, let us know if you'd like to be invited back to talk more about your department.

736
01:13:08,866 --> 01:13:09,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the questions.

737
01:13:09,646 --> 01:13:12,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go over them as well, but feel free to go right ahead.

738
01:13:13,068 --> 01:13:13,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Dickinson.

739
01:13:27,145 --> 01:13:30,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And just before you start, I'm looking at finance procurement at a total of $859,901,965.

740
01:13:34,696 --> 01:13:40,479
[SPEAKER_04]: that is an increase of $136.30 and $0.65 from the previous fiscal year.

741
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:48,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of that is looking like if finance is absorbing the cost of the admin's program subscription.

742
01:13:48,144 --> 01:13:49,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, exactly.

743
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:55,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the budget is fairly... Our budgets are fairly simple because there isn't a lot there.

744
01:13:55,989 --> 01:14:01,592
[SPEAKER_07]: We did shift the payment for the admin software system from IT to...

745
01:14:03,513 --> 01:14:08,877
[SPEAKER_07]: to finance, so IT should see a similar reduction in their costs.

746
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:13,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they'll have other budget needs, which will make their costs go up.

747
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But for us, it's pretty much the same.

748
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:20,765
[SPEAKER_07]: The audits tend to cost more every year.

749
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:23,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Admins tends to cost more every year.

750
01:14:23,327 --> 01:14:28,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's nominal stuff in there for office supplies, stuff like that.

751
01:14:29,972 --> 01:14:31,853
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of conferences,

752
01:14:33,054 --> 01:14:42,120
[SPEAKER_07]: We put some extra money in that budget because Mike Roberts, who is the ARPA coordinator right now, gets more.

753
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:49,665
[SPEAKER_07]: As we move out of ARPA, he's a position we're looking to keep and actually train to do municipal finance.

754
01:14:50,405 --> 01:14:56,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to send him to classes to make sure he knows how to do that, but it's a small amount of money.

755
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:11,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And then looking at this, I just have to say that the Assistant Finance Director, Courtney Cardello, a lot of this grunt work that we've talked about tonight, this is, I see an overview of this.

756
01:15:13,237 --> 01:15:28,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, she has done a phenomenal job and I just wanted to, you know, just acknowledge that going like literally sitting down with departments, ironing out budget things and where we can cut and where we have to keep finances in there.

757
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to say that.

758
01:15:30,587 --> 01:15:34,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, you know, Courtney and Adam and we sat down with, uh,

759
01:15:34,932 --> 01:15:36,633
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk about the legislative budget.

760
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:41,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was one of the toughest conversations we had, because we asked for nothing to change at all.

761
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:43,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So seriously, Courtney was great.

762
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that was music to her ears.

763
01:15:45,961 --> 01:15:46,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

764
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:52,086
[SPEAKER_07]: But literally, this budget, I mean, she gave it to me a week ago.

765
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:54,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said, this is what we need.

766
01:15:54,908 --> 01:15:56,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, oh, yes, that's what we need.

767
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:02,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Overviews of what?

768
01:16:04,249 --> 01:16:15,380
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, narratives for finance, you know, I have a sheet here, but, you know, we kept our AAA bond rating, AAA plus bond rating, that was good.

769
01:16:18,263 --> 01:16:23,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing the, obviously working on the budget ordinance has been a, I think,

770
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:32,536
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a good thing for this year, trying to get that ironed out and have a good format for doing that.

771
01:16:35,238 --> 01:16:38,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Reviewing and adjusting the city's comprehensive plan.

772
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:45,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, we're going to have an act for an annual comprehensive financial report like we do every year come out.

773
01:16:47,007 --> 01:16:48,568
[SPEAKER_04]: When is FY23 coming out?

774
01:16:48,588 --> 01:16:51,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm the only person who's waiting for the debut date.

775
01:16:54,156 --> 01:17:03,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to finish, as I said in one of my slides, I need to finish up the state report and get that to the state, send that off to Zellian Clark.

776
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,305
[SPEAKER_07]: The minute I get all that done, it shouldn't take very long.

777
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping mid-May we'll have all that done.

778
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:15,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do an actuarial report this year for OPEB.

779
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:21,073
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've already contacted them, and we're giving them the information to do that.

780
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that has to be part of the audit, too.

781
01:17:23,294 --> 01:17:25,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to get that done.

782
01:17:25,035 --> 01:17:27,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the other post-employment benefits?

783
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:28,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

784
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:28,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

785
01:17:28,517 --> 01:17:30,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Other post-employment benefits.

786
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:43,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So procurement is mostly continuing education through inspector general's office, purchasing officials and operational services.

787
01:17:46,437 --> 01:17:50,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the procurement team is great.

788
01:17:51,462 --> 01:18:02,313
[SPEAKER_07]: And having had to deal with this in my former job, I love departments like that where I really don't have to worry about it.

789
01:18:03,194 --> 01:18:05,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've been doing a great job doing that.

790
01:18:09,372 --> 01:18:17,240
[SPEAKER_07]: done over 200 procurements in the last year, processed 200 plus contracts for the city and school, totaling over $15 million.

791
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:20,143
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a great job, Fiona and Co.

792
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:21,124
[SPEAKER_07]: are doing a great job.

793
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:27,690
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, goals.

794
01:18:28,331 --> 01:18:29,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We keep having trouble with 1099s.

795
01:18:31,553 --> 01:18:39,699
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the year, vendors being entered improperly and not having backup, not having W-9s for them.

796
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:50,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Some vendors, sometimes refunds get given to employees, and then they're listed as the 1099 eligible, even though they're not.

797
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:56,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've worked on that process extensively to make sure that's all working correctly.

798
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Financial policies, obviously, we review them all the time.

799
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:09,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And then financial software packages.

800
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:25,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I have actually been in touch with Tyler Technologies about putting together a proposal to shift this to Munis, and I've talked to procurement about doing an RFP so we could see what software packages we could

801
01:19:26,889 --> 01:19:33,115
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly move to or at least consolidate the various software packages that we currently have.

802
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:42,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be a long process, but we are still pursuing that.

803
01:19:42,624 --> 01:19:51,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully within the next, I'm hoping within the next nine months or so, we have some better proposals on how to move forward with that.

804
01:19:57,092 --> 01:20:06,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been working with the ClearGov people for putting together a nice, shiny budget book that is comprehensive and legible.

805
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:11,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one of those priorities for this year.

806
01:20:13,003 --> 01:20:22,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, and hopefully we can put the budget in and submit it for a distinguished budget award, which would be nice.

807
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:24,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to have budget awards and have plaques.

808
01:20:27,153 --> 01:20:33,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's pretty much what we've been working on, as well as all of the daily stuff that constantly crops up.

809
01:20:34,517 --> 01:20:41,882
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, the watchword in finance is to make sure we fix problems, not symptoms.

810
01:20:42,322 --> 01:20:53,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So when things come up, we review what's going on and why we might have had a problem, and then make sure that the system actually works so that we don't have problems in the future.

811
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:56,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we've been doing.

812
01:21:00,575 --> 01:21:00,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

813
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:02,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much.

814
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:10,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for the director about the finance department's proposed budget for fiscal 2025?

815
01:21:11,297 --> 01:21:17,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two questions for you.

816
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:29,640
[SPEAKER_04]: One, in terms of the RFPs, you said nine months, hopefully, to get some RFPs back on the financial software.

817
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:31,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd like to.

818
01:21:31,524 --> 01:21:39,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's going to be a long process to make sure that we were picking the right software.

819
01:21:39,693 --> 01:21:46,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, implementation of something like this will take working with

820
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:52,111
[SPEAKER_07]: basically every department to see what we need.

821
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:57,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Municipal software, it's funny because it's a niche situation.

822
01:21:57,235 --> 01:22:03,799
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a town the size of say Hadley with low budget, not that much going on, they could use QuickBooks.

823
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,120
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't afford Munis.

824
01:22:07,181 --> 01:22:11,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm denigrating Hadley, so I apologize, but take a small municipality.

825
01:22:11,483 --> 01:22:12,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Sandisfield.

826
01:22:12,283 --> 01:22:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Sandisfield.

827
01:22:13,323 --> 01:22:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a small municipality.

828
01:22:14,923 --> 01:22:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Florida.

829
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:27,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the big players, for instance, if your M&T bank can have 1,200 locations nationwide, you need a really comprehensive and expensive software package.

830
01:22:28,867 --> 01:22:34,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, what's an appropriate software package to manage a city the size of Medford?

831
01:22:35,697 --> 01:22:37,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of in between those two.

832
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:45,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are many decisions to be made, you know, to take Munis, which is the one I know most about.

833
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:50,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, you can run the general ledger.

834
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:53,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want it to run Treasury too?

835
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to have the contract module?

836
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:57,270
[SPEAKER_07]: boat excise.

837
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:58,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good example.

838
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,731
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a boat excise module.

839
01:22:59,811 --> 01:23:06,714
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Medford gets maybe $5,000 a year in boat excise, so it's not actually worth having the boat excise module.

840
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:08,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Why pay for it?

841
01:23:09,775 --> 01:23:10,635
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd lose money.

842
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:18,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And then going through the needs of human resources, is that a package that they want?

843
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:26,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that software do what they want, or do they need to have another software solution for their particular needs?

844
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:34,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the conversations we're going to have to have citywide, is making sure we're getting a package that actually

845
01:23:35,481 --> 01:23:40,383
[SPEAKER_07]: addresses our needs, but we're not buying stuff that we don't need.

846
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:43,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Fixed assets too.

847
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:47,705
[SPEAKER_07]: For years Nantucket had the fixed asset package and we never used it.

848
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:50,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So we said, hey, we don't need to pay for this.

849
01:23:51,587 --> 01:23:54,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently in Medford, fixed assets are done by our auditors.

850
01:23:54,648 --> 01:23:56,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't need that.

851
01:23:56,968 --> 01:24:01,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to go through and look at every individual piece of

852
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:06,807
[SPEAKER_07]: these software solutions and figure out what is appropriate and intelligent to purchase.

853
01:24:08,868 --> 01:24:09,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

854
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:27,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know that's been a priority of this council, and I do hope that, you know, the solution that we come to enables everyone to do their job more efficiently and not have the reconciliation and the data cross between multiple systems that we're dealing with right now, because I know that would be a boon to everybody.

855
01:24:28,962 --> 01:24:33,986
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of just making things easier, making things more timely, making it maybe easier.

856
01:24:34,046 --> 01:24:38,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, you know, basically I feel like we invite you here, we ask you to do a bunch of work every time you come.

857
01:24:39,069 --> 01:24:44,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, maybe this new system will make that a little bit less burdensome.

858
01:24:45,073 --> 01:24:50,837
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully as I get more used to the systems that are existing and we polish them up, they get easier to use.

859
01:24:51,218 --> 01:24:51,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

860
01:24:51,518 --> 01:24:55,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on that in various small ways, constantly.

861
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:55,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

862
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:57,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's noticed.

863
01:24:57,862 --> 01:24:58,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

864
01:24:59,332 --> 01:24:59,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

865
01:24:59,892 --> 01:25:01,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick clarifying question on the same topic.

866
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:03,473
[SPEAKER_01]: You said nine months on the RFPs.

867
01:25:03,593 --> 01:25:08,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, do you expect to get proposals back from vendors or just what's the step in the timeline?

868
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:12,855
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm hoping to get done.

869
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:22,038
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the next thing after we get budgets polished is to work with procurement to put out an RFP so that, and I know that the procurement department

870
01:25:25,114 --> 01:25:25,994
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my phone.

871
01:25:26,214 --> 01:25:27,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I turned that off.

872
01:25:27,314 --> 01:25:32,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I know that the procurement department already has sample RFPs ready to go for that.

873
01:25:32,975 --> 01:25:36,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I need to, we need to get the budget done.

874
01:25:36,516 --> 01:25:43,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I need to talk to the mayor and administration about how they wish to proceed on this.

875
01:25:43,317 --> 01:25:47,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but again, this is going to be a long process.

876
01:25:47,498 --> 01:25:53,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to take several, even if we, once we pick a software package, it will take several years to implement it.

877
01:25:53,912 --> 01:25:54,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.

878
01:25:54,237 --> 01:25:54,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

879
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:01,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just had one last question, which is just on the clear outside of things.

880
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:07,972
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know we ran into some issues last year where some of the actuals uploaded in the clear of were not the right actuals.

881
01:26:08,012 --> 01:26:16,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, you know, just wanted to fly that again, because I think it is probably the place that most people look to see what's going on with the city's finances.

882
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:21,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and something I've also noticed some other communities and again.

883
01:26:22,397 --> 01:26:25,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going back to my asking you to do more work piece of this whole thing.

884
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:25,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

885
01:26:28,604 --> 01:26:34,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Some communities will update the budget after approval to reflect any amendments or adjustments to the budget process.

886
01:26:35,374 --> 01:26:45,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we generally have been keeping up just the proposed version, or I'm not 100% sure about that, but that it's staying as the proposed budget versus the approved budget that people say.

887
01:26:46,089 --> 01:26:47,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can I find the approved budget?

888
01:26:47,651 --> 01:26:50,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, well, this is pretty close, but it's not it's not 100%.

889
01:26:51,195 --> 01:27:01,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are just some things about the clear side of things that feedback we hear from residents that might be helpful to for just for residents to see it.

890
01:27:01,747 --> 01:27:03,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, we can put on, you can.

891
01:27:03,829 --> 01:27:07,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can add in this budget was approved June whatever by the council.

892
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:12,552
[SPEAKER_04]: These were the adjustments and this is the final approved amount.

893
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:17,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can point people to say, that's the approved amount.

894
01:27:18,613 --> 01:27:24,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how any of that works on the back end, but that's some of the feedback that we hear from residents who are trying to learn more about the budget.

895
01:27:24,535 --> 01:27:30,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I can definitely work with Courtney and the other people who are working on carry ups.

896
01:27:32,107 --> 01:27:33,449
[SPEAKER_07]: to see if we can do that.

897
01:27:33,469 --> 01:27:42,237
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are working strenuously with the ClearWeb people to make sure that the data is both correct and relevant.

898
01:27:43,018 --> 01:27:43,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

899
01:27:43,818 --> 01:27:51,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And even just, I'm just in here right now, there's like a FY20 is presented strangely in the general fund summary and section three.

900
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:53,127
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going through the whole thing.

901
01:27:53,467 --> 01:27:55,229
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going through the whole thing and making it.

902
01:27:56,559 --> 01:27:59,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, and we're making it correct.

903
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the great thing is that with the most of this shell built, now it's, you know, you can focus even more on the details of improving it, which I think is great.

904
01:28:13,903 --> 01:28:16,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions for the finance director?

905
01:28:19,064 --> 01:28:21,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none.

906
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:21,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Bob.

907
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:23,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

908
01:28:23,225 --> 01:28:23,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all.

909
01:28:24,011 --> 01:28:28,995
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two budgets that we have here are the clerk's office and the legislative department.

910
01:28:30,656 --> 01:28:32,838
[SPEAKER_04]: For the clerk, we'll go to the clerk.

911
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:35,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk.

912
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:36,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

913
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:37,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, councillors.

914
01:28:38,202 --> 01:28:50,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to thank Sylvia DiPlacido and Janice DePace and Annie Kelly in the clerk's office who make it run so well every day and are intimately involved.

915
01:28:51,632 --> 01:28:54,174
[SPEAKER_08]: most of the work that you see coming out of our office every day.

916
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:58,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me be very simple with our budget.

917
01:28:58,356 --> 01:29:01,598
[SPEAKER_08]: It's essentially the same as last year's budget.

918
01:29:02,179 --> 01:29:14,706
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some proposed cuts to some expenses that when we looked at the actuals, we're not actually making those expenditures and the increases are mostly contractually mandated salary increases.

919
01:29:15,046 --> 01:29:17,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it's essentially level funded with last year.

920
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

921
01:29:19,302 --> 01:29:21,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for the clerk on the clerk's budget?

922
01:29:24,795 --> 01:29:28,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a quick update, if I may, if there's no questions.

923
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:34,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we have the new legislative software that's being run out of the clerk's office as well.

924
01:29:34,603 --> 01:29:39,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's been, you may want to elaborate on it more when the legislative budget comes up.

925
01:29:39,327 --> 01:29:48,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was the biggest change in terms of expenses for us, was getting rid of the old software we're using and updating this one.

926
01:29:48,034 --> 01:29:53,698
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually ended up being a little bit cheaper to go to this new software, which has increased transparency in the office.

927
01:29:54,899 --> 01:29:57,781
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, increase transparency with, uh, with your documents as well.

928
01:29:57,821 --> 01:29:59,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, that's it.

929
01:29:59,642 --> 01:29:59,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

930
01:29:59,843 --> 01:30:00,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a huge change.

931
01:30:01,584 --> 01:30:03,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also shout out the, uh, the marriage.

932
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:05,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another change, right?

933
01:30:05,486 --> 01:30:05,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

934
01:30:05,827 --> 01:30:07,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving to online software, which is great.

935
01:30:08,168 --> 01:30:13,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, always good to hear and fingers crossed.

936
01:30:13,972 --> 01:30:16,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be at full staff in the clerk's office in a few weeks.

937
01:30:16,474 --> 01:30:19,936
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great for the first time in a while.

938
01:30:20,357 --> 01:30:21,077
[SPEAKER_08]: First time since,

939
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,942
[SPEAKER_08]: last July 1st.

940
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:28,726
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been doing more with less for a year.

941
01:30:28,987 --> 01:30:30,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and so that'll be great.

942
01:30:33,925 --> 01:30:36,326
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I see no questions for the clerk.

943
01:30:38,107 --> 01:30:47,392
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's anything else you want to share about plans for the future, you're welcome to, and we have you here at our mercy at all times, so we can ask you those questions whenever we want.

944
01:30:47,472 --> 01:30:49,773
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask those questions whenever you want.

945
01:30:49,933 --> 01:30:54,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited that we're approaching, you know, being back to full staff.

946
01:30:54,315 --> 01:31:01,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been, you know, basically down at least one person for almost a year, and it's going to be nice to be able to catch up on some of the stuff we have

947
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:10,104
[SPEAKER_08]: We have let slip a little bit and it'd be, you know, I mean, the amount of customer service that we do on a daily basis is truly astounding.

948
01:31:10,124 --> 01:31:15,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a credit to Sylvia and to Janice and to Annie particularly.

949
01:31:15,068 --> 01:31:25,975
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I'm looking forward to being fully staffed so we can continue to do that service and also continue to do the other work that the community expects us to do.

950
01:31:27,336 --> 01:31:27,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

951
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:29,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

952
01:31:30,517 --> 01:31:33,898
[SPEAKER_04]: The last budget we have is the, and I'll just read it out really quickly.

953
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:36,739
[SPEAKER_04]: The total budget proposed for the clerk's office is $404,133.86.

954
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:37,879
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an increase of $19,977.86 from fiscal 24.

955
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:42,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially all of that increases in the raises for the staff, the contractual raises for the staff in that department.

956
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:42,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like,

957
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:04,953
[SPEAKER_04]: you were able to find about $1,800 worth of some efficiencies on the ordinary expense side.

958
01:32:07,113 --> 01:32:13,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking like some, where are we?

959
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:16,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, subscriptions, subscriptions, publications, 2,500.

960
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:20,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think office equipment as well.

961
01:32:21,038 --> 01:32:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you upped office equipment by about 1,000 there, so I can see it.

962
01:32:28,155 --> 01:32:30,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, office equipment, my apologies, yes, 500 and 200, yep.

963
01:32:30,676 --> 01:32:48,406
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, slight decreases in some of those, and you're correct, the increases are all contractually, you know, the result of the new contract and the ordinance that you passed last year for the non-union salary increases as well.

964
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:49,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

965
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:54,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Last budget is the legislative budget, totaling 312,689.

966
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to triple check, but I believe that that is identical to our proposed legislative budget for fiscal 24, which it is.

967
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

968
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was no change.

969
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:09,621
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also no change from the prior year there.

970
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: We are getting into one of these conundrums where the longer you don't change something, the more you have to change it.

971
01:33:20,003 --> 01:33:24,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will note that for the future, although I am certainly not proposing anything.

972
01:33:27,972 --> 01:33:29,053
[SPEAKER_04]: No change proposed.

973
01:33:29,233 --> 01:33:43,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to ask our finance department for one shift, if possible, if we could shift $1800 from line item 5240, which is our legislative repair and maintenance line item to 5202 for the videographer.

974
01:33:51,203 --> 01:33:57,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Our videographer has made a request to be paid closer to market rates and we would like to retain his services.

975
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:02,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our 1 request.

976
01:34:02,433 --> 01:34:04,074
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no shift within the node.

977
01:34:04,154 --> 01:34:04,655
[SPEAKER_04]: No amount.

978
01:34:04,675 --> 01:34:05,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount would stay the same.

979
01:34:05,675 --> 01:34:13,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and given the actuals of legislative repair and maintenance, we believe that that is a. You know, we're very much under on that software.

980
01:34:16,343 --> 01:34:22,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you just let me know a little bit more about what those, these two, 5240 and 5310 are, what those cover?

981
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:26,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, maintenance and professional technical services.

982
01:34:26,472 --> 01:34:37,561
[SPEAKER_04]: 5240 is our line item for civic clerk software, meeting code software, essentially our legislative softwares for codification and for

983
01:34:40,131 --> 01:34:45,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The now running of our agendas and uploading of minutes and the agenda and meeting minutes portal.

984
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:50,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So we haven't had a full year expenditure there yet.

985
01:34:50,494 --> 01:34:52,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're waiting to see what that will look like.

986
01:34:53,415 --> 01:34:56,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to fund the, I'm going to forget the name of it.

987
01:34:57,757 --> 01:35:03,681
[SPEAKER_04]: IQM2 software package that the council used to have.

988
01:35:04,301 --> 01:35:13,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It's similar to what Somerville used to use for their legislative maintenance, but that was where we were able to stream from room 207 before the pandemic, before we moved to Zoom.

989
01:35:14,907 --> 01:35:20,090
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morell and I were reviewing the budget and found that we were still paying for that software even though we were not using it.

990
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:23,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we decided to stop doing that and to

991
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:43,187
[SPEAKER_04]: look at this new civic clerk software which has been actually was cheap quoted cheaper and has been fun serving more of the functions that we needed it to serve than the prior software package and the professional technical services other 5310 that is our funding for the zoning project.

992
01:35:45,233 --> 01:35:48,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So we split that with the Planning Development Sustainability Office.

993
01:35:49,735 --> 01:35:51,716
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our chunk of it for next year.

994
01:35:51,756 --> 01:36:00,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the same amount this year, which was committed in both of the, this year and next year are both committed through the procurement process to that contract.

995
01:36:05,423 --> 01:36:09,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions about the legislative budget?

996
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:11,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, there's no proposed change.

997
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, any further discussion?

998
01:36:22,562 --> 01:36:25,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some general nods.

999
01:36:25,463 --> 01:36:28,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we cool with moving that money around in the legislative budget?

1000
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:34,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1001
01:36:37,089 --> 01:36:39,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in agreement with that, Council President.

1002
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:43,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I would move forward with that as a motion, if that's what you need.

1003
01:36:44,568 --> 01:36:45,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

1004
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:55,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a motion of Councilor Scarpelli to request that we shift 1800 from line item ending 5240 to the line item ending 5202.

1005
01:36:55,783 --> 01:36:57,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

1006
01:36:58,567 --> 01:36:59,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I will go to the Chief of Staff.

1007
01:36:59,668 --> 01:37:00,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that, Madam Chief of Staff.

1008
01:37:05,046 --> 01:37:05,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1009
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:17,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say that I think it may warrant some further discussion as to the structure of the, you know, basically how the position is funded, how the position is paid.

1010
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:32,616
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with our human resources department to determine if the position should be shifted to an employee position, and that's just really early, but that may be what is necessary in terms of how we structure the role.

1011
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:33,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, got it.

1012
01:37:35,134 --> 01:37:38,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and yeah, we can talk that through.

1013
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:51,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have motions from, I think we have three motions, and they are, yes, Vice President Collins.

1014
01:37:52,007 --> 01:37:57,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, it doesn't have to be a motion, but will the slides from today's presentation be emailed around for the councillors who want it?

1015
01:37:57,611 --> 01:37:57,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1016
01:37:57,931 --> 01:37:58,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1017
01:37:58,432 --> 01:38:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seeing a yes on that, we'll get that emailed out to everybody.

1018
01:38:03,097 --> 01:38:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the motions are to request the three years of new growth numbers, the projections and the actuals.

1019
01:38:11,044 --> 01:38:13,887
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the one on the, that we just did on moving the money around.

1020
01:38:13,927 --> 01:38:14,607
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the third one?

1021
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:19,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Update.

1022
01:38:21,793 --> 01:38:23,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, budget shortfalls 2024, if any.

1023
01:38:25,276 --> 01:38:26,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1024
01:38:26,658 --> 01:38:27,578
[SPEAKER_04]: On those motions.

1025
01:38:29,188 --> 01:38:32,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, all by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1026
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:33,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we comfortable taking it?

1027
01:38:36,795 --> 01:38:39,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we just vote on them all at once.

1028
01:38:41,059 --> 01:38:41,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1029
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:43,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1035
01:39:23,323 --> 01:39:23,563

1037
01:39:24,403 --> 01:39:24,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1038
01:39:25,204 --> 01:39:25,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Strunk?

1039
01:39:25,664 --> 01:39:25,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1040
01:39:28,846 --> 01:39:29,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Strange, absent.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1043
01:39:30,487 --> 01:39:32,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

1044
01:39:33,029 --> 01:39:38,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion for this meeting before the, sorry, six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1045
01:39:39,193 --> 01:39:42,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion before the next meeting?

1046
01:39:44,176 --> 01:39:44,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins?

1047
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:45,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1048
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:51,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to again thank Director Dickinson, Chief of Staff for being here tonight and for preparing us for this meeting, all the documents you've prepared for this.

[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you as well to the clerk for the budget presentation.

1051
01:39:59,013 --> 01:40:00,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we need to thank ourselves for ours.

1052
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:02,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to adjourn.

1053
01:40:03,858 --> 01:40:04,058

1055
01:40:18,463 --> 01:40:21,587
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a new Zoom, but it should still be on the same channel on cable.

1056
01:40:22,488 --> 01:40:24,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion seen?

1057
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:25,070
[SPEAKER_04]: None.

1058
