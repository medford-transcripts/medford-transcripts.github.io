[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

91
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:07,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Nine.

92
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:13,091
[SPEAKER_08]: in the affirmative, zero in the negative, six absent, the minutes are approved.

93
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:19,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I just wanted to give you all a deliverable status overall.

94
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:26,661
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, we have five, we'll call it six things, but with five official things that have to be done in the eligibility phase.

95
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:30,424
[SPEAKER_08]: The MSBA let us know that our, you know,

96
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,589
[SPEAKER_08]: ICC has, which is the legal agreement, has been approved.

97
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is complete and approved.

98
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:42,256
[SPEAKER_08]: We have submitted our SBC form, our school building committee form.

99
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,619
[SPEAKER_08]: They reviewed it and they have approved it.

100
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are done and approved on item number two.

101
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:52,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, last meeting, we approved, um, the chapter 74 form as amended.

102
00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:00,055
[SPEAKER_08]: That one has not been submitted yet, but that is just a matter of, um, collecting up all the paperwork and doing some final editing, and that will be submitted.

103
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, item number four is the educational profile, which I am hopeful that we will, um, get to today.

104
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:12,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then, um, the

105
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:24,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Final pieces include the maintenance plan profile, which we will talk about today and potentially provide an approval by this group to go ahead and submit that as soon as it's complete.

106
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:46,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the final big thing that we will have to do there's well there's two more things so there's data from the about enrollment that has to be submitted that is in process does not require approval of this body but we are working with Alicia Hunt as well as Jerry McHugh who's our CFO here and are on track to get that completed.

107
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:52,190
[SPEAKER_08]: The very last thing that we will have to do is earmark funds for the feasibility study.

108
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:00,497
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to let you all know that you can expect to see that on the city council agenda on the 25th, which is a Tuesday evening.

109
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:10,646
[SPEAKER_08]: The request will come from the mayor to use free cash to set aside funds for the feasibility study.

110
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:12,668
[SPEAKER_08]: The exact amount is still

111
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:21,911
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit of a TBD because there's a little bit more legwork to do to make sure that we get the right number, but we know what that range needs to be.

112
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:26,892
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a couple more conversations to have, and then the mayor will make that request to the council.

113
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:30,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully the council will approve that on the 25th.

114
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:35,974
[SPEAKER_08]: MSBA has already signed off on the language that will go before the council to be approved.

115
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:39,315
[SPEAKER_08]: They are fine with it and they are ready to watch and hear that that's approved.

116
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:46,220
[SPEAKER_08]: They did say that they will schedule our enrollment meeting like once that happens.

117
00:05:46,380 --> 00:06:02,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the fact that we're going to do that in June is good because then we can accelerate that piece of it, which really would position us for a much earlier view by the board than next February, which is when we would sort of be scheduled if we take full time.

118
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:06,497
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just a quick update.

119
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:07,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions?

120
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:18,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

121
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:26,013
[SPEAKER_08]: The other just like announcement related is that we have finished the first draft of the website.

122
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:31,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna ask Tom to send that out to everybody after this evening.

123
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:41,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you wanna take a look, if you have any questions or comments or suggestions, please, by all means, let Tom know what they are and he will work on integrating any of those things.

124
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:51,213
[SPEAKER_08]: We are on our way there and sort of positioned for being able to use that to start to talk to the community when we are ready for that.

125
00:06:54,276 --> 00:07:05,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last thing we did have a subcommittee meeting earmarked for June 20th for the communication subcommittee and that meeting will be canceled.

126
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:20,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will reach out to the communications team to find another Zoom time for us so we can move forward on some of the preparation things that we were talking about at our last meeting.

127
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:26,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will tell you for sure it will not happen probably until the beginning of July.

128
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:30,934
[SPEAKER_08]: because I don't have any minutes left in the day.

129
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sure that's true of everybody.

130
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It's June and it's just sort of a full court press.

131
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:39,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll spend some time in the summer to do that.

132
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:44,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And our summer meetings will be on the schedule unless we are in a true holding pattern.

133
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:47,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And in which case I will let you know and we'll cancel those meetings.

134
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:51,951
[SPEAKER_08]: But my plan is for the summer meetings to be Zoom only so everyone can be where they are.

135
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that make sense?

136
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Is everybody okay with that?

137
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

138
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:01,037
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, cool.

139
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:03,798
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so on to the next item.

140
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,519
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a look at the ed profile again.

141
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:16,623
[SPEAKER_08]: What I did since we last spoke is integrate feedback that I got from lots of people.

142
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:18,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Maria.

143
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Libby.

144
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Luke.

145
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:22,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Tracy.

146
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,800
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys really crushed it in the performing arts.

147
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:30,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I wanted to do, what I'm hoping that we can do tonight.

148
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:32,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Paul.

149
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:37,610
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm hoping we can do tonight is sort of collect any additional feedback that you have.

150
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,535
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some placeholders in here that are contingent on the staff having some time to meet with all the district administrators.

151
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:47,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what I'm hoping that we can do is,

152
00:08:48,971 --> 00:09:13,925
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about what we see here, talk about any additional suggestions, agree on the things that are listed here as placeholders, and provide an approval as amended and to be completed so that, you know, and we'll share the final copy with you all, but if you do that, that will give me the leeway to sort of collect up all the last pieces and get this submitted as well, which I would like to do before June 30th.

153
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:39,884
[SPEAKER_08]: So a couple of big changes that I made, let's see, are start on page... So one big change that I made starts on page eight, which provides a deeper description of the library in its current form.

154
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:40,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Maria.

155
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:44,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is one change that has been made.

156
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:53,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there is reference to the library as well, down in the non-traditional and other spaces section.

157
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:05,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we fast forward to page 12,

158
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:23,965
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the section that got a really substantive overhaul based on all the things that were provided to me.

159
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:32,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the top of page 13 in course spaces, still to be added to this document, just for

160
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody to sort of shake their head and say yes, those are the things.

161
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:43,561
[SPEAKER_08]: There is some discussion about Curtis Tufts that has to go into this section.

162
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:54,118
[SPEAKER_08]: There is discussion about early EEC, early education and childcare, so that is both our Chapter 74 program as well as our MEET programs.

163
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:04,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids Corner, which is our daycare program for Medford Public Schools employees, and certainly they are at capacity.

164
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there would be no shortage of people interested in that service if there was space to increase enrollment and open that up to the public.

165
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:25,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the final thing that is on the to be added list in core spaces is that that felt integration project that we talked about.

166
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:35,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Suzanne was looking for some information about what that said so that we can sort of paint a like sort of paint some broad strokes about that as well in terms of this is our like sort of goal.

167
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:39,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll stop talking.

168
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:43,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions, thoughts, changes about the course basis section?

169
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:48,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

170
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:48,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

171
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:55,018
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're volunteering, I will sign you up to do that.

172
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:55,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

173
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:55,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

174
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,529
[SPEAKER_06]: will be some of these suggestions based on this piece of property.

175
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:16,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you foresee whether you will make it fit for a location?

176
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:19,256
[SPEAKER_08]: That will all happen in the feasibility study.

177
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is some time from now.

178
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:24,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, in some places, try to

179
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,809
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of describe that.

180
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:35,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's probably buried in one of these sections.

181
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what the other thing I'll do is find it and put it at the top of this section as well.

182
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I printed it in the site section.

183
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:44,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think that danced around it.

184
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,296
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, okay, so I will.

185
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I am making a note that we will add that.

186
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:54,959
Luke.

187
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah.

188
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,142
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I read the

189
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,037
[SPEAKER_04]: and any discussion of proposed changes to current spaces.

190
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:23,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sort of constrained my thinking in applying this as the current space.

191
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:31,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't interpret this as a call for a design concept.

192
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:37,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Because logically, they arise in the details of the current facility.

193
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:50,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I read some of this, especially on page 13, it seems like it's a design vision suit, a multi-part design vision that's being proposed.

194
00:13:51,696 --> 00:14:02,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm asking the committee at large, is that an appropriate statement to include in this document?

195
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:14,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So I asked a similar question of MSBA when I spoke with them.

196
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:23,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they said was they used information in this section to get a feel for the kind of building we're trying to create.

197
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,151
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that is like an answer and a non-answer.

198
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:36,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought about that, too, as I was pulling in some of Tracy's content.

199
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:47,707
[SPEAKER_08]: to bring that to this group because I read it and I was like, I can see what he's talking about.

200
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I can visualize

201
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:56,488
[SPEAKER_08]: what he's saying when he talks about like the performing arts space in this building.

202
00:14:57,068 --> 00:15:02,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I found it very helpful to read that to get a sense of like, do I agree with this?

203
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes or no?

204
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:09,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did for the, you know, for the by and large, and I'm not an expert in space.

205
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, Tracy thinks we probably do.

206
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:19,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So I let I put it in here, sort of with that in mind, which is to say, like, if the if the

207
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:26,168
[SPEAKER_08]: designer or MSBA is trying to understand where our head is at.

208
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:31,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this sufficiently describes how we're currently feeling about the performing arts.

209
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:43,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So Libby and Brian, I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of your experience in this space and whether you feel strongly about what's here.

210
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:44,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it too much?

211
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:46,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it not enough, et cetera?

212
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can get a huge amount

213
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:52,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

214
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,570
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

215
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:04,733
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is, I interpret this question as being scoped within one frame.

216
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:10,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't disagree with any of what Tracy is proposing.

217
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:17,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that the question doesn't belong in this document.

218
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:20,066
I think it does.

219
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:23,607
I would take this as an outline and a chance to show some good vision.

220
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I wouldn't limit it.

221
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they penalize anybody for adding too much information.

222
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:35,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we propose a vision for other activities?

223
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:35,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

224
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:40,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do that for Curtis' test, too.

225
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:40,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

226
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,416
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, because I wasn't sure in terms of, I mean,

227
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's very different.

228
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:52,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like what Joan and I wrote in the back.

229
00:16:52,590 --> 00:17:03,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we're looking at core spaces and what we need out of space, I would want to move what we have currently inside this building.

230
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Just flatten it, you know what I mean?

231
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:06,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Or make it round or something.

232
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:11,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just would like to take the philosophy, like shoot for the moon, like we said.

233
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we're going to have time during

234
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:16,972
[SPEAKER_05]: our admin meetings to work on it, which will be great.

235
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:17,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

236
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're signing up for that, that's great.

237
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:24,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll sign up for it with Joan.

238
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:32,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, Luke, I think as you read this, if there are changes in that vein that paint a bigger picture, I think that's great.

239
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:43,541
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I think we can use this document for is when we went to Arlington and we walked around a brand new building,

240
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:47,423
[SPEAKER_08]: The first thing you saw was like a student-run cafe.

241
00:17:50,386 --> 00:18:02,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody in this building is like dreaming about a student-run cafe because it's like beyond the scope of what by and large we know to be about high school.

242
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:04,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I didn't have a student-run cafe.

243
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:06,579
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't have a student-run cafe.

244
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Those weren't things back when we were kids going to high school.

245
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know what's in this building.

246
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people probably know like what those options are.

247
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:19,148
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think this is also sort of a nice opportunity for us to say to the community,

248
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:24,190
[SPEAKER_08]: here's this big vision, like here's where we're at right now.

249
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:31,871
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the beginning, because I think it could get juices flowing, which will like feed into the feasibility study.

250
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:33,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke.

251
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say, okay, by allowing us members of the committee to make strong statements of what we want in the school and have it

252
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,432
captured in this doc, which is the official record.

253
00:18:53,452 --> 00:19:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I worry that we drown out the voices that we've not heard from yet, because we haven't engaged them.

254
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:15,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's almost like we're taking a hold of the headline, and we're driving in the directions that we want, without even doing an initial read.

255
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:16,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to happen.

256
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that could be a process problem.

257
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,568
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I want to bring it up.

258
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:25,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

259
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:31,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I think also just remember that this is a great time to be visionary and think of big ideas, but also it will not limit what goes in the building.

260
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:43,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's still going to be a programming process where you'll go through with every space that needs to be in the building, and it will include big, great ideas, new spaces that no one's even thought of yet, but also down to offices and admissions spaces.

261
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:50,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yes, we should make sure we're not overbooking anybody that feels like they're being left out of the vision, but also like we're not limited.

262
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:56,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So if another great idea comes up later, or just important space to have it mentioned.

263
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:01,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the other thing that is important to remember is that

264
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:07,652
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no requirement even that the school building committee is involved in the creation of this document.

265
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:11,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the requirement is that it is submitted by the district.

266
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:18,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's appropriate for this team to start to like paint a picture for people to react to.

267
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:19,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'm okay with that.

268
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm personally okay with that.

269
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:26,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I think to the point of like engaging the community,

270
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to engage the community when there's experts in the room who can do that well.

271
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:51,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want us to be too far out ahead of that process because I think none of us particularly is equipped to do that kind of visioning process with the community in a way that's going to sort of be consistent with what has to happen during feasibility.

272
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:55,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want to create a situation where we are

273
00:20:57,452 --> 00:20:59,854
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of out over our skis, essentially.

274
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:16,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think like what I would use this document when we sort of get to the point of publishing this to the community, I mean, they can, it's in the meeting documents and everything, but to say like, this is our, this is like the jumping off point that the committee accelerated to

275
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:26,751
[SPEAKER_08]: get us to the place where like the door, we can open the doors to this bigger vision, but we want you to read this and start to think creatively about these spaces.

276
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:34,356
[SPEAKER_08]: The important thing is like programming like Curtis Tufts, Curtis Tufts has to sort of say like an enter, this is our, this is like

277
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:40,760
[SPEAKER_08]: is, you know, this is our place to, to describe all of that.

278
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,282
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and start that process.

279
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:55,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'm okay with us being sort of visionary in terms of what we know, because as MSBA describes the requirement here is like, this is so that we can start to hear what's important to you.

280
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:55,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you,

281
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:03,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel good that the things that we hear about on the school committee all the time are well represented here.

282
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:15,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Athletics, performing arts, Curtis Tufts, the alternative space for the high school, like all of those things are the, those are the heavy hitter topics for us, generally speaking.

283
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter?

284
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:26,398
[SPEAKER_00]: My one takeaway from this is having worked in schools that had been through MSBA projects or school building projects, however you want to look at it,

285
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:35,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people will often talk about the visionary hopes that they had and that they, they wish they'd done more.

286
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:44,372
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'd wish they'd put in more of it, because that way the voters could have seen, the people could have seen what it could have been.

287
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:50,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, they almost felt hemmed in by worrying about like, oh, will it pass?

288
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it not pass?

289
00:22:52,336 --> 00:23:00,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And my suggestion, having been through this a few times in various things, is to make the building as visionary as possible.

290
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:08,595
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you inspire the community around it, and that you really wrap them into the possibilities and the potential.

291
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry, Larry?

292
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that statement 100%.

293
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:25,906
[SPEAKER_04]: With regards to the student-run food service, when the students

294
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,188
[SPEAKER_04]: time back, the students were clamoring for that.

295
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:43,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But we couldn't do it because the word at that time was, I think, hide and kill.

296
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,456
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're frustrated with that.

297
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:55,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But because of issues of fairness and so forth, that not all students understand that we could afford it at a sale.

298
00:23:55,503 --> 00:24:00,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think going into that, now most of the regional schools I've been to have student

299
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:09,558
[SPEAKER_04]: meal tickets or something.

300
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:12,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The one in Arlington is like a cafe.

301
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So the one in Arlington is like limited because you can't interfere with the food service program.

302
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,805
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a whole other problem.

303
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:25,829
[SPEAKER_08]: But this what was in Arlington was like a cafe, essentially like coffee.

304
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:28,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, students to this day.

305
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:31,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So last year, they Mr. Brown.

306
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:32,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:36,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that number two in terms of the shot.

308
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:43,616
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's all in the chapter 74 piece in that other form.

309
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't make a huge appearance here for that reason.

310
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:53,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

311
00:24:54,139 --> 00:25:05,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, I did put something in there just so it doesn't get lost, but the chapter 74 form talks about all of those programs that we're trying to explore and the proposed capacity.

312
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Essex has an institute up there.

313
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:18,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Their shops are in actual, like, more like warehouse-type buildings adjacent to the structured building.

314
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:26,914
[SPEAKER_04]: What we really need is space and metal buildings that are well-insulated, even with all the power and stuff, are fine.

315
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:28,516
We just need space.

316
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:37,283
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on how the layout was, as a concept, we would find the sort of the top wing that was a little more industrial.

317
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:42,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way, that might also give us more split footage, which is what we would need.

318
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:47,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, it might be a good money.

319
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:48,374
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

320
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I can add something about that in.

321
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:52,516
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

322
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:53,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul?

323
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:55,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

324
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:58,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so it's something that I said, I think, earlier.

325
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:06,723
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were walking around the Bonington building, two things that worked out is to me, just through my experience of it, I think what we were told is that there were multiple areas

326
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:25,340
[SPEAKER_01]: to it because their needs are starting to grow as we start envisioning what we want.

327
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:38,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that I feel also comfortable with this as a starting point or as a jumping off point because it doesn't, I don't think it limits us in that we can't continue to grow or consider what the community actually needs.

328
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're only a select few people.

329
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:46,476
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a community of 60,000 people who all probably have an opinion in some capacity on some program the high school could offer.

330
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:47,377
So I think that

331
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:54,412
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting for the stars or really considering what's possible is also difficult because we don't know what's possible.

332
00:26:54,632 --> 00:27:07,260
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were walking around in Wellington, I mean more than half the tour I was just like in shock at what they had to offer their students, what the faculty were experiencing, what the HFMA or the design firm were offering.

333
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was so much

334
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,812
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what we can do, because it's never happened before.

335
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:26,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So an idea like a student cafe, we've never had that before.

336
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:30,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have it here, and I'm sure many of you didn't have a student cafe in the sense of the word.

337
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:34,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to even consider what that would look like for our community is something that's never been done before.

338
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:36,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So how could you say we want that?

339
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:49,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than hearing we're going to other communities that do have that, which I think is why we should really push to go to other programs that have done MSPA, or it's other programs in general that are offering things that we can't have as of right now, we could consider the program.

340
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with it in its current wording, just as a starting, as a limiting, like it.

341
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

342
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:01,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I want to feed everything from this.

343
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:18,010
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I think about the community involvement, several people have mentioned that we are somewhat limited by our own experiences and knowledge, well, we are completely limited by our own experiences and knowledge.

344
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And so,

345
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:24,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike the community, we're going to go around and look at lots of schools.

346
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,872
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole of Medford is not like this.

347
00:28:28,212 --> 00:28:38,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's, well, to be expected, reasonable to think we have an outsized impact on what's possible.

348
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:48,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I mean, obviously, I'm not serving the community, and I look forward to the professionals that kind of do that, doing that, because, like, I don't envision them

349
00:28:49,209 --> 00:29:05,338
[SPEAKER_02]: providing us with a list of things to do with this building, this room, like, they're going to be providing, in my mind, a set of values, what's important to them, and have feedback from there to create a vision.

350
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But to ask the community, will be self-selected, it will absolutely be not representative of the community, that's 100% not an option, to somehow

351
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:24,194
[SPEAKER_02]: generate a vision, I think it will be great.

352
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see that as something to happen.

353
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:38,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sort of, in my mind, I mean, I'm on this committee, because I have a search for new things that I need to make sure we don't stop talking about, stop thinking about.

354
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:43,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assume everybody here was on here for people had to

355
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:58,680
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're not investing in five to seven years of their lives getting it.

356
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:07,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really do care very much about what everyone else is saying, but like me, I went to a one-level school in Borough of New Hampshire.

357
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:11,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a regional school and built in 1970 or so.

358
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's what high school is.

359
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure hope we don't do that here, but until we start this,

360
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:22,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're going to do.

361
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:23,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible.

362
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:27,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look forward to that opportunity.

363
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sharing what we're experiencing with those tours.

364
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:47,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we saw this thing, like, far like a van, these tunnels that are like as big as this, from the ceiling to the first floor, going through the library, provide light, natural light, everywhere the library came.

365
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird, to be honest.

366
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:55,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, like, never seen such a thing and thought it was cool to go there.

367
00:30:55,045 --> 00:31:04,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm excited for all of these visits, because I suspect we're going to find in every visit things that we want more.

368
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, let's not do that.

369
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:07,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

370
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:09,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

371
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:10,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

372
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:12,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to defer to Lori.

373
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

374
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, you kind of added that.

375
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:16,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess.

376
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:26,349
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, and maybe Peter knows since he's on the cutting edge of kind of the research, I feel like some of the research is missing around this, around the educational underpinning.

377
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:28,670
[SPEAKER_05]: How are we going to deliver instruction, curriculum?

378
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:38,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel, you know, listening and I happen to love school architecture, but I'm also thinking there's a school in San Diego that I know we've all talked about it.

379
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:42,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's the vision for Curtis Tufts that we get to project-based learning.

380
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not looking at the typical classroom.

381
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:53,722
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at collaboration stations, collaboration areas, that the hub is probably the library and we're calling it something else.

382
00:31:54,623 --> 00:32:03,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to make sure that we're not losing that because this building is, I'm sure in 1970 when this building was being built, we were like, this is cutting edge for 1970.

383
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:08,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no one expected that it was going to look the way that it did.

384
00:32:08,114 --> 00:32:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say for the 1900 building that is Curtis Tufts, which I love and I'd love to replicate in different ways, but I just think, I don't want to miss the research on this.

385
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:21,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I think going to high schools is really important.

386
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:28,340
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a school in San Diego that does project-based learning and it's how they structure their day, but it is like a warehouse.

387
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like this and kids come together, like they're doing a project.

388
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:41,031
[SPEAKER_05]: and they leave into different rooms to go do their part of the project or meet with their facilitator.

389
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:52,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to make sure that, because I think we have to be light years ahead of everyone, we're also going to need to be budgeting for how a teacher is going to teach differently.

390
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:54,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to lose that.

391
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:58,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can have a building and not do what you said you were going to do with the building.

392
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:03,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, Mosconomet went through and created this round building

393
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:04,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

394
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So that kids would never have a place to go anywhere but around the building, right?

395
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:10,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's round.

396
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't economically feasible when it came to it.

397
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:18,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you get to the third floor, educationally, there was no air conditioning because they ran out of money.

398
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't have had a third floor.

399
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:29,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make, I'm just thinking curriculum instruction and assessment 15 years from now, because that's typically when probably the building will be built.

400
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:33,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want our plans or what our vision

401
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:36,664
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to be five years ahead of everything.

402
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:41,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you know that school in San Diego, Peter, but it's like cutting edge.

403
00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:47,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's, and their achievement is through the roof and it's attached to a vocational school.

404
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:52,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And so kids are going to, and from, and creating, and design, and it's really about design.

405
00:33:53,171 --> 00:34:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that's what would engage my students, but I'd want to start even younger with middle schoolers, because I think in terms of Curtis Tufts, it's too late for our kids.

406
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:06,434
[SPEAKER_05]: they should have been engaged a long time ago.

407
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just don't want to lose the research.

408
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to do some research and get some articles.

409
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:26,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the work that the administrative team has signed up to do, because they will have to describe the curriculum, the 2B curriculum section of this, which is not complete yet.

410
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:29,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to have an innovative building and then do the same things you've already done.

411
00:34:29,922 --> 00:34:30,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

412
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:31,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's our work.

413
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so you know more than I do.

414
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:34,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

415
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:44,333
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just, you know, I don't want that to be lost because we might as well have this thing developed.

416
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:45,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

417
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:45,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Lou?

418
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:46,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that makes sense.

419
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:47,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

420
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple of points.

421
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:52,037
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of our responses here is delinquent.

422
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:52,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

423
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:54,959
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is still limited.

424
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bunch of things you can talk.

425
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

426
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So about this vertical balance.

427
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:00,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

428
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:06,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is a mistake not to engage with them.

429
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:18,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I think deferring until professionals are involved is possibly too severe an instinct.

430
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:23,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there should be self-coordinated engagement, probably this summer.

431
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:26,478
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about a survey and the education committee.

432
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:28,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a wise idea.

433
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a, what do you want?

434
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree.

435
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:42,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Their responses probably won't be very detailed terms with long explanations about how different elements are integrated, how they support learning.

436
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:50,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not expecting that, but I am expecting to get an understanding of what the community views as important and what they want to see.

437
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:56,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, we kind of know that first and document it.

438
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll use that as part of our vision

439
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:04,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly, a lot of the imaginary is discussed.

440
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:07,008
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a place for that in the process.

441
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:08,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's feasibility.

442
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:18,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we have money earmarked, and we are committed to feasibility, that money will be deployed on consultants, and on people with disabilities.

443
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:28,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of feasibility, we should have, judging by all of the schools that are studying, which is 2.7, we'll have three to five options.

444
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:31,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will have significant detail.

445
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:36,389
[SPEAKER_04]: They will spur a lot of community conversation.

446
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's probably going to get messy.

447
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,751
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a lot of opinions and so on.

448
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:47,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to refer that to feasibility and focus on executive eligibility.

449
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:55,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the reason it's not here is because I've seen through many sources, right, I've spoken to people

450
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,921
[SPEAKER_04]: particular things.

451
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball is a great example, right?

452
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:20,548
[SPEAKER_04]: If you pitch a perfect game and nobody knew you in high school, you're gone in six years.

453
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, you might be on your 14th account, right?

454
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here to keep this thing on track.

455
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to waste that.

456
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,391
[SPEAKER_04]: is nothing else.

457
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:41,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get all those things out there.

458
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:42,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

459
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:44,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I guess a couple things.

460
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:47,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also here to keep this on track.

461
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:51,176
[SPEAKER_08]: It is like my mission in life to keep this thing on track.

462
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:57,920
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that, so I agree with you that we can start to ask those questions in the summer.

463
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,987
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm unclear about is, are you saying we should not submit this until we've done that?

464
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:11,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you suggesting that we submit this and then we use that sort of body of information to also feed the consultants that are going to come on?

465
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:37,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sort of ascribing you and also sort of outlining the efficiency of what we'd like.

466
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:41,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And so is there something in here that you want to not be in here?

467
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:53,217
[SPEAKER_04]: If we are introducing new things that we want, I think that material belongs in these buildings.

468
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:58,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that what this question is asking is to tell us currently

469
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:21,493
[SPEAKER_08]: It is asking for core spaces, specialty spaces, and non-traditional spaces that are described above are proposed to be used if known at this time.

470
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:30,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, if there are proposed changes indicate how they will impact space needs and what training to support staff will or may be provided.

471
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:32,853
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the question.

472
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:34,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

473
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:34,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it?

474
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:34,554
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

475
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:02,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Bear with me, my brain short-circuited several hours back.

476
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:05,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there something you're proposing to take out?

477
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, are there words on the page that you want to take out?

478
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:10,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say anything that doesn't exist today.

479
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:11,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is?

480
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:19,351
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an auditorium which has lighting and acoustics and a sound system.

481
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:30,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Anesthesia, like all of these things exist, they just exist poorly.

482
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:37,060
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a wishlist for book one tomorrow, I would say book one.

483
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: However, that conversation has to be about it.

484
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:50,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you concerned that the MSBA will trip up that process or that people will be concerned that they haven't had a chance to get feedback?

485
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:53,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And we submit this document without reaching out to the community.

486
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:57,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So my mother is, so that's the last one.

487
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:10,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm concerned that we're disenfranchising by allowing our kids to leak into this saying, well, we want a school to be without ever having engaged the community to ask what it wants.

488
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:21,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what the community wants is to talk in feasibility study.

489
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:29,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't get there unless we agree on how we are going to get this document submitted, right?

490
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:32,143
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is why I'm just trying to be really concrete.

491
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:41,439
[SPEAKER_08]: that you what I think what you're saying is there's too much information in items one through 11 on page 14.

492
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead, we should maybe be more broad about what we are thinking.

493
00:41:47,664 --> 00:41:48,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're saying?

494
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:53,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, other than the mini stage, all of those things exist poorly.

495
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And

496
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:11,943
[SPEAKER_04]: This goes in our front of the bracket, right?

497
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:15,945
[SPEAKER_04]: This is part of our official eligibility-based schedule.

498
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:23,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be viewed by anyone who answers the RFI and makes proposals in our community for feasibility study.

499
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:32,272
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are certain things that the size don't bother us, then that contractor will see that and will think about that possibly to the detriment of other things.

500
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is kind of it.

501
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:38,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

502
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:43,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I also would encourage this group to choose their words carefully.

503
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if we start telling people we're disenfranchising them, they will feel that way.

504
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,311
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think the community thinks of us that way.

505
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:54,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and so we shouldn't talk that way.

506
00:42:56,232 --> 00:43:01,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, I think this stuff does find its own legs in the community.

507
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:06,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, the school committee under its authority

508
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:09,524
[SPEAKER_08]: appointed you all.

509
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here to like, make sure we don't mess this up, right?

510
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:18,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everyone in the city is definitely afraid we are going to mess this up.

511
00:43:18,814 --> 00:43:20,776
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just it's the truth.

512
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:24,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can strike

513
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:28,285
[SPEAKER_08]: item 11, all those other things are there.

514
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:38,052
[SPEAKER_08]: We can make it, like I will go through and make it a little bit less specific, which I think is totally fine and reasonable, so that it does not sound so specific.

515
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:52,061
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think to your point, like when we put out a press release that says these documents are complete, there needs to be some framing of this document as like a starting point by this committee,

516
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:56,516
[SPEAKER_08]: in meetings open to the public, it's tough.

517
00:43:56,656 --> 00:44:01,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like May and June, like there's not a whole lot of time in the community for people to be with us.

518
00:44:01,677 --> 00:44:13,460
[SPEAKER_08]: But the entire point of this was to like collect all the feedback that we've heard all along the way, pair it up with like the teaching and learning methodology and get us sort of off to the races.

519
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, to me, that is what we're here to do in eligibility.

520
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:21,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're still on track to do that.

521
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:30,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think the other place where there is some like real description here is around the library media space.

522
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:40,127
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would also say, I don't see anything in here that doesn't sort of match the description of current in some way, shape or form.

523
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:44,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some description of like what the current state is that Maria put in.

524
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:47,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there is the description of the like,

525
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:55,771
[SPEAKER_08]: the ideal space and other than a restroom close by.

526
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:59,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And movable walls.

527
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:15,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I think other than that, we are fairly saying something about how we're envisioning and actually with the luxury of our head librarian doing that for us, that this is sort of what we're envisioning that space to become.

528
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the other place where I thought it was very detailed.

529
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:25,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't know if anybody saw anything else that they thought was maybe too detailed.

530
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:29,830
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some items in the library section that's really good information.

531
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably more necessary like a little farther down the road.

532
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Like needs a sink and like boxes for the cabinets.

533
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:38,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's all great, maybe like a little too granular for this document.

534
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:39,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

535
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:42,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if it hurts us to have it in there, but it may be

536
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And to Luke's point, it's focusing on one area of the project more than others.

537
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:50,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could, I mean, I wouldn't rid of any of it.

538
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:52,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I would maybe, we'll talk to her later.

539
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure, sure, yeah.

540
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:58,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we just save it for the visioning programming part.

541
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:02,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, give me that.

542
00:46:02,423 --> 00:46:02,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

543
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:13,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in one way, I'm assuming you kind of address some of the concerns that I raised and perhaps others shared, is to have more consistent formatting.

544
00:46:14,798 --> 00:46:16,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, different formatting.

545
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like you're emphasizing something over another thing.

546
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,724
[SPEAKER_08]: That will all be cleaned up before this is done.

547
00:46:21,764 --> 00:46:27,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps if that were standardized, things would pop out more than other things.

548
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:28,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

549
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:37,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also we could adjust wording here and there where something needs to be designed to strike that.

550
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:40,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, current series are this.

551
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:52,793
[SPEAKER_04]: have a different, it'll land.

552
00:46:56,676 --> 00:46:56,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

553
00:46:57,937 --> 00:47:03,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all of that is a sort of a wacky template to work in.

554
00:47:04,182 --> 00:47:05,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has like all kinds of different bullets.

555
00:47:06,304 --> 00:47:12,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of that will be cleaned up before we're done to make sure that it's consistent.

556
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that as for those of us that did have some writing

557
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:19,714
[SPEAKER_06]: The assumption was that you would be reformatting.

558
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:22,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I don't suffer from brevity.

559
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,776
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's totally fine.

560
00:47:26,236 --> 00:47:26,956
[SPEAKER_08]: That's totally fine.

561
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:27,596
[SPEAKER_08]: That's totally fine.

562
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:36,457
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did want to say before that, Laurie, if you do look at some of the ideas for the library, I had project-based learning in mind.

563
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,237
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

564
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:39,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I also thought, yeah.

565
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:40,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

566
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:45,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there questions about section three?

567
00:47:47,427 --> 00:47:47,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron?

568
00:47:47,747 --> 00:48:00,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, like you mentioned, for example, some of the more specific items, like on the library, the library media space, we're suggesting that CERN ones are more specific than others.

569
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we taking them out?

570
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:10,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the previous section of the state of the art, the Performing Arts Facility, we're going to strike Levin, but then we're not going to strike others.

571
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:14,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't really know if it makes sense to strike CERN ones but not other ones.

572
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're just, I think what I'm hearing is to just bring everything up to the same level of detail.

573
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:20,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

574
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:21,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

575
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I prefer that.

576
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:32,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're gonna, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to strike certain things and not other ones if we're going to be specific about certain areas.

577
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:34,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think one or the other should be chosen.

578
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, perfect.

579
00:48:38,392 --> 00:48:39,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Larry, did I see your hand?

580
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:40,714
[SPEAKER_04]: A minute ago.

581
00:48:40,974 --> 00:48:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

582
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:48,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be.

583
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:50,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that that's true.

584
00:48:50,729 --> 00:49:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'd like to propose, if you're interested, NELTA, the New England Labor's Training Academy, is just completing, as we speak, a brand new campus, which would be suitable for vocational courses.

585
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:14,188
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has booths and clusters and classrooms surrounded by this big metal shop, as does Essence.

586
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:17,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So conceptually, it builds different schools,

587
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:18,476
[SPEAKER_04]: take a picture.

588
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:25,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean downstairs at Media Tech does a very good job with the students.

589
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:29,859
[SPEAKER_04]: By that point in the fall, or maybe beforehand.

590
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:35,120
[SPEAKER_04]: But put together a nice little montage with music.

591
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:38,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of explains things that get us excited.

592
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:44,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can then maybe go into the theater sometime and show people in the community who are interested.

593
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of what got us going.

594
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,191
[SPEAKER_04]: so we can set the table a little bit.

595
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:51,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think it's good.

596
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:54,374
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, we're kind of painting with a broad brush.

597
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:56,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got all this stuff.

598
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:58,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's good to give a panoramic.

599
00:49:58,936 --> 00:50:07,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And I personally, I guess, I think it's OK to say not only what is, but just to sort of play them a little bit.

600
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we would like to stay in New York Theater.

601
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:12,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really, really nice spot.

602
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:14,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We love those two things.

603
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Classrooms are classrooms, they should be nice, they should be functional.

604
00:50:18,801 --> 00:50:20,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Vogue, they just need space.

605
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:22,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tear it up anyway.

606
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:24,004
So, you know what I'm saying?

607
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:36,609
But say what we want in a broad sense and put that out, show the pictures of what we have liked, all these other tours and visits, and then we start the process of when it's everybody going to the community.

608
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:38,630
And you're constantly coming early to the party.

609
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,112
[SPEAKER_04]: The connection with the films, media is really big.

610
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:45,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, and Suzanne was working on that.

611
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Tracking down that application that went in.

612
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:53,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Some years ago now to do something.

613
00:50:53,643 --> 00:51:02,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very project based learning integration with the outdoors oriented for another grant that we did not get, but she was going to.

614
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:07,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Go through the files and we had information to figure out if there's anything that.

615
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock climbing baseball.

616
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:21,252
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, groomed cross-country ski course up there with some yurts and you can eat here.

617
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:24,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that is so undeveloped and it's a gem for the entire city.

618
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:29,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to be capitalistic, but there's money in terms of parking fees and concessions and stuff.

619
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that is such a beautiful

620
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:53,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So how that integrates with everybody, there could be cross-country meets in that area.

621
00:51:53,350 --> 00:52:09,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So to whet the appetite of it, to me, I think it's fair to point out what is here, some of the deficiencies, what we feel like we're lacking for the sake of students, and then sort of shoot them with some options of kind of what we're thinking.

622
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:10,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

623
00:52:11,034 --> 00:52:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

624
00:52:12,794 --> 00:52:16,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions, comments?

625
00:52:18,424 --> 00:52:18,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria?

626
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to mention one thing.

627
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:23,948
[SPEAKER_06]: You're probably already aware PVD High School is in process right now.

628
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,229
[SPEAKER_06]: They're about to begin the design phase.

629
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:30,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So I spoke with the librarian at PVD High School.

630
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,473
[SPEAKER_06]: She gave me some of her notes, which I incorporated.

631
00:52:33,274 --> 00:52:33,594
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

632
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're just a few steps ahead.

633
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

634
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:36,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a resource.

635
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:38,137
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

636
00:52:39,237 --> 00:52:39,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

637
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:39,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian?

638
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:44,921
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your list of potential students who are unable to attend?

639
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,322
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is on?

640
00:52:47,229 --> 00:53:11,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Um so we talked about Arlington, we talked about Somerville, Belmont, okay and you know the other you know the thing we may want to do is sort of reformat our summer meetings to be like tours instead so that we have some time in summer to do various tours so um

641
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:30,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be a great use of summer if we can get all of these documents, if we can get through all of these documents so that we really can sort of take the summer to put all of our like communication plans together, start to tell the community what we're saying, start to look at all those other schools and sort of get ready.

642
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:34,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might just be nice timing to do all of that.

643
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:37,358
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to go to Nelta, I think I can send that home.

644
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:37,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

645
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:41,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I think that's out there, especially with locations

646
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:44,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, okay.

647
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:44,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

648
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:47,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what school is that?

649
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:47,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Quincy.

650
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:48,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

651
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:18,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

652
00:54:20,873 --> 00:54:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

653
00:54:24,075 --> 00:54:35,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be great.

654
00:54:35,683 --> 00:54:37,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Section four, community engagement.

655
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:44,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the last time we talked, people talked about the sequencing of the information in there.

656
00:54:48,351 --> 00:55:01,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tried to, although I'm finding the typos because I was doing this in my lap at the council meeting last night, but I did try to like re-sequence this to better flow with the information that we have in here.

657
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:06,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So talking about the communications and community engagement subcommittee first.

658
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:16,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was last and then talking about some of the things specifically that they asked about around, you know, what kinds of things are we considering doing?

659
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:25,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, in addition, doing a little bit of sort of just framing that last paragraph a little bit better about.

660
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:38,425
[SPEAKER_08]: the engagement that we've already done around the co-location of Curtis Tufts because that is a program that we are proposing to bring on here and the school committee has done some very helpful useful work to sort of move that forward.

661
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:49,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is, I think that is everything in this document.

662
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

663
00:55:58,724 --> 00:56:07,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, is there a motion to approve this document as amended and to be completed as noted?

664
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:11,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to approve as amended and completed as noted.

665
00:56:12,894 --> 00:56:13,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

666
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:15,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by... Oh.

667
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:18,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask to stand by?

668
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:19,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

669
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:19,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

670
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:23,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I put your name on the list.

671
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:24,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

672
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:33,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so a motion by Dr. Cushing and Aaron, seconded by Aaron.

673
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:41,294
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our voting members are in person.

674
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:42,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So all those in favor.

675
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:45,416
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

676
00:56:46,996 --> 00:56:47,556
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

677
00:56:48,556 --> 00:56:48,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

678
00:56:58,022 --> 00:57:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

679
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:01,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do that.

680
00:57:04,444 --> 00:57:13,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the last item on our agenda for this evening is just to give you an update on the maintenance practices information.

681
00:57:15,428 --> 00:57:19,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Dr. Cushing, so let me pass this out and then I'll explain what it is.

682
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:56,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, does everyone have a coffee?

683
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're almost there.

684
00:57:58,975 --> 00:57:59,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

685
00:58:01,236 --> 00:58:14,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so just as framing, the MSBA has an online portal where they require us to upload a whole variety of documents around our maintenance and capital planning practices.

686
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:30,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier in this process, Tom and I sat down with that system and we went through and we created this document to just try to provide like a working place for all of that information.

687
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll see all the questions listed.

688
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:38,410
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout this document.

689
00:58:40,573 --> 00:58:44,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you'll see is the questions, the answer format.

690
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:53,989
[SPEAKER_08]: So many of these things are like yes, no type questions, and then any comments, which would be comments that we need to put into the system to answer the question, et cetera.

691
00:58:55,485 --> 00:59:09,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so if we start at the top, what I think you'll see is that the vast majority of this information has to be completed by Dr. Cushing, who's our representative on the committee in terms of

692
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:20,903
[SPEAKER_08]: his work as the overseer of the facilities department for Medford Public Schools, among other 45 other jobs that he does.

693
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:34,396
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think I just wanted to run through the questions here as a sort of jumping off point and talk a little bit about, you know, give you all a chance to review all the information that

694
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:40,869
[SPEAKER_08]: is populated in here already and talk about next steps for this document.

695
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,251
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we start at the top, the first series of questions is really around staffing.

696
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:53,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So it asks about, question number one is, is the facility maintenance performed by the municipality or the district?

697
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:56,676
[SPEAKER_08]: In our situation, it's a combination of both.

698
00:59:57,415 --> 01:00:08,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So the districts largely has the responsibility for sort of all things maintenance until something gets too big and becomes a capital project and then the city does step in.

699
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:15,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Our buildings and grounds department clears snow and they do other projects like paving and things like that.

700
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:17,172
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is truly a group effort.

701
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:22,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number two, are vendors used for any aspect of facilities maintenance?

702
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:24,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer to that is yes.

703
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:34,818
[SPEAKER_08]: For all of these things, plumbing, pest management, elevator inspections, asbestos testing, et cetera, fire alarm systems, all of that good stuff.

704
01:00:35,238 --> 01:00:37,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting on the name of our pest management company.

705
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:46,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, full-time equivalent, to help them understand how many custodians we have across the district.

706
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a director of facilities?

707
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:51,192
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

708
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:57,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And does the district have defined job descriptions for our custodial staff?

709
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:59,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is yes, so we'll have to attach those.

710
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:06,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, item number six is their system of performance evaluations of the district's custodial and maintenance staff.

711
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:15,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that is a work in progress, but, uh, we are, uh, pending contract negotiations around that.

712
01:01:17,071 --> 01:01:22,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, number seven is training required or provided for the district's custodial and maintenance staff.

713
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:23,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yes.

714
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:28,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And we cover some of the things that we have, um, trained our staff in starting in 2023.

715
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:39,841
[SPEAKER_08]: And then number eight is their written maintenance plan for the district that details minimum custodial maintenance standards and governs day to day operations.

716
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:40,881
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

717
01:01:41,822 --> 01:01:43,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we will have to attach those documents.

718
01:01:43,923 --> 01:01:47,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the staffing section, the planning.

719
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:52,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a preventive or predictive maintenance plan for the district's facilities?

720
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:57,404
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes, and there's an attachment that we'll have to provide.

721
01:01:58,225 --> 01:02:00,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district have a work order system?

722
01:02:00,187 --> 01:02:01,128
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer is yes.

723
01:02:01,248 --> 01:02:06,374
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually recently converted from email work order system, which is

724
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:13,163
[SPEAKER_08]: problematic, as you might mention, to a system called operations hero.

725
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a true work order ticketing system.

726
01:02:17,707 --> 01:02:25,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And we the district is sort of rolling folks onto that both on the custodial staff and then also in the school buildings.

727
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the course, there's working on that implementation.

728
01:02:29,736 --> 01:02:31,138
[SPEAKER_08]: The facilities condition index

729
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:33,391
[SPEAKER_08]: question number one.

730
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:37,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district conduct periodic inspections of school facilities to ascertain their conditions?

731
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:39,035
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

732
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:52,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, item number two is do we have a facilities condition index which keeps track of school systems, identifies major system components and tracks information.

733
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:56,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we purchased some software to begin doing that in February of 2024.

734
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:57,748
[SPEAKER_08]: That's operation hero.

735
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:57,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

736
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:11,157
[SPEAKER_08]: item number three, please describe how the district analyzes facility condition information and how that analysis impacts decisions on budget capital improvements and staff performance.

737
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:18,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So up until recently, the facility conditions and repairs were done on an as-needed basis.

738
01:03:21,229 --> 01:03:22,310
[SPEAKER_08]: the district.

739
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:35,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So beginning in FY 24, we've really begun to shift to a recommissioning model where we are looking at each of our schools on a periodic basis to understand their budgetary needs, etc.

740
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:37,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number four,

741
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:41,919
[SPEAKER_08]: is do we have a protocol around commissioning and recommissioning?

742
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: That is starting in FY25.

743
01:03:46,162 --> 01:03:48,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And that process is essentially on a periodic basis.

744
01:03:50,385 --> 01:04:00,952
[SPEAKER_08]: You do sort of a soup to nuts assessment of what is happening in the building so that you can identify what it would take to bring the building back to its original condition in terms of its intention.

745
01:04:01,632 --> 01:04:04,774
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what that does is it sort of highlights any maintenance

746
01:04:06,515 --> 01:04:08,096
[SPEAKER_08]: practices that need to change.

747
01:04:08,977 --> 01:04:12,440
[SPEAKER_08]: HVAC can, you know, the big systems there are like HVAC oriented.

748
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:22,767
[SPEAKER_08]: You may or may not know this, but we have a project going on right now in our middle schools that will replace HVAC systems in the Andrews Middle School and then in the entire McGlynn complex.

749
01:04:23,788 --> 01:04:32,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So those buildings are like in effect being reconditioned because of that substantive work, which is scheduled to be done.

750
01:04:32,294 --> 01:04:33,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully by next summer.

751
01:04:33,816 --> 01:04:34,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Next summer.

752
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:34,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

753
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:45,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other schools, Brooks, Roberts, Missittuck, will get on to the reconditioning cycle with this next rehab.

754
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:51,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the expectation would be the high school would go on to like a five-year loop with the other schools as well.

755
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:52,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria?

756
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:55,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question because those buildings are only 20 plus years old.

757
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:58,354
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm going to say?

758
01:04:58,374 --> 01:04:58,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.

759
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:05,354
[SPEAKER_06]: because of not being kept up or is that just aging out?

760
01:05:05,514 --> 01:05:07,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's actually a really good question.

761
01:05:08,055 --> 01:05:09,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really is both.

762
01:05:09,436 --> 01:05:23,563
[SPEAKER_00]: In all honesty, and with any of our architects and others who have a lot more experience than I do, the reality is as these buildings approach 25 years old, they're at midlife expectancy for their structure.

763
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,653
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, roofs last about 30 years.

764
01:05:28,774 --> 01:05:34,779
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC equipment, you know, some pieces of the equipment are expected to last 10 years.

765
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are expected to last 15.

766
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:45,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, your bigger equipment, your rooftop chillers, your compressors, things like that, with proper maintenance, will make it to that 25-year mark.

767
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:57,196
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially at that point, I mean, everybody we have talked to in our process for OPM and designers is, oh, yeah, they're at the end of their life.

768
01:05:58,116 --> 01:05:59,517
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be the Rolls Royce.

769
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:10,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is how I described it to someone like, you know, we're not going to put more money into fixing these because it's not a classic Mustang or classic car.

770
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:12,264
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 1975 Pinto.

771
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:25,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so yes, yes to both of those things right like proactive maintenance like extends the life of these systems.

772
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:36,049
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is a life of the system that you know you you tap out and I think what you see, particularly when you talk when you start to think about like that's kind of.

773
01:06:37,179 --> 01:07:04,245
[SPEAKER_08]: system programming that's going to go into this new high school like Arlington talked a lot about how like they don't know how to use their building just yet because it is so highly technical and so very different than how their building used to operate that they said often they hear they are like this thing is broken and it's not broken at all they just don't know how to use it yet right and so there's this huge learning curve that goes into these these new buildings in particular

774
01:07:04,927 --> 01:07:07,081
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, for the same reason that like

775
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:12,369
[SPEAKER_08]: when your car is like fully electrified inside, right?

776
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:16,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's more parts, there's more things that can go wrong, right?

777
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:21,156
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more, there's more, well, if you're completely electric, that's different.

778
01:07:21,196 --> 01:07:29,622
[SPEAKER_08]: But like you start talking about like even the advancement of anything else that's going on in your home, like you're, you know, the refrigerator from the 70s lasted for 30 years.

779
01:07:31,623 --> 01:07:35,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still, maybe it's still running in avocado green, but

780
01:07:35,816 --> 01:07:41,938
[SPEAKER_08]: If you buy a refrigerator 10 years ago, you're probably thinking about it's time for a new refrigerator.

781
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:47,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So the entire way we maintain our buildings will change with this new building.

782
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:51,960
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what they're trying to understand is, how do we do it today?

783
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:56,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So how big of a climb is this going to be for us to take good care of this building?

784
01:07:57,181 --> 01:08:01,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is, we have work to do in that department, for sure.

785
01:08:03,363 --> 01:08:11,328
[SPEAKER_08]: we are trying to get there proactively so that we have arrived by the time this building comes on because that's going to be its own challenge.

786
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:18,652
[SPEAKER_08]: The environment question, does the district routinely monitor air quality?

787
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:19,773
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

788
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:26,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district implement practices in the EPA's Tools for Schools program?

789
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,378
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer is yes.

790
01:08:28,258 --> 01:08:30,079
[SPEAKER_00]: More information forthcoming.

791
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do have more work to do on that.

792
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:39,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district have a protocol to eliminate toxic chemicals and use green products for cleaning and repairs?

793
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:48,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Best practices for building operators typically include regular inspecting, testing, balancing, and cleaning of HVAC components in order to make them most efficient.

794
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:49,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we do that?

795
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:53,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's like maybe a working yes.

796
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district monitor energy consumption and spending?

797
01:08:57,537 --> 01:08:58,338
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.

798
01:08:58,358 --> 01:09:00,099
[SPEAKER_00]: We've started that this year.

799
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:04,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a very interesting analysis.

800
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:07,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you right now.

801
01:09:07,505 --> 01:09:08,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one word.

802
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:08,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

803
01:09:09,026 --> 01:09:09,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Luke?

804
01:09:09,206 --> 01:09:11,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Since COVID, yes.

805
01:09:28,462 --> 01:09:30,623
[SPEAKER_08]: With outside testing, yeah.

806
01:09:31,403 --> 01:09:32,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

807
01:09:32,644 --> 01:09:37,866
[SPEAKER_03]: There's technology now, meters.

808
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:50,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Across a number of UK metrics, a number of international metrics.

809
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:52,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything you want.

810
01:09:53,552 --> 01:09:55,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there is a problem, you can go that way.

811
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:05,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's once a year or if a concern is raised.

812
01:10:05,389 --> 01:10:19,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we had flooding, I forget when that was, December, January, whenever we were hit at the high school with a heavy flood, once we had everything cleaned up, we brought in UEC consultants

813
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:21,814
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did air testing.

814
01:10:23,174 --> 01:10:32,857
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found to be fine at the Brooks and other schools, the Mississippi in particular, where there's been some buildup of land or the land is just up against the foundation.

815
01:10:32,897 --> 01:10:34,838
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been some concern of moisture.

816
01:10:35,358 --> 01:10:37,339
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will do testing in those spaces.

817
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:42,821
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing too is across our

818
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:58,208
[SPEAKER_00]: District right now we're doing a district mapping project to know every single space to get pictures of every space to really understand every space for us to be able to have a device like you mentioned, we'll probably have a significant ramp up cost.

819
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:03,512
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think we should really look at when we go for a new high school.

820
01:11:04,072 --> 01:11:26,986
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what Member Graham is saying about the things that we need to learn as part of this HVAC project with the Andrews and the McGlynn, that's been one of my key questions is, okay, this is great, but once we commission these, how are we gonna know that our maintenance staff are well-trained to be able to monitor and then not just like know what to monitor, but know when

821
01:11:27,466 --> 01:11:32,427
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know something, this is outside of my scope, I can't try to fix this, I need to call someone in.

822
01:11:33,888 --> 01:11:44,070
[SPEAKER_00]: So those types of things, like know what you know and then also know what you don't know so that the system can be maintained by truly trained HVAC professionals.

823
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And our maintenance staff does a great job.

824
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:52,072
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, we're getting into an area with these building systems

825
01:11:52,879 --> 01:11:57,403
[SPEAKER_00]: that require extraordinarily high training and high skill.

826
01:12:00,265 --> 01:12:01,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I give a quick example?

827
01:12:02,847 --> 01:12:05,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the maintenance guy's fault.

828
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:09,232
[SPEAKER_04]: There are times when everybody else is open.

829
01:12:09,632 --> 01:12:12,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Open groups in the winter, but class is out.

830
01:12:13,255 --> 01:12:15,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids over at C building, it's the community

831
01:12:24,821 --> 01:12:29,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And simple, but good quality, to me, is what's really important for the board.

832
01:12:30,063 --> 01:12:32,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Another quick example.

833
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:35,244
[SPEAKER_04]: The lights we had in the shops were terrible.

834
01:12:35,304 --> 01:12:40,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Those fluorescents, a lot of juice, they didn't shine very brightly.

835
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got this rant of getting new LEDs.

836
01:12:42,886 --> 01:12:45,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like, not very literally in the shops.

837
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:45,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wonderful.

838
01:12:46,527 --> 01:12:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Except that whoever sold the bill of goods got all this,

839
01:12:55,117 --> 01:12:56,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good, no problem there.

840
01:12:57,217 --> 01:12:59,738
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was all programmed via cell phone.

841
01:13:00,218 --> 01:13:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We had no control over it.

842
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't go over internet.

843
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:04,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And cell phone reception is terrible.

844
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:08,919
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was pre-pandemic days for about three years.

845
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:13,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I would come over here to walk in the middle of the weekend, and the lights were on in my shop.

846
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,281
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on?

847
01:13:15,761 --> 01:13:18,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was supposed to stop that.

848
01:13:19,221 --> 01:13:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just asked, can we just put in switches?

849
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:23,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we didn't think, well, how long does it take to turn on the switches?

850
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:33,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just took like until two years after we got back to schools, about a year and a half ago, we finally solved it and we haven't had a bunch of problems since.

851
01:13:33,722 --> 01:13:37,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they did, but they had a bunch of the guys from Jordan come up and figured it all out.

852
01:13:38,484 --> 01:13:49,987
[SPEAKER_04]: But just sometimes we run with all the bills and things that are so high tech, it's like software that is, it has all these whistles and bells, but you only need this 5%, you know what I'm saying?

853
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:50,947
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need all this other stuff.

854
01:13:57,363 --> 01:13:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: mental capacity to do it.

855
01:13:59,544 --> 01:14:07,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think that this is something we're going to have to deal with throughout this whole process and review.

856
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:18,430
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing with regards to, I would like to see as part of this vision thing, is I would really, really like, and I think John would back me 100%, is to have that having maintenance department.

857
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,931
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a maintenance department.

858
01:14:21,531 --> 01:14:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That has a space, a little shop,

859
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:25,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay.

860
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

861
01:14:26,281 --> 01:14:34,327
[SPEAKER_04]: A place where they can take their lawn mowers in so we don't have to build these sheds all over the place, store them, work on them.

862
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:34,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

863
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:41,613
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy probably needs a pickup because they're always borrowing other shops, trucks when it snows.

864
01:14:42,093 --> 01:14:48,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our own snowplow and we have tried to form a relationship with maintenance because they need help.

865
01:14:49,499 --> 01:14:50,700
[SPEAKER_04]: They need the facilities.

866
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,362
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to always borrow tools, ladders, scaffolds.

867
01:14:57,947 --> 01:15:00,068
[SPEAKER_04]: to work and to do stuff.

868
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:02,068
[SPEAKER_04]: They need their own stage and scaffold.

869
01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:14,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the kids, the cooperation, because so you know, every year they break leaves, they prune trees, they do the landscape.

870
01:15:14,393 --> 01:15:17,854
[SPEAKER_04]: The kids have done all this garden stuff out in front.

871
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year they were all on their hands and knees pulling weeds out of the break out of the center courtyard.

872
01:15:23,056 --> 01:15:26,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, there was this stuff about paint

873
01:15:27,185 --> 01:15:31,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So every year we work with all the potholes and parking lots.

874
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:38,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids have resurfaced, seal coated parking lots and painted all the stripes.

875
01:15:38,907 --> 01:15:42,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So since they do that, I would like the kids to get a little recognition.

876
01:15:43,448 --> 01:15:51,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And also maybe that can be part of a new plan, which is collaboration, where the vocational students can take on some of that stuff.

877
01:15:51,709 --> 01:15:55,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try and try to get some of these kids co-op jobs

878
01:15:55,626 --> 01:15:57,447
[SPEAKER_04]: But in construction, you have to be 18.

879
01:15:58,228 --> 01:16:01,430
[SPEAKER_04]: But they could work with the school for a little bit here and there.

880
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,010
[SPEAKER_04]: We could maybe do some more merging.

881
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:10,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding the last thing I'll say, the warehouse thing, I just think the guys at CCW would like this at all.

882
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:13,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But that could be a stopgap thing.

883
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:15,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever been in that facility?

884
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is.

885
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:19,080
[SPEAKER_04]: That's everything they construct for free.

886
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It is nice.

887
01:16:20,441 --> 01:16:21,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It's big.

888
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:21,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It has everything in it.

889
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:27,553
[SPEAKER_04]: If they didn't get a quarter, maybe for the school district, they run out of that for a while.

890
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:28,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

891
01:16:28,853 --> 01:16:30,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you didn't hear that.

892
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:31,454
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

893
01:16:31,494 --> 01:16:33,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, you're being recorded, right?

894
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:33,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so

895
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:46,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in this document is a series of questions about budget.

896
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:50,940
[SPEAKER_08]: So does the facility maintenance person have a role in establishing the budget?

897
01:16:51,981 --> 01:16:57,423
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the amounts that have been requested in the budget over a series of years?

898
01:16:58,103 --> 01:17:01,064
[SPEAKER_08]: What was allocated in the budget over a series of years?

899
01:17:01,244 --> 01:17:04,485
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a variance, why was there a variance?

900
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:10,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Expended budget over a series of years.

901
01:17:12,196 --> 01:17:13,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a variance?

902
01:17:13,998 --> 01:17:21,204
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a variance of 20% or greater between consecutive years and the district's total expended amounts, please provide the details on the reason for the difference.

903
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,060
[SPEAKER_08]: projected budget.

904
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:25,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're actually on a better track there.

905
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:26,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is nice.

906
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:35,544
[SPEAKER_08]: What does the district believe that the appropriate amount of spending on operations and maintenance should be to allow for routine maintenance of those facilities?

907
01:17:36,104 --> 01:17:37,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And how close are we?

908
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:43,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had lots of conversation at the council meeting last night, in particular, because

909
01:17:46,801 --> 01:17:56,381
[SPEAKER_08]: that there are potential Proposition 2.5 overrides on the ballot in November, voted in last night.

910
01:17:57,303 --> 01:18:07,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of all of that money, $7.5 million across the two ballot measures, other than $500,000, would be directed towards schools.

911
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:16,993
[SPEAKER_08]: A big part of the planning that went into those numbers was things like making sure that we're able to provide routine maintenance that supports the district.

912
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:17,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a big deal.

913
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:24,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then any other comments on your budget history, so we will talk about those upcoming items.

914
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:27,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there's a capital program piece.

915
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:35,748
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in good shape from a capital program perspective because the city, we had a capital program for several years when Mayor Lungo-Koehn

916
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:37,995
[SPEAKER_08]: took the reins of the city.

917
01:18:38,135 --> 01:18:47,284
[SPEAKER_08]: She created an integrated capital plan that included the schools and they use the calling center to help establish that.

918
01:18:48,185 --> 01:18:57,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we are in the midst of a policy change on the school committee side to sort of codify our annual capital planning review process for schools.

919
01:18:59,897 --> 01:19:06,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the capital budget history asks about tax overrides, capital exclusions, debt exclusions.

920
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:12,224
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to all of those is we have not done that before, but we're about to do it in November.

921
01:19:13,404 --> 01:19:20,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And then any other capital projects that were deferred due to funding constraints, so I'm sure that we will have one or two items in there.

922
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:25,844
[SPEAKER_08]: The final section is the capital improvement plan and budget.

923
01:19:27,404 --> 01:19:41,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is you know what is our capital improvement plan and budget so we will attach the city's capital improvement plan and some of the other documents that we have internally and then provide any information about availability of non public funds for school facility purposes.

924
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:43,571
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about our rentals.

925
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,363
[SPEAKER_08]: and some other things there.

926
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:56,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And then provide information from the treasurer finance committee or capital planning committee regarding the outstanding debt and future bond capacity inside the debt limit for municipalities.

927
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that will come from the bankers office.

928
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:06,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this last table was just a table, one of the tables that have to be sort of filled out and completed.

929
01:20:07,089 --> 01:20:18,034
[SPEAKER_08]: So all this document is really just to allow us to start to collect the information where that ultimately then has to be like keyed into the system in a very particular way.

930
01:20:19,654 --> 01:20:23,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to share this with you, find out if you have questions or comments.

931
01:20:25,126 --> 01:20:30,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Our working goal is again that by June 30th this will be done and we will be able to submit it.

932
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:37,859
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have until I think October to do this, but we can't go to that next phase in the process until we're done.

933
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:44,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So our goal is to get all of this documentation pulled together and buttoned up between now and then.

934
01:20:44,065 --> 01:20:45,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So questions?

935
01:20:49,193 --> 01:21:02,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, would anybody like to make a motion to authorize Dr. Cushing and I to complete and submit the questionnaire?

936
01:21:02,561 --> 01:21:15,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so motion for myself and Dr. Cushing to complete this questionnaire as requested by Nicole Morell, seconded by Emily.

937
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:16,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Emily.

938
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:20,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all those in favor?

939
01:21:21,883 --> 01:21:22,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

940
01:21:22,565 --> 01:21:23,286
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

941
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:25,130
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

942
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

943
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,902
[SPEAKER_08]: We are at the end of our agenda, a few minutes early.

944
01:21:35,122 --> 01:21:40,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next full meeting is scheduled at six o'clock on July 17th via Zoom.

945
01:21:41,006 --> 01:21:46,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be in touch with the communications committee so that we can find another date hopefully in July.

946
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:57,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the next steps are to finish up these forms and get everything submitted and look forward to that feasibility study vote by the council on the 25th.

947
01:21:59,297 --> 01:22:08,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so that we are sort of off to the races and then, you know, use the summer to do our community engagement planning and do some touring.

948
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:19,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So between now and July 1st, I'm going to say I will be back in touch with you if I am able to sort of shift things around and schedule some dates and times.

949
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:27,037
[SPEAKER_08]: So those two meetings may not stay on the calendar exactly as they are, but I will let you know as soon as I have ideas and plans.

950
01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:40,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally speaking, if we're going to go to a school in the summer, I think their folks are going to lean toward wanting to host us, not in the evenings, is there.

951
01:22:43,322 --> 01:22:46,565
[SPEAKER_08]: time frame that works better for you all than others.

952
01:22:48,527 --> 01:22:53,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming it's summer, it's going to be sort of a Monday to Friday ish thing.

953
01:22:53,853 --> 01:23:00,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably they're going to ask for us not to come from six to eight, but I will certainly ask if that's a possibility.

954
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:05,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there other other times like, generally speaking that like,

955
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:07,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Is morning better than afternoon?

956
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:08,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Is afternoon better than lunchtime?

957
01:23:08,976 --> 01:23:10,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Is lunchtime the best?

958
01:23:11,037 --> 01:23:12,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Any feedback about scheduling?

959
01:23:12,658 --> 01:23:13,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's all impossible.

960
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,301
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

961
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:16,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily?

962
01:23:16,801 --> 01:23:22,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's flexible, but I assume we're not going to get a critical mass of our feedback.

963
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:28,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just probably going to be something that some school that's a great example offers themselves.

964
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:30,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we think it won't, we don't.

965
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:31,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

966
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:31,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

967
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:34,172
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have more conversations.

968
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we should prioritize whatever school is the best example for us to see.

969
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:41,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my take on it.

970
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:41,887
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, Nicole?

971
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:47,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'd be nice to just not be there to overshow or damn take your time.

972
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:49,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

973
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

974
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:55,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions, comments about timing and scheduling?

975
01:23:56,702 --> 01:23:57,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's all.

976
01:23:58,128 --> 01:24:12,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I said, I will ask if there are people willing to host us on an evening, and maybe there's evening programming going on in the building where somebody would be willing to do that, or the architects would be willing, the designers often are willing to sort of help make those things happen.

977
01:24:12,933 --> 01:24:17,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will do some outreach and be in touch.

978
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:22,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure the HMFH would be very happy to take a group back to Arlington.

979
01:24:23,377 --> 01:24:24,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some of you got to see Arlington,

980
01:24:26,438 --> 01:24:30,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just right next door, which is amazing and was very cool.

981
01:24:30,839 --> 01:24:33,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will be in touch on that.

982
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as I have dates, I will have Lisa send them out to you all so that you have them on your calendar.

983
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:43,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And you all should have district email now.

984
01:24:43,342 --> 01:24:45,523
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have questions about that, you can see Dr. Cushing.

985
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:49,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there a motion to adjourn?

986
01:24:51,824 --> 01:24:53,165
