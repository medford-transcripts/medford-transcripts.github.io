00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:04,013
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:08,896
The ninth regular meeting of the Memphis City Council.

3
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:10,317
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,217
Councilor Behrs?

00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,058
Present.

6
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:14,039
Councilor Falco?

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:15,080
Present.

Vice President Knight?

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,041
Present.

11
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:18,582

Councilor Scarpelli?

15
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:22,484
Present.

16
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:23,464
President Caravaglia?

17
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:24,745
Yes, this is the president.

18
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:37,534
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:08,067

24
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:46,859
In the event we were able to do so despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford

25
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:56,399
community media website and audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as possible.

26
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,824
Councilor Knight, would you please take the chair?

27
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:24,630
That's why I asked.

28
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,513
Council paper 21078 offered by President Caraviello.

29
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:41,244
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests that we reach out to one of the owners of the 630 Felsway Plaza, Kimco Corporation to meet with the city council on the placement of collection bins on their property.

30
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:42,486
Councilor Caraviello.

31
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:45,528
Thank you, Mr. President.

32
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:46,369
Today I received a call

33
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,003
couple of residents that the bins are overflowing again.

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:56,910
And this is the second time that I've reached out to the company to have that emptied.

35
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,094
So they were emptied, I think, later this evening.

36
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:14,385
When I reached out to the company that owns that, Standard Recycling, those were supposed to have been removed last week because they weren't in compliance with our current ordinance.

37
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:19,747
When I talked to the gentleman again today, he said he promised they'll be up by the end of the week.

38
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:25,769
But, Mr. President, this is already twice that I've had to reach out to them.

39
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:33,056
They're not showing the good faith that, I mean, even in the beginning, I mean, these are getting filled.

40
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:47,587
So I think it's time that we reach out to Kimco, we sign an agreement with this company for the placements of those containers on their property, and have them appear before the council, and so the neighbors can make this pleasure known.

41
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:53,711
about those being there because they're a site hazard and they're just a hazard in general.

42
00:03:54,052 --> 00:04:04,059
So I would ask that if the administration contact Kimco and request that they come to the council within the next 14 days.

43
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:12,085
Second.

44
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,888
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

45
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,671
Will the clerk please call the roll.

46
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:24,774
Councilor Beers.

47
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:25,454
Yes.

48
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:27,215
Falco.

49
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:28,436
Yes.

50
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:29,616
Councilor Marks.

51
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:30,297
Yes.

52
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,277
Councilor Morrell.

53
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:32,018
Yes.

54
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:33,699
Kelly.

55
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,079
Yes.

56
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:35,260
President Carabiello.

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:35,940
Yes.

58
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,820
Vice President Knight.

59
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,141
Yes.

60
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,303
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

61
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:43,344
Mr. President.

62
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:48,067
I'll wait for the president to get up there before we switch seats.

63
00:04:58,516 --> 00:04:59,016
Councilor Marks.

64
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:00,798
Thank you, Mr. President.

65
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:17,631
Three weeks ago, this council voted unanimously to request that the Board of Health Director give us and the residents of this community a weekly update on the vaccine rollout, as well as any potential method sites for vaccination sites.

66
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:36,039
And we received, all of us received an email from the mayor stating that the Board of Health Director will appear before the Meffitt City Council on March 9th and that she will give the council as well as residents an update on the rollout at that point, Mr. President.

67
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:48,290
So I just wanna update people that are concerned in the community on how to get assistance and when and if there'll be a vaccination site locally that they can attend.

68
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,271
Thank you.

69
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,115
Thank you, Councilor Lonnox.

70
00:05:53,135 --> 00:06:01,642
21079 offered by Vice President Knight, whereas quarter two revenue forecast projects a 5.5 to an $8 million structural deficit, whereas

71
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:13,093
The current fiscal year budget relies on $5 million in reserves, be it so resolved that the Mayor present to the City Council a zero-based budget for the upcoming fiscal year.

72
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:13,914
Vice President Knight.

73
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:15,694
Mr. President, thank you very much.

74
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:23,217
This is a resolution that I raised last year prior to the pandemic, and then the pandemic struck, and we were faced with a lot of fiscal uncertainty.

75
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:30,554
It's apparent that that fiscal uncertainty still lingers over our head now, and I don't think that those circumstances are going to change.

76
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:35,455
But Mr. President, what I'm asking the mayor to do is to put forward a zero-based budget.

77
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:50,738
Instead of continuing the trend of using last year as a reference point, to have each department start with zero and build a budget from the ground up, a budget that will be based upon measurables and goals, and will have

78
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:56,877
every expense justified based upon its funding mechanism, its impact, and its prioritization to the community, Mr. President.

79
00:06:57,257 --> 00:07:08,346
I think we're at a point now where we're still working off McGlynn One budget that's been traditionally budgeted as a reference point year in and year out now for the better part of three decades.

80
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:12,650
And it's time, Mr. President, that we take a look at our priorities, our spending in the way that we budget.

81
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,431
and change the way we do it, Mr. President.

82
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:40,922
I think that this is something that needs to be looked at and the traditional way of budgeting where we use last year as a reference point and build upon that without measuring whether or not we've attained the goals that we've set our sights upon, whether or not we're seeing that the money that we've invested is giving us the most bang for the buck and whether or not we're meeting the measurables that are defined the previous year, I think is very important, Mr. President.

83
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:50,320
And in zero-based budgeting, every year you have to show that your expenses were justified, that you've made an impact, and that your prioritizations remained in line.

84
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:53,321
So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

85
00:07:54,041 --> 00:08:06,985
We're gonna be facing very uncertain fiscal times, and I, as one member of this board, do not feel comfortable relying on more than 80% of our reserves, using more than 80% of our reserves to balance next year's fiscal budget.

86
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,406
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues for support.

87
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:11,904
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

88
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,524
Councilor Falco.

89
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,145
Thank you, Mr. President.

90
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,006
And I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

91
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:18,728
It's a resolution that I definitely support.

92
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,811
And I think, you know, it's not too early to think about budget.

93
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:27,393
We need to be talking about budget and the sooner the better.

94
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:34,157
You know, we received our Q2 budget update, let's see, a few weeks ago and Councilor Knight's right.

95
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:38,520
The basically a forecasting, I think a five to $8 million structural deficit.

96
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,642
Now more than ever, we need to be working with the administration.

97
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:49,987
The administration should be working with us to let us know where the city stands with regard to the budget.

98
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,429
The quarterly updates are good.

99
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:57,572
I mean, we get to take a look at the data or some of the data and we get to know kind of where we're going.

100
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:58,733
It's a little bit of a roadmap.

101
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:04,943
but we really need transparency from the administration now with regard to the budget.

102
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:10,672
And we need to have up-to-date information as soon as possible.

103
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,102
No, the budget is not only a fiduciary responsibility.

104
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:17,902
It's good government.

105
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:20,043
We need to make sure that we're on top of this.

106
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,044
We're coming into a really, really tough budget year.

107
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:23,665
We all know it.

108
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,746
And we need to have pre-budget meetings.

109
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,687
It's something that everyone on this council supports.

110
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:33,348
The administration was going to work with us last year on this.

111
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:35,429
We need to make sure we're working on this.

112
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:36,569
I know COVID happened.

113
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,970
We need to make sure we're working on this now.

114
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:40,211
If you take a look,

115
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:46,220
And I believe the request was, let's just meet with the major departments.

116
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,083
Let's meet with the DPW, the police department, the fire department, just to see what is the budget going to look like.

117
00:09:53,723 --> 00:10:04,908
If you take a look at last year's budget, which I believe was about $185 million, 36 million was a DPW, 14 million, the police department, 14 million, the fire department.

118
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:08,630
That takes you to about $64 million, I believe about 35% of the budget.

119
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,524
We're only asking to meet with four departments.

120
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,246
I don't think that's too much to ask for.

121
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:26,432
And if you throw in the school department, which I think is really important to meet with a finance person from on the school side, then you're probably talking about 68% of the budget, but we're only asking for four departments.

122
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,988
You know, the pre-budget meetings are really important.

123
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,269
To me, I think they need to happen.

124
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:43,834
So President Kavya, I'd like to ask you, have you received any update from the administration as to pre-budget hearings or pre-budget meetings with the department heads?

125
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,195
Is there any type of timeline on that?

126
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:55,359
Councilor Fevella, I have reached out to, I met in person with the chief of staff and I requested the meetings of the major departments in the school department.

127
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,567
And I've gotten no response as of yet.

128
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,527
I will reach out again.

129
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:06,150
I said that we'd like to do that if we can get it done in March.

130
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:11,634
But again, the administration has not given me any response to that.

131
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:12,795
But I will ask again.

132
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:16,897
And but I said, you know, we don't need to do the whole thing.

133
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,500
And the response was, you know, they hadn't even started their budget meeting with them.

134
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,780
at this point, sir.

135
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,441
And I thank you for reaching out on behalf of the council.

136
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,602
I appreciate the attempt.

137
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:37,544
I find it hard to believe that they haven't, and I'm not saying I don't believe you, but I have a hard time thinking that the administration hasn't talked budget yet and here we are in March.

138
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:43,145
I mean, the budget hearings, when you think about it, they're probably going to be sometime maybe early June.

139
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:48,766
So I would think they need to be talking about budget now, and we need to be part of that conversation.

140
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:56,929
If you take a look at the school side, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Locke, you on the school committee, you remember this, we had pre-budget hearings.

141
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:00,050
We met with the department heads in February, March, April.

142
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,331
By the time you got to the budget, there were no surprises.

143
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,798
We need to make sure that's happening on the city side as well.

144
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,499
So thank you for bringing this forward.

145
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,779
I support this resolution.

146
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:16,260
I second the resolution and I would hope that the administration will work with us.

147
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,340
I will reach out again tomorrow.

148
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,701
I did do that a couple of weeks ago and I've had no response.

149
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:22,221
Thank you.

150
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,402
I appreciate you for doing that.

151
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:29,603
And like I said, this is really important and we need to make sure we're on top of it.

152
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:30,043
Thank you.

153
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,727
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my colleague, Vice President Knight, for putting this resolution forward.

154
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:49,352
I think it would be interesting and helpful to look at a zero-based budget, but I do have some concerns about so drastically moving from the existing process to the zero-based process.

155
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,933
I would like to see maybe both.

156
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:55,875
I know that's a lot of work, but I think it would be helpful to see

157
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:02,336
but what the administration is proposing based on the prior year, and then what a zero-based budget look like, and then we can make an informed decision.

158
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:03,877
So that is just my preference.

159
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:12,645
If we're talking about just looking at a zero-based budget, I will probably vote against this resolution, but again, I appreciate it being brought forward by Vice President Knight.

160
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,067
Thank you, Councilor Baez.

161
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:15,888
Councilor Scarpelli.

162
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:21,072
Thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

163
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:24,035
What we're hearing tonight is

164
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,881
that we need to see some movement.

165
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:28,922
We need to see some action as we go on.

166
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:35,265
We heard it from the chief of staff a few weeks ago, looking at a five to $8 million budget deficit.

167
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:46,970
We heard it from the mayor, if you watched her interview on public access with the transcript that we're looking at dire times with five to $8 million deficit.

168
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,873
And something I would like to recommend to the council, it might,

169
00:13:54,458 --> 00:14:01,162
behoove us that we, as a council, look and put in place what neighboring communities do.

170
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:22,955
I know neighboring communities, their auditing, finance, budget, and taxation, or their budget and finance subcommittees meet on a biweekly basis to go over with the city finance director, department heads that are called on when needed,

171
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:38,562
What those organizations do in neighboring communities is they eliminate the process that we're doing right now and continually asking for the administration to put a budget together.

172
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:48,164
So what I would recommend, and I'd like to see this put forth and I'll leave it up to the president, make this as a motion,

173
00:14:49,011 --> 00:15:07,124
is really looking at the subcommittee of auditing, finance, budgeting, and taxation to try to meet in bi-weekly meetings and look at budget concerns with the finance director, the city administration, and then bringing in those departments that we just requested.

174
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:18,532
Unfortunately, we heard it for years here, whether it be school committee and getting the budget Friday before Father's Day, and we have to vote on it on Monday,

175
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:25,974
or on this council so far is receiving that budget pretty late.

176
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:46,331
I know that unfortunately Mayor Lungo Kern and her administration had a tough year last year with the pandemic and I sat next to her for years and we all had the same concerns that we get the budget issue, we get the budgets too late and it's difficult to really

177
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,791
put together a plan or understand the plan.

178
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:52,492
So I agree with Councilor Falco.

179
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:58,075
I believe the mayor said in the meeting that it was the school department had 52% of the budget last year.

180
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:11,161
I might be wrong, but if between the school, like Councilor Falco said, the school department, DPW, police and fire, we're looking at the majority of our budget here in the community.

181
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:16,684
And like everybody said, this is gonna be a scary time coming up

182
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,718
you know, we're going to have to try to figure this out.

183
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:27,084
And I'd rather have more information ahead of time, instead of waiting for the last minute and then being told we have to do something.

184
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:33,449
So, because I tell you what, if I have that decision to make at this year's budget, I don't know if I'd support it.

185
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,611
So thank you, Mr. President.

186
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,333
And thank you, Mr. Vice President.

187
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:45,859
Oh yeah, if we can, if we can request the chairperson of the auditing finance budget and taxation subcommittee,

188
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:48,634
to possibly look into setting up some meetings.

189
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:54,917
I hate to put the work on that chairperson, but is it you now?

190
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,118
Oh, I don't think so.

191
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:58,899
I don't have the list in front of me, sorry.

192
00:16:58,939 --> 00:16:59,899
It's Councilor Marks.

193
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,360
Oh, good, so you're really good with this.

194
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,221
So you're a pro at this, so.

195
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:06,222
Okay.

196
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:09,024
If I can, I- Just point of information, Mr. President.

197
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,964
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

198
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:14,006
I appreciate Councilor Scott Kelly's intent,

199
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:29,263
You yourself, Mr. President, just stated to us that you tried on several attempts to have a meeting with the administration to discuss the budget, and they refused to get back to you.

200
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:35,425
I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna be able to do on a subcommittee trying to pose the same question.

201
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:41,006
So I appreciate the intent, but I'm not sure how effective that'll be.

202
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,067
Like I said, I will reach out tomorrow again

203
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:50,797
to see if their stance has changed on letting us have the... Why don't I just retract that until next week to see if it gets the message back.

204
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:51,818
I will do that tomorrow.

205
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,459
Thank you.

206
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:54,780
All right.

207
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,780
Okay, any further discussion?

208
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,703
Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

209
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:02,605
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

210
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,186
Councilor Behrs.

211
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:04,986
No.

212
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:10,590
Councilor Falco.

213
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,810
Yes.

214
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:14,676
Vice President Knight.

215
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:15,597
Yes.

216
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:19,738
Councilor Marks.

217
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:20,258
Yes.

218
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:24,280
Councilor Morrell.

219
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:24,940
Yes.

220
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,381
Councilor Scripp-Hilley.

221
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:29,742
Yes.

222
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:32,863
President Ker-Viello.

223
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:33,423
Yes.

224
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:36,484
Motion passes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

225
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:42,166
21800 offered by Vice President Knight.

226
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:53,977
being so resolved that the Memphis City Council requests the administration provide a presentation of C-Click Fixed Data each quarter following the rollout of the new program.

227
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:54,998
Vice President Knight.

228
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,059
Mr. President, thank you very much.

229
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:04,963
We had a great presentation last week from the administration relative to their vision for a C-Click Fixed Program here in the community, something I'm very excited about.

230
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:12,567
I think it's about time that we started using data to drive our decision-making when it comes to delivering services here in this community.

231
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:23,642
And when you look at what this council's done over the past term, in terms of getting data and getting information, it's necessary for us to make good decisions.

232
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:29,766
You know, we've moved to require that the administration provides us with monthly warrant articles, so we know where money's being spent.

233
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:35,931
We're requiring the administration to present before us quarterly updates on the financials, so we know what fiscal condition we're in.

234
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:41,655
And quarterly updates on C-Click fixed data, I think, Mr. President, goes hand in hand with those two items.

235
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:48,847
what exactly it is, the types and levels of service that the people out there in the community are seeking right now.

236
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:52,709
It also highlights what we're good at and what we're bad at, Mr. President.

237
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:59,953
Now, if we were a multi-million dollar for profit corporation, I'd say that our goal is to make profits, but we're not.

238
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:03,115
Our goal as a government entity is to deliver services.

239
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:08,037
And I think it's safe to say the city of Medford is not great at delivering services.

240
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,659
We lag behind our neighboring communities when it comes to that.

241
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:17,438
I think that putting our money where our mouth is is important.

242
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:22,662
In order for us to do that, we need the appropriate data and information before us to make well-informed decisions.

243
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:34,049
And I think that quarterly updates, quarterly data reports from C-Click Fix will allow us the opportunity to have more information in front of us when it comes down to making those difficult financial decisions.

244
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,650
So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

245
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:42,494
It falls in line with the practice of open and transparent checkbook that we've supported all term long.

246
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:44,305
and I'd ask my council colleagues to support.

247
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:46,606
Councilor Scarpelli.

248
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,826
Thank you, Mr. President.

249
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:49,707
And thank you for Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

250
00:20:49,727 --> 00:21:06,412
If we can, if we can amend this paper to ask the administration if they've met with the leadership team to see quick fix of implementing the forgiveness program, or maybe if one of my colleagues can help me, what was the program that we talked about?

251
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:09,593
I didn't bring my notes with me.

252
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:21,971
to work with constituents that have a very big parking, right?

253
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,653
It was supposed to meet amnesty, correct, right?

254
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:27,313
It was the amnesty.

255
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,794
That's what, thank you, Council Member Mock.

256
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:38,378
So if we could just ask if they've spoken with CQX about the amnesty, implementing the amnesty program to possibly,

257
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:45,547
recover some of that $500,000 that is still outstanding.

258
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:46,487
Thank you.

259
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:47,708
Thank you.

260
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:48,368
Councilor Belco.

261
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,909
Thank you, President Cabrillo.

262
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,809
And thank you Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

263
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,110
It's something I truly support.

264
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:01,874
I think, especially when it comes to budget, it's good to see data and good to see what's coming in with regard to tickets and how they're being, you know, how they're being resolved.

265
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:10,117
The only thing I would ask if I may, through the chair to Councilor Knight, is it okay if we stagger these so we would get a report

266
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:17,960
at the end of May for like early June, just so we have like data for us going into the budget, would you be amenable to that?

267
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:23,405
I as one member of this body could care less as long as we get it.

268
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:33,736
I think the person that we really need to ask that question to sits across the hall as to when they're willing, able and ready to provide us with this information, some of which we fight tooth and nail to receive.

269
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:39,630
And I understand because it'd be nice to get something.

270
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:49,713
I just would like to see, if we're looking at budget meetings in June, that means that we probably, the latest report we probably have is something that had much data.

271
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:54,215
And that gives us two months of data that we're not looking at.

272
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:59,236
So that's why I'd like to get, I think from a budget perspective, we're looking at the budget.

273
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:03,878
It'd be nice to see something that as of like May month end in June, so we can kind of,

274
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,565
make more sense of the numbers in the budget.

275
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:18,052
So that would be a suggestion that I would like to see or an amendment or a B paper, whatever you prefer, to have, you know, May data going into the budget.

276
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:26,697
Mr. President, I've moved to amend the paper to insert the following language, on a schedule sufficient to councilor Falco's liking.

277
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:28,638
I like it.

278
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,278
Councilor Scarpelli.

279
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:30,699
Yes.

280
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:31,439
Councilor Scarpelli,

281
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:40,916
Your amendment for the amnesty was not part of our C-Click Fix program.

282
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:41,916
Oh, please forgive me.

283
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,457
I had a brain freeze.

284
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:45,919
That was part of the- That was part of the Republican- I'll bring it up later.

285
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:47,921
Thank you, I apologize.

286
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:49,602
That is withdrawn, I apologize.

287
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:53,625
On a motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

288
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:56,867
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

289
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,950
As amended by Councilor Falco, to his liking.

290
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:05,239
We're actually using council members, correct?

291
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:05,659
Yes.

292
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:15,705
So if we get, so if we could have like data, you know, so if March could be like a second quarter cutoff.

293
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,647
We can get a monthly too.

294
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,949
I think it's a click of a button from the way they made it sound.

295
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,770
It was going to be very easy reporting techniques.

296
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,912
So we get the Warren articles monthly.

297
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:27,013
I don't see why we couldn't get this report monthly as well.

298
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,436
Who's the second?

299
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,437
Councilor Falco is the second.

300
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,218
As amended by Councilor Falco.

301
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:41,060
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

302
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,781
Councilor Paris.

303
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:43,521
Yes.

304
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:46,323
Councilor Falco.

305
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:46,883
Yes.

306
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:48,163
Vice President Nights.

307
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:48,744
Yes.

308
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:49,884
Councilor Marks.

309
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:50,885
Yes.

310
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:51,925
Councilor Morrell.

311
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:52,626
Yes.

312
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:54,547
Councilor Scarpelli.

313
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:54,987
Yes.

314
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:55,867
President Kerrio.

315
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:57,748
Yes, I'm in the affirmative motion passes. 21081.

316
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:11,224
Offered by Vice President Knight and President Caraviello, we have resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Herbie Wells on his recent passing.

317
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:11,905
Vice President Knight.

318
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:15,807
Thank you, Vice President.

319
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:22,371
Many of us remember Mr. Wells, a longtime football coach.

320
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:28,475
For me personally, the Wells family, they were an extension of the Caraviello family.

321
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:29,956
Very close with my family.

322
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,861
And so I knew him a little different than anyone else here, but good family.

323
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:40,786
Again, always took care of the kids on the football team, good community man.

324
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:51,673
To the younger members who don't remember, in the early 70s and late 60s, when the Bruins were the Big Bad Bruins, Mr. Wells worked the door at the Boston Garden.

325
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:55,255
And he was very generous to us.

326
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:57,497
We would go to the Boston Garden,

327
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:01,916
give us the nod and then he'd let us go to the gate and watch the game.

328
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:06,039
So again, he was, all the kids, everybody that went there.

329
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:12,703
And I better say, Herbie was a real good guy and I wish the best to his wife, Patty, on his passing.

330
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:14,104
Vice President Knight.

331
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,806
Mr. President, thank you very much.

332
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:21,270
I, too, go way back with the Wells family, Peter and Mary.

333
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,151
Peter is Herbie's brother and I

334
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:25,727
We've been close friends for a long time.

335
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:29,468
His niece and nephew, Brian and Julie, and I are very close as well growing up.

336
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:36,909
And I had the pleasure and luck of having Mr. Wells as my sixth grade teacher at Brooks Arms Elementary School, Mr. President.

337
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,810
And I'll just tell you what a gentleman he was, a great teacher, great person.

338
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,710
He was someone that was willing to pull you aside and teach you the values of life.

339
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:47,411
Someone that wasn't just a classroom teacher, but went a little bit above and beyond.

340
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:52,732
Someone that, you know, was really a mentor and someone that could help out someone that was on the wrong path.

341
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:56,164
So with that being said, Mr. President, he'll certainly be missed.

342
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:02,865
You know, one thing I think that everybody who ever worked with Mr. Wells would say is that he was a hard worker.

343
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:09,726
I think when he retired, he might have had, what, one or two days absent in his whole career as a teacher in the public schools.

344
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:10,627
Never missed a day of school.

345
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,207
Never missed a day of school.

346
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,047
He came in every day and he did it because it was for the kids.

347
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:16,228
And he was just a great person.

348
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:21,669
He died very unexpectedly in his golden years down in Florida, Mr. President, while he was enjoying his retirement.

349
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:22,804
as a snowbird.

350
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:27,613
So that being said, I support the resolution and your commentary as well.

351
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:32,160
Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for my colleagues for bringing this forward.

352
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:34,685
Again, another legend.

353
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:37,763
off to heaven.

354
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:49,332
So I think that Mr. Wells, I remember substitute teaching and Mr. Wells often being the person that puts his arm around you as a young teacher and saying, okay, this is what to watch for.

355
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:50,973
This is what to do and what not to do.

356
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:54,396
And I was fortunate also to know him.

357
00:27:54,976 --> 00:27:58,379
His son, Scott and I were classmates in 87.

358
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,201
Scott left us way too early.

359
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:06,065
And I know that was a painful ordeal for the Wells family.

360
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:14,439
Um, it's, we, we're definitely going to miss Mr. Walls in our community and we get send our deepest sympathies to the family.

361
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,960
So thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,220
Thank you.

363
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,060
Councilor Marks.

364
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:20,681
Thank you, Mr. President.

365
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,561
I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

366
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:26,442
Uh, Mr. Walls really cared about the students he taught.

367
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:32,463
Uh, he was strict, but, uh, he cared and that showed Mr. President and the way he carried himself.

368
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:34,956
and his community involvement.

369
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:47,379
He was involved in a lot of different activities, as you heard from my council colleagues, and he was never looking for a thank you or anything other than he just wanted to give back, and indeed he did so.

370
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,600
He was a true family man, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

371
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,440
Thank you.

372
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,881
On the motion by Vice President and President Cabrera, seconded by Councilor Mox.

373
00:28:58,842 --> 00:28:59,842
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

374
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:05,449
also bears.

375
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,270
Yes.

376
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:08,191
Also Falco.

377
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:09,272
Yes.

378
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:10,433
Vice President night.

379
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:12,294
Also marks.

380
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:14,196
Also morale.

381
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:14,816
Yes.

382
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:16,577
Also Scott Kelly.

383
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:17,058
Yes.

384
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:17,698
Yes, sir.

385
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,980
Motion passes please stand for a moment

386
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:54,692
21082 offered by Councilor Scott Pelli, be it resolved that the City Environment Energy Director look into solar carports at city facilities to help with energy costs and possible revenue gaining venture.

387
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:56,993
Councilor Scott Pelli.

388
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:58,094
Thank you, Mr. President.

389
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:07,700
I bring this forward because as we just, a few resolutions ago, we talked about how difficult times

390
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:16,252
and how oblique times are looking financially and trying to recover funding anywhere we can in our community.

391
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:32,096
I was lucky enough to traverse a few communities that have solar powered carports in their athletic facilities and their open parking lots.

392
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,518
Talking to facility managers and a few communities, the discussion

393
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:57,850
has been the lack that really haven't lost any parking spots, but at the same time, gaining enough electricity and power to run their hockey rinks, some of their high schools, and then having a plan in place that would also bring back some funding back to their communities.

394
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:03,654
So I know that our energy environment director has been busy.

395
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:05,675
I think this might be the first

396
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,774
first resolution that we've sent over for a long time.

397
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:17,576
We haven't heard much from that department, but I think it's something that we really need to inquire about.

398
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:24,678
I mean, I know that there are private deals going around with different solar companies for residents.

399
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:36,142
And I'm sure with the competition that's out there right now, looking at different solar carport farms at some of our facilities,

400
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:43,035
to recover some funding, I think is a prudent effort.

401
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:51,098
So I welcome the director to put a plan together and hopefully we can get some news back.

402
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:51,878
Thank you.

403
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:54,099
Councilor Morocco.

404
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,600
Thank you, Mr. President.

405
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,920
I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

406
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,881
I think this is a great idea to look into.

407
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:02,662
To his point, this makes a lot of financial sense.

408
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:12,946
It also makes a lot of sense as far as making efficient use of space and really kind of leveraging that sort of dead space that a lot of parking lots have, especially when they're not in use.

409
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:19,489
And I think it's also a great idea because it's a physical representation to a commitment to sustainability that this city continues to make.

410
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,311
And that's something that's very important in this space.

411
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,112
So I look forward to supporting this and hope something can come out of it.

412
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:25,413
Thank you.

413
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:28,735
On the motion by Councilor Scott Peltier, excuse me, Vice President Knight.

414
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:30,588
Mr. President, thank you very much.

415
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:37,191
I'm just thinking about this, and as Councilor Scott Pelley is making his presentation, I'm picturing in my head, you know, where this would work.

416
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:51,118
And, you know, having worked at La Conte Skating Rink for a while, and, you know, having been able to whip the Zamboni around the ice down there a little bit back in my heyday, one of the things that always amazed me was how much it costs to operate these facilities.

417
00:32:51,158 --> 00:32:54,860
You know, the electrical bill at La Conte Rink is like $30,000 a month.

418
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:57,762
Imagine if we were able to put these solar carports in,

419
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,924
between La Conte and Homel and generate enough electricity to pay the electric bill at La Conte and for the lights at Homel.

420
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:04,704
It's a win-win.

421
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:06,085
It's a win-win, Mr. President.

422
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:11,349
So, you know, I thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this on, for putting this on, and I'm put in support of it wholeheartedly this evening.

423
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:12,490
Thank you.

424
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,552
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

425
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:18,013
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

426
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:21,536
Councilor Behrs.

427
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:22,336
Yes.

428
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:24,218
Councilor Fevella.

429
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:24,558
Yes.

430
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:25,378
Vice Mayor.

431
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:26,219
Yes.

432
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:27,300
Councilor Marks.

433
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,740
Yes.

434
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:29,037
Councilor Morrell?

435
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:29,658
Yes.

436
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:31,479
Councilor Kelly?

437
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:31,739
Yes.

438
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,819
Senator Fevella?

439
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,381
Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

440
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:39,983
21-083 offered by Council of Mayors.

441
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:57,813
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, that the city administration plan an update on the status of 8086 Nail Street, which had a severe fire last year and was left open to the elements for several months, and how the administration plans to address health and safety code enforcement

442
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:02,814
to ensure safety for any new construction in our neighboring residential building.

443
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:14,121
Be it further resolved that this item reappear on the city council agenda in two weeks for an update in discussion or further action that can be taken by the council to address this issue.

444
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:26,908
Councilor Baez, before I think I had the opportunity to speak with building commissioner Moki today, and this is private property and is not germane to the city council.

445
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:39,016
According to him, the building is closed to their satisfaction, and the person who owns the property has not filed for any building permits or any new construction.

446
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:47,280
So unfortunately at this time, after my conversation with the building commissioner, I am going to rule this out of order, Councilor Bairds.

447
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,102
Because it's a private property, and we have no jurisdiction on that.

448
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:54,924
And there is no building permit that has been filed.

449
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:57,305
OK.

450
00:34:58,876 --> 00:34:59,216
Thank you.

451
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:07,758
If you want, if you'd like to call the building commissioner in the morning, he'll give you a same synopsis he just gave me.

452
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:13,999
Yeah, I've spoken with the building commissioner and this is mostly their residents in the area who are concerned about the status of the building.

453
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:18,080
Private property and we have no jurisdiction over private property.

454
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:18,980
Thank you.

455
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:27,222
21084 offered by Councilor Viz, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council that we request our state representative and state senator advocate

456
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:40,233
for a hold harmless provision for charter school reimbursements for fiscal year 2022 state budget to prevent a nearly $1 million loss in urgently needed state aid to Memphis public schools.

457
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:48,475
We have further resolved that we request our state delegations for a permanent solution that will stop draining over $8 million from our city budget for charter schools.

458
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:57,457
We have further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to Memphis legislative delegation as well as speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka.

459
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,910
Council this.

460
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,451
Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:02,933
As we heard last week in our financial update.

462
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:17,122
One of the major hits to the potential hits to the budget next year would be a significant loss in charter school funding from about 2 million that we received in this current fiscal year to less than 1 million next year.

463
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,464
This is kind of a two part resolution.

464
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:22,766
The first one is around this upcoming state budget.

465
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:32,269
asking our state delegation to advocate for a hold harmless provision, meaning that we wouldn't receive anything less than we received in the previous fiscal year.

466
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:41,592
And the second piece of this, you know, looking at the just looking at this budget, we're sending eight and a half million dollars every year to charter schools.

467
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,912
That's almost 5% of the whole city budget.

468
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:47,173
And I think it's important that our delegation advocate for us

469
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:52,848
to try to reduce the impact of that serious hit on our revenues every year.

470
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:55,389
So that is the intent of this resolution.

471
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,170
And I move approval.

472
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,391
Thank you, Vice President.

473
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:08,993
Mr. President, I can remember the charter school debate being raised when I worked on Beacon Hill with Senator Shannon, when they first came around.

474
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,714
And this has always been an ongoing

475
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,614
back and forth charter schools public schools yes charter schools and public schools, how come they're not funded.

476
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:22,857
The same way that public schools are funded then how come an assessment is levied upon the community, which participates.

477
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:26,060
I appreciate Council based measure and I move approval.

478
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:34,185
I think it's a great idea Mr President to reach out to our state delegation and let them know this is something that's really negatively impacting our budget, and the way that we operate.

479
00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:36,387
I don't think it's fair that you know.

480
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:42,073
We have to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, but the assessment continues to go down, down, down, down.

481
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,274
I'm sorry, the assessment continues to rise.

482
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:47,894
There has to be some sort of balance and some sort of permanent solution.

483
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:51,795
This has been a discussion and debate that's been going on for now, it's been about 20 years.

484
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:56,976
And our legislature still hasn't been able to solve the problem.

485
00:37:57,036 --> 00:38:01,657
So with that being said, a whole harmless provision is something that's necessary at this point in time, Mr. President, to support the measure.

486
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,138
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

487
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:08,873
to be able to bring this forward.

488
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:16,855
I think that as a former school committee member, that was my number one initiative is trying to battle this inequity.

489
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:26,858
And right off the bat, we saw the inequities where, and I think most people don't know what the reimbursement looks like.

490
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:34,520
And the easiest way I explain it to the common person is that to the money that's given to,

491
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:46,337
to the city public school student is $5,000, but the money that goes to each pupil in the charter school is $7,500.

492
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:55,043
And when they have money in reserve, they can actually use that money to improve their facilities.

493
00:38:55,943 --> 00:39:04,189
I think during the time we're on the school committee, the charter school in Malden built a multimillion dollar sports facility

494
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:06,563
when we were losing reading teachers.

495
00:39:07,223 --> 00:39:15,706
And I think that's where we have to realize the inequities, not only just in on the bank account, but also in the classroom.

496
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:20,728
And I know it goes hand in hand and I appreciate bringing this forward.

497
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:31,613
And I think that it's something we need to really push, especially in these dire times when we're looking at a deficit right off the bat because of this inequity.

498
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,313
So thank you.

499
00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:36,413
Thank you, Mr. President.

500
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:39,015
I want to thank Councilor Biaz for bringing this forward.

501
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:43,659
I agree wholeheartedly with everything that my colleagues have mentioned so far.

502
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,843
This is a problem that's been going on for years, unfortunately.

503
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:56,604
When I was in the school committee with Councilor Scarapelli, we were on the school committee for six years, and this is something that we battled with since day one.

504
00:39:56,804 --> 00:40:00,346
Every year, the charter school would have a ton of cash on hand.

505
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:01,647
They would literally have cash on hand.

506
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,188
They would pay for projects with cash.

507
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:09,751
Meanwhile, we would scrap trying to figure out how we're gonna pay for different departments.

508
00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:13,654
We would go with no department heads, no supplies.

509
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,915
I mean, this has to stop at some point.

510
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:18,452
and the state really needs to get involved.

511
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:23,793
And what they really need to do is sit down and come up with a permanent solution to this problem.

512
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:33,395
It's not fair that every year, you know, our local schools get hammered over the head because we don't have the funding.

513
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:40,817
We could always use more funding, yes, but this is a key component to the formula, to our funding here locally.

514
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:43,057
And, you know, to lose a million dollars, if not more,

515
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:47,654
And it happens year after year after year, it needs to be addressed.

516
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:51,777
Our state legislators need to do something about this.

517
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,698
This is just wrong.

518
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,819
And Councilor Biarzi, thank you for bringing this forward.

519
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,281
And I support 100% move approval.

520
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:00,822
Thank you.

521
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:03,063
Thank you, Councilor Falcone.

522
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,484
And again, I want to thank Council for bringing this forward.

523
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:10,667
Again, I don't know what the governor's thinking, knowing we're in a pretty tough time with the pandemic.

524
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:15,456
Oh, he can come in, hit us with a million dollars before we even get to our budget.

525
00:41:15,616 --> 00:41:19,017
So, again, I think, like, Council Bishop bring this forward.

526
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:22,039
And, and I will support this.

527
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:24,840
The motion by Councilors is seconded by Councilor Knight.

528
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,481
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

529
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,102
Councilors.

530
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:29,862
Yes.

531
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:31,723
Councilor.

532
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:32,123
Yes.

533
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,223
Vice President.

534
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:34,564
Councilor Marks.

535
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:36,125
Councilor Morrell.

536
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,521
Councilor Scarpelli?

537
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:38,942
Yes.

538
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:39,842
President Kerrio?

539
00:41:39,902 --> 00:41:43,245
Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

540
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:49,549
21085, offered by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Bares, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council express their support of H.C.

541
00:41:49,569 --> 00:42:01,477
1440, an act relative to a streaming entertainment operators use of Publix right of way in SD 834, an act relative digital entertainment on Publix right of way.

542
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:05,700
Be it further resolved that city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Memphis

543
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:12,154
legislative delegation, as well as House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka.

544
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:12,815
Councilor Morales.

545
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:14,456
Thank you, Mr. President.

546
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:22,400
So this was brought to the council's attention by someone very near and dear to us all, Mr. Gordon, who helps to make these meetings possible and accessible.

547
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,261
So these bills, it's the identical bill.

548
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:29,043
I know they, identical docket number, docket.

549
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:34,446
I know that these haven't been assigned a bill just yet, but I think it's something that needs to come with our support early.

550
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:35,327
Essentially,

551
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:42,929
These are seeking to assess fees for streaming services that rely on digital infrastructure that's at least partially in public rights away.

552
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:46,671
And then a portion of funds collected in this way would go to the Commonwealth General Fund.

553
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:53,654
And most importantly, to municipalities proportionally based on population and to community centers proportionally based on population.

554
00:42:54,294 --> 00:43:04,980
So this is really important at this time as more and more people cut the cord from cable and money to public education and government media gain through these agreements is really impacted as a result of those changes.

555
00:43:06,032 --> 00:43:13,914
So this is really a measure to encourage our local delegation to support these.

556
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:20,356
And I did get word that Christine Barber did sign on as a co-sponsor after I submitted this item.

557
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:34,100
And it's really just to make sure we have the funding from these systems in place to continue to support our diverse community, robust and diverse community media, and to really respond to the changing behaviors of both providers and subscribers.

558
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:42,592
Thank you, Mr President, and I want to thank Councilor Merrill for bringing this forward and signing on with her.

559
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:46,175
Um, you know, they come to us from Patrick Gordon and.

560
00:43:46,195 --> 00:44:00,766
This is really about, you know this issue of cord cutting right and peg access fees for a long time for our community access stations across the state have been coming through cable companies and cable subscriptions are going down.

561
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:02,547
So this is about assessing, um.

562
00:44:03,128 --> 00:44:11,332
that we're going to be able to continue to pay our fees on the streaming services that are replacing in some cases, cable subscriptions and making sure that we still have funding for community access.

563
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:22,618
I know that this, uh, legislation like this has passed in many states, and I also know that these bills are an initiative of many of our community access stations, including Medford Community media.

564
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:25,319
Um so I just think it's an important effort

565
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:34,023
content delivery.

566
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:35,304
Thank you, Mr. President.

567
00:44:36,265 --> 00:44:36,645
Thank you.

568
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:38,127
Thank you for the discussion.

569
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:43,872
All the motion by Councilors and Councilor Morales, seconded by Councilor Mox.

570
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:47,175
I'm sorry, Councilor Mox.

571
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:48,876
Thank you, Mr. President.

572
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:57,904
I just want to make it be known, Mr. President, that a lion's share of the Peg Access money does not go directly to Peg Access.

573
00:44:58,324 --> 00:45:00,006
It actually goes into the city coffers.

574
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:08,514
So 3% of the money that would be generated by this automatically goes into city coffers and 2% goes into peg access.

575
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:28,749
And that's something I think we have to look at as a council regarding a home rule petition that was filed some 30 years ago by this Memphis City Council, Mr. President, and put the money where rightfully belongs, which is community access, which is government, public and educational channels, Mr. President, in this community.

576
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:30,017
Thank you, council member.

577
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:33,059
It's on the motion by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Leik.

578
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:34,360
Mr. President, thank you.

579
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,681
You know, six of one doesn't the other.

580
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:40,483
I took an opportunity to read over the state legislation that was offered.

581
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:46,446
A couple of things, you know, it's the bill, the legislative session just started a month ago.

582
00:45:46,486 --> 00:45:47,166
The bill was just filed.

583
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:48,307
It doesn't even have a bill number yet.

584
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:52,009
Normally in my experience, I haven't worked in the legislature.

585
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,930
Nothing comes out the way it goes in.

586
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,272
So I don't know if the council wants to monitor the progress

587
00:45:59,126 --> 00:45:59,966
of the legislation.

588
00:45:59,986 --> 00:46:05,169
There's going to be assignment to a committee, testimony, so on and so forth, Mr. President.

589
00:46:05,749 --> 00:46:10,772
A letter like this is great, but if we really want to do something, why wouldn't we monitor it?

590
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:19,456
And then send letters when the time is right, when testimony is being solicited from the public, so on and so forth.

591
00:46:19,597 --> 00:46:26,320
I get a little wary of having the mentioned city council sign on to pieces of state legislation every other week.

592
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:43,120
With that being said, I have no problem supporting the paper this evening, but I think it's a little early in the game when we're looking at this, Mr. President, to have bills that don't even have bill numbers yet, docket numbers that haven't been introduced to a subcommittee yet in the state legislature for us to be jumping on.

593
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,281
We have a representative democracy.

594
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:48,962
We elect representatives in the state house to represent us.

595
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:54,685
Let's give them an opportunity to do that, give them a little bit of breathing room, maybe pick up the phone and call them, see if they'll sign on.

596
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,811
before taking such a public action.

597
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:05,056
But with that being said, Mr. President, this evening, based upon the paper that's before us, I really see it as a whole harmless provision if we support it or don't.

598
00:47:05,497 --> 00:47:09,019
I'm sure I'll support it this evening, but moving forward, it's something that I would be wary of.

599
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,080
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

600
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,943
On the motion by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Baird, seconded by Councilor Mark.

601
00:47:14,983 --> 00:47:16,043
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

602
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:17,684
Mr. President, just if I could.

603
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:20,146
Councilor Marks.

604
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:21,687
Councilor Lai brings up a great point.

605
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:23,288
If it hasn't been signed to a committee,

606
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:27,507
Where is the clerk going to forward this to?

607
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:34,690
One part of the resolution does say to the House Speaker and the Senate President, but if it's not assigned to a committee, where does it go?

608
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,252
Councilor Bass or Councilor Morocco?

609
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:43,434
Just in the resolution to our legislative delegation,

610
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:54,325
And I also had an opportunity to speak with Representative Garbaly and Representative Donato, who said that they hadn't heard about the bill, but after seeing this, that they would be interested in signing on.

611
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:57,547
And I'm also sure that Patrick will be sending us updates in the future.

612
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,507
He seems very on top of this.

613
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:02,128
Thank you.

614
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:04,869
So we send it to our state delegation?

615
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:05,229
Yes.

616
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,030
Okay.

617
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:12,311
Again, on the motion by Councilor Barreau, Councilor Beasley, seconded by Councilor Marks.

618
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:13,892
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

619
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:15,137
Councilor Behrs.

620
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:15,958
Yes.

621
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:17,700
Councilor Falco.

622
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,100
Yes.

623
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,161
Vice President Knight.

624
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:19,601
Yes.

625
00:48:20,182 --> 00:48:20,782
Councilor Marks.

626
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:21,283
Yes.

627
00:48:21,823 --> 00:48:22,463
Councilor Morrell.

628
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:23,104
Yes.

629
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:24,845
Councilor Scarpelli.

630
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:25,186
Yes.

631
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:26,086
President Kerrio.

632
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:27,828
Yes, 70 in the affirmative motion passes.

633
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:38,937
21086 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Anthony Boner on his recent passing.

634
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:40,118
Councilor Falco.

635
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:41,819
Thank you, Mr. President.

636
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:52,237
Recently, Anthony Bonner, a longtime Methodist resident, probably for about 40 years, lived in the Washington Street Park Street area.

637
00:48:52,778 --> 00:49:01,083
And a longtime resident, someone very dedicated, not only to the community, but also to outside of the community.

638
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:05,346
He was a member of the Shriners Club, or he was a Shriner, I should say.

639
00:49:05,386 --> 00:49:09,229
He was actually a member of the Fire Brigade Unit, the Aleppo Shriners.

640
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:12,011
He was a Mason, he was someone who loved his family.

641
00:49:12,907 --> 00:49:20,072
a very family oriented, had many kids and grandkids, and he will be missed.

642
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:27,638
So I just wanted to offer our condolences to the Bonner family and offer also offer my thoughts and prayers.

643
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:27,998
Thank you.

644
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:29,459
Thank you.

645
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:34,963
On the motion by Councilor Falco seconded by Vice President Knight.

646
00:49:35,424 --> 00:49:36,605
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

647
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:40,387
Councilor Beers.

648
00:49:40,908 --> 00:49:41,148
Yes.

649
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:42,896
Councilor Fevella.

650
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:43,357
Yes.

651
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:44,539
Vice President Knight.

652
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:44,940
Yes.

653
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:45,902
Councilor Marks.

654
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:46,543
Yes.

655
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:47,765
Councilor Morrell.

656
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:48,386
Yes.

657
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,350
Councilor Scarpelli.

658
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:50,791
Yes.

659
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:51,793
President Kerrio.

660
00:49:52,093 --> 00:49:52,314
Yes.

661
00:49:52,354 --> 00:49:53,035
Motion passes.

662
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:54,518
Please rise for a moment of silence.

663
00:50:13,454 --> 00:50:23,099
21-087 offered by Councilor Scott Pelli, be it resolved that the city administration prepare all the chambers for public participation purposes according to the Board of Health and CDC guidelines.

664
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,140
Councilor Scott Pelli.

665
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:25,961
Thank you, Mr. President.

666
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:35,027
About a month ago, we had the Director of the Board of Health, and as we talked about the budget season coming upon us,

667
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,733
We mentioned what we needed.

668
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:42,815
I know that we talked prior to that about putting a plan together to open the chambers.

669
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:45,676
Their answer was very simple, concise.

670
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:54,500
As long as it's following proper CDC guidelines and six feet apart and people wearing their masks, we can do what we want to do.

671
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,481
I believe that's what you said.

672
00:50:55,541 --> 00:51:02,404
So what we're seeing right now, we're hearing right now from the general public, we're coming down to a pretty

673
00:51:03,747 --> 00:51:05,889
it's people starting to get tired.

674
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:11,093
I don't want to loosen up on any dangerous situations.

675
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:19,921
I know that we have counselors and department heads that might have health issues that they need to protect themselves.

676
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:26,867
And I can respect that, but I think we have to have the option to have the people's forum open for the people.

677
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:30,730
We're asking our teachers now,

678
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,003
We're asking our teachers to come back to the classroom.

679
00:51:35,043 --> 00:51:43,706
We've heard some great news before I left for the meeting that President Biden wants to see all of our teachers vaccinated by at least the end of March.

680
00:51:44,486 --> 00:51:45,666
And that's a great step.

681
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:48,827
And we're moving in the right direction.

682
00:51:49,187 --> 00:52:00,571
And as long as we have the proper protocol in place, I can't see why we can't move forward to start inviting people and department heads

683
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,022
back into this chamber.

684
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:06,304
So again, my request is really to get the room ready.

685
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:16,591
If they need my assistance, I can come here with my tape measure and we could measure out six feet and put enough chairs for the people that are interested to be here in person.

686
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:23,555
And hopefully get back to the people's business.

687
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:26,957
I think we're very fortunate that we now have another form of

688
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:30,736
reaching our constituents and our community via Zoom.

689
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:33,096
And that's something we can continue doing.

690
00:52:33,136 --> 00:52:36,857
I know Patrick loves to make sure that happens.

691
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:50,979
But at the same time, as I've been saying since last budget season, there are people that want to come to this chamber and express their support or their issues to this council and this community.

692
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:56,140
And I think we owe them that respect as we're moving to a more

693
00:52:56,665 --> 00:53:00,568
positive in what hopes to be some sort of normalcy, Mr. President.

694
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:01,849
So thank you.

695
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:04,891
Thank you, Councilor Scott.

696
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:11,557
And I did have discussion with the administration on this, about opening the chambers up possibly for next week.

697
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:16,060
And we talked about making sure to open the doors.

698
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:23,646
And I volunteered the services of our messenger, Mr. Lepore, to sign people in as they came in the door.

699
00:53:24,046 --> 00:53:25,828
And he has graciously accepted that task.

700
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:32,428
So I wait for guidance from the administration moving forward.

701
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:33,028
Councilor Best.

702
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:35,769
Thank you, Mr. President.

703
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:42,191
And I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli understanding some of the differences of views on this.

704
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,532
And personally, I have a different view.

705
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:47,173
I won't be supporting this tonight.

706
00:53:47,273 --> 00:53:51,154
I understand where Councilor Scarpelli and my fellow councilors are coming from.

707
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:55,416
But there's a couple things, even over the past weekend,

708
00:53:56,004 --> 00:54:13,015
have made me, you know, pretty pretty seriously concerned about, you know, some of some of the rollbacks that are happening and I think in some ways this could be considered one, you know, the public health advice and the best practices since last spring has been that

709
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:22,254
know, if you can reasonably do something without in-person attendance, that you should do that because it protects the people who can't make that choice.

710
00:54:22,314 --> 00:54:26,058
It protects the essential workers, it protects the healthcare workers, it protects the teachers.

711
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:29,821
So, you know, that is one piece of this for me.

712
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:40,630
The second piece was the CDC director over the weekend, you know, kind of responding to some of the rollbacks and the increase in some in-person limits and saying, you know, really, this is a dangerous time if we

713
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:50,648
If we wait a couple more months and we have the vaccine rollout really in full progress, it'll be much safer to look at items like this and like that at that point.

714
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,209
And, you know, President Biden said the same thing.

715
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:59,710
And then the third piece is I do wonder if we will be able to fully, you know, enforce the CDC guidelines.

716
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:04,512
One of them being, you know, making sure that people keep their masks on when they're talking.

717
00:55:04,532 --> 00:55:08,153
And I know that was an issue with a member of the public, you know, a few weeks ago.

718
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:09,893
So that's just where I come from on this.

719
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:11,317
I'm going to be voting no.

720
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:13,998
I appreciate how Councilor Scarpelli presented it.

721
00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:15,939
And that's my position.

722
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:16,519
Thank you.

723
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:18,700
Thank you.

724
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,781
Fire Chow, I think you had your hand up.

725
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:23,902
Mr. President, if I could.

726
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:25,662
Councilor Morrell, I'm sorry.

727
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:26,883
Thank you, Mr. President.

728
00:55:27,163 --> 00:55:27,743
Yeah, I agree.

729
00:55:27,843 --> 00:55:35,545
I really, I understand where Councilor Scarpelli is coming from, and I really appreciate the way and the consideration with which you introduced this.

730
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:40,067
So I'm just trying, I am also going to be voting against this this evening, but I just want to explain where I'm coming from.

731
00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:43,237
I do still have some concerns about duration.

732
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:47,419
Ideally, hopefully we're all vaccinated by budget season.

733
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:53,163
This is not something we even have to worry about, but we do have some exponentially long budget meetings.

734
00:55:53,223 --> 00:56:00,567
I think we had a 10 hour meeting last year and, and duration of exposure really comes into effect with the virus and aerosols.

735
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:02,809
And again, just concern over the variant.

736
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:04,890
So I very much feel like we're almost there.

737
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:08,592
This just feels a little bit premature to me, so I will be voting against it.

738
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:14,753
But again, I very much appreciate the way it was introduced and your concern and respect for other people's positions.

739
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:16,153
Councilor Scarpelli, thank you.

740
00:56:16,993 --> 00:56:17,554
Councilor Marks.

741
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:19,194
Thank you, Mr. President.

742
00:56:19,214 --> 00:56:22,895
I just wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

743
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:26,215
This is a very timely resolution.

744
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:33,657
We're gonna be faced with probably one of the most difficult budgets over the last many years.

745
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:46,182
And I think it's important, Mr. President, that we allow people in this community to voice their concerns, whatever form they decide.

746
00:56:46,963 --> 00:56:52,366
And coming in public is one, Mr. President, way of doing such.

747
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:55,108
And I don't want to limit someone's ability.

748
00:56:55,628 --> 00:57:03,793
If they feel safe, Mr. President, and if the protocols are followed, that they have the ability to come up and speak.

749
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:05,389
as well, Mr. President.

750
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:19,977
I find it very difficult that you can open restaurants now and you could be seated six feet from someone and be eating a meal, but you can't speak without a mask on.

751
00:57:21,098 --> 00:57:23,359
It's very difficult to eat without a mask on.

752
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,702
So I'm not quite sure the mixed messages that are being sent.

753
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:32,645
All I can tell you is that since we've been on this council,

754
00:57:33,278 --> 00:57:43,947
and open this council up for business that we've run this meeting, Mr. President, adhering to all the CDC guidelines and the Method Board of Health guidelines.

755
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:49,811
And I think we've done such in a safe manner and I am very proud of what we've done.

756
00:57:50,872 --> 00:57:55,756
So we do have the ability to accommodate and that is not going away.

757
00:57:56,177 --> 00:58:02,682
So I guess as long as we have that ability, Mr. President, we can open up and start doing business

758
00:58:03,238 --> 00:58:04,999
as usual in a safe manner.

759
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,420
And I wanna thank my colleague for bringing this up.

760
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,380
Thank you.

761
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,181
Mr. Castaneda, I think you had your hand up.

762
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,523
Mr. Castaneda?

763
00:58:19,024 --> 00:58:19,184
No.

764
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:20,905
Okay.

765
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:22,705
Vice President Knight.

766
00:58:23,285 --> 00:58:32,189
Yes, it's always been my understanding that local elected bodies were exempt from the governor's executive order and that we were always

767
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:39,445
warranted the ability to meet in person, provided that we work within the guidelines, number one.

768
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:52,874
Number two, I do think it's important to point out that since this body has begun to meet in person, we've been very productive, more so than we were when we were working in a telecommuting fashion.

769
00:58:52,974 --> 00:58:59,199
So I thank Councilor Scapelli for putting a resolution on it.

770
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:02,621
Being a frontline worker, Mr. President, I welcome anybody

771
00:59:03,054 --> 00:59:03,956
who wants to come in here.

772
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:05,699
I'm here to do the people's business.

773
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,062
I'm here for the people, not for the cause.

774
00:59:07,823 --> 00:59:09,907
So that means that we have to be here.

775
00:59:09,928 --> 00:59:10,529
We have to be here.

776
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:11,450
So I have no problem with that.

777
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:13,014
And I thank Councillor Scott Feller for bringing it up.

778
00:59:13,555 --> 00:59:13,835
Thank you.

779
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:16,051
Councilor Falcone.

780
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,011
Thank you, Mr. President.

781
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:19,472
I also want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward.

782
00:59:20,612 --> 00:59:23,133
I think it's good to have that option available.

783
00:59:23,873 --> 00:59:35,236
And I think if we follow the Board of Health and the CDC guidelines, and if I know Mary Ann O'Connor, she's going to want to make it as safe as possible, it should be an option.

784
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:37,877
Not everybody has to take it, but it should be an option.

785
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:43,119
But I just want to say thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing that forward.

786
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:43,779
Thank you.

787
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:44,039
Thank you.

788
00:59:45,506 --> 00:59:53,069
Again, I have spoken to the administration about this, and I asked them if we could have the doors open possibly by next week.

789
00:59:53,649 --> 00:59:59,392
And again, if you come into the room here, I mean, the administration meets in this room on a daily basis.

790
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:04,434
There's a big long table that seats 10, and everybody is socially distanced with a TV.

791
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,275
I have attended meetings with the administration at that table.

792
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:11,858
and everyone keeps their mask on, and there hasn't been a problem.

793
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:17,059
So on the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Mark, please call the roll.

794
01:00:17,499 --> 01:00:18,059
Mr. President.

795
01:00:19,399 --> 01:00:19,980
Councilor Best.

796
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:26,601
We did have Mr. Castaneda did get on, and I think I saw Kelly Catala's hand as well.

797
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:29,742
Okay, Mr. Castaneda, are you there?

798
01:00:34,223 --> 01:00:35,623
Yes, Councilor President.

799
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:37,591
Can you hear me?

800
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:39,412
Give an address of the record, please.

801
01:00:40,013 --> 01:00:42,795
Andrew Castanetti, East Medford, Massachusetts.

802
01:00:43,715 --> 01:00:45,076
Thank you, Council President.

803
01:00:45,756 --> 01:00:50,899
And again, I would also like to thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this forward.

804
01:00:51,660 --> 01:01:03,427
I believe it's long overdue to come out of our old hide-in basements and get back to the forum to take care of the city's business, especially as Councilor Marks had

805
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:14,690
Brooke stole my words saying that with $180 million plus budget, it's time to, uh, at least be able to fix our, our damn potholes.

806
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:16,112
That's all I have to say.

807
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:16,652
Thank you.

808
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:18,094
Thank you.

809
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,458
Uh, Kelly Cotello name and address of the record, please.

810
01:01:23,843 --> 01:01:25,885
Kelly Catalo 46 Otis Street.

811
01:01:26,426 --> 01:01:32,753
Mr. Caravaglia is a member of the public, I would like the option to be able to come into the council chambers.

812
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:39,660
If I can go into Wegmans with a mask and I can spend a couple of hours in there I think it's time that City Hall has been opened up

813
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,240
to the residents of the city.

814
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,681
If there's some people that don't feel safe being there, they don't have to.

815
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:50,763
It's great that we always have this option of Zoom, but I think a lot of people like being in the room.

816
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:54,524
They like having that amount of interaction.

817
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,484
So I would ask you that at least you give us the option.

818
01:01:58,185 --> 01:01:59,585
Thank you.

819
01:02:00,805 --> 01:02:07,707
And again, on the motion by Councilor Scott Pele, seconded by Councilor Mox, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:12,941

01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:36,879
Councilor Scarpelli.

963
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:37,559
Yes.

964
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,220
Yes.

965
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,360
Semi in the permanent.

966
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:41,261
Motion passes.

967
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:43,942
While we're on the suspension, we have one more paper here.

968
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:51,307
Paper 21089 offered by Councilor Scott Belly.

969
01:07:51,767 --> 01:08:00,789
It resolved that the city council get notifications from other source in the city administration dealing with the pipeline project schedule and went on and went to street neighborhood.

970
01:08:01,149 --> 01:08:02,310
Also Scott Belly.

971
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,450
Thank you, Mr. President.

972
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:10,092
I know prior to COVID this project was discussed and a plan was in place

973
01:08:10,864 --> 01:08:19,625
to meet with the members of that neighborhood and the community to discuss their project and timeline.

974
01:08:20,426 --> 01:08:22,206
And here we are.

975
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:24,866
We're now moving into March, April.

976
01:08:24,906 --> 01:08:26,307
We're going to see nicer weather.

977
01:08:26,947 --> 01:08:34,868
And the word is that Eversource is going to be revving up to continue this process.

978
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:40,229
And I reached out from a few constituents that are still very concerned.

979
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:45,139
with the lack of communication and lack of notice to especially our senior citizens.

980
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:56,466
One of the things we talked about months ago was making sure that they had a liaison that dealt directly with the constituents, with the neighbors.

981
01:08:57,386 --> 01:09:03,770
One very valid point was when an area of Winthrop Street is closed and

982
01:09:04,672 --> 01:09:09,259
We have elderly residents that can't traverse in and out of their driveways.

983
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:19,634
And with health issues and concerns of doctor's appointments, and not having that contact person, I think is a very dangerous situation.

984
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:21,656
these are valid concerns.

985
01:09:21,736 --> 01:09:29,159
So, you know, as well as making sure that the process is still in place and what was promised.

986
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:38,883
And one of the biggest things we've talked about, and I know Chris Donovan has been pushing this, is the implementation of sidewalks along both sides.

987
01:09:40,244 --> 01:09:42,607
of Winthrop Street from beginning to end.

988
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:47,894
So I think that was part of the agreement, but we haven't heard from anyone in a while from Eversource.

989
01:09:48,335 --> 01:09:57,286
So my recommendation is actually to call for a representative from the Eversource project to appear at one of our next meetings.

990
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:05,030
And so we can go over the process and hopefully set up what we asked for in the past was a community meeting.

991
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:16,574
I know with nice weather, Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco, I think held a great meeting up in the heights with members of the community, social distancing, wearing masks.

992
01:10:17,114 --> 01:10:18,855
And we had close to 50 people there.

993
01:10:19,435 --> 01:10:26,298
And I too look at this project and really having the neighbors come out and speak to someone in person and then

994
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:33,237
actually know who they can talk to when it comes time for shovels to break ground.

995
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:54,753
So if we can, I'd like to amend my resolution to ask for a representative from Eversource and our city administration to meet with us to make sure that concerns and issues from the neighbors in the Winthrop Street area are heard and they are listened to and everybody is prepared

996
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:56,749
for this daunting project.

997
01:10:56,809 --> 01:10:59,792
I know hopefully we're all getting back to school.

998
01:10:59,832 --> 01:11:01,413
The high school's gonna be back open.

999
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:03,235
The weather's gonna be nice.

1000
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:06,238
You're talking more traffic, people going back to work.

1001
01:11:06,898 --> 01:11:14,305
So as we're getting to some sort of normalcy, we're gonna be encountering some serious concerns for those neighbors.

1002
01:11:14,345 --> 01:11:22,492
So I'd like to have representatives here to discuss that and have them, our neighbors, have a chance to speak.

1003
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:23,766
and she had her concerns.

1004
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:24,326
Thank you, Mr. President.

1005
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:25,607
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1006
01:11:25,627 --> 01:11:27,787
Any other discussion on this?

1007
01:11:27,827 --> 01:11:28,187
Mr. President.

1008
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:29,968
Councilor Morocco.

1009
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:31,328
Thank you, Mr. President.

1010
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:33,769
I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

1011
01:11:34,589 --> 01:11:48,633
I do know the, I was curious to get out a B paper or the representative from Eversource did send the council fairly comprehensive updates while they were doing work as far as what areas the project was focusing on and what would be next.

1012
01:11:48,753 --> 01:11:50,413
It would be great if the administration could

1013
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:54,591
those on the website as soon as they're received and make sure they're up to date.

1014
01:11:54,671 --> 01:11:59,653
So in addition to, I think it's a great idea to have an in-person meeting outside safe and socially distance.

1015
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:03,675
I think in addition to that, just having that information shared as well.

1016
01:12:03,775 --> 01:12:17,642
And I think that in-person meeting would be great because so often this council, when residents have made requests for safety improvements and everything else on Winthrop Street in this area, their response has unfortunately always had to be

1017
01:12:18,316 --> 01:12:21,038
When Eversource is done, it's going to be curb to curb.

1018
01:12:21,058 --> 01:12:22,379
We're going to get that sidewalk.

1019
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:26,943
And that doesn't make that part of Winthrop Street or most of Winthrop Street any less dangerous.

1020
01:12:27,563 --> 01:12:34,889
And work that was done prior to the winter, one of the more dangerous crosswalks on that area, Winthrop Street, has been dug up.

1021
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:37,571
And now we're missing the actual paint on that crosswalk.

1022
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:43,215
And we wait, and we wait, and we wait until Eversource completes this project so we can have a safe Winthrop Street.

1023
01:12:44,096 --> 01:12:46,938
So again, simple thing just like to add to the administration.

1024
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:51,609
post that information as soon as it comes through from Eversource.

1025
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:58,453
And I think an in-person meeting would go a long way for a lot of the challenges related to this project and what needs to be done when it's finally complete.

1026
01:12:59,534 --> 01:13:00,254
Thank you, Councilor.

1027
01:13:00,274 --> 01:13:00,774
Councilor Knight.

1028
01:13:01,114 --> 01:13:02,775
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1029
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:10,740
That information that the Councilor speaks of is a direct result of the work that this Council has done in ensuring that Eversource is brought to the table.

1030
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:17,164
The administration had nothing to do with ensuring that we got bi-monthly and bi-weekly updates during the construction project.

1031
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:18,285
That was something this Council did.

1032
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:30,694
I can remember when this project was first introduced back, I think it was in 2015, and Councilor Marks, way ahead of the curve on this one, was demanding that Eversource come down to the city council meetings.

1033
01:13:30,794 --> 01:13:39,681
I believe they brought, Mr. Bill Zamparelli was here before us on multiple occasions, before they even got a grant of location or a permit to put a shovel in the ground, Mr. President.

1034
01:13:40,161 --> 01:13:44,604
And they had a gentleman by the name of Sean Shortell was his name.

1035
01:13:45,145 --> 01:13:48,227
And Sean is the community outreach liaison who is working

1036
01:13:49,032 --> 01:13:49,733
on the project.

1037
01:13:50,173 --> 01:14:00,481
And I believe the last update that we received from him was right around in between Christmas and between Halloween and Thanksgiving, Mr. President, that said that the work would resume in the spring.

1038
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:01,742
And that was it.

1039
01:14:01,862 --> 01:14:03,763
But I think Councilor Scott is probably on the right track.

1040
01:14:03,783 --> 01:14:04,744
We haven't heard in a long time.

1041
01:14:04,804 --> 01:14:15,212
It's time to come back to the table and tell us exactly what's going on, provide us with the construction schedule, and let's get this project moving so that we can go back to some sense of normalcy.

1042
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:18,094
That coupled with the fact that we have a commitment from

1043
01:14:18,848 --> 01:14:27,252
have a source when this project's done to resurface our roadways from curb to curb, to fix the Winter Tree Rotary and the mess that was left behind when the water pipeline project was done there.

1044
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:35,076
I think we're gonna see a lot more construction in that area before it's over, but the final product will be something that is well worth the wait.

1045
01:14:35,457 --> 01:14:38,738
So with that being said, Mr. President, I look forward to seeing another source here in this room.

1046
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:45,422
I share many of the concerns that not only my colleagues, but most importantly, my neighbors share, and I look forward to having the opportunity to have them addressed.

1047
01:14:46,302 --> 01:14:47,303
Thank you, Mr. President.

1048
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:54,246
Thank you, Mr President, I want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward I feel like this is kind of like a project that will never end.

1049
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:57,149
We've been talking about it for years now.

1050
01:14:57,169 --> 01:15:01,334
And, you know, it's kind of gone away for a little bit but now it's coming back.

1051
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:10,930
And, you know, you need to get an update, you know, from, from every source with regard to the timing, what's going to happen, who's going to be inconvenienced next.

1052
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:20,531
And, you know, the, the residents should have the opportunity to basically, you know, ask questions and they're impacted the most.

1053
01:15:20,731 --> 01:15:26,072
This is a major project and we need to get some answers and we need to get an update from every source.

1054
01:15:26,092 --> 01:15:29,313
So Councilor Scott Kelly, thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

1055
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:29,693
Thank you.

1056
01:15:32,465 --> 01:15:33,226
Thank you, Mr. President.

1057
01:15:33,246 --> 01:15:35,607
I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this up.

1058
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:39,069
And indeed, Vice President Knight is correct.

1059
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:49,514
My first paper in my folder, Mr. President, this dates back first presentation to the mayor, November 13, 2014.

1060
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:57,790
This is when this project was presented by Eversource to the city of Method.

1061
01:15:58,431 --> 01:16:03,415
So some six years ago, Mr. President, almost seven years we're working on now with this project.

1062
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:18,207
I also have a copy of the MOU, a memorandum of understanding from Mark Rumley dated March 9th, 2017, which lays out many of the mitigating

1063
01:16:18,794 --> 01:16:25,740
items, Mr. President, as part of the agreement between Eversource and the City of Medford.

1064
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:31,905
And I also have, Mr. President, a number of Committee of the Whole meetings from 2017.

1065
01:16:34,367 --> 01:16:41,913
I believe you may have been president at the time that we held regarding Eversource, regarding neighborhood concerns.

1066
01:16:42,768 --> 01:16:49,813
I think it was Council Scott Pelley that requested that they have direct neighborhood meetings in that particular area.

1067
01:16:50,854 --> 01:17:11,828
And a lot was done by this Meffitt City Council to ensure that this project, when it did take place, that first of all, the city of Meffitt received some benefits because this line that they're installing, this high tension line, has zero benefits for the city of Meffitt other than total disruption

1068
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:18,067
of our streets, Mr. President, and noise in our neighborhoods as well, Mr. President.

1069
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:23,913
I believe we put a number of initiatives in place to address that.

1070
01:17:24,693 --> 01:17:43,147
The calls that we got and emails from area residents, I know the Karen family that lives on Winthrop Street, very involved in the community over a number of years, they had a concern, rightfully so, of putting back the street, pave to pave, and also the sidewalk.

1071
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:45,509
And I did find a press release

1072
01:17:46,149 --> 01:18:10,899
from April 17th, 2019 from then Mayor Burke, and it states, and this is a quote from the mayor, that Eversource Project to connect their Woburn and Everett substations with an underground conduit will improve New England's power grid, which benefits the entire region by meeting its electricity needs in a more reliable manner.

1073
01:18:11,599 --> 01:18:13,720
Method residents will benefit directly

1074
01:18:14,187 --> 01:18:19,969
from just over three miles of street restorations and improvements along the route.

1075
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:27,011
Improvements to sidewalks with ADA compliance and curbing near Lorraine and Smith Roads.

1076
01:18:27,532 --> 01:18:37,715
Installation of freeways crosswalks on Winthrop Street at Method High School, Winthrop Street crosswalk by Memorial Park and South and Main Street.

1077
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:40,056
And other smaller improvements along the route.

1078
01:18:40,476 --> 01:18:42,957
And that was said by former Mayor Burke.

1079
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,941
So there is plenty of record, Mr. President.

1080
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:58,707
I know some residents are concerned, and rightfully so, it's been such a long process that if you don't have a file to look back, you forget the commitments that were made, and we wanna make sure that these commitments aren't forgotten.

1081
01:18:58,807 --> 01:19:13,053
So as far as I'm concerned, as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, the curbing of the sidewalk on both sides, Lorraine, Smith, and all the way down Winthrop Street, Mr. President, was a commitment that was made originally back some years ago.

1082
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:15,422
And that will be honored, Mr. President.

1083
01:19:16,782 --> 01:19:21,704
Regarding the construction itself, they seem to be making a lot of progress.

1084
01:19:22,644 --> 01:19:30,027
I haven't received a lot of complaints regarding neighbors not being able to access their driveways, regarding excessive noise.

1085
01:19:30,427 --> 01:19:37,269
I think Vice President Knight mentioned about the storage of equipment during work time.

1086
01:19:38,029 --> 01:19:39,690
I haven't seen any equipment stored

1087
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,650
in the area.

1088
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:49,213
So I think we really stood our due diligence on our homework when this project was coming through three miles of our roads and our neighborhoods.

1089
01:19:50,354 --> 01:19:55,475
And that has nothing even to do with traffic and the impact of traffic, Mr. President.

1090
01:19:56,075 --> 01:20:00,477
And I just want to thank my colleagues and we have to make sure we stay on top of this.

1091
01:20:00,497 --> 01:20:06,279
So I will support the motion offered by my colleagues for an update from Eversource.

1092
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:09,165
Thank you, Councilor Moxley, and if I could put in my efforts.

1093
01:20:09,645 --> 01:20:17,890
I think the most amount of complaints I got with people were from the banging of plates at night, you know, when trucks are going over during the construction.

1094
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:25,153
But I think we're at the point now where, like Councilor Moxley said, there's three miles of road that they have to repair.

1095
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:32,797
They're pretty much done on Mystic Avenue, so I would hope that maybe Mystic Avenue could be paved this spring.

1096
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:34,618
I mean, driving down there is like,

1097
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:38,482
going through a war zone, I think South Street is pretty much done too.

1098
01:20:39,503 --> 01:20:56,296
And let's say, I wish they would at least start paving the sections where they're complete as promised, because otherwise, are they gonna wait to do this, pave all the way from Charlestown to Woburn, when the project is actually finished in another year or so?

1099
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,697
I hope that wouldn't be the case.

1100
01:20:57,717 --> 01:21:02,260
So I thank Councilor Capelli for bringing this forward, and I will support this also.

1101
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:03,341
On the motion,

1102
01:21:05,015 --> 01:21:05,516
comes to this.

1103
01:21:07,057 --> 01:21:07,938
Thank you, Mr President.

1104
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:09,840
And I think your point is well taken.

1105
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:15,466
Um, you know, if parts of this project are done, can we move to the resurfacing phase?

1106
01:21:15,507 --> 01:21:22,995
I don't think it really is fair to the community to leave these roads in such condition if they're not going to, you know, if their construction is complete there.

1107
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:25,017
And I just wanted to bring up one other point.

1108
01:21:25,557 --> 01:21:25,898
Um, you know,

1109
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:31,434
of the priorities of this council for this session was council communications.

1110
01:21:31,494 --> 01:21:46,361
And I think Councilor Morrell brought up a good point, which is we, you know, this council did the work to make sure that Eversource is providing the updates to the community, but we are still reliant on the administration in order to put any of that information on the city website, you know, for people to see.

1111
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:54,605
And I think, you know, what Councilor Marks read as well, you know, that would be very helpful information for residents to have access to, but it's not on the city website.

1112
01:21:54,645 --> 01:21:55,906
So I hope that as we

1113
01:21:56,636 --> 01:22:09,103
move forward, we can figure out a way for this council to have more input and control over getting our message out about the good things that we are doing and not be entirely relying on the administration for that.

1114
01:22:09,463 --> 01:22:09,843
Thank you.

1115
01:22:10,524 --> 01:22:10,864
Thank you.

1116
01:22:11,484 --> 01:22:13,546
Okay, I don't see any hands up.

1117
01:22:14,086 --> 01:22:23,211

1118
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:24,672
Did I miss anything?

1119
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,202

1133
01:22:43,536 --> 01:22:45,278
Yes, I move the affirmative motion passes.

Councilor Falco.

1139
01:23:04,554 --> 01:23:04,794
Yes.

1140
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:05,995
Vice President Knight.

1141
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:06,555
Yes.

1142
01:23:06,956 --> 01:23:07,556
Councilor Marks.

1143
01:23:07,937 --> 01:23:08,237
Yes.

1144
01:23:08,897 --> 01:23:09,558
Councilor Morrell.

1145
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:10,238
Yes.

1146
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:11,960
Councilor Scarpelli.

1147
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:12,500
Yes.

1148
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,641
President Quirvial.

1149
01:23:14,442 --> 01:23:16,183
Yes, seven in the affirmative motion passes.

1150
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,606
Communications from the Mayor 21088.

1151
01:23:20,026 --> 01:23:23,469
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis Mass, 02155.

1152
01:23:25,135 --> 01:23:26,616
and Mr. President, city councilors.

1153
01:23:27,117 --> 01:23:42,930
I respectfully request to recommend that your own body accept under the Massachusetts General Laws and Acts of 2020 Chapter 325 to appropriate $200,000.00 from the Method Casino Special Revenue Fund to fund the firetruck platter lease payment.

1154
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:51,517
This request is in compliance with the Method and Wynn Casino's sobriety community impact payment, specifically the public safety payment.

1155
01:23:52,148 --> 01:23:55,169
Chief Chief Chief your burning is on hand.

1156
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,611
Finance director, we should not be Benjamin.

1157
01:23:59,031 --> 01:24:01,072
It's also here to answer any questions.

1158
01:24:01,712 --> 01:24:13,718
Mr. Clark at this point, I must recuse myself as I chair the committee for the mass gaming commission that oversees these funds, and I will relinquish the chair to Councilor marks.

1159
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,101
Mr. Clark I to recuse myself as a member of the commission.

1160
01:24:22,885 --> 01:24:23,766
Motion to approve.

1161
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:38,818
Do we have Chief Gilberti on the... Yes, I'm here.

1162
01:24:39,799 --> 01:24:43,041
Chief, could you just give us an update on this paper?

1163
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:49,046
I can give you an update on the trucks.

1164
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:49,626
Do you want...

1165
01:24:51,205 --> 01:24:53,747
finance director Alicia to update you on the monies.

1166
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:58,230
Why don't you, while we have you, why don't you give us an update on the trucks?

1167
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:12,739
Okay, we were hoping to get the trucks in December and then early December we got delayed and they moved the delivery date into late February.

1168
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,462
And just recently I've been notified that we are now

1169
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:25,363
expecting delivery late April, early May for at least the tractor-drawn aerial.

1170
01:25:28,505 --> 01:25:42,074
As the COVID pandemic has hit everywhere in the country, Seagrave has also been hit, and every day they have about 20-25% of their staff, their

1171
01:25:44,395 --> 01:25:48,717
factory workers that are either quarantined or have tested positive.

1172
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:54,900
So they have shut down different divisions throughout the plant.

1173
01:25:55,381 --> 01:25:57,842
And that's the reason for the delay.

1174
01:25:57,882 --> 01:26:05,546
But I just last week received some photos of our tractor drawn that's being put together now.

1175
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:07,207
So that is underway.

1176
01:26:08,505 --> 01:26:17,232
And hopefully, late April, early May, we will have delivery of at least the tractor-drawn aerial.

1177
01:26:19,653 --> 01:26:22,596
And what about the other lot of truck, Chief?

1178
01:26:23,276 --> 01:26:26,118
Right now, I spoke to the Seagrave today.

1179
01:26:26,138 --> 01:26:31,802
I don't have a definitive date or even a guess as to when that one will be ready.

1180
01:26:31,823 --> 01:26:34,985
And that's as of today.

1181
01:26:38,162 --> 01:26:43,344
So we're looking at one, possibly the middle of April and the other one, we're not sure yet.

1182
01:26:44,485 --> 01:26:55,890
I was told late April, early May, late April, maybe for the tractor drawn and into May for the rear mount.

1183
01:26:56,370 --> 01:27:01,652
So they come fully equipped or will there be a process to equip the trucks when they get here?

1184
01:27:02,212 --> 01:27:05,774
No, they come with ladders and pipe poles

1185
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:17,494
things of that nature, but very limited, but I'm gonna utilize most of the equipment that we have on the current ladder trucks to outfit both new ladder trucks.

1186
01:27:19,094 --> 01:27:21,035
And what stations will these be at?

1187
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:29,078
The tractor drawn will be stationed at headquarters at Main Street and the rear mount will be at Salem Street.

1188
01:27:31,038 --> 01:27:35,280
Okay, and do we have Alicia Nunley on?

1189
01:27:37,022 --> 01:27:38,183
Yes, good evening, councillors.

1190
01:27:41,025 --> 01:27:43,446
Alicia, can you give us an update on this paper?

1191
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:53,192
Yes, so what we're looking to do is a 10 year lease as your honorable body had approved previously in 2019.

1192
01:27:53,793 --> 01:27:57,555
With this paper, we're actually putting aside casino money

1193
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:10,068
for the fire trucks from the public safety so that in the future as we're making our payments, we have the payments ready for the lease and we don't have to take too much out of the budget, especially with what has happened with COVID.

1194
01:28:10,688 --> 01:28:14,411
I'd rather use casino mitigation money than have to go into the budget.

1195
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,934
So can you give us a breakdown?

1196
01:28:18,954 --> 01:28:20,815
So it's a 10 year lease, it's $200,000.

1197
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:34,797
So the lease payment right now, we got a rate under 2% at 1.86% with a lease payment of 286, 436 and 51 cents.

1198
01:28:37,398 --> 01:28:43,041
Okay, so at the end, so after 10 years, what are we paying in interest on these?

1199
01:28:44,182 --> 01:28:50,445
So in total interest at the end, so it says our lease payment, the trucks in principle are 2.6 million.

1200
01:28:52,135 --> 01:28:56,298
Our interest is $264,365.10 for a total of $2,864,365.10.

1201
01:28:57,098 --> 01:29:02,601
How is that per lot of truck?

1202
01:29:04,723 --> 01:29:07,204
The total for two lot of trucks is $2.6 million.

1203
01:29:07,224 --> 01:29:08,545
$2.6 million.

1204
01:29:09,426 --> 01:29:12,407
And do they need to be equipped with anything other than how they're coming?

1205
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:16,870
I leave to the fire chief to answer that.

1206
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:19,812
Chief, are there any additional costs?

1207
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:30,638
We have, I have a, the total cost of the two vehicles is $2,441,397, which will leave $158,603 to purchase new equipment.

1208
01:29:30,678 --> 01:29:31,039
And one of the,

1209
01:29:44,393 --> 01:29:52,876
One of the items that we will be purchasing for both ladder trucks, hydraulic height, first tools.

1210
01:29:54,036 --> 01:30:01,598
Each one will come with a spreader, a cutter and a battering ram.

1211
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:06,280
Those two, I think total around $70,000.

1212
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:11,902
So that's going to take a chunk out of the 158,000.

1213
01:30:13,838 --> 01:30:22,445
And the remainder will be used to buy, we need radios, of course, in the trucks and miscellaneous equipment.

1214
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:29,610
So we should have enough money to outfit both ladder trucks using what we have on the current ladder trucks.

1215
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:33,633
So the 2.6 million covers equipping the trucks as well.

1216
01:30:34,213 --> 01:30:35,214
That is correct, yes.

1217
01:30:36,795 --> 01:30:40,138
And chief, if you can just give us a brief rundown of

1218
01:30:40,729 --> 01:30:43,271
What's going to be done with the existing ladder trucks?

1219
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:45,212
Are they going to go into reserve?

1220
01:30:45,272 --> 01:30:48,135
How is that going to work?

1221
01:30:48,195 --> 01:30:53,559
The 2000 ladder tower has been out of service for quite some time.

1222
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:58,843
The platform was damaged and we can't use the aerial.

1223
01:30:59,623 --> 01:31:06,729
So we do have a reserve piece of 2009 E1 that is currently at headquarters.

1224
01:31:08,205 --> 01:31:10,527
That's a rear-mount 110-foot aerial.

1225
01:31:11,228 --> 01:31:16,012
And we have the 2010 rear-mount that's at Salem Street.

1226
01:31:16,172 --> 01:31:20,916
The tractor drawn, as I said, will go to headquarters at Main Street.

1227
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:25,820
The rear-mount will go to Salem Street.

1228
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:33,466
The 2010 will be a reserve piece, as will the 2009 will be a reserve piece.

1229
01:31:34,107 --> 01:31:35,228
And I'm going to be

1230
01:31:35,853 --> 01:31:39,775
disposing of the 2,000 ladder tower.

1231
01:31:41,756 --> 01:31:44,437
And where are the plans to keep the trucks that are in reserve?

1232
01:31:46,258 --> 01:31:48,079
In various stations, actually.

1233
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:51,081
We have room to keep them indoors?

1234
01:31:51,601 --> 01:31:52,061
We should.

1235
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:56,984
Do I have any questions?

1236
01:31:57,644 --> 01:31:58,485
Mr. President, colleagues?

1237
01:31:58,985 --> 01:31:59,745
Councilor Falco.

1238
01:31:59,985 --> 01:32:00,926
Thank you, Mr. President.

1239
01:32:01,006 --> 01:32:02,366
Thank you, Chief Gilberti.

1240
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:05,725
And then you should only as well.

1241
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:08,547
A quick question with regard to the lease.

1242
01:32:08,587 --> 01:32:10,829
At the end of the lease, do we have the option to buy the vehicles?

1243
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,832
We actually own them outright at the end of the lease.

1244
01:32:15,332 --> 01:32:15,993
You own them outright.

1245
01:32:16,093 --> 01:32:16,313
Okay.

1246
01:32:16,733 --> 01:32:16,914
Okay.

1247
01:32:16,954 --> 01:32:19,015
That was my, that's, that was my big question.

1248
01:32:19,035 --> 01:32:20,236
So we own at the end of the lease.

1249
01:32:21,717 --> 01:32:21,998
Perfect.

1250
01:32:22,038 --> 01:32:22,378
Thank you.

1251
01:32:23,018 --> 01:32:23,218
Yep.

1252
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,101
Any other questions for my colleagues?

1253
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:29,663
Any questions from the public?

1254
01:32:30,004 --> 01:32:31,285
We have anyone from the public?

1255
01:32:31,865 --> 01:32:32,966
Mr. Clark, give us a minute.

1256
01:32:40,462 --> 01:32:45,165
On the motion of approval by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1257
01:32:45,926 --> 01:32:47,166
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1258
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:53,591
Councilor Behrs.

1259
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:54,411
Yes.

1260
01:32:56,532 --> 01:32:57,253
Councilor Falco.

1261
01:32:57,433 --> 01:32:57,733
Yes.

1262
01:32:58,414 --> 01:33:00,035
Vice President Knighton has recused himself.

1263
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,056
Councilor Morrell.

1264
01:33:02,696 --> 01:33:02,977
Yes.

1265
