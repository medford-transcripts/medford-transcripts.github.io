1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:03,253
We certainly hope that you'll come back Saturday and Sunday.

2
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:29,327
We have a couple of different things.

3
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:35,670
Please return your cell phones on silent while we're off.

4
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:57,654
I just do want to thank John.

5
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:06,417
I agree with what the community has done to bring the best in here.

6
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:08,758
It's getting bigger and better every year.

7
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:12,920
So we're really, really, really happy to be here with them.

8
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,952
I just wanted to say

9
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,931
I don't know.

10
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:56,571
I don't know.

11
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,032
I don't know.

12
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:28,205
and doing this as a program is what I'm interested in today.

13
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:42,815
I'm also a secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and I'm very humbled to be here today to be able to announce the remainder of my time that I'm going to be doing on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security.

14
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:47,458
I'd like to share one and a half, because I'm not going to speak today.

15
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:51,781
I'm not going to speak today.

16
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:59,828
and then to Anita for, you know, helping me think of a new jam session for him to get to know him better.

17
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:04,790
So, we look forward to hearing from you, and thanks so much for your time.

18
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:12,594
What do I think about how the community has developed this year?

19
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:18,136
I feel like it's just been a year that we've never heard of anything like that.

20
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:19,677
I've heard that they have a helpful community plan.

21
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:25,060
I know that one of the things that gets them more diversified is in the middle of our social media.

22
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,302
There's just so many things to see on Facebook, Instagram, or on Google Docs.

23
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,702
I don't know anything about that.

24
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,664
So, I'm listening to you here.

25
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,705
Big shout out to Lauren for her help.

26
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:46,335
Also to, I think it was Kenneth, I asked him to do a murder job, and I think that's what he's like.

27
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:52,218
And it's been really saving me in a variety of different ways.

28
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:54,379
So, thank you to Lise.

29
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,100
Also to my partner, Taylor.

30
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:14,119
I wanted to thank you for all your help with the promotion and you mentioned that there's a couple of meetings coming up around the area today.

31
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:20,684
And I'd also like to say that there are two really unique initiatives that are all around the area.

32
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:23,446
I'd like you to actually have a couple of meetings.

33
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,167
We're working on that right now.

34
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:27,069
It's really just a situation.

35
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,629
It is new.

36
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,611
We're doing what it's all about.

37
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,733
It's more from a self-regulation role.

38
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,353
I'm happy to lead the group around here.

39
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:47,798
And I'd like to just give a round of applause to all of you.

40
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,833
and everything else I can say about the community center itself.

41
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:26,935
The last thing I'll say is that we get a lot of support by generous sponsors.

42
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:34,738
So all group organizations that have access to money or a discount fund, if it's a community.

43
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,920
Rivers of West Denver Community Center is a space where arts, life, and education.

44
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,001
I'm really excited to see more opportunities for the community.

45
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,842
And then there's just huge projects coming our way.

46
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:52,946
And then for our council, this year we actually don't have food in there, but the Saturdays and Sundays we have food.

47
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,247
We can use Instagram houses.

48
00:05:54,427 --> 00:06:03,596
We may or may not be able to come back, but we will do our best.

49
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:12,118
For her, she's a tribal man, which is a local t-shirt, meaning that this is her territory and her t-shirt is made to look great.

50
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,060
It's made out of a local hollywood look.

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,207
For her, at least, it's a t-shirt that she has, a t-shirt that says she's run by a big name that's over here in New York.

52
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:26,871
She's a descendant of a woman I know over there that has a local t-shirt.

53
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:29,052
It's a t-shirt that she has.

54
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,394
So all of our P.D.

55
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:31,454
trainers, which is P.D.

56
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:31,795
trainers,

57
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:38,485
Um, can you turn it off?

58
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:39,006
Um, can you turn it off?

59
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,406
Um, can you turn it off?

60
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:40,866
Um, can you turn it off?

61
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:41,407
Um, can you turn it off?

62
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:42,848
Um, can you turn it off?

63
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:43,308
Um, can you turn it off?

64
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:43,808
Um, can you turn it off?

65
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:44,508
Um, can you turn it off?

66
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,109
Um, can you turn it off?

67
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:45,629
Um, can you turn it off?

68
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:46,169
Um, can you turn it off?

69
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,630
Um, can you turn it off?

70
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,490
Um, can you turn it off?

71
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:48,951
Um, can you turn it off?

72
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:49,491
Um, can you turn it off?

73
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:49,951
Um, can you turn it off?

74
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:50,432
Um, can you turn it off?

75
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,252
Um, can you turn it off?

76
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:51,752
Um, can you turn it off?

77
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:54,234
Um, can you turn it off?

78
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:56,675
Um, can you turn it off?

79
00:06:56,695 --> 00:07:00,317
Um, can you turn it off?

80
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:00,777
Um, can you turn it off?

81
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:01,237
Um, can you turn it off?

82
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:01,697
Um, can you turn it off?

83
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:02,178
Um, can you turn it off?

84
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:06,500
Um, can you turn it off?

85
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:13,619
If you're especially tired about what we do, we do a good time for that.

86
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:19,023
And of course, they're involved with I know a lot of you are, because of that law.

87
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:27,430
And then lately, we've been doing a little bit of a roll with that.

88
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:51,312
And I think it's important to know that we have a community.

89
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,202
and then to keep them off for a little bit.

90
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:21,930
So, there's that alternative on the one side, and then you use, there's a lot of ways I can say it, on the one side, I love that, I'm in the area, but there's so many ways that you can get control, and then to really fire,

91
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,075
I'm going to get that.

92
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,166
do do

93
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,296
Music Music

94
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:43,473
do do

95
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:19,679
Thank you very much.

96
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:36,220
Thank you so much.

97
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:44,083
In this last couple of summers, we should take a clear day for granted.

98
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:47,964
So we wanted to start off on a clear day.

99
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,465
So I'm going to play a mix of standards

100
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,593
This is a statue called Gyurusai, by the late Jim Brattain.

101
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:42,337
do do

102
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:47,592
do do

103
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:31,649
do do

104
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:03,022
do

105
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:46,908
Yeah.

106
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:40,113
We're going to pick up the pace.

107
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:47,038
We're going to play a tune called Simone.

108
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:45,374
Yeah.

109
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:07,364
do do

110
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,380
do

111
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:21,116
do

112
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:03,006
We have such fun rehearsing above the region here on various nights of the week.

113
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:08,631
It's nice to come together, get out, walk across the river.

114
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,732
Here we are.

115
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:11,454
We don't have far to go.

116
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:28,349
But we do have farther to go musically, and on is Mike Chambliss on the drums.

117
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,061
Ah, the wisdom.

118
00:29:52,922 --> 00:30:00,529
And at this time, we have a special shift in course as we invite the wonderful Debbie Lang to come up.

119
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:06,035
I actually want to introduce Peter Barney.

120
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:49,619
So we saw it, and I wonder if you want to turn it up for us, if you can.

121
00:30:49,659 --> 00:31:01,527
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

122
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:16,132
My love, my love, your love is great, my heart is flowered.

123
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:21,037
I need your love or I will die.

124
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:23,359
My very life is in your power.

125
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,395
I want you, baby.

126
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,377
I want you, baby.

127
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:40,598
I want you, baby.

128
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:41,119
I want you, baby.

129
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,020
I want you, baby.

130
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:55,626
rain.

131
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:55,947
rain.

132
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,221
Why a bum, why a bum?

133
00:32:59,512 --> 00:32:59,712
do do

134
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:28,846
do do

135
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:38,465
The rain can fall on distant mountains.

136
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,146
The rain can fall upon the sea.

137
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,590
The rain can fall upon the flower.

138
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:51,555
Since the rain has fallen, let it fall again.

139
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:02,578
There you go.

140
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:45,212
So this next song is by the wonderful Toots Eamons, who played a wonderful Hamada and wonderful jazz sax.

141
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:47,193
I say wonderful.

142
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:32,593
poor little sad little blue who said, don't you cry, don't you cry, you can bet one lucky day you'll wake up and your blues will be forsaken, one lucky day that you'll overcome, you're winning.

143
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:45,292
as long as there's love in your heart to share with those that don't care.

144
00:36:45,652 --> 00:37:00,906
As long as you look for it, as long as there's someone like you to find someone to be true to, two loving arms we can nestle in and say,

145
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,146
blues and true love is coming

146
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,254
do do

147
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:10,156
you

148
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:10,822
Read a little newsletter, open a new quarter.

149
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:13,343
Have you heard the news yet?

150
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:19,065
All around the town, a quarter of clubs wrapped in rainbows and flowers.

151
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:23,846
So make your next springtime, your falltime, your wintertime.

152
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:28,207
Dry your eyes, don't fool yourself.

153
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:31,168
The good times are gone, he said.

154
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:36,110
Oh, what a sad little world, he said.

155
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,338
don't you cry

156
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,191
you.

157
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:15,238
This song is uh, there's a wonderful songwriting team uh, Jimmy Van Hoesel and Jonathan Burbank.

158
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:17,139
And we have this song called Congratulations.

159
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:47,497
Yeah.

160
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:48,018
Yeah.

161
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:11,709
I'm going to put you in your seat.

162
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:42,754
is funny.

163
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:48,458
It makes a cloudy day sunny.

164
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:53,881
Makes a evening of honey.

165
00:43:55,382 --> 00:44:01,126
Just as I think of you.

166
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:06,849
Imagination is crazy.

167
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,371
Your whole perspective

168
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:30,173
Maybe it starts you asking a daisy what to do Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss and then, and then

169
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:39,842
I find it's only your imagination.

170
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:40,242
Oh, oh.

171
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:41,383
Imagination.

172
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,163
Silly me.

173
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:46,244
You go around with it.

174
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:51,866
For example, I go around wanting you.

175
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:12,603
And if I can't imagine the truth, what is truth?

176
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,060
do do do

177
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,327
do do

178
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,662
Have you ever felt a thrill?

179
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:59,229
And then a kiss, and then, and then Find it's only your imagination again Oh well, imagination

180
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:29,662
You go around whirly-whirly Oh, for example, I go around wanting you And yet I can't measure that you want me Can't measure that you want me

181
00:48:31,264 --> 00:48:51,058
I can't imagine that you'd want me to.

182
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,700
So my son is a jazz classic player.

183
00:48:54,516 --> 00:49:00,197
I just put a little sign up that my family lives here, and their last name is Golson, not related to Benny Golson who wrote this song.

184
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:01,978
As far as I know.

185
00:49:02,218 --> 00:49:04,038
Check it out.

186
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:10,960
This song's called Whisper Money.

187
00:49:53,343 --> 00:50:03,209
Sweet words in my ear, not a whisper of despair.

188
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:18,858
But love is all fresh in your arms until you bring back the thrill of the scent.

189
00:50:19,505 --> 00:50:27,647
That's a town that died too soon.

190
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:32,207
Our harmony was lost, but you forgave.

191
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:34,348
I forgot.

192
00:50:35,488 --> 00:50:39,049
Whisper not of all those pasts.

193
00:50:40,189 --> 00:50:42,929
You know that I left.

194
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:43,569
So now,

195
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:58,261
love will whisper from eternally.

196
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:41,375
He said so when they said it would last

197
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:05,126
I didn't want you here to stay, but like you know, we still could make it.

198
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,469
Forget it all, answer the Cupid's call.

199
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:12,090
Is it true?

200
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:17,773
Is this a problem or an echo of the past?

201
00:52:17,953 --> 00:52:22,835
All it will take to lose my bloom is just a whisper, not a rumor.

202
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:27,838
Love your love for me, that's how it's got to be.

203
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:36,255
Our harmony was strong, but you forgave.

204
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:38,557
I forgot.

205
00:52:39,438 --> 00:52:43,742
Whisper love, love grows fast.

206
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:47,325
You know we are the last.

207
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:51,608
So I will keep on keeping constantly.

208
00:52:52,229 --> 00:52:54,631
Love will whisper home.

209
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:06,953
Bye!

210
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:00,567
do

211
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:30,535
Okay.

212
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:04,823
do do

213
01:00:53,823 --> 01:00:54,183
do do

214
01:01:26,662 --> 01:01:27,643
Thank you very much.

215
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:06,397
do do

216
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:35,385
do do

217
01:04:34,022 --> 01:04:34,122
do

218
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:34,734
you

219
01:06:50,543 --> 01:06:50,823
do

220
01:07:44,654 --> 01:07:51,299
We're going to take a quick pause while we put our next act in place.

221
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:54,242
If you need to use the restroom, feel free.

222
01:07:54,282 --> 01:07:57,964
I'm going to see if I can find some water to put out.

223
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,184
We'll see.

224
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:44,675
Okay.

225
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:09,389
Yeah.

226
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:31,860
Okay.

227
01:10:01,787 --> 01:10:11,551
You know, it's funny, I was trying to see if I could figure out a better way of communication because these things haven't sunk.

228
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:12,751
They do, yeah.

229
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:36,368
In like a studio setting where there isn't like a live audience.

230
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:38,829
Yeah, if you're in like a green room.

231
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:43,952
But yeah, these are, I would, for the inside, maybe we'll better look outdoors.

232
01:10:43,992 --> 01:10:46,213
I'll see what we got.

233
01:10:46,633 --> 01:10:48,374
Well, here's what I was thinking.

234
01:10:48,614 --> 01:10:51,715
So we have a third person's ball, right?

235
01:10:51,975 --> 01:10:52,355
Yeah.

236
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:58,978
So I was thinking what we could do is come up with at least a system where you're quarterbacking.

237
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:03,200
So when we're on the cameras, you know, we might just look back at you.

238
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,303
It's just a matter of one, one, two, three, you know.

239
01:11:08,883 --> 01:11:18,128
And when, you know, we're going to switch or change our angles or whatever we're doing, we'll just do something like this.

240
01:11:18,188 --> 01:11:24,411
Nothing really obvious, but, you know, subtle enough where it's like you get it and you won't switch over to us.

241
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:27,173
That way it comes across better.

242
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:35,145
Yeah, I have to check the stream audio, but according to how well it sounds, because it records in the past.

243
01:11:55,699 --> 01:12:00,342
We might have better in-camera quality.

244
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,926
Yeah, well, tomorrow if you want.

245
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:12,531
What I might do is I might switch out the other one might have more in's.

246
01:12:12,631 --> 01:12:20,677
I like this one, but I think for like bigger stuff, like this would be good for like one, two cam, like some mid-light mics.

247
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:38,600
Yeah, I'll play around tomorrow morning while we're at it, because this is working alright.

248
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:45,786
But I want to see how the other one does here.

249
01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:47,527
Well, tomorrow morning you'll be here, what, at 10?

250
01:12:48,968 --> 01:12:50,609
Maybe earlier.

251
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:51,750
When do they open?

252
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:51,950
I think 10.

253
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,791
Well, we can check.

254
01:12:56,722 --> 01:13:03,608
And I can be here first thing in the morning, so that way I can help you move all this stuff outside and get it set up.

255
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:05,329
Yeah, that'd be great.

256
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:08,952
I mean, I've done it before for some stuff, but yeah, it's not ideal.

257
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:10,593
Yeah, but you never know.

258
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:13,736
Yeah, thank you very much for assisting here.

259
01:13:13,816 --> 01:13:14,897
You came in straight.

260
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:29,619
on the solos there.

261
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:37,224
Yeah, it's really nice having somebody who can get up there and shoot.

262
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:44,508
You know, I was also thinking, if we could talk this over too, is that that camera over there is really a tough shot.

263
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:53,513
The only thing I can think of is either putting it behind them, not blocking the door, so that way you get the trucker in a straight shot.

264
01:13:55,155 --> 01:13:56,836
That's going to change tomorrow too.

265
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:19,894
Yeah, yeah.

266
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:31,991
And the white balance is?

267
01:14:32,031 --> 01:14:32,731
Yeah, right there.

268
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,613
He's actually going home, because he's got the new cleaning bar right now.

269
01:14:35,673 --> 01:14:36,234
Come on.

270
01:14:36,374 --> 01:14:36,854
Nice, nice.

271
01:14:36,914 --> 01:14:37,154
All right.

272
01:14:37,174 --> 01:14:37,675
I know, I know.

273
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:39,256
If you hear me, clap once.

274
01:14:39,356 --> 01:14:40,917
All right.

275
01:14:41,037 --> 01:14:41,738
Come on.

276
01:14:41,798 --> 01:14:42,098
Come on.

277
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:07,199
All right, come on, you're like bubbles in a soda waiting for you to rise to the top, come on.

278
01:15:07,259 --> 01:15:07,640
Let's go.

279
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:08,080
All right.

280
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:08,841
Okay.

281
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:10,402
All hearts and minds clear?

282
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:14,766
That's a little something to say in the church there, okay.

283
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:42,499
So, we love, in West Medford, and you know, probably you're from it as well, I don't mean to single us out, but in West Medford, we really love homecomings, okay?

284
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:50,484
You know, we love reunions, we love backyard barbecues, we love all of that kind of stuff that gets the family together.

285
01:15:50,924 --> 01:15:54,867
And Anita Wood is a homegirl, as we like to say.

286
01:16:00,062 --> 01:16:05,004
If I was with my homies, I would say, she's my homegirl, like that.

287
01:16:05,304 --> 01:16:18,748
But anyways, so she's got this very cool collective that she's been jamming with for a little while now, trying to get that sound down that they like, jazz standards, often with a twist of passion.

288
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:23,869
And the band consists of Anita A.J.

289
01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:24,990
Wood on vocals.

290
01:16:33,165 --> 01:16:37,327
All right, and then they got the baby of the group back here, Carolyn Sue.

291
01:16:38,008 --> 01:16:39,469
All right, ready?

292
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:45,012
As you can tell, they brought up the cradle to get her.

293
01:16:47,193 --> 01:16:49,114
All right, it's Kyle Helmer on guitar.

294
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:51,676
All right, he's a tall man.

295
01:16:53,417 --> 01:16:56,358
All right, it's Rose Giuliani on bass.

296
01:16:56,899 --> 01:16:57,279
All right.

297
01:17:05,148 --> 01:17:05,508
All right.

298
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:09,089
We're getting ready to do something special tonight.

299
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,330
I just want to point out a couple of things.

300
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:17,432
Donation box on the table for the Jazz Festival itself.

301
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:21,053
Donation jar on the back table for the West Bedford Community Center.

302
01:17:21,073 --> 01:17:26,355
So if you're feeling soldiers bold, hook a brother, hook a sister up, as we like to say.

303
01:17:27,096 --> 01:17:29,736
And we're going to get going, OK?

304
01:17:29,756 --> 01:17:33,138
So hopefully your phones are still on silent or vibrate.

305
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:38,150
and enjoy the music right now of AJ and the crew.

306
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:34,013
We'll walk the dream house of love, dear Close to the sun of the day Near to the moon at night We'll live in a lovely way, dear Livin' on love in a pale moonlight Just you and I Forever and a day

I'm a mom, a star, a fire.

01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:48,872
I'm only alive to love you, too.

forever and a day.

319
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,081
How come I die before giving a break?

320
01:23:22,161 --> 01:23:28,726
Up above the stars, my heart and I grew up between east of the sun and west of the moon.

321
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:31,808
Here is the sun and west of the moon.

322
01:23:47,777 --> 01:23:50,379
East of the sun and west of the moon.

323
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:54,802
East of the sun and west of the moon.

324
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,381
We hope you like what we've done.

325
01:24:18,942 --> 01:24:19,782
The next one.

326
01:24:57,537 --> 01:25:00,238
So where on the rainbow, way up high

327
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:48,685
The skies are blue and the dreams that you dare to dream, they do come true.

328
01:25:48,705 --> 01:26:01,313
Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

329
01:26:01,633 --> 01:26:04,455
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

330
01:26:04,948 --> 01:26:21,681
The way above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me.

331
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:25,324
Somewhere over the rainbow, birds fly, birds fly.

332
01:26:25,444 --> 01:26:28,807
Over the rainbow, and what can't I

333
01:27:29,975 --> 01:27:43,522
It's a rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow.

334
01:28:05,663 --> 01:28:06,403

I want a lonely road that leads me nowhere I want a Sunday kind of love

341
01:31:04,488 --> 01:31:18,033
I do my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming, every minute, every hour, every day.

342
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:25,055
I'm hoping to discover a certain

343
01:31:47,603 --> 01:31:50,345
I want a Sunday night of love.

344
01:32:16,101 --> 01:32:18,142
do do do

345
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:48,823
I'm

346
01:34:12,909 --> 01:34:32,897
To my Sunday dreamin', and all my Sunday schemin' Every minute, every hour, every day I'm on my way to discover a certain

347
01:34:43,408 --> 01:34:57,533
Someone put you in my fold to keep me warm when my days are cold.

348
01:34:57,673 --> 01:35:04,815
I've asked for all my life to have you too.

349
01:35:04,855 --> 01:35:09,537
I want a Sunday kind of love.

350
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:26,848
I want a Sunday kind of love I want a Sunday kind of love

351
01:35:53,802 --> 01:35:54,449
Here it comes.

352
01:36:43,522 --> 01:36:45,323
I feel the earth move.

353
01:36:45,503 --> 01:36:48,644
I feel the sky falling down.

354
01:36:48,704 --> 01:36:54,526
I feel my heart start to tremble whenever you're around.

355
01:36:54,627 --> 01:37:00,869
Ooh, baby, when I see your face, I know it's the one I've made.

356
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:04,310
Oh, baby, I can't stand it when you don't

357
01:37:30,669 --> 01:37:33,650
tenderly call my name.

358
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,031
I know that it's my devotion.

359
01:37:36,111 --> 01:37:38,112
I see something I just can't tame.

360
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,573
I feel the good news.

361
01:37:40,933 --> 01:37:44,695
It's nothing like a gap in the sky.

362
01:37:44,755 --> 01:37:46,556
I'm coming down.

363
01:37:46,576 --> 01:37:51,978
I feel my heart start to crumble as I lay on the ground.

364
01:38:18,683 --> 01:38:18,783
do

365
01:38:50,648 --> 01:38:51,028
when you

366
01:39:17,602 --> 01:39:17,823
you

367
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:53,322
This is an instrumental, original, by our very own Steve Linscott.

368
01:40:24,073 --> 01:40:24,134
do

369
01:40:54,619 --> 01:40:54,819
do

370
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:22,179
do do

371
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,050
Yeah, woo!

372
01:42:44,878 --> 01:42:45,238
do do

373
01:43:17,148 --> 01:43:17,288
do

374
01:43:53,745 --> 01:43:54,125
do do

375
01:44:58,071 --> 01:44:58,172
do

376
01:45:45,588 --> 01:46:06,819
You're the one who made my dreams come true A few kisses ago And I've refelled the grain I want to move When my life is through And the angels ask me to recall The truth I've been told

377
01:46:19,294 --> 01:46:20,615
Oh, you.

378
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:23,033
Thank you.

379
01:48:03,173 --> 01:48:04,014
Thank you.

380
01:49:02,283 --> 01:49:26,033
I'm in a world full of people The one who may not dream of you

381
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:48,107
A few seasons ago I remember you You're the one who set us apart But you, I do not know I remember a two-distance bell That starts a bell Ringing out on the roof

382
01:49:59,443 --> 01:50:01,129
When will you see me?

383
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:30,910
Shhh.

384
01:51:17,342 --> 01:51:29,329
Yeah, you are the one For me, you'll be the moon and I'll be the sun

385
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:45,811
I couldn't be here to be your father isn't that darling where you are?

386
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:56,599
I think of you dying away day and night why is it so that this love

387
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:08,676
In the silence of my lonely days, I think of you.

388
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,123
Stay under the height of me.

389
01:52:34,203 --> 01:52:43,270
Because I'm such a hungry, yearning, burning side of me.

390
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:53,417
And a storm that won't be through till you let me spend my life making love to you.

391
01:53:24,338 --> 01:53:25,099
do do

392
01:54:35,227 --> 01:54:42,610
Night and day You are the one Only you beneath the moon

393
01:55:07,689 --> 01:55:35,095
dear to me, your father is the man, darling, where you are I think of you night and day day and night why is it so that this longing for you for long

394
01:55:37,285 --> 01:55:49,504
Wherever I go, in the glory of the Lord, in the silence of my companion.

395
01:56:15,501 --> 01:56:42,015
The wind and the storm and it's wandering through To meet the peace and be alive and make love to you Day and night Night and day Night and day Night and day

396
01:56:58,089 --> 01:57:01,293
We'll shoot for two years after you and Wayne Day.

397
01:57:01,373 --> 01:57:06,519
Next up is a less-played song from Freddie Hubbard's album, Who Beats the Scene.

398
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:12,587
You may even know most of us, but Carl transgraphed it, and we take it out of our heads, and you won't pop it.

399
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,196
do

400
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,301
do do

401
02:01:23,641 --> 02:01:33,909
The next one was actually inspired by a friend in the audience, David, I'd never heard of before.

402
02:02:36,396 --> 02:02:40,238
I want to take you away.

403
02:03:03,783 --> 02:03:14,906
I'm all to myself, alone and apart, out of a dream, safe into my heart

404
02:03:47,502 --> 02:03:47,623
do

405
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:29,304
You are so fabulous to me You are too wonderful to be what you seem Could there be eyes like yours?

406
02:04:29,344 --> 02:04:32,967
Could there be lips like yours?

407
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:37,310
Could there be smiles like yours?

408
02:04:44,817 --> 02:04:47,158
Out of the crowd.

409
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:58,784
I want to take you away, away from the crowd.

410
02:04:58,884 --> 02:05:03,167
And have you offer my son, an open heart.

411
02:05:03,187 --> 02:05:08,609
Out of the tree, safe into my heart.

412
02:05:42,166 --> 02:05:45,788
Oh no, we only have one more.

413
02:05:45,828 --> 02:05:47,008
Shoot.

414
02:05:47,148 --> 02:05:57,613
All right, once again, we'd like to thank Terry, I'd like to thank Jonathan, I'd like to thank Mr. Patterson, a big round of applause for Jonathan, and his partner, who is here all the time.

415
02:05:57,673 --> 02:05:59,893
It's just been an amazing afternoon.

416
02:06:00,074 --> 02:06:02,575
I'd like to introduce the band again.

417
02:06:02,775 --> 02:06:03,715
Steven's on the left.

418
02:06:03,895 --> 02:06:07,557
From Long Island, New York.

419
02:06:09,758 --> 02:06:10,798
Hello there, everybody.

420
02:06:20,024 --> 02:06:22,907
Thank you for having me.

421
02:06:38,923 --> 02:06:40,804
That's why I hired a dog.

422
02:06:40,844 --> 02:06:42,544
I'll give you a copy later.

423
02:07:17,217 --> 02:07:19,622
¿Quién será la que viene al sur?

424
02:07:19,862 --> 02:07:21,646
¿Quién será?

425
02:07:21,886 --> 02:07:23,629
¿Quién será?

426
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:27,517
Yo no sé si la podré encontrar

427
02:07:57,211 --> 02:08:01,457
You can hear the sounds of violins on the floor

428
02:09:11,626 --> 02:09:13,307
Thank you very much.

429
02:09:40,839 --> 02:09:40,920
so

430
02:10:11,906 --> 02:10:12,086
so

431
02:11:12,632 --> 02:11:13,993
Music.

432
02:11:42,735 --> 02:12:04,391
When marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me, make me smile Like a lazy ocean on the shore Hold me close, swear you'll be my lord Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend for me

433
02:12:14,865 --> 02:12:34,459
Other dancers may be on the floor Never mind, I will see only you I can hear the sound of violins echoing When they sway I fall asleep I can hear the sound of violins echoing

434
02:12:57,288 --> 02:13:25,696
Me thrill is only good on a swingin' roof, swingin' roof Wow, thank you so much, thank you guys, brutal.

435
02:13:31,023 --> 02:13:36,847
I'm so glad that I ended up bringing it to you much last year and that you could make this happen.

436
02:13:36,908 --> 02:13:42,892
So seriously, it's a fantastic way to just, you know, start a whole celebration.

437
02:13:42,912 --> 02:13:47,996
And also remember that, you know, there's so many different ways you can make music with other people.

438
02:13:48,056 --> 02:13:57,503
I remember, I think you were just starting to kind of comment on the jam session circuit when I ran into you over in Winchester and just to see how much you've kind of developed

439
02:14:04,987 --> 02:14:09,070
Thank you also to Morningside Music Studio for putting together two great bands.

440
02:14:13,753 --> 02:14:19,838
In addition to an area rich with talent, I really feel lucky that there are so many great community music school programs around here.

441
02:14:20,098 --> 02:14:21,339
Morningside being one of them.

442
02:14:21,379 --> 02:14:25,582
Dan Fox, who's out of town at the moment, I mean he's a busy guy but he can do it.

443
02:14:25,722 --> 02:14:32,627
But he's put together some really amazing ensembles and a lot of these students have been there for years and years and just keep getting better.

444
02:14:35,275 --> 02:14:36,416
check out the table in the back.

445
02:14:36,916 --> 02:14:49,661
Along with that, there are a couple flyers for the Winchester Community Music School, which has been really amazing, and all of their offerings, and Medford Music Studio, which is run by a woman named Laura Brereton, right here in the city of Medford.

446
02:14:49,962 --> 02:15:01,987
Again, thank you to all of our production staff, Terry Carter, Jayla, Reese, all the folks at Medford Community Media, and please remember that our donation is conveniently placed

447
02:15:04,267 --> 02:15:06,407
And there are QR codes in the back of the programs.

448
02:15:07,528 --> 02:15:08,368
Stay tuned for more.

449
02:15:08,628 --> 02:15:12,309
I'll come back tomorrow for Sita Isamah, both Bill Ward's projects.

450
02:15:12,349 --> 02:15:13,890
It's going to be fantastic.

451
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:17,891
And for the Alive project, featuring Terry Carter and I.

452
02:15:30,305 --> 02:15:30,705
So stop recording.

453
02:15:49,275 --> 02:15:49,515
I love her.

454
02:15:49,535 --> 02:15:49,856
I love Dylan.

455
02:15:49,876 --> 02:15:50,256
I love her so much.

456
02:15:50,276 --> 02:15:50,677
I love her so much.
