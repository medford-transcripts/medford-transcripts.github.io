We have a couple of different things. Please return your cell phones on silent while we're off.

00:00:54,453 --> 00:01:22,043
I just do want to thank John. I agree with what the community has done to bring the best in here. It's getting bigger and better every year. So we're really, really, really happy to be here with them.

4
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:50,191
I just wanted to say

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:24,312
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

6
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:52,021
and doing this as a program is what I'm interested in today. I'm also a secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and I'm very humbled to be here today to be able to announce the remainder of my time that I'm going to be doing on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security. I'd like to share one and a half, because I'm not going to speak today. I'm not going to speak today.

7
00:02:52,325 --> 00:03:05,470
and then to Anita for, you know, helping me think of a new jam session for him to get to know him better. So, we look forward to hearing from you, and thanks so much for your time.

8
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:35,845
What do I think about how the community has developed this year? I feel like it's just been a year that we've never heard of anything like that. I've heard that they have a helpful community plan. I know that one of the things that gets them more diversified is in the middle of our social media. There's just so many things to see on Facebook, Instagram, or on Google Docs. I don't know anything about that. So, I'm listening to you here. Big shout out to Lauren for her help.

9
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:57,901
Also to, I think it was Kenneth, I asked him to do a murder job, and I think that's what he's like. And it's been really saving me in a variety of different ways. So, thank you to Lise. Also to my partner, Taylor.

10
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:32,073
I wanted to thank you for all your help with the promotion and you mentioned that there's a couple of meetings coming up around the area today. And I'd also like to say that there are two really unique initiatives that are all around the area. I'd like you to actually have a couple of meetings. We're working on that right now. It's really just a situation. It is new. We're doing what it's all about. It's more from a self-regulation role.

11
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:54,162
I'm happy to lead the group around here. And I'd like to just give a round of applause to all of you.

12
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:45,142
and everything else I can say about the community center itself. The last thing I'll say is that we get a lot of support by generous sponsors. So all group organizations that have access to money or a discount fund, if it's a community. Rivers of West Denver Community Center is a space where arts, life, and education. I'm really excited to see more opportunities for the community. And then there's just huge projects coming our way.

13
00:05:45,378 --> 00:06:05,138
And then for our council, this year we actually don't have food in there, but the Saturdays and Sundays we have food. We can use Instagram houses. We may or may not be able to come back, but we will do our best.

00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:32,155
For her, she's a tribal man, which is a local t-shirt, meaning that this is her territory and her t-shirt is made to look great. It's made out of a local hollywood look. For her, at least, it's a t-shirt that she has, a t-shirt that says she's run by a big name that's over here in New York. She's a descendant of a woman I know over there that has a local t-shirt. It's a t-shirt that she has. So all of our P.D. trainers, which is P.D. trainers,

If you're especially tired about what we do, we do a good time for that. And of course, they're involved with I know a lot of you are, because of that law. And then lately, we've been doing a little bit of a roll with that.

17
00:07:38,305 --> 00:08:02,217
And I think it's important to know that we have a community.

18

and then to keep them off for a little bit. So, there's that alternative on the one side, and then you use, there's a lot of ways I can say it, on the one side, I love that, I'm in the area, but there's so many ways that you can get control, and then to really fire,

120

In like a studio setting where there isn't like a live audience. Yeah, if you're in like a green room. But yeah, these are, I would, for the inside, maybe we'll better look outdoors. I'll see what we got. Well, here's what I was thinking. So we have a third person's ball, right? Yeah. So I was thinking what we could do is come up with at least a system where you're quarterbacking.

121
01:10:59,618 --> 01:11:27,293
So when we're on the cameras, you know, we might just look back at you. It's just a matter of one, one, two, three, you know. And when, you know, we're going to switch or change our angles or whatever we're doing, we'll just do something like this. Nothing really obvious, but, you know, subtle enough where it's like you get it and you won't switch over to us. That way it comes across better.

122
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:55,559
Yeah, I have to check the stream audio, but according to how well it sounds, because it records in the past.

123
01:11:55,559 --> 01:12:25,360
We might have better in-camera quality. Yeah, well, tomorrow if you want. What I might do is I might switch out the other one might have more in's. I like this one, but I think for like bigger stuff, like this would be good for like one, two cam, like some mid-light mics.

124
01:12:31,115 --> 01:12:56,073
Yeah, I'll play around tomorrow morning while we're at it, because this is working alright. But I want to see how the other one does here. Well, tomorrow morning you'll be here, what, at 10? Maybe earlier. When do they open? I think 10. Well, we can check.

125
01:12:56,562 --> 01:13:26,026
And I can be here first thing in the morning, so that way I can help you move all this stuff outside and get it set up. Yeah, that'd be great. I mean, I've done it before for some stuff, but yeah, it's not ideal. Yeah, but you never know. Yeah, thank you very much for assisting here. You came in straight.

126
01:13:26,397 --> 01:13:54,494
on the solos there. Yeah, it's really nice having somebody who can get up there and shoot. You know, I was also thinking, if we could talk this over too, is that that camera over there is really a tough shot. The only thing I can think of is either putting it behind them, not blocking the door, so that way you get the trucker in a straight shot.

127
01:13:54,494 --> 01:14:18,997
That's going to change tomorrow too.

128
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:29,408

131
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:55,167
So, we love, in West Medford, and you know, probably you're from it as well, I don't mean to single us out, but in West Medford, we really love homecomings, okay? You know, we love reunions, we love backyard barbecues, we love all of that kind of stuff that gets the family together. And Anita Wood is a homegirl, as we like to say.

132
01:15:59,842 --> 01:16:25,610
If I was with my homies, I would say, she's my homegirl, like that. But anyways, so she's got this very cool collective that she's been jamming with for a little while now, trying to get that sound down that they like, jazz standards, often with a twist of passion. And the band consists of Anita A.J. Wood on vocals.

133
01:16:33,085 --> 01:16:57,419
All right, and then they got the baby of the group back here, Carolyn Sue. All right, ready? As you can tell, they brought up the cradle to get her. All right, it's Kyle Helmer on guitar. All right, he's a tall man. All right, it's Rose Giuliani on bass. All right.

134
01:17:05,148 --> 01:17:34,358
All right. We're getting ready to do something special tonight. I just want to point out a couple of things. Donation box on the table for the Jazz Festival itself. Donation jar on the back table for the West Bedford Community Center. So if you're feeling soldiers bold, hook a brother, hook a sister up, as we like to say. And we're going to get going, OK? So hopefully your phones are still on silent or vibrate.

01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:38,290
