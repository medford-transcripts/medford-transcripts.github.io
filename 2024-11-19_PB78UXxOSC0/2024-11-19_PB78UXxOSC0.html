    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=941.497s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=942.477s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=943.918s">So</a>  annually, I'm so sorry.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=948.564s">No,</a>  go ahead, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=949.806s">Do</a>  you need to share your screen, Ellen? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=951.989s">I'm</a>  happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=953.532s">If</a>  you can go ahead and make me a co-host. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=956.997s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could do that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=959.241s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=959.822s">All</a>  set. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=962.326s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=975.021s">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=976.021s">Is</a>  that all up and above everybody can see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=979.102s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=980.003s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=980.763s">So,</a>  as we know this is an annual event that the city council is to adopt the city's tax policy by allocating the tax levy or classifying it among the property types. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=993.308s">So</a>  I, you know, this is something that's done every year it Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1001.423s">has</a>  historically shifted the tax rate from a single tax rate to a shift of the 175%, which is allows the shift of the levy from the residential class to the commercial industrial and personal property class. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1015.793s">Also</a>  annually you vote on the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption, both of which have historically not been done for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1027.023s">And</a>  so, here we are, we're looking at fiscal 23, the Board of Assessors received certification of our new values that we used sales from calendar year 2021 to set the assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1044.034s">And</a>  those were approved by the Department of Revenue on November 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1050.158s">So</a>  the slide just does the brief overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1053.22s">Statistically,</a>  we meet the standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1057.472s">you</a>  know, we're blessed to have a lot of sales in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1061.014s">And</a>  so for this calendar year, we had, I think it was over 798 arm's length transactions that allowed us to build the new model and set value. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1073.701s">Our</a>  average assessments have increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1076.963s">Everybody</a>  knows what the market's done and it continued to be strong all the way through calendar year 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1081.825s">We're</a>  still seeing, you know, we saw that through most of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1087.349s">never</a>  been a good fortune teller so I don't know what the future is going to bring for those but quite, you know, we certainly are in a good position for property owners in the city of Medford, having their property hold value. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1101.927s">In</a>  addition, you can see that compared to the surrounding communities, we are also very strong in our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1108.891s">Historically,</a>  this is not the first year where our average assessments increased more than what the other communities did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1117.657s">So</a>  single family, we're at an increase of 9.79, other communities not quite, but when you look at that comparison, you also know <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1126.382s">a</a>  single family home in Cambridge is certainly much higher than a single family home in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1131.665s">So</a>  Medford, desirable place to raise your family, your home values are stable, and that's a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1139.949s">We</a>  also have and are enjoying a really nice year two of strong growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1146.072s">Coming</a>  out of COVID, we were worried and that has continued to be a good story with 2.2 million in <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1153.261s">tax</a>  levy growth, that levy growth is based on fiscal 22 tax rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1159.886s">And</a>  these slides just show, just breaks this down a little bit better for you where those numbers come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1168.352s">Personal</a>  property continues to shock me every time that it's gonna grow the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1175.617s">And</a>  we're seeing this year, stronger commercial growth <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1181.837s">than</a>  it has been historically. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1183.298s">So</a>  that's a nice trend for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1187.039s">That</a>  commercial growth, point out like number one Cabot with lab space, 87 Medford Street with its mixed use, all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1200.325s">And</a>  then again, those personal property accounts bringing in growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1205.006s">We</a>  are still a bedroom community residential 89% of the total value of the city is in residential versus those commercial industrial and personal property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1218.72s">And</a>  again, this is just another slide that shows the historical nice trend to see, you know, it's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1229.688s">We've</a>  been, we need to start creeping back up so this year, you know, commercial percentage of levy has gone up a tech from where it was last year, in comparison to residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1242.586s">If</a>  we had a single tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1247.48s">It</a>  would have been 946, I see a typo as I look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1250.601s">So</a>  it's 946 at a single rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1253.182s">Again,</a>  Medford has historically a mixed split rate with 8.65 in residential and 1656 on the commercial, industrial and personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1263.765s">Again,</a>  estimates they'll change by pennies potentially when the state is done looking at our tax recaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1272.547s">So</a>  again, if we, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1276.108s">follow</a>  historical trends, you're gonna be voting to use the minimum residential factor of the 91.426, that will give us that split tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1287.152s">And</a>  this is just another breakdown, so I'm gonna keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1295.253s">And</a>  this one I can't see as well because my screen is blocked, but this just tells you the average single tax rate and what that does in comparison to the split rate versus a single rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1307.585s">So</a>  average values increased, our average tax bills potentially for a single family home will go up about $300 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1316.453s">Again,</a>  that's on an average. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1321.194s">And</a>  we talk every year about the residential exemption at this point in time, as I've indicated before, it's too late in the year for the city council to vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1333.782s">I</a>  would suggest again, like you did last year, hopefully, we'll visit it again and see what those numbers look like with fiscal 23 calculations to give you a benchmark for fiscal 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1348.873s">And</a>  then as we talk about every year, the small commercial exemption, really it benefits the property owner, not those small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1357.081s">And</a>  historically this council has chosen not to entertain that exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1363.748s">So</a>  the summary is that the vote will split the tax rate for the small commercial business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1372.3s">again,</a>  favoring the residential property. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1375.181s">And</a>  then you vote whether or not to adopt the residential exemption and whether or not to vote on the small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1382.764s">And</a>  that's my PowerPoint in a nutshell there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1385.765s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1386.365s">So</a>  I'm gonna try to stop sharing my screen and entertain any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1392.008s">I</a>  hope I didn't go too fast.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1396.289s">Thank</a>  you, Ellen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1397.149s">Going</a>  to Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1399.9s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1401.166s">Thank</a>  you, Ellen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1403.258s">Thanks</a>  for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1404.979s">Just</a>  wanted to kind of have two quick lines of questioning here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1409.383s">But</a>  first, I just want to also remind everybody that we had a meeting over the summer where we did go really into depth on a lot of property tax exemptions, the residential exemption with Assessor Bordeaux. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1422.713s">So</a>  I'm not going to ask the questions that I asked at that meeting again, but that's a good meeting recording to refer back to for folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1431.3s">where</a>  we did dive into that in a little more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1435.002s">Just</a>  two things, Ellen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1436.743s">One,</a>  on the average growth rate of assessments versus average growth rate of the average tax bill, I noticed that average assessments are going up significantly faster than the average tax bill itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1454.272s">And</a>  I just wanted to confirm with you, that's attributable to Proposition 2.5, correct?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1460.262s">Correct,</a>  I mean, yeah, because the values, obviously everyone's values are gonna be what the market dictates, but the tax levy is constrained by prop two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1471.591s">And</a>  this council and the administration for the city of Medford have always been very conservative in taking care of not to overspend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1479.858s">So</a>  that's the reflection of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1482.1s">Your</a>  property values are going up, but your tax bill is not going up proportionately.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1488.358s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1490.119s">And</a>  yeah, along those lines, I just wanted to also to make a point of note for folks that the because of that the tax rate is going down again right we're dropping from, I just want to confirm we're dropping from 9.18 per thousand to 8.65 for residential Is that correct.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1509.663s">I</a>  thought it was 901, but you could be- 901 sounds right, my apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1515.204s">901,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1516.265s">Yes,</a>  you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1517.005s">So</a>  again, a great story to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1522.506s">It's</a>  that I sleep better at night, high property value, low tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1526.887s">So</a>  I hope everybody in Medford's gonna sleep better knowing that too.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1531.544s">Thanks,</a>  Ellen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1532.065s">And</a>  then just finally, so what we're adding here is we're adding the 2.5% minimum plus that $2.2 million in new growth, and that's what's being added to the levy.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1541.177s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1542.938s">And</a>  we're not, as your finance director, Mr. Dickinson has done a very good job of making sure that we're not right up to that levy ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1556.89s">We're</a>  not raising absolutely every penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1560.253s">It's</a>  absolutely where it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1562.354s">For</a>  rounding and everything, that's the number you end up with.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1567.098s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1568.159s">Thank</a>  you very much, Alan.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1571.498s">Thank</a>  you by Susan bears going to Councilors, garb. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1574.559s">Kelly,</a>  I believe saw Hannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1576.62s">Here</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1577.721s">Yeah,</a>  I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1578.881s">No,</a>  I think that Ellen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1582.303s">I</a>  know that Ellen has just always explained where people have asked for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1592.578s">the</a>  exemption for residential and how that impacts our community if we went that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1599.885s">I</a>  think that you always had a statement that really just summarized it and really helped people understand why it's not really a good fit right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1610.214s">So</a>  can you just elaborate on that?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1614.068s">Certainly,</a>  Councilor I for Medford you are a bedroom community and you have, you know, a large percentage of your homes over what they consider that break even point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1625.35s">So,</a>  people below the break even point might get a break, but the people above the break even point would can see it would see a significant increase in their tax bill depending on where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1635.993s">And</a>  I always go back to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1638.193s">The</a>  analogy of it, it's all it does is shift within your residential so you're you're hurting your people within your with your same class of property, it doesn't make a raise an extra dime on commercial, it goes within the residential class. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1653.344s">The</a>  other thing it does, and Medford wants to have affordable housing, and affordable housing is through those landlords that own multifamilies and own apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1665.374s">If</a>  you do a residential exemption, those apartment buildings and your multifamilies are going to see an increase in taxation that they're going to pass on to the renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1675.242s">That's</a>  truly, that's in a nutshell, you know, a quick why it doesn't really work for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1681.566s">It</a>  works great in vacation communities or in communities like our neighbors that are very much, you know, they don't mind passing it all on to the renters and that's what they do in Cambridge and in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1694.215s">It's,</a>  you know, they're <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1698.043s">want</a>  to ship that over to those groups.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1701.625s">That's</a>  exactly what I wanted to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1703.166s">I</a>  want to make sure that that's a brief understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1705.287s">So</a>  thank you again for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1707.268s">And</a>  we really thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1710.871s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1711.991s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1716.314s">And</a>  I do just want to note this is a public hearing on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1719.055s">So</a>  I'm just going to officially open the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1722.597s">Seeing</a>  no additional questions from the council at this time, are there any members of the public who would like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1728.441s">Please</a>  raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1735.907s">On</a>  this paper specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1737.088s">Anyone</a>  who would like to speak on the public hearing on the tax paper for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1744.934s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1747.977s">Seeing</a>  none, do I have, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1750.937s">a</a>  motion on the table or I can close this portion of the public hearing and then drive a motion from a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1759.444s">So</a>  actually, sorry, we have to go through, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1761.505s">We</a>  have to go through each question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1764.107s">Is</a>  that something Councilors is something we want to go on tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1767.57s">Would</a>  we like to carry it over to a future meeting Councilor Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1778.251s">President</a>  Merle and I motioned a table, so that we can we can take this up in person at a subsequent meeting.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1787.399s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins motion, I think it's wise choice.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1791.423s">Yeah,</a>  I think it'd be valuable for people to be able to come in next week, if they have any ideas.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1799.193s">Thank</a>  you, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1800.173s">And</a>  then just seeing Allen Bordeaux, I saw you had your hand up and I also just want to confirm that timing would be okay if this were to be voted on next week as far as the time we need to vote on this by.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1808.495s">So</a>  I'm concerned about the timing because it does still have to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1814.356s">I</a>  mean, certainly you're earlier in the year, but I am not available next Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1819.897s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1820.717s">And</a>  then pushing it further out, but I have my, I'm already have a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1829.04s">So</a>  I, and I just want to let you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1831.462s">So</a>  my only this, this, um, this vote tonight, really, you're really looking at the, whether or not you're going to split a tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1842.829s">And</a>  I don't know if that was, you know, so it's not like there would be doing any changes to the tax rate or anything else, unless you didn't split the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1853.199s">So</a>  timing wise if the city doesn't have the, the other thing is, and I feel like I put you in this position but I'm going to take a little bit of it is that if we don't have the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1866.478s">set</a>  and completed, then we jeopardize getting those tax bills out on time so for for any delay in this tight timeframe that we're in, it's going to push me against the wall to get those final files over to the collector for her to get that data out and get it to the billing company in time.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1887.33s">Put</a>  them in a manner present the information Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1893.71s">I'm</a>  understanding you're working in a part-time capacity here in this community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1896.551s">And</a>  that you've moved on, you've left Medford and you're working in another neighboring community at this point in time as well.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1903.793s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1905.293s">I'm</a>  a full-time employee for another city and I'm- So you haven't put us in any position.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1910.334s">I</a>  don't want you to feel like you have, because you haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1912.935s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1913.435s">It's</a>  through no doing of your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1916.076s">If</a>  it weren't for you being here this evening, we probably wouldn't even have this paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1921.137s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1921.97s">Um,</a>  so thank you for being willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1924.634s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1924.935s">Be</a>  willing to continue to carry the torch. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1927.584s">All</a>  right, we've had a revolving door personnel issues that I'm going on in city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1930.766s">You've</a>  seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1932.467s">And</a>  ultimately, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1934.048s">If</a>  you weren't good enough to come forward and to be here and to be willing to do this, you and Ted, I don't know where we'd be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1941.833s">All</a>  right, I really don't know where we'd be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1943.714s">So</a>  thank you for being willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1947.116s">I,</a>  as one member of this body, am comfortable doing what we always do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1950.959s">It</a>  hasn't hurt us in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1953.024s">I'm</a>  just more comfortable taking a tax vote in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1957.405s">I</a>  understand what we're doing here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1959.785s">We've</a>  done it, and I've done it 10 times before, and I'd be happy to do it 10 times again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1964.806s">So</a>  with that being said, even if we table it this evening and bring it back up next week, I, as one member of the council, wouldn't have any questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1972.748s">I</a>  think you did a good job with the presentation, and it's really pro forma at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1979.389s">We</a>  do this setting of the tax rate every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1982.637s">And</a>  the setting of this tax rate really supports the budget that had just been passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1986.361s">You</a>  know, so all we're doing is really funding the measures that we've, we're setting the tax rate to fund the measures that we've approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1991.827s">So,</a>  you know, I think that, you know, six one half a dozen or the other, but in terms of the job you've done here and the position that you think you put us in, you haven't put us in any position at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2000.976s">And</a>  I wish you the best in pursuing better opportunities for yourself and your family.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2005.02s">Well,</a>  thank you Councilor I truly, I went to this position for to complete, I loved working for the city of Medford, I liked working with this council, and this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2016.39s">It</a>  was personal choice for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2019.262s">But</a>  there is such a shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2021.022s">It's</a>  not just assessing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2022.623s">I</a>  mean, the role I took in my new community was without their assessor for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2027.544s">So</a>  it's universally, there's just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2030.025s">And</a>  as you know, I teach assessing courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2033.846s">I'm</a>  bringing up a new group and boy, do I plug, go to work in Medford, because it's a great place, but we haven't gotten anybody yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2040.387s">We're</a>  working. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2041.267s">I'm</a>  definitely promoting you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2045.128s">Thank</a>  you, Ellen.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2045.708s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2046.769s">Thank</a>  you for coming to the rescue once again.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2050.431s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2051.312s">And</a>  to Councilor Knight's point, I guess if Councilors have questions in the meantime, if we could just collect them before next Tuesday's meeting, I too would feel, as Councilor Knight said, a lot of this is pro forma, but I think I would feel more comfortable just having that in-person opportunity for folks to come out and speak, extenuating circumstances that we're on Zoom tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2068.207s">So</a>  I just want to, you know, have that opportunity for folks to come out and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2071.61s">So</a>  I appreciate it, Ellen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2074.511s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins to table as seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2081.594s">Vice-President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2084.375s">Could</a>  we table for one week so it appears on the regular agenda next week?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2090.318s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2912.763s">Madam</a>  President, the only reason that I brought the motion forward was because I noticed that we had an inordinate number of people on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2919.169s">And</a>  after looking at what was left on the agenda, I don't think that they were too concerned about fiber optics funding from our APA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2926.036s">So</a>  that's why I just wanted to make sure that in the interest of time, that these people have taken time away from their family to be here, that they had the opportunity to be heard.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3093.232s">No</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3094.852s">And</a>  no one will be safe, not one teacher, not one student, and certainly not our daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3101.136s">to</a>  say this has been a nightmare of epic proportions for our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3107.04s">I</a>  come here tonight to ask each and every one of you for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3115.527s">I'm</a>  a mom who can leave no stone unturned in protecting my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3124.673s">Being</a>  here tonight, I can now say <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3130.477s">Every</a>  elected official in this city has heard our story from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3135.741s">I've</a>  spoken publicly at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3138.883s">I've</a>  spoken to our mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3140.284s">I've</a>  communicated with our state representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3143.947s">I've</a>  communicated to the news, to DCF, to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3147.77s">I</a>  have had our story shared hundreds of times on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3154.535s">And</a>  I have spent countless hours trying to communicate with Mefford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3162.477s">What</a>  happened to our daughter opened my eyes to a much larger problem at Mefford High School, one of rules not being followed, and I'm seeing that starting with our administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3174.046s">Multiple</a>  times, my daughter's attackers were wandering the halls, searching her out to threaten her life in a class that she belonged to, not them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3185.787s">Not</a>  one school administrator called us when this all began. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3190.329s">Incident</a>  reports were written, and I never got a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3193.63s">I</a>  never got an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3198.091s">At</a>  one point, I had to go to the school where I came to learn the administration was unable to locate these bullies who had tried to enter yet another one of my daughter's classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3211.596s">They</a>  could not find these girls on the Medford High School campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3215.595s">And</a>  they asked me to dismiss my daughter for her safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3223.04s">I</a>  wonder all the time what would happen if she wasn't as communicative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3229.364s">What</a>  if she didn't text me during those times? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3231.186s">What</a>  would have happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3234.448s">I've</a>  learned from many sources that cutting classes and hiding in bathrooms is a regular occurrence at Medford High for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3243.216s">It's</a>  not always followed up by our administration for consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3249.12s">No</a>  doubt they are overwhelmed, but I refuse to make excuses for the adults who have a job to do to ensure all of our children's safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3261.228s">We</a>  all own a part in this, each of you, our city officials, school staff, and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3268.653s">We</a>  need to show our students that there are consequences for their actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3275.539s">There's</a>  nothing more I want than to work with the superintendent and her administration to ensure our daughter's safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3282.381s">Although</a>  we have had some communication in one meeting, unfortunately, I have had multiple emails not returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3289.803s">I</a>  requested paperwork that had a 10-day deadline, not by me, but by law, and it was not received. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3297.665s">I've</a>  been given dates by Medford High School admin of when the paperwork would be ready, and yet these dates have also passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3306.447s">I've</a>  been told one of my daughter's attackers was removed from a class when she was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3311.71s">I</a>  have been told that they were suspended indefinitely at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3317.773s">They</a>  were not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3320.394s">I</a>  was assured they never crossed paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3322.395s">They</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3322.795s">I</a>  was assured they never entered CAF II, which is exactly where they entered the day that they attacked my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3332.48s">No</a>  school administration even thought to reach out to the other family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3336.767s">knowing</a>  that their child was on the football team on Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3340.488s">And</a>  there, yet again, they tried to attack my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3347.709s">It's</a>  negligent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3350.73s">Disregarding</a>  the rules is starting at the top of our school chain, so no wonder some students are not following the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3360.052s">School</a>  administration must be the leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3364.753s">They</a>  must set a better example. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3367.585s">I</a>  hope the example that I'm setting for my daughter is a good one, to always stand up for what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3374.169s">And</a>  I also hope you will stand with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3377.11s">I'm</a>  willing to help in any way, any solution that I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3381.333s">I'm</a>  open to every suggestion on how to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3386.636s">I</a>  wanna work with our city officials, the school, our teachers, they are so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3393.117s">They</a>  are beloved, and they deserve to have every child be able to thrive in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3398.961s">What</a>  is allowed in our schools sets the standard in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3403.625s">And</a>  I appreciate you listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3406.146s">I</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3408.688s">And</a>  I would appreciate any solutions that you may have for me going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3413.351s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3428.813s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3429.673s">And</a>  thank you, Nicole, for coming forward and having the courage to stand up here and say what you said to all these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3439.337s">And</a>  like I said, you know, I have a granddaughter that goes there and same age as, I think, as your daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3446.799s">And</a>  she tells me stories of things that happened there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3450.58s">And</a>  I say, I don't know what to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3453.761s">I</a>  wish I had some advice for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3456.185s">I've</a>  reached out to you with any help I can be to you, but I say that this is not how children should have to go to school in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3465.673s">Kids</a>  shouldn't be afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3467.434s">They</a>  shouldn't be hiding in bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3469.776s">They</a>  should be there to learn, not learn how to fight, but learn learning basic things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3475.301s">And</a>  again, I say, I commend you for your courage and the battle that you're waging. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3483.327s">I</a>  hope that the school department at some point stands up and does the right thing for your daughter, instead of standing up for the people that they shouldn't be standing up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3492.515s">We</a>  shouldn't be standing up for the people that are the attackers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3498.18s">So</a>  again, I thank you for your courage in standing up here tonight.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3503.924s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviellol. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3504.905s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3508.028s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3509.509s">And</a>  again, thank you, Mr. Brownlee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3512.207s">It</a>  takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3515.108s">It's</a>  easy just to keep your mouth shut and walk away and hope things are going to be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3519.31s">But</a>  I know I've talked to you personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3523.292s">I</a>  think we all share situations about children being bullied, mine as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3528.134s">As</a>  a city councilor, we have a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3530.952s">and</a>  the mayor who's the president of that committee that are in charge of making sure that they follow through these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3539.036s">So</a>  as a city councilor, it's very difficult to cross over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3543.919s">So</a>  I'll leave that with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3546.76s">I</a>  know that you had some, without getting that information, you had some interest to talk to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3552.223s">I</a>  know we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3553.224s">Unfortunately,</a>  I informed you that we don't have a city solicitor because you were asking who you can speak to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3558.987s">So</a>  that I apologize for on our end, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3561.253s">But</a>  I'm going to speak right now as a parent of a Medford High School student, someone that has had their kids go through the system from preschool all the way through high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3572.244s">As</a>  a member of a teacher in the system and a member of the school committee that did everything in my power to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3580.692s">We</a>  put in strongholds to make sure that our kids are protected, putting in bullying protection programs, setting up mentoring programs, making sure the kids that don't want to be in the school and that are harming our children every single day, that they're the ones that are being looked at and those are the ones that are being taken to task. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3601.42s">And</a>  unfortunately, what we hear over and over again, especially with this story with the Bramley family, it seems like that's not the priority right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3612.29s">I</a>  told you in a meeting months ago when this happened, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3615.93s">We're</a>  still seeing the uh, the the children that that that can't go to the bathroom because the the bad kids or the kids that don't care are using those bathrooms and And going kids not eating in cafeterias And finding little nooks and crannies to eat throughout the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3634.128s">That's</a>  despicable That's horrifying to me and why <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3640.308s">and</a>  why the kids are telling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3641.969s">They're</a>  telling me that the administration's in the buildings afraid to punish kids because of rules that are put into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3648.735s">Well,</a>  I think we need to revisit these rules and make sure that we hold a school committee and our mayor and the school administration, the superintendent, to task, that this is their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3663.427s">And</a>  I'm not talking as a city councilor, because I'm out of line if I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3666.069s">I'm</a>  talking as a parent of a senior at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3670.153s">And</a>  when I hear ridiculous comments like, geez, maybe this child should go to a private school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3677.418s">Maybe</a>  she should just leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3679.399s">Are</a>  you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3681.481s">The</a>  Branleys did nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3683.122s">The</a>  kids that are bullied do nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3686.064s">We</a>  should take a stance against the kids that don't want to be there, that are harmful to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3692.186s">We</a>  need to take a stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3693.727s">So</a>  as a parent, I'll do everything I can to make sure that my voice is heard as well, Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3699.189s">This</a>  is horrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3702.33s">I</a>  saw the video, it's disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3706.272s">That</a>  is the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3707.152s">As</a>  a city council, I will tell you, we have no grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3709.753s">We</a>  truly have no grounds that this is, you know, unless when it comes to the budget meeting, we talked to the superintendent, because it seems like that's the only time we seem to get any information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3720.967s">Because</a>  unfortunately, we found out as a council through the newspaper, through the TVs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3729.359s">I</a>  wasn't notified, and I'm sure most of my fellow councils weren't notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3735.497s">So</a>  it's very difficult when we don't get information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3737.798s">We</a>  have to hear from newspapers and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3739.598s">That's</a>  frustrating in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3741.179s">But</a>  that's what I'm frustrated as a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3744.54s">As</a>  a parent of a child at Medford High School, I'm appalled that this is still going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3748.901s">My</a>  daughter was there and watched the situation occur right in front of her. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3752.022s">And</a>  she was horrified for this family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3754.463s">Horrified.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3756.162s">And</a>  so were all their classmates. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3757.383s">But</a>  you know what they're told to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3759.044s">Keep</a>  their mouth shut, sit on their hands, because they're afraid that they're the next people to be bullied. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3764.568s">Well,</a>  that's not the way to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3766.95s">I</a>  remember one person stood up and looked me right in the eye and said, say something, see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3772.314s">Well,</a>  we're seeing plenty, and we're doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3776.797s">So</a>  please, if there's anything that the school committee that's on tonight or the city administration that's going to hear this, please, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3786.174s">work</a>  with the school administration, work with those great teachers, because that's the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3791.819s">We</a>  went out and got us... We heard that there was a study done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3797.084s">That's</a>  great that we did a study, but we wasted money, the city's money, on bringing someone in from the outside when we could have just asked the teachers, great teachers that know exactly what's going on and what we need to fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3810.857s">No</a>  one's asked them that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3814.182s">Instead,</a>  I'm getting phone calls from teachers that they're afraid to stand up because they're wiping blood off their clothes, off their bodies, because they just broke up another fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3825.347s">So,</a>  Nicole, again, I don't want to revert and take this away from your points that you made, but I tell you, as a parent, I'm standing with you, and I'll do whatever needs to be done as a parent to make sure that your child is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3840.016s">There's</a>  absolutely no reason why your daughter has to fear and put her head down at night knowing that she has to get up in the morning to go to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3848.937s">In</a>  no way in the world should you and your family think of trying to figure out how you can break the bank to try to figure out to move your daughter to a different school system just because this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3859.267s">I</a>  condemn that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3860.74s">So</a>  I thank you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3863.303s">And</a>  if what we can do is we can ask the city administration, I will tell you, Nicole, I do not support AP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3872.634s">We</a>  don't know what we're paying for this community and paying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3875.477s">And</a>  I don't know what it would be a charge to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3878.4s">But</a>  right now, I'm at the point where <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3880.772s">No</a>  charge right now would be too small, too large. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3883.837s">We</a>  need to get assistance for this family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3885.439s">If</a>  she's not getting the information she needs by law of the timetable, then someone needs to assist her. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3891.989s">And</a>  obviously when I talk to Nicole, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3894.715s">She</a>  wanted to come here to see if anybody and I explained to her that we don't have a city solicitor No one really can answer you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3900.078s">So</a>  I know this is going to get back to the superintendent I know that there's commitments on this on this call, please Somebody get mrs. Branley the information that she needs so sure and her daughter and her family could rest every day, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3913.265s">Thank</a>  you Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3915.587s">Councilor</a>  scarpelli councillor night, um, madam president.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3919.069s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3920.53s">Um,</a>  first of all, um <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3923.987s">I've</a>  known Nicole and Rob for quite a bit of time now, and I'm very proud to call them my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3931.829s">And</a>  I'm very proud of Nicole for taking the action that she's taken and standing up and fighting for her family and not letting this get pushed under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3941.712s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3942.812s">Um,</a>  it takes a lot for someone who's been so invested in this community for so many years to get up and to do what she's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3952.535s">And</a>  I know that the last thing that she wants to be in the last thing she wants her family to be is the center of attention surrounded by such negative energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3961.217s">Um,</a>  so, you know, Nicole, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3964.497s">And</a>  through you to, to Rob and your daughter, um, for putting up the fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3970.898s">Um,</a>  because if you weren't going to talk about it, it was going to go away and you're not letting it go away and you shouldn't, um, ultimately, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3982.551s">There's</a>  been a systemic failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3984.833s">The</a>  systems failed you and it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3990.097s">And</a>  it's not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3993.08s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3993.42s">We</a>  hear the stories every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3995.582s">Um,</a>  the same mayor that chases down room is putting GPS trackers on, on city employees cars is the same mayor that's trying to control the narrative on this, but this administration should be doing is reaching out to this family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4011.565s">to</a>  see what they can do to protect the family, not reaching out to the newspapers to see how they can control a narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4018.348s">I</a>  think it's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4019.989s">I</a>  think it's absolutely shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4022.49s">When</a>  I sit back and I think to just a few years ago, when I mentioned it previously, we had a city councilor standing in the auditorium at Medford high school, screaming and yelling like a lunatic at the superintendent over a gun magazine that was found in a little theater after a private rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4042.356s">I'm</a>  still waiting for that former city councilor who's now a mayor to have this conversation with her superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4051.839s">Cause</a>  I don't think it's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4053.359s">I</a>  haven't seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4055.74s">There</a>  are safety issues in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4057.961s">There's</a>  no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4059.141s">This</a>  is not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4062.242s">What</a>  happened to Nicole's daughter wasn't just kids being kids that got into a disagreement that ended up in a fistfight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4072.377s">It</a>  was a criminal attack, an organized criminal attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4078.36s">And</a>  it's, it's, it's sickening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4079.8s">It's</a>  sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4080.981s">It's</a>  sad to see that this woman can't get answers, that she can't send her daughter to school to receive an education and have the peace of mind that her child's going to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4094.906s">Imagine</a>  sending your kid off every day, a nervous wreck. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4097.948s">It's</a>  bad enough out there in the world, not having to worry about things like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4101.469s">And</a>  imagine sending your kid off to school every single day being a nervous wreck, wondering if today's going to be the day that you get another phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4111.334s">You</a>  know, consultants, consultants, consultants, meetings, consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4119.858s">We</a>  have a pretty well-paid administrative staff over in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4125.48s">We</a>  have people that are making salaries over $200,000, but we need consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4136.262s">The</a>  focus should be on the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4138.363s">The</a>  focus should be on the victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4142.005s">Quite</a>  frankly, I think Mr. Greenspan should be involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4145.226s">I</a>  think immediately after this occurred, Mr. Greenspan should have reached out to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4149.988s">He</a>  is the attorney for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4152.769s">I</a>  don't understand why Mr. Greenspan hasn't sat down with the family yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4159.032s">The</a>  superintendent should have been over at the house, visiting the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4163.154s">They</a>  should have been at the hospital to make sure that she was okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4168.851s">Those</a>  are the things that happen in the community where our leaders are vested. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4177.674s">Imagine</a>  being a parent and after this happens, you pick up the phone and you call the superintendent's office and they tell you that she's on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4186.877s">Talk</a>  to me in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4188.398s">Are</a>  you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4188.918s">Are</a>  you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4192.339s">It's</a>  craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4193.559s">It's</a>  absolute craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4196.52s">Nicole,</a>  I stand with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4198.79s">And</a>  I stand with the other families who have gone through this very same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4204.694s">And</a>  quite frankly, I have kids in the public school system too, and it hasn't been a pretty ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4209.998s">You</a>  know, my third grader has quite a bit of trouble at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4213.621s">Seventh</a>  graders in the playground at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4215.983s">The</a>  seventh graders have no business at the playground in the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4218.385s">Why</a>  are they there? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4220.046s">You</a>  know, what steps are we taking to make sure that our schools are safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4224.329s">And</a>  why isn't the mayor acting <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4226.361s">with</a>  the same outrage that she acted with previously when a far less severe incident happened, when nobody got hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4234.803s">These</a>  are the questions that I ask myself every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4237.143s">These</a>  are leadership issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4239.224s">I'll</a>  walk through the fire with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4241.444s">I</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4242.205s">I</a>  think this is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4243.905s">And</a>  I think that there are some resources out there and there are some ideas for us to pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4248.566s">Like</a>  George said, you shouldn't be considering out-of-district placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4252.047s">You</a>  shouldn't have to be forced <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4253.766s">to</a>  spend money to send your daughter to another school because you're not feeling safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4257.929s">But</a>  maybe the city should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4259.109s">Maybe</a>  the city should send her to the charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4260.75s">Maybe</a>  the city should get her in there then. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4262.992s">Maybe</a>  the city should take some affirmative steps to be sure that your tax dollars are being well spent and that your family is being protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4269.976s">The</a>  number one role in government is to make sure that our community is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4273.398s">And</a>  we're failing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4274.519s">And</a>  we're failing our most vulnerable citizens, our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4277.741s">So</a>  for that, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4278.981s">And</a>  I look at this as a reflection of the failure of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4282.156s">not</a>  just the administration, not just the school department of government as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4285.439s">And</a>  as Nicole said at the beginning, very astutely, we all have a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4290.584s">I</a>  wanna make it right.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4294.868s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4295.989s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4477.825s">Seeing</a>  none, passing it over to you, Chief Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4480.587s">And</a>  I will unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4487.12s">Okay,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4488.901s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4489.661s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4492.422s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4515.571s">Are</a>  you watching on another? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4517.132s">Do</a>  you have another device open to Chief Friedman? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4519.293s">Or</a>  are you just on your computer? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4520.193s">I</a>  don't know why we're hearing like multiple times.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4522.875s">I</a>  just have one device.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4526.336s">Okay,</a>  it seems to have stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4527.937s">So</a>  please proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4529.298s">All</a>  right, I'll just be quiet, please proceed.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4538.252s">Uh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4538.852s">So,</a>  uh, hopefully everyone can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4540.893s">I'm</a>  the chief of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4542.194s">I'm</a>  here to speak on behalf of the two fire projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4544.915s">Uh,</a>  the first one is the fiber optic network that is going to connect, uh, all the fire stations with headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4551.037s">And,</a>  um, the second one is the, uh, installation of an upgraded CTRON max system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4557.22s">Which</a>  kind of goes hand in hand with the fiber optics that will allow us to, um, have more reliability and increase that, uh, so that we won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4568.344s">um,</a>  have any failures that we've been experiencing in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4572.086s">So</a>  both of these projects are, um, you know, at a time where, where we hired the, um, onus project manager for headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4584.392s">And</a>  we have selected an architectural firm, which allows us access to sub consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4590.215s">And</a>  in effect, it's like, um, you know, greater efficiency because we have them <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4597.732s">to</a>  assist us with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4600.533s">And</a>  it has the potential to give us that sort of economy of scale, if you will, where instead of having two separate projects and separate consultants, we have access to them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4614.717s">So</a>  this is a good time to look at these projects and fund them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4618.918s">So</a>  I'm here to entertain any questions that the council has, if they want more detail on the projects or any questions.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4629.367s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4632.749s">Any</a>  discussion or questions from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4634.61s">I</a>  do want to note, so at our ARPA meeting we had before the Thanksgiving holiday, we did have the question whether these papers were coming before us for appropriation approval, and the Chief of Staff <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4648.089s">essentially</a>  said this is kind of a courtesy or something that they just like to present on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4653.292s">So</a>  just noting for that consideration of the council that this is essentially just receiving a presentation, but not something the administration has deemed that they need our appropriation approval on.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4668.322s">Any</a>  questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4675.527s">Seeing</a>  none, thank you so much chief, much appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4678.462s">Madam</a>  President, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4679.542s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4681.123s">I</a>  just, I know I'm breaking in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4683.184s">So</a>  we really, this doesn't matter on what we, we don't have a vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4688.547s">Is</a>  that what I just heard? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4689.587s">Is</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4690.848s">That</a>  is essentially what the chief of staff told me other Councilors that were there, if they could confirm that I misinterpreted that, but basically they, this is being presented to us as more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4702.21s">deemed</a>  as a courtesy to provide us more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4704.356s">They</a>  would like us to be on board, but they don't think that they need an appropriation vote from us.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4710.832s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4711.132s">No,</a>  I think that this is important because I know when this first came out and there were departments that were left out and chief Friedman fire or one of the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4719.881s">I'm</a>  glad to see that we're moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4721.903s">This</a>  isn't something I would, I would vote against, but, uh, there are some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4726.628s">I</a>  know that, um, uh, I know there's some it issues that are coming up and we don't have an it department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4732.814s">So</a>  I don't know what, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4734.375s">what</a>  we're doing to get that into place, and then some other concerns that I have with the recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4741.26s">So</a>  if I take it again, it really doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4746.023s">But</a>  hey, thanks for the input. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4749.706s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4751.027s">Thanks,</a>  Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4752.988s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4753.989s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4756.751s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4757.711s">Just</a>  since you asked for confirmation, I just wanted to offer mine, what I heard from the chief of staff at our <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4763.65s">meeting</a>  was that I say, I believe that they said they were looking for feedback, an opportunity for feedback from the city council on these projects, but that they had, the executive office has full jurisdiction to go ahead with the appropriations and that they do not need our vote to complete them.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4779.983s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4781.784s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor Knight, did you wanna go?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4787.669s">I</a>  was just wondering if the dog and pony show was over now or if we're good to go.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4793.525s">we</a>  do have a few more items of this agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4797.166s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4798.927s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4799.907s">And</a>  I just, I believe the reason this did end up on the agenda is we received emails about these projects asking for our support for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4808.71s">I</a>  was unclear as to what that entailed and kind of responded asking whether that was asking if we were going to approve these projects for appropriation or otherwise have some sort of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4820.734s">So</a>  I think that's how they ended up on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4823.431s">Um,</a>  and I believe where we left the last meeting was. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4826.035s">Um,</a>  that the chief of staff would report back to us, but then if we say voted these down, they may move forward with the projects anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4838.545s">And</a>  one of the reasons that I have some, not necessarily concerns about the substance, but concerns about process and future process actually pertains to the next two items, the technology items for IT help desk support and premium Microsoft Office 365, the backup system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4856.488s">Both</a>  of these seem like helpful services for the city to have, but compared to the other three, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4867.533s">items</a>  in this paper, those seem to be payments for contracted services versus payments for one-time capital costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4876.077s">And</a>  I'm just wondering if there has been discussion about how this additional $450,000 in services are going to be paid for after ARPA funding expires at the end of the 24-month period mentioned in the document.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4893.16s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4893.94s">I</a>  do see Jim Silva on the call, who I believe can speak to this Jim if you could give me an address for the record and also just let us know in what capacity you're working with the city.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4903.324s">Yes,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4904.505s">I'm</a>  Jim Silva special project coordinator for the office of male lingo current. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4909.925s">I</a>  am also a small business owner, I have a technology and support business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4914.989s">Part</a>  of my journey in being part time for Mailungu Kern is one of my projects is IT. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4922.515s">I</a>  have stepped into the IT support role. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4926.198s">What</a>  both of these AAPA requests are about are the possibility to work, have a help desk support system in place, which we have established that allows support services for between 70 and 100 calls on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4945.552s">What</a>  we're hopeful to do, this project being, is having the support services in place so when a director of IT and staff comes into place, they can focus in on issues that need to be addressed that might've been put aside the last couple of years because of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4963.34s">Specifically,</a>  we have servers, we have some other equipment that are going to be sunsetted within the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4970.423s">We</a>  also have an opportunity to work at stakeholders in City Hall to mitigate some of their needs to upgrade product, to update process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4980.525s">Some</a>  of our legacy products are no longer supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4983.746s">So</a>  this gives us an opportunity of two years, two years of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4988.367s">So</a>  our director and staff can focus on upgrading and developing and keeping it in a secure environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4996.329s">The</a>  positive part about this is it also provides 24-hour monitoring during that two-year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5004.453s">This</a>  will give us a much better opportunity to look at budgeting needs, seeing what is important, what needs to be addressed, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5012.977s">and</a>  giving our stakeholders, which are folks in City Hall, DPW, the opportunity to work in developing that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5021.28s">So</a>  this is sort of a stopgap measure, something that needs to be put into place, something that we see as an opportunity to bring us a little much further forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5032.343s">Part</a>  of the Office 365 allows us to look into the governance, the opportunity to <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5038.465s">take</a>  information out as laws change, and it's a much more robust product than we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5046.431s">So</a>  again, this gives us an opportunity to grow, to have a more secure environment, and give us the resources to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5055.277s">Part</a>  of this supports services, and it provides us with engineering staff that we don't currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5061.26s">It</a>  provides us with 26 different additional people that can support people in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5067.483s">And</a>  what we've seen, as well as DPW, what we've seen is we've seen turnaround times being a couple of hours, a couple of days versus weeks oftentimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5076.868s">So</a>  meeting those obligations are important, and it will give the IT director, whoever in the future that may be, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5084.392s">the</a>  opportunity to work in improving that process and improving, again, the infrastructure at the city.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5094.498s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Silva.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5095.899s">Any</a>  questions, discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5098.181s">Madam</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5100.922s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5102.303s">Do</a>  we have Director Dickinson with us still?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5104.304s">I</a>  do not see him.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5114.89s">Okay,</a>  and Jim, I'll ask you, and it may be out of your wheelhouse, so I totally understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5121.072s">It</a>  sounds like the intent is that the IT help desk support services may be temporary, but my understanding of the Microsoft 365 product is that, you know, you're paying a monthly or an annual subscription fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5135.556s">Is</a>  the intent that that would continue after the 24-month period?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5139.615s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5140.475s">I'm</a>  currently it's it's you're basically buying a licensing services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5145.516s">So</a>  those licensing services will be built into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5148.717s">I</a>  think this is an opportunity again to have the IT director sort of look at the budget, see what the long term goals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5156.219s">You</a>  know, our infrastructure needs to be improved upon our communication in the building, for instance, needs to be upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5163.391s">All</a>  of those need to have focus and uninterrupted focus as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5168.136s">So</a>  having a help desk service will provide that focus that's needed for the folks that are internal to the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5178.57s">Thanks,</a>  yeah, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5180.291s">It's</a>  just, you know, whenever I see an ongoing expense being funded with one-time funds, it just goes back to the discussions we were having in the budget around, you know, it's essentially we're just adding to the structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5193.855s">And,</a>  you know, I don't actually have, I have no question that the services are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5198.416s">I</a>  think we've all experienced the IT deficiencies of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5204.478s">So</a>  it's just that long term concern about making sure that in 24 months this doesn't fall away.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5211.382s">So,</a>  exactly, and I'm hopeful that this will give those folks an opportunity to have a three year plan a five year plan to work in developing a budget that would allow that sort of sun setting equipment, putting things out that that no longer will work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5227.452s">improving</a>  upon process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5229.512s">I</a>  mean, the ultimate goal is to support community and support the infrastructure of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5234.814s">So</a>  we're hopeful that this is where we're going with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5241.195s">This</a>  is just a step in that direction.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5243.935s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5244.736s">I</a>  do have a motion, but I'll wait until my fellow councilors have had a chance to speak.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5249.977s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5250.377s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5254.316s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5255.217s">And</a>  thank you, Mr. Sullivan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5257.478s">I</a>  didn't realize that was your capacity to work with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5259.82s">I'm</a>  glad to see that we're using your expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5262.281s">But</a>  again, this is what I was I was asking to same thing that the same grounds as Council beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5269.626s">I</a>  know that you said that we can add this to our budget, Mr. Silva. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5274.209s">This</a>  is the problem, my friend, we don't know what the budget is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5279.047s">So</a>  I understand that we have this ARPA money right now for these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5284.652s">And</a>  when you look at what we're looking with the fire department, and as much as I don't like the traffic and parking, you're talking about something tangible that's going to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5294.32s">When</a>  we're looking at our IT department, this will support something right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5302.606s">But</a>  if we don't have enough staff, we don't have a budget that'll <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5307.371s">um,</a>  withstand, um, the concerns that I'm saying are what the mayor had mentioned last year during the budget season that, um, you know, that we're going to, we're going to be looking at some dire situations again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5319.959s">Is</a>  this right now putting money into something that as much as we need it, and I agree with you, we do need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5326.504s">But</a>  again, is it going to be putting it to something that then we can't man. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5333.043s">that</a>  don't have the funding to staff and not having someone at the other end to answer at that IT desk for that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5343.125s">I</a>  mean, and we just haven't seen anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5347.206s">I've</a>  been saying this at every meeting until we have an understanding of what our budget looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5352.228s">This</a>  is what I'm afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5354.048s">You</a>  know we weren't I was I was the same same type of situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5356.99s">We</a>  talked about the 3 1 1 you know unveiling years ago that we said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5362.674s">And</a>  I said it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5363.635s">I</a>  said how how do we have a 3 1 1 system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5366.116s">We</a>  don't have the infrastructure in place to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5369.158s">So</a>  this is what I'm afraid that this is not 3 1 1 system all over again because we're starting to put money into situations and different processes that <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5378.879s">We</a>  don't know budgetarily if we can even support that in the next budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5384.842s">So</a>  this is what I'm fearful of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5388.264s">So</a>  just thank you for listening to my concerns, but that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5395.248s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5396.309s">If</a>  I could add to that, to your question, actually, we do have communication budget that's in force and in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5403.433s">And</a>  this is a little bit more on an annual basis that we currently spend so it's sort of an upgrade to what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5409.697s">We</a>  have additional staffing needs, and we are looking at a full office preview. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5416.021s">What</a>  we're proposing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5417.562s">So</a>  the money is already there, it's, it's a little additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5421.605s">When</a>  I say a little, it's a couple of thousand dollars in a six-month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5427.687s">So</a>  it's within the budget that we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5429.667s">We</a>  just have a much more robust product that allows us to actually have the opportunity of controlling communication, controlling who has access. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5440.07s">When</a>  somebody leaves or somebody comes, we have those resources to provide them with that information.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5446.292s">No,</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5447.333s">I</a>  thank you for the, for the, uh, the knowledge that you're sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5450.015s">I</a>  just, like I said, I'm just, you know, what was left in, in June was the comment that was resonating that it's going to be so bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5459.701s">Um,</a>  is it going to be so bad that the mayor says we need to take this money out of the communication line to support fire police? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5467.967s">That's,</a>  that's what I'm fearful of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5469.148s">So,</a>  but thank you for your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5471.289s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5474.163s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5475.224s">Any</a>  further discussion on the IT papers or the IT requests we're looking at? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5483.849s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Silva. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5484.67s">And</a>  then we do have a request regarding parking and parking meters.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5489.733s">I</a>  don't know if we have anyone from the parking department here to speak on this.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5498.319s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, do you know if anyone, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5500.666s">The</a>  parking department was going to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5502.967s">I</a>  can check my.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5505.107s">I</a>  know that the parking director reached out and, and, uh, got another copy of the agenda today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5509.788s">So</a>  she would, uh, be able to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5512.369s">I</a>  don't, I think I saw her on here earlier, but I, I don't see her on here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5517.65s">I'm</a>  just, I'm just looking.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5518.59s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5520.051s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5521.131s">I</a>  would recommend the table if she's not, if there isn't a representative, not a president, her point.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5529.31s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5530.35s">I</a>  do see Chief Friedman with your hand up once more.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5535.252s">Please</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5537.593s">I</a>  just wanted to speak a little bit more about this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5543.055s">I</a>  mean, this is something that is slowly needed in the fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5549.058s">I</a>  think this discommunication is something <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5553.38s">We've</a>  been trying to get for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5554.521s">It's</a>  one of my goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5555.482s">My</a>  actual goal is for you to bring us into the technology era. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5562.166s">But</a>  I wanted to speak a little bit about the... You're coming through, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5566.749s">You're</a>  coming through a little warbled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5570.472s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5570.832s">And</a>  maybe if you want to turn your video off sometimes that helps.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5574.014s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5575.455s">Maybe</a>  if you want to turn your video off sometimes that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5577.937s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5578.137s">Let</a>  me do that for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5581.059s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5581.299s">How's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5581.72s">Any</a>  better? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5582.956s">A</a>  little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5583.516s">A</a>  little bit better.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5586.439s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5586.779s">So</a>  what, you know, what happens right now, if we have a computer that, um, for example, fails and we have a bunch of data in that computer, that computer is lost that data and this system, it's a backup system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5603.352s">So</a>  like, even if that computer, uh, the hardware failed for whatever reason, this backup system will be able to recover it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5611.502s">And</a>  I can tell you being on the fire department for 28 years, that has happened to me before where I worked in other positions and a computer will fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5620.444s">We</a>  will get a power surge or something causes a failure and you have to recreate all that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5626.445s">And</a>  sometimes it's very difficult, time-consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5630.106s">And</a>  so this stuff all ties in with the network. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5633.847s">When</a>  we put the network in, we'll be able to back everything up and it'll prevent that type of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5640.472s">from</a>  happening in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5642.253s">So</a>  I just wanted to get that out there that this is not something that like an extra thing we're putting in, this is something that's sorely needed to increase our reliability and prevent us from having these failures.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5656.422s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5656.902s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5658.423s">Going</a>  to Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5662.906s">Hope</a>  you just made yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5665.504s">My</a>  question is on the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5667.545s">Is</a>  this the second time we funded the parking departments? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5672.088s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5676.031s">I</a>  believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5676.672s">Jim,</a>  can you speak to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5677.632s">I</a>  see you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5679.914s">First</a>  of all, they can't be unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5682.996s">So</a>  she can answer your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5685.358s">Oh,</a>  here we go.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5686.419s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5691.082s">I</a>  just lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5693.744s">Oh,</a>  there's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5695.124s">Apologies,</a>  Faye. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5697.146s">Parking</a>  Director Morrison, we'll go to you if you want to briefly speak to this paper and then Councilor Caraviello, we can go back to your question.</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5707.975s">Good</a>  evening, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5710.398s">This</a>  is, well, I don't know if I would call it the second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5714.001s">I</a>  came, I submitted in June, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5719.42s">replacing</a>  all of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5722.381s">The</a>  decision was made by the ARPA committee to just do Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5728.144s">So</a>  now they want to do the other squares as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5733.126s">And</a>  that's why we're before you tonight to get that additional funding to do the additional locations.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5743.471s">Thank</a>  you, Director Morrison. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5745.632s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5749.276s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5749.857s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5751.278s">No,</a>  my question is so this is so we're up over half a million dollars in funding for from opera. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5757.705s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5761.629s">That</a>  would be correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5764.272s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5765.991s">I'm</a>  sorry to interrupt you, Councilor Caraviello, but understand that I feel like I'm coming behind Jim who had better lines on this than myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5777.462s">You're</a>  up against equipment that is almost a decade old, that is failing and getting complaints every day, that had no upkeep and we need to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5790.453s">you</a>  have to do something in order to provide service to the community or else we're just frustrating them and <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5800.298s">causing</a>  them to have issues when they're trying to park in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5805.119s">This</a>  is not asking because we know the money's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5811.381s">The</a>  need is there, and that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5813.901s">Again,</a>  wanting to finish the rest of the village centers, the squares, so that every business out there that can have the same benefit that I'm hearing that Medford Square businesses are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5827.044s">by</a>  having accurate enforcement with those meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5830.265s">So</a>  that's why we're back today trying to get the job finished.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5835.427s">Do</a>  we call this a benefit to the business community?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5839.208s">I</a>  absolutely have seen the benefit of it from the response that I've received, especially on the censored meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5846.891s">You</a>  have a lot of timed parking in your squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5854.073s">and</a>  to have a meter that's able to properly censor that and keep those free and open to the businesses and being used properly, that's the feedback that I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5865.736s">And</a>  I knew that once those businesses were happy with it, I knew that the other centers would want the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5875.739s">And</a>  so we're just trying to make sure that we are serving all of the businesses <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5880.88s">fairly</a>  and equally and not just favoring one over any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5886.466s">And</a>  so that's our only intent to try to bring this upgraded system that I absolutely feel has been a benefit because that's the feedback that I'm getting from the chamber and from the businesses in Medford Square.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5900.4s">Okay,</a>  my other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5901.662s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5903.553s">we're</a>  going to be doing West Medford Square, correct?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5907.195s">We</a>  would be doing any additional square that's left that has kiosks in it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5912.559s">We</a>  would be putting in the poles just as we did in Medford Square, and then installing the meter heads and then removing the old meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5922.144s">The</a>  exact same process would happen with every additional square that is identified by the city as a business square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5933.431s">to</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5935.531s">Okay,</a>  so my question is how far outside of these squares are we going to be going? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5938.692s">Are</a>  we going to do like we did all the way down to the church and we still have to do this on Boynton Road?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5944.233s">The</a>  mayor has the map.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5947.674s">I</a>  have the floor right now.</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5948.934s">Director</a>  Morrison, I apologize if you could just let Councilmember- I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing, but okay, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5954.075s">I</a>  just thought I heard a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5955.395s">My</a>  apologies.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5956.035s">How</a>  far out of the business districts are we going to go with these meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5959.316s">Are</a>  we going to do like we did to the square? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5961.215s">and</a>  go down to the church and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5963.376s">We</a>  still have meters on Boynton Road, which Boynton Road is not in the business district of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5970.217s">Boynton</a>  Road is actually those are sensors, not meters, not paid meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5975.079s">And</a>  there's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5975.939s">If</a>  you could let Morrison finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5981.708s">Those</a>  are what we called sensor head meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5985.01s">They</a>  are not paid meters, and there has always been an hour limit of parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5990.674s">All</a>  those sensors are doing is monitoring the same hour parking there that our parking control specialists have been doing all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5998.7s">It</a>  just makes their job easier that they have a device there that actually meters when someone pulls in and parks in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6008.306s">And</a>  then we have accurate information so that we're not ticketing too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6012.41s">So,</a>  can I finish please? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6019.516s">So</a>  that we can make sure that we keep those spaces open as they were intended by the ordinance that we have in place, which is one hour parking on those spaces on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6030.667s">So</a>  my question- And to answer your other question about how far we're going to go, maps have been submitted to the executive office, and that will be a decision that they will make moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6042.712s">So</a>  my question is, when did Boynton Road become a business district to get parking meters?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6047.394s">So</a>  you're saying that- As I said, they're not parking meters, they are sensors.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6054.736s">So</a>  you're not giving any tickets- On that end, can I finish?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6060.422s">On</a>  that end of Boynton Road, we have an hour limit on parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6064.705s">So</a>  we are not exceeding our mandate there in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6069.047s">We</a>  are just enforcing the ordinance that's on the books, which is an hour of parking in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6075.891s">As</a>  I've said already twice, those are not parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6079.153s">They</a>  may look like meters, but they are actually just timed sensors.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6084.436s">So</a>  you're saying to me that if I park at that meter for two hours, I will not get a ticket?</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6090.677s">No,</a>  you will get a ticket because the only time you're the only time you're allowed to park in that area is one hour I believe, sir.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6101.459s">When</a>  did boy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6102.379s">Yes,</a>  President district.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6105.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6105.94s">Director</a>  Morrison I guess I think the question I'm trying to understand is you're saying that these are meeting these meters you do not have to pay for they're simply tracking how long someone's parked in a spot.</p>

    <p>[Faye Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6116.001s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6116.342s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6117.462s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6123.127s">I'm</a>  going to, does that address your questions, Councilor Caraviello?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6127.088s">No,</a>  but it doesn't make any difference anyways.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6128.708s">Thank</a>  you, going to Councilor Collins, and then we'll go back to Mr. Silva.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6134.549s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6136.37s">And</a>  thank you to Chief Friedman, Director Morrison, and I wanna say project manager, Jim Silva. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6143.151s">I</a>  apologize if I got your title wrong, but it's great to see you working in the city hall in any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6149.693s">I</a>  definitely, as one councilor, I definitely appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6153.063s">the</a>  clarity and the context around these funding requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6161.508s">Now</a>  that we've heard a little bit about each of them, you know, I would be happy to make a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6167.881s">them</a>  all or frankly to just receive and place on file, the Chief of Staff made it clear that our votes of approval on these appropriations were not necessary for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6181.305s">So</a>  I'm not sure if there is a procedural difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6186.086s">But,</a>  you know, I think that this is, you know, in a best case scenario, this could be a forum for meaningful feedback on the work of these departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6198.929s">I</a>  don't know that we've really seen that play out in our ARPA allocation process so far, which, you know, I think is a part of the allocation process where there's a bit of potential that I hope we can see used a little bit better as we continue to go on and continue to spend down our disbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6216.673s">I</a>  would like for the community to have meaningful input. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6218.974s">I</a>  would like for this council to have meaningful input. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6220.974s">That's</a>  not to say that there's anything I'd really like to critique about the projects before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6229.757s">These</a>  are projects that are being advocated for by the city department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6234.438s">It's</a>  not up to us how ARPA is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6237.979s">And</a>  so for the purposes of this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6241.4s">That's</a>  good enough for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6242.242s">I</a>  think that there's a forum for getting more information about each of these projects in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6247.775s">But</a>  frankly, I'm not sure that this is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6250.45s">I</a>  think that the administration wants to let it be known, you know, some of these big buckets that some of our ARPA money is going to be, is considered being committed towards at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6263.22s">You</a>  know, message heard loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6264.701s">I</a>  think that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6265.361s">That's</a>  a good start of getting, you know, a bit more on the ball in terms of where those big tracts of our ARPA spending is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6272.587s">I</a>  hope that we can continue to have that level of back and forth and that we can continue to have meaningful input going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6279.071s">But</a>  as for now, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6280.29s">Um,</a>  you know, I think that continuing to have that broad stroke kind of conversation is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6285.491s">And</a>  then if there's nitty gritty on implementation, you know, I'd like to have that in a more dedicated setting, um, so that Councilors as well as department heads can be fully equipped to have those kinds, um, of conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6300.716s">So</a>  with that, I would, I would motion for approval on, on these five. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6305.607s">appropriations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6307.228s">And</a>  I also I apologize if my words are a little garbled tonight, I am on day four COVID right now so not speaking that well but thank you for letting me know.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6316.533s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Collins so just to follow up to your motion that the communications from the mayor just state that they're, they're requesting and recommending to allow time for presentation.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6326.812s">Great,</a>  then I would I would motion to receive in place on file, if that is the case, but I'm open to open to amendment if other Councilors feel differently.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6335.515s">I'm</a>  going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6337.436s">Okay,</a>  we got a second by Councilor Tseng I'm going to go to Mr. Silver's had his hand up for a while then I'll go to vice president bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6343.378s">Going</a>  back to you Jim unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6347.973s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6348.593s">I</a>  just want to state that this is an opportunity, again, to change the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6354.695s">The</a>  infrastructure in our community, in our city, has not been kept up to a standard that's necessary to run a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6363.257s">So</a>  this was a funding opportunity to actually make some changes, some permanent changes, some long-term changes that will support <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6373.22s">the</a>  folks in City Hall as well as most of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6378.544s">So</a>  again, I just want to mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6380.825s">And</a>  a lot of our calls that are helpdesk calls that are currently being supported are infrastructure issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6387.01s">So</a>  a lot of the support process will sort of diminish as we're able to improve upon that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6395.796s">Thank</a>  you, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6397.077s">Going</a>  to Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6399.078s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6401.068s">One</a>  question, Jim, for the helpdesk services, you were saying it's for about 70 to 100 helpdesk requests per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6413.377s">Was</a>  there any consideration of just creating a helpdesk support staff person in-house who could handle that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6421.163s">It</a>  sounds like a reasonable workload for a single staff member.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6430.422s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6432.664s">So</a>  the answer to your question is, with the funding that we have for employment, it's 70 to 100 calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6443.356s">It's</a>  a matter of answering a call, but it's also a matter of <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6447.671s">Finding</a>  out what the problem is and actually mitigating that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6451.812s">That</a>  is a full time job for it could be one hour worth of work to maybe research, development, all of that process to change something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6463.236s">The</a>  answer to your question is, by having a help desk support as we're outsourcing to a certain degree, they're doing the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6470.887s">We</a>  have 26 people on staff versus one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6474.732s">So</a>  this is sort of an engineering staff as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6477.816s">So</a>  if there's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6479.638s">is</a>  really imperative that needs to be worked on to develop or to infrastructure changes that's outside of your, you know, your skill set, we have that resource in this capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6496.274s">So</a>  it's really important to consider that as an opportunity to having 26 people for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6503.14s">which</a>  is a game changer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6504.421s">And</a>  I think people at City Hall and DPW have seen those changes and have seen and have participated in this opportunity to actually, you know, submit a request and within a matter of hours be able to have that looked at, resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6519.929s">And</a>  again, we meet on a weekly basis, so we have an opportunity to see where our problems exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6526.473s">I</a>  don't think you have that luxury with one or two people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6529.454s">It's</a>  impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6531.635s">So</a>  this is a good opportunity, I think, and a good opportunity to improve upon infrastructure, which will not be such a focus potentially in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6542.08s">And</a>  we won't need 26 people anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6544.861s">It</a>  could be much more manageable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6547.422s">I</a>  hope that answers your question.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6549.403s">No,</a>  that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6550.924s">I</a>  definitely hear where you're coming from on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6554.83s">I</a>  would just also, Madam President, propose a B paper that we formally request that the city administration provide a response to whether, as to whether or not the city council will be approving our appropriations above, in excess of $250,000 for appropriation.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6587.356s">Thank</a>  you, vice president bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6589.258s">Going</a>  I think to.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6593.183s">Yes,</a>  I just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6595.726s">I</a>  appreciate Jim, you know, giving us the information that we needed with that but I just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6601.642s">directors</a>  to chief Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6603.302s">I,</a>  I, it's not that I don't think that this is an important endeavor that Jim has presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6609.784s">I</a>  understand that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6611.044s">What</a>  I'm concerned in is not understanding our budget and how the longevity of the sustainability for whatever we're using our ARPA funding for can be sustained. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6623.347s">I</a>  would hate to be <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6626.047s">uh</a>  during sitting in budget season you sitting across from us and saying we're talking about closing you know a fire station god forbid or or losing firemen and women because we don't have in our budget we don't know what the ramifications are in our budget so <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6641.942s">It's</a>  not that I don't think that this isn't a great idea, because I think this is an amazing idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6647.145s">I</a>  think this is exactly where you should be in a community that can handle the sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6654.27s">We</a>  don't know where we are financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6657.151s">So</a>  I just want the chief to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6659.072s">I</a>  know that he jumped in and wanted to defend this amazing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6664.035s">I</a>  agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6665.196s">But</a>  again, without us seeing the budget numbers, without seeing our finances right now, without understanding where we're going, anything that's not sustainable, that has to be sustained, excuse me, through our general budget, I think it lends to fear in my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6681.022s">Because</a>  if, you know, God, if this was the case, why aren't we funding, you know, the teachers' raises with it then? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6687.584s">Why</a>  are we securing, you know, these are the concerns that we have, that everybody has, that we don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6694.086s">the</a>  funding to sustain this after the ARPA is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6697.729s">So</a>  that it's just the same question, just in a different area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6701.071s">So</a>  I just want people to understand that this, I agree with Mr. Silver. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6704.494s">I</a>  think it's something that it sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6707.596s">And</a>  most functioning communities have unbelievable ID departments like he's talking about that have a high have helped us that all we have to do is send it, send a request to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6717.564s">So</a>  it's, it's beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6719.666s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6720.186s">But</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6721.595s">My</a>  fear, again, I'm going to say this all the way until the budget season, because we still have yet to see anything dealing with our finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6730.517s">And</a>  in my own home, my father taught me, you can't spend what you don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6737.038s">That's</a>  why we have a checkbook, that we follow the guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6739.499s">In</a>  today's world, we have online banking, so we can follow that every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6745.22s">I'm</a>  not going to cut a check for $2,000 if I only have $1,500 in the account, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6750.461s">This</a>  is what we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6751.802s">These</a>  are the basic understandings of finances that we don't have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6755.626s">We</a>  can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6756.727s">So</a>  again, I know I'm winded, but I just wanted Chief Friedman to understand that that's where I was coming with that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6763.913s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6767.036s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6768.076s">Going</a>  back to Councilor Collins, then Vice-President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6773.821s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6774.462s">I'll</a>  defer to Councilor Bears because he spoke less recently than me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6780.409s">Vice</a>  President Bears?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6783.09s">Or</a>  Vice President Bears has stepped away and left. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6784.91s">Oh,</a>  there you go.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6785.991s">No,</a>  no, we just have the motion to receive and place on file in the B paper, correct?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6792.332s">Yes,</a>  you had your hand up still.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6794.453s">Sorry,</a>  that's accidental.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6796.494s">Okay,</a>  so we'll get back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6798.014s">I</a>  see if you... All right, thank you people for lowering your hands.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6801.735s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Chief Friedman and then back to you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6813.057s">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6815.158s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6816.358s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6816.698s">So</a>  I just wanted to just add this one little tidbit in here that, you know, these, this network that we're talking about installing has a potential to allow cost savings within my budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6829.84s">If</a>  I can shrug off some of the current, like currently what we do is we, we pay to go over the internet and go over different phone lines and <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6840.605s">If</a>  we put this network in, and I'm not going to say all of it, cause I like to maintain, the fire department likes to maintain some redundancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6847.586s">So</a>  in the event, something does go down, we won't be able to get rid of all of it, but I think it has a potential to save some money in the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6856.568s">If</a>  we get this installed, I can get rid of some of those bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6861.309s">So</a>  over the longterm, it's going to save money, even though it's a lot of money upfront, the bills that I pay within my operating budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6869.89s">to</a>  currently communicate the way we are now is very expensive.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6878.307s">Chief,</a>  that's exactly what I'm saying, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6880.709s">You're</a>  saying that you can see savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6883.83s">We</a>  can't, because we don't have a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6886.832s">We</a>  don't have finance paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6890.535s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6891.535s">I'm</a>  not saying you can see that in your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6894.337s">As</a>  a city councilor, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6895.918s">We</a>  don't have any information budget-wise, financial-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6899.56s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6900.601s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6902.142s">OK,</a>  I understand that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6904.48s">I</a>  just wanted to make you aware that of that potential cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6909.513s">The</a>  other thing is the reliability go way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6912.32s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6914.097s">It's</a>  something that absolutely, you know, should have been done a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6917.76s">And,</a>  um, just look at the cost of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6920.382s">I</a>  can see why. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6921.102s">Uh,</a>  and this opera fund is exactly, uh, you know, this particular project fits this opera fund model exactly for what it's being requested for is to get us to hook up our communication, get that last mile of, um, network installed so that we can actually communicate properly and reliably. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6942.544s">But</a>  I don't, I don't speak to your stuff on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6945.185s">Like</a>  I said, I know some of those, um, I understand your concerns there, but I just want to let you know that as far as what I'm looking at on my end, it's something that's sorely needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6956.708s">It's</a>  something that can greatly increase the reliability and it has a potential for cost savings for the city.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6963.951s">if</a>  I can shut off some of these other bills, which again, I've, I've supported everything that when it comes to fight upon, especially communication, because we realize how, how we're in the dinosaur age and I completely understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6977.596s">And</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6978.736s">I</a>  support this a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6980.517s">All</a>  I'm saying is my fear is without knowing the finances, guys, that's, that's all really I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6986.179s">I</a>  don't, I don't disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6987.519s">I</a>  think it's, it's something I find women need for their safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6991.38s">I</a>  agree with you a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6993.749s">Understood.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6996.191s">Thank</a>  you, Chief and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6997.551s">Going</a>  to Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6999.573s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7000.693s">Yeah,</a>  to echo Councilor Scarpelli's words of support and other Councilors' words of support, just to emphasize, since I didn't earlier, even if we were voting for approval, even if approval were up to us, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7015.366s">I</a>  would have no hesitation voting for approval for any of these, for any of these suggested expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7023.93s">They</a>  heard loud and clear the benefits to our city, our community, to our various departments, the projects that these expenditures will fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7033.354s">I</a>  don't wanna detract from that note of support just because this conversation also brings in sort of the broader threads of, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7043.158s">ARPA's</a>  funding in general and how that relates to the overall budget and how that relates to the structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7049.481s">I</a>  think the point that I'm trying to make through what I've said is that I think with conversations like this with individual department heads, about individual departments, about individual <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7061.444s">Expenditures,</a>  often they become about the operating budget, they become about the structural deficit, they become about the communication that we receive about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7072.631s">With</a>  city staffers who frankly, I don't think it's fair for us to expect to answer to those questions because we're not getting that communication elsewhere in predictable and routine ways from our central administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7086.56s">You</a>  know, I'm always glad for the chance to talk about those things with our department heads and our project leaders, but at the same time, that's not the forum that I want for these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7098.167s">So,</a>  you know, I think we can say at the same time, we're concerned about one-time funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7105.692s">being</a>  used to fund projects that will then, in a couple years, need another funding source, because maybe somebody knows, but I don't happen to know where that funding will come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7114.327s">We</a>  can say that, and at the same time, we can say, you know, I personally, as one Councilor, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7119.851s">I'm</a>  glad that these projects will be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7122.573s">They</a>  will be funded because it's up to this administration and the administration, by virtue of the fact that these department heads are here today, they're planning on funding them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7130.422s">So</a>  I just wanted to make that very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7131.923s">I</a>  think there's kind of two levels to this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7134.586s">They're</a>  parallel, but these broader concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7139.035s">in</a>  my understanding, don't take away from the fact that these projects are going to get funded unless, you know, the executive office changes its mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7148.242s">And</a>  personally, I'm happy about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7151.204s">So</a>  just to clarify that, and with that, I would move the question.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7155.366s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7158.537s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins to receive in place on file, we also have a B paper that we can take first from vice president bears to request a response from the administration as to whether the council will, it will be requesting approval from the council on appropriation over $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7174.872s">Do</a>  you have language you want to read back Mr. Clerk on that?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7180.377s">That's</a>  how I had it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7181.318s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7182.766s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7183.686s">So</a>  on the B paper from vice president bears, second by a Councilor Tseng Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>
